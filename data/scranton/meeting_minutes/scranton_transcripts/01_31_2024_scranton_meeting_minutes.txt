CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REGARDING TWO (2) BUDGET TRANSFERS FOR THE SCRANTON FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THE PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT . MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : I have two quick ones. So I'm happy to announce that last Friday I attended the VFW Post 25 Backs the Blue fundraiser for Detective Gilmartin . There was a fantastic turnout for this event. God bless him. Secondly , I would also like to announce that last night I attended and spoke 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 on behalf of myself and the residents of Scranton at the public hearing with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and American Water strongly opposing the proposed rate increase . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? All right. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Our first one Anita Steenson ? MS. STEENSON : Yes, thank you very much. I appreciate City Council and the public allowing me to go out of order. So if I could introduce myself, my name is Anita Steenson and I'm a Public Affairs Specialist with the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Disaster Recovery and Resilience . And I'm here as a result of your Governor 's request of our administrator for a disaster declaration . And what that means is and most people don't realize is during disaster declaration s, the Small Business Administration provide s resources to homeowners and renters , not just businesses and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 nonprofits . So we're very honored and humbled to be here in your community to provide recovery assistance to the public as a result of the terrible flooding that occurred here last September . And we offer our sincerest condolences to the community for the loss of life as well as the terrible , terrible damage that occurred in your community . So I just wanted to introduce myself and give a very brief introduction as to what we have to offer. And I wanted to let the officials know that through the county emergency manager here in Lackawanna County, we've scheduled on Friday the 2nd at 10 a.m., at the public safety building a more detailed informational PowerPoint that explains how disasters get declared , you know, perhaps the situation , you know, with FEMA versus SBA, some of the new rural community resources that became available as of July 31st, which I understand is very important to this community and the nearby communities that can be -- you could avail yourself of in the future and you know how our program works.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And the ask that I'm making of you here tonight and in the future is, if you will help us share our message to get it out to the community and the public because as I said, most people don't realize that the Small Business Administration provides resources to homeowners and renters having absolutely nothing to do with business . So if you would like I could just tell you a quick what we have? Okay. So what we have for homeowners is we have a low interest loans and that is 2.5 percent interest loans up to a half a million dollars . And on top of that, we have an additional $100,000 that homeowners and renters can access to replace personal property and that could include a car or, you know, your furnishings that got destroyed in a flooding . And all of our loans including the business loans that I'm going to talk about have absolutely no payment and no interest due the first year. And the interest does not accrue the first year so there's no gotcha at the end of the first year. And it's our hope that during that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 first year you will have time to continue to pursue and what else might be available to you by way of grants or other situations . So you could use the SBA money to pay down -- at this point a lot of people have spent money to fix their situation . They might have put it on high interest credit cards. So they could maybe pay themselves back or, you know, continue to pursue grants or if they are involved with an insurance company and they didn't, you know, get that or still pursuing that. They have funds to get things fixed. So all of our loans are no payment s and no interest for the first year. Businesses and non-profits can access up to 2 million dollars . And the interest rate for businesses is 4 percent and non-profits it's 2.375. So non-profits find it very useful to have the one year interest free because they could replenish themselves as they go about trying to get, you know, find out what they're pledging is going to be. So that's it in a nutshell . We are direct lenders . So it's a streamlined easy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 process . We have a recovery center currently set up here in Lackawanna -- I apologize -- county at the County Center For Public Safety at 30 Valley View Drive. And people can also make applications online. And I provided some information which gives a really easy link. These are disaster loans. You guys are survivors . There's no minimum credit score. The documentation is very streamline d. We want to make you this loan. So that's pretty much -- MR. SMURL: Thank you. Any Council members have any questions ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I actually have a question . So, Miss Steenson , these -- there was an article in the newspaper in the last few days. Is this the loan program that was mentioned in that article ? MS. STEENSON : Yes, sir. I've been trying to get that word out so, yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Is this citywide because it's a disaster or is it just affected homes? MS. STEENSON : The loan is to repair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 disaster damage. However , businesses also have access to what's called our economic injury. And those loans don't require any actual damage. That provides working capital to businesses almost like, you know, if you will, the Covid loans. And those economic injury loans also extend outside of Lackawanna County to -- you're going to have to help me with the actual pronunciation of all the counties . We have Wayne, Wyoming , Monroe, Luzerne and Susquehanna . Okay, those counties can access our economic injury loans because we know that business doesn't stop at the borders . MR. SCHUSTER : And you said there's two types of loans. There's one for personal property and there's another one for damages. Are they the same interest rate for each of those loans? MS. STEENSON : So homeowner s and renters have a 2.5 percent interest rate. Business have physical damages and economic injury. And if you are a business whether it's a physical damage -- just in Lackawanna County 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 gets physical damages . All of the counties outside of Lackawanna County only get economic injury. So the interest rate for businesses and non-profits are the same, 4 percent for businesses whether it's economic injury or physical damages inside of Lackawanna County and 2.375 for non-profits . And then outside of Lackawanna County it's just economic injury 4 percent for business and 2.375 for non-profits . MR. SCHUSTER : Fixed interested or is the rate -- MS. STEENSON : Fixed interest for up to 30 years. And again, no payment s and no cost. There's absolutely no cost to apply. And there is no obligation to take the loan, which is why we encourage everybody to apply and just see what your options are. If you like the loan, if you don't like the loan, see what you are eligible for. MR. SMURL: All right. Anyone else? Thank you and there is information that it was brought -- Alison, is this on the outside where people signed in, the information pamphlets ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Just so they're accessible if anybody wants them. MS. STEENSON : Yeah, hopefully we can put it on, like, a multimedia chat or I can provide a link where people can go and -- again, people can come down to the recovery center just to ask questions . If they just want information , there is absolutely no obligation at all. We just want people to know what is available to them because it probably doesn't bring organics , small business , homeowners , and renters so, yeah. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. STEENSON : And if you have any questions , you have all of my information . I'm happy to answer. And I hope somebody can come to the information al meeting on Friday. I'll make sure I send the information to the Clerk's Office and a representative can maybe come and learn some more details. MR. SMURL: Thank you very much. MS. STEENSON : Thank you all very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen , for letting me -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : You got to love these foreigners. Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I was impressed by her presentation . But I must also say that I was disappointed to read in the paper that FEMA denied the county's application for aid. So in Fifth Order if you would please any update you could give us on tax relief for homeowners . And I was also very impressed last night. I was also at the public hearing for Pennsylvania American Water's rate increase even though I'm not a ratepayer. But I was very happy to see that four of the five of you were at the night session and that you clearly voiced your opposition to the rate increase . I'll be watching to see what happens with that. I was also very happy that -- he stepped away, but Frank helped Scott Thomas, the CEO of Scranton Public Library get invited to a meeting that the Mayor had this morning about the gang problem . And what they -- she had many people there, about 30 people talking about approaches 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 to that problem . People tend to forget that, you know, the school district is obviously a key player in the gang issue and preventing it from arising or identifying it if it's happening . But what happens when the school district closes the schools during the summer? The library is one of the few assets that remains open 24/7 -- not 24 hours a day but it's open every day 12 months a year. So Scott's got some very good ideas about things that they could do because there are program s that the library has from infancy to seniors in high school. And so I'm glad that Frank was able to help him get invited to that Council meeting and he's now part of that group. I also on Monday night attended a -- one of the first meeting s of the Scranton 's Environmental Advisory Council . And Mr. Schuster was also there. And I was impressed by the caliber of people who are sitting on that authority , people like Bernie McGurl who has retired from, I guess, the LRCA and is looking for something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to do with his time. And they were very -- right now they are just standing up this Council . So they are in the process of writing their bylaws and that kind of thing and getting their web page set up. But they were talking about things that they wanted to pursue, things like the walkability study, climate change, recycling , stormwater management and all the environmental impacts that all of these issues have on the city. So they're going to meet quarterly . Their next meeting is April 29th. It's a Monday at 4 p.m., in the Governor 's room. And anybody who is interested in some of these issues and has ideas and questions and recommendation s might want to come and start sitting in on some of these meetings if they have the time and the energy because , you know, you get the government you deserve . And if you have an opinion , you should express it. If you have questions , you should ask it. And like I said, I was rather impressed by the caliber of people who were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 appointed to this board. These people tend to be very serious and very well educated and very ambitious . So I just want to put that out. And finally , you probably saw in the paper that the Library Express Bookstore in Market Place at Steamtown will be closing at the end of April. So starting tomorrow everything , everything for sale in that book store and they have more than books. They have greeting cards. They have T-shirts. They have all of this Dunder Mifflin paraphernalia , everything in the book store is going to be 20 percent off until they liquidate their entire inventory . So that's a good opportunity for people, you know, who may want to pick up something special for a gift or for themselves . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. John Pocius. MR. POCIUS: Good evening , Council , John Pocius, Minooka , Scranton . First, I'd just like to take on a personal note you did honor some of the deceased people. I saw this in the paper this morning . I don't know if you knew Patrolman Don Duffy. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 He was a good guy. He probably worked back with my dad at least when my dad was Chief of Police back in the 60s. And he should be remembered . He was a good man, a quiet cop and a very good cop. So that is just a little personal note right there. I'm here tonight -- I never thought I would come back. I guess I'm here as a former city engineer and a former City Council man because things like this drive me crazy. And for some reason I was never dropped as an e-mail on the Green Light Go program . So I've been receiving reports for the past couple years on these project s that we had underway . The two project s that we have are the replacement of the traffic signal at Green Ridge and Wyoming Avenue. And the second project was the Cedar Avenue signal improvement project , which included new signals on Elm Street and Maple Street. Those signals were out last week for a couple weeks. They were running on a -- stop signs. It's one of the oldest systems in the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 But I got these e-mails and I'm very concern ed. It says that these reports are sent out by PennDOT on the Green Light Go. Green Light Go is a program set up by PennDOT to help cities -- every traffic signal has to be approve d by the municipality and then they inherit the signal once it's constructed . So PennDOT set up this program to allow for money for new signals , to replace, modify, whatever . The city has been successful in a bunch of grants. We did Sanderson in Green Ridge. We had inventory . We were able to get LED light bulbs for the things. But these two reports have been kind of stagnant for the last bunch of reports . I did send them -- Mr. Smurl, we had a conversation last October . He reported that the administration told him everything was under control . I do not believe so. In bold letters in the e-mail it says failure to respond to these reports will not be permitted to justify an extension of the deadlines below. PennDOT is unable to extend the expiration date since grant funding is tied to the state fiscal calender year. And the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 appropriate funds lapse at the end of the fiscal year. They also say that they encourage that the project s be bid at least a year in advance to allow for the slow production of the traffic mast arms and poles and the traffic signal equipment . For Green Ridge Street, I actually signed that plan back in April of 2020, the approved signal plan. Then Covid hit. And they put Green Light Go on hold. In the interim , we received the grant for Elm Street and Maple Street on Cedar Avenue to the tune of $488,000 because I wrote the estimate for that for the grant application . The city's schedule here shows that these project s should have been bid last year and it was suppose d to be completed by May 15th. Unless I'm missing something they are not -- they have not been bid yet. MR. SCHUSTER : Was the end of the fiscal year, was it 2023 was the end of the fiscal year or -- MR. POCIUS: No, 2024, Tom, June 30th -- Councilman Schuster . So what I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 saying is remaining -- excuse me I have to put my glasses on. Remaining in the Cedar Avenue grant there is roughly $108,000 that could be spent towards the construction of the signal. And under the Cedar Avenue grant there is $418,000 left. So unless you guys can or woman can find something else out, this ship is going to fly and there is three intersection s in the city that we're not going to be able to do. I don't want to go over my time because I was a stickler on that when I was up there. So I want to ask you other thing to look into. We received a multimodal grant in 2019 for the Ash Street bridge replacement . We received I think about 1.1 million dollars . The total project cost was about 1.4. That grant also has guideline s and expiration date. I don't know if you, gentlemen or ladies, have heard anything about this, but I certainly haven't. So I would think you would want to get an update on that. Now, this is for the good of the order. I'd like to give you an update on the PennDOT bundle bridges . They were the bridges that we turned 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 over to PennDOT and they're designing and going to construct and give back to the city when they're done. East Parker Street, I don't know when exactly but it has been bid and there's a contractor on board for East Parker. That's the first one to go. I know because I stay in touch with the Professional Affairs with the engineer s that are designing these and we talk about, you know, the projects . Elm Street over the Lackawanna River is the next project to be bid probably maybe next February . These are all through PennDOT . And then the other two are Main Avenue over Leggett 's Creek. That's going to be depending on Parker Street being done only because the detours are the same. And West Lackawanna over Norfolk Southern Railroad , they just cleared their PUC hearing with the railroad . So that's kind of -- I think because of the detours involved , you may want to get an update yourselves on these because you're going to get a lot of questions why are all of these cars on Boulevard Avenue or Main Avenue or something like that and you could get an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 update. And I think if you called PennDOT they'd be glad to send someone down to talk to you. MR. SMURL: All right. Mr. Pocius, if you have a minute -- MR. POCIUS: Sure. MR. SMURL: Ash Street was started last year. The first phase was done, the big bank and stuff and they cleared the first section . And then when the flood came, they did not do the first -- the last part before the bridge before it goes underneath into that big turn. But I know that was started . The first half of it is done. Parker Street bridge, PPL just got -- we actually just passed it I believe last week. So they were waiting on us but that was our fault. That was Council . It was -- we tabled it for a while, but that's all straightened out and that's on the go. As far as the Green Light Go project , this is from this afternoon . Both project s are Baker and Nash{phonetic } who you know is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 enginee r for PennDOT . Okay, they have both of them. The city signed and approved both final permits and construction plans from PennDOT engineer last November when you first brought that up, okay. So the plans were sent to PennDOT . And we are still waiting for their approval and their permit to put them in. So that's where we stand. MR. POCIUS: Well, I signed the final signal plans for -- the proof plan for Wyoming and Green Ridge. I know that's done. The other project I had no involvement with so I just -- MR. SMURL: They haven't been forgotten . They are still -- MR. POCIUS: I just hope the ship hasn't sailed. But I don't think you quite understand about -- I don't want to take any more time but this Ash Street project , this is for replacement -- demolition and replacement of the bridge. This permitting . This is design. This is a bid. I have not seen a bid in the paper for Ash Street bridge. I read the papers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 every day. So I think you want to get an update from the administration where we're at with this project , have they given it to the new city engineer to design, have they gone out for consultant ? I mean, I really don't know. I think it's -- but all of these grants they are locally managed grants. MR. SMURL: A lot of them are from 2018 also. But I'll get you that information . MR. POCIUS: Yeah, I mean, it's no big deal. MR. SMURL: Everything is in process . I have been through this a number of times with these bridges and stuff. So they are all in process . But I'll get you that information , okay? MR. POCIUS: And just one other thing, I think City of Scranton has a lot of posted bridges. I think that should be a priority of the administration . And I know you guys will assist in any way possible to look for funding for these bridges . If federal money can be used for bridge replacement which I think it can, right now you've got South Washington Avenue. You've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 got Hickory Street. You've got -- MR. SMURL: I have been in contact with PennDOT . MR. POCIUS: I still have them in my head. But they are still city projects . MR. SMURL: We are working on them. MR. POCIUS: And one more personal note, my street is in deplorable condition . And I always -- I didn't want to come over and say this but the 400 block of McDonough Street in Minooka really needs milling and resurfacing , so anything you could do to do that I would appreciate it. MR. SMURL: I can't get mine done. Thank you, John. MR. POCIUS: I don't think it's been paved since -- MR. SMURL: Thank you. Norma Jeffries . Oh, I'm sorry, oh, yeah, Norma, you're next. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we get an update on the Green Light Go? I know I've asked several times since these projects started and since the gentleman from the library has come over and mention ed Wyoming , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 think that's going back two years now. I know we're always being told that it's been approve d and it's going to be worked on, but if we could get -- is this thing going out to bid and is it within the timeline and are we at risk of losing these funds I think would be the questions to ask. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Frank, if we could also get an update as to where we are with that Ash Street Bridge Project . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Sorry. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I'm starting off tonight by thanking the people that went to the PUC conference or meeting yesterday . I went to the 1:00. And it was a nice attendance there and the speakers were awesome . All of the Mayors from the different cities and everything spoke and the representatives and they gave such a great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 presentation as to why there shouldn 't be the increase in the water and all. And there was such a lot of information that the people that I was with didn't know and that is that you pay for your meter every month. And they said, like, the one person she had her house for 30 years. So she's been paying that meter charge for that box sitting on her house for 30 years, you know, so I'm sure it's been paid for more than once. But there was a lot of good information that came out. And kudos to everyone that spoke. And Doris couldn't be here tonight . And she wanted to thank all of the Council members that were there. She was at the 6:00. So she wanted to make sure and asked me if I would thank you guys for that as well. I'm starting off my night for thanking everybody and I guess the gentleman is gone. But we do have that pothole hotline, which I do take advantage of. So, of course, I hit another pothole yesterday . And it was in evening . I was doing some computer work. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 I thought -- so I called. It was about 8:30. 8:15 I called the hotline and I left a message . And believe it or not I got a call back last night at quarter of nine from a Joe. He was working the second shift. He called me back and we talked about the potholes that I was concerned about. And we talked too about the weather , of course, that has its impact on the roads and what they could do. So he was very congenial and I just enjoyed speaking with him about it. He took all the information down about what I was concerned about and the potholes and all and, you know, he said it would go on the list. And while I had him on the phone, I also asked him about the street paving list. And I know that this '24. Twenty-three or maybe the end of '22, my street was on for street paving and it never got paved, lots of potholes are filled but it never got paved. So I went to the city website to see if there was a list -- a street paving list for 2023 that might have carried over to '24. And, of course, I wasn't able to find anything . And being on that -- our city website , it just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 needs so much work. You know, there's so much activity on that there that's outdated or either it's not even giving you what you need. And I say that because under the board for the Municipality Recreation Authority which I'm on the board and the information there is so, so outdated. It's talking about the swimming pool. And it's talking about things that don't have anything -- they are so outdated. So I know that IT is probably very busy with things. But I would -- you know, I volunteer for a lot of things. And I certainly would like to volunteer and offer my services to update that portion of the website information so that we can be up-to-date on as many things as possible . I mean, I'm a city resident so you could imagine with people coming to the city and is looking to our city site for information and they are going to get it. They're going to get outdated information which is not good for our city. Let's see what else do I have on my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 little letter here. Oh, we talked about the bench sale and the zoo. I mean, come on, the zoo has been gone how long? I've been back in the city seven years and the zoo was gone before I got back. When I was a kid it was here. So, you know, those are the things that really need to be address ed. And also, of course, my pet -- like I said I volunteer a lot. My food drive -- it's not my food drive. It's the SMRA food drive. It's going to be next weekend on February the 10th and the 1th. And I've been doing a lot of outreach to make sure that it's overflowing with food from the community . So I'm just thanking those in advance if they could come to Nay Aug Park on October 10th and October the -- where did I get October from? February 10th and February the 11th, if they could just come and help us, just overflow that room with food because we usually break it down and give it to the local food pantries on Tuesday by the time we break it down and they come and get. So help us out with that. And lots 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 of stores are having buy one, get one or four cans of this for $5 or whatever . But help out our community . And one more thing, I'm not going to be here next week because it's my grandson 's birthday so I have to go out of town for that. But if would you please, Council , mention the food drive because that will be the Tuesday before the event and I won't be here, okay? Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident and homeowner . I too was at the meeting last night for the PUC and I had to leave after I spoke. I was very impressed at everybody that spoke before me. And from everything I heard and all the people on the panel that were representing the citizens , I don't know how this could possibly be passed by the PUC. I think this is going to get voted down and I hope I'm right. Next thing, until the last few weeks, I didn't realize how prevalent gangs were in our city. And I saw in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the paper yesterday or the day before where the school district is going to educate their staff. And that's all well and good but I was speaking to a neighbor of mine the other day. And she was saying that the city -- I totally agree with her, the city should have some kind of meeting maybe at Scranton High School or whatever and try to educate the people of the city on gangs. And she had a thought and so did I. That 16 year old that was arrested last week, the person that called 911 recognized that he had a red bandana on and he figured it out that he was part of a gang because of that. I wouldn't have known that. If I just saw that kid walking , I wouldn't have known a red bandana that kid was in a gang and so didn't this woman that I was talking to. She said she wouldn't have know that. And I'll bet everybody in this room probably wouldn't have known that. I think it would be a good idea to get the police department or the gang task force possibly to have a big meeting , invite 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 everybody that wanted to show up and educate them on what to look for if a person looks like a gang member or even if it's close to it. You know, we were lucky last week that that person spotted that kid because something terrible could have happened . So maybe if we could send a letter to the police chief or the gang task force and see if we could get something like that done. I think it would be an excellent idea because the people in this city have to be educated . Like I said, I would have thought that kid was just walking around for no other reason but maybe going somewhere . While I'm on that subject , last week because , Mr. McAndrew , you were modeling a shirt that you got honoring Detective Gilmartin . Well, I have one on also. MR. MCANDREW : You wear it better than I do. MR. SPINDLER : While we're on that subject also, I don't know if people saw it in the paper it started Monday and it ends Friday at Krispy Kreme Donuts that they are selling three donuts for $5. And all of the $5 goes directly to the Gilmartin family, which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 great. I bought mine the other day. There's nothing better than Krispy Kreme glazed donuts. So if anybody hasn't gone up there, it would be a good investment , $5 on all -- 100 percentage , all of the $5 goes to the family. And it goes to this Friday so there is still time. Lastly, talking about bridges , I spoken about this many times. The bridge on Main Avenue where Euclid Avenue meet, last Friday an 18 wheeler was stuck under the bridge. A few weeks before that, a flat bed 18 wheeler was going by with PVC pipe on it, didn't make it. All the PVC pipe on the truck was all over the road. There was plastic all over the road. It's like every week or every other week that bridge is hit by an 18 wheeler , whether we need more signage or what. I don't know what the solution could be. But I have a solution I think that might help. The bridge that is on the corner of Capouse and Olive, the railroad they painted their name on the bridge with the height in big white numbers -- the height of the bridge. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Maybe if we could get in touch with the railroad that owns that bridge on Main Avenue if they could do something like that because there is -- like I said, at least two, three times, maybe four times a month this is happening . And it's a terrible inconvenience because it holds up traffic going in both directions . And I think something should be done. PennDOT , they did have those digital signs up for a while going in each direction . But I don't think they have them anymore. But they didn't help. But either better signage or, like I said, if the railroad could paint like they did on Capouse Avenue, I think that would be a great idea. And my time is up so thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Spindler , in caucus previous to the regular meeting , NeighborWorks was in here. And they have the sidewalk program . I hope you spoke with Mr. Gettman about the $4,000 match for that for possibly Bulwer with some of the neighbors to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 get together to maybe make advantage of that sidewalk opportunity . MR. SPINDLER : I spoke to Gerard Hetman about it. He gave me the information . But you have to get five neighbors . I don't know if I'll be able to do that. MR. SCHUSTER : Hawthorne Street has the same issue as Bulwer. So there might be an opportunity to get five of those neighbors . MR. SPINDLER : All right. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. You know, I'm going to talk about Licensing and Inspections next week. They're not going anywhere . I'd just like to say that when I was a child we had a lot of good policemen in the city. They brought up Dan Duffy. And there was also Jerry Moss and Frank McGuire and lot of guys that people in the neighborhood looked up to because , I don't know, because they were police and they were fair. And I'm really troubled where we are. And I listened to what everybody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 here says about gangs. But I think we should appreciate the police. Nobody needs them until the chips are down. You know, but yesterday I had an opportunity to speak at the PUC meeting in the afternoon , spoke to the judges. And you know when Council President Wechsler was the President of Council , he caused a lot of pain to the community in Dunmore and Scranton by introducing the legislation to sell the Scranton Sewer Authority . And I think it's important for city residents to understand that we put a lot of political people in place in the Scranton Sewer Authority . We used it as a conduit for supporters of the Mayors for an extended period of time. It was severely mismanaged . And the Sewer Authority was never designed to handle the pension debt for the City of Scranton . And we had a very corrupt Mayor at that time, a lot of attorneys made a lot of money. And like I said to the PUC judge yesterday , the PUC decided that the city could sell the Scranton Sewer Authority . None of the money really went into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 the pension plans. It was all squandered . So, you know, when you look at the Council s that we've had, they're just terrible . And then we had the opportunity for Mr. Pocius to come in here today. He was a great Council man. I remember him over 30 years ago, him and Alex Hazzouri when the Council members would tell the solicitor what the laws were and how things function ed. We just moved so far away from that. We just -- it's just a shame where we really are because it's like the city is adrift and it's on fire. And it's just a shame how the city is continually falling apart. You know, the public access channel has to be brought back to access by the public so the politician s can really hear what the people think because , really, coming up here speaking to this Council and a multitude of other ones, soon I'll be coming here almost 40 years. And we've been ignored and the city population has declined and all the Council members have great plans and our population has dropped by 28,000 people. Like I said to the PUC judge, you threw us in the water. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 State of Pennsylvania owns every drop of water that falls out of the sky. Pennsylvania American Water is only using their conduit to introduce the water into the people's homes and the people can't afford them. One of my co-workers made between 100 to $116,000 a year. He had a house in the Hill with pocket doors. He was really proud of it. One day he came to work and said, nope, I'm done with that. Walked out the door, shut the door and walked away from the house. Why, he said, Lee, you can't live in the city where you can't afford to bathe your children . That was the end of it. He bought a house out in the country , didn't have any of that silliness . So what I'm saying to all the people here today is, we need to rewrite the city charter . We need to change our government . And we need to realize one thing. The PUC judges, the PUC commissioner s are picked by the Governor and by the Pennsylvania Senate. They don't represent us because the people we elect don't represent us. And you can hand out all the grant money you want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 here that comes from the federal government or the state government. But you are not going to create success . People need jobs. You changed all the zoning. You have a make-believe small business incubator in the downtown . You squander ed all the grant money over an extended period of time. You even took a water slide down that the kids in this community enjoyed that was probably worth a half a million dollars . It's just one of these. Well, what's next? It's time to think, gentlemen . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hello Council , I'm Rick Little. I'm officially homeless now. But I'm going to keep working on what I've -- what I know. I just know too much. And I have a lot of PSTD and OCD. And it sort of works together , especially the OCD. When I start looking into something , I go from one to the other to the other. But since I've been fighting Scranton Housing Authority , pretty much the whole time I've been there but especially in the last four years in the Courts. The Courts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 are gone. I know this because I spent 15 years in New York State Family Courts. And I know how courts work. I know how judges work. I know -- when you get into that branch of the government, the judiciary , you got lawyers. And they don't like non-lawyers practicing in their courts. I found that the Lackawanna courts are just completely crooked . They don't follow the rules of Pennsylvania Civil Procedure . And they have all of these tricks to trick Pro se litigant s, you know, oh, that's a typo, especially the stuff it's lost in the mail -- you know, lost in the mail or we sent it to you electrically , you know, you didn't respond and stuff like that. And that happened to me. I realized , you know, way before Covid -- I knew Covid was coming since 1992. All you have to do is read the United Nations booklet , half inch booklet called Agenda 21. And then another one which bugged me because I see the United Nations flag flying in the front of City Hall here. United Nation is communism . They 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 are helping bring all the people across the border. They are fostering the wars between , you know, Nato and Russia and everything . I always believed it starts locally . And in the last couple months, you know, calling all of these -- everybody is a not for profit. That's the biggest problem in this community is that these not for profit, Scranton Housing Authority is a not for profit. I looked into it, did a right to know. That's probably why I'm evicted because I know that these -- I mean, the executive director is making just under $200,000. And they raised the pay for everybody in Scranton Housing Authority to 4 percent . And they keep in business at least for the last 28 years through this body, through the Mayor. There's a lot of back room deals that have gone on all along and they are just abusing the elderly. I heard the City of Philadelphia sent a bus to the City of Scranton telling all -- and these are all old people, disabled people, people that lived in something like Scranton Housing Authority here where I used to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 live, telling them, oh, come to Scranton and the Catholic Services will help you. And I'm thinking , gee, Catholic Services is where I signed up for the American Rescue Act ERAP funds. And then I spent, like, three months trying to find -- going to the Globe building . No one knew where it was. It's just a runaround. And I have a hard enough time just with my phone. I never know who is calling me. You know, but it's fixed. And Scranton used to be a very great city. But I know clearly why we have a homeless problem , why we have all the gangs here, why things don't go anywhere . It just keeps going on and on and it's readily heading toward bottom. I hear about all of these, you know, centers and they're all 5013Cs, NeighborWorks , everything is neighbor , children to help you. But there's no help. People have to start looking at it the way -- the way it was earlier in the governance of how -- so people are responsible so there's transparency . I'm done. I hope we get public access. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 like to speak to Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Well, it was brought up here earlier which I was going to put up as my own, but tax relief for the victims of the flooding . We are at right now 143 days past. So where do we stand especial ly on this body's statement on not waiting and being a front to the action? Is this going to take as long for this body to act as it is to get the firemen 's contract posted? How about news on the Serrenti Center? We know there were issues up there. They were suppose d to come in for a -- and speak about where the financing are, where the study is, where they're going to. And then we had the unfortunate newspaper article about mismanagement of funds and funds being used where they shouldn 't be. Are we ever going to get an update on the Serrenti Center again? Is there any updates on charging non-profits who have dorms, multiple schools who have dorms a rental fee because anything that people who are -- occupy for over a month period of time under PA law is a rental. Dorm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 rooms aren't rented for -- by the month or by the week, whether it be a quarter , a half a year or an entire year, they are rented. There may be two people to a dorm and only one charged for that rental fee for that dorm since it has dual occupancy . But the City of Scranton for every single dorm that is out there, for the multiple universities should be getting that rental fee. Are we ever going to get that answer back or is that something once again the city is not sure what we mean by a rental fee and what we mean by applying it to the city because it's been asked multiple times and it keeps coming back as a, oh, well, off campus properties with a student renting it, of course, they pay that. We're not talking about off campus. We're talking about properties owned by the universities that house university student s that all should be paying $45 a year for those dorms. Payment in lieu of taxes certainly drops every year now from them. It would be nice if not only the University of Scranton , but all the other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 universities who share in the benefits of having student housing here in the City of Scranton actually kicked in to the livelihood and survivability of the City of Scranton . I made a comment on the water rate hike about how going to your boss -- about how silly it is going to your boss and asking for 70 percent raise would get you laughed out of your boss's office and then going back the next year and asking for an increase of 30 percent would be absolutely absurd that any employer going to their boss and saying I need 70 percent this year and then 30 percent the following year, their employers would laugh at them. They might get 3, 5 percent depending upon how desperately they were needed. And more likely they would find the front door. Those water rake hikes are ridiculous . And I made that point. But on the way back home something hit -- hit me in the brain panel. The sarcastic point of, well, I'm complaining that these massive raises of 70 percent and then they come back the next year for 30 percent , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 how it's so absurd, that's exactly what this administration has been doing. That's the policy of this city body to the taxpayers just like the PUC coming in and robbing people with giant rates. The administration coming in here for anywhere up to 50 percent increase s and then coming back the following year and asking for increases on top of those increases is no different than the robbing that the water company wants to do from every citizen . It's shameful . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else want to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Once again, I would like to make a mention that recycle bucket and bins are suppose dly available at the DPW's office. And it would be helpful if the landlords in town seeing as home ownership has been on a declined for years. We got married in 1976. And, of course, we rented. But within four or five years it was 20 percent down for a house and 20 percent interest for a house. So, you know, give you a little tip, don't expect people not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 to go wild if that's -- you know, nothing else left to do. And television s, if there is some type of help, trying to get a date again. I think the March date was incorrect . But, you know, it sucks when they appear on your curb in front of your house or back by your garbage can and they are not really yours. And they cost some serious money to get rid of. That's at least two-thirds of the pay for a really big dinner at a restaurant or something . The water situation , I felt that Mr. King had an excellent statement prepared and seeing as he was a public official , an elected public official , he should not the have been cut off at 5 minutes. If you add all these guys up here, now we got 10 minutes last night. And if everybody was there -- I saw Mr. Schuster , you were there, right? Did I see you there? Yeah, okay. Well, the point being that would have occupied nearly a half hour of their time by the time you get somebody to walk up and identify themselves and sworn in. And I felt that we were seriously cut down by that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 And it was a shame. Somehow we should get to the PUC and mention that if somebody is an elected official , they have a right -- should have a right to speak a little more than a ya ya like me. They tried to stop me from speaking a second time. But there was a lot of plastic bottles mention ed and so forth. And plastic breaks down into microplastic . It's present in fish. It's present in animal food. It's present in your food. And it's probably present in your system right now. It is an organic molecule with chlorine attached . So it's very close to a pesticide and it could act like hormones or, you know, whatever and cause some serious problem s. So it's something to think about. They are fish that are actually starving because there is so much plastic in their stomachs out in the ocean. Now, the one thing I brought up last night and I think it's fair to say, I don't know what we could have done with the police and firemen settlement because that got ugly. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 That's like seven years they didn't get a raise and then it wound up being an eighth year. And we had punitive damage hanging over our head, something definitely -- well, we seem to be doing a little better with that nowadays . But the point in being that in -- I think it was 2005 I was at the university . They had Rick Santorum there advocating privatize Social Security , no contrary discussion just Rick Santorum advertising for Social Security . And the point of it being then we have this on -- I'll end it real fast with the Sewer Authority . I will also point out that education -- nonprofit education institutions have drug these people into town and their ideas aren't always so good. I had wished we had done it another way. I was against the Sewer Authority being sold. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else that wishes to address Council ? MR. MARGAVITCH : Good evening , Council , Mark Margavitch , Scranton . I have good news. Today is January 31st and even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 better news that at the end of the month there will be leaves on trees or trees on -- yeah, leaves on trees. Any word on my photos? MR. SMURL: Mr. Voldenberg , did we receive those? MR. MARGAVITCH : I got nothing . MR. VOLDENBERG : We're awaiting on the photos from February 24th of 2023. Those particular photos that were forward ed to Mr. Margavitch were from the revisit by code enforcement on April 25th. So I believe they submitted them to him in error. And I'm awaiting for Mr. Oleski for the actual photos from February 24th. MR. MARGAVITCH : So we did all believe last week that they are require d to take them on visits. Is that a yes? Would anyone know that not to be the case? When they write a citation that they should have photos with that citation ? MR. MCANDREW : Correct . MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. All right. And as far as with the right-to-know-request regarding your own property , do you need to do a right-to-know-request or is that not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 necessary for your own property ? MR. SMURL: Are you looking for documentation ? MR. MARGAVITCH : Just, yeah, anything that involves -- MR. SMURL: Any time you want documentation or things written out to you, you've got to do a right to know. And if you just ask, we could put a request in again but -- MR. MARGAVITCH : But nothing -- see, I was told by another code enforcement official that photos could be sent to the property owner. And this was a place that I manage. So the property owner did request them. And he did get them immediately . But I could not get them as the property manager . So I was just wondering if that was correct by what this code official who's currently employed with the city if that is correct or -- MR. SMURL: I don't know what code official would tell you that. I would go to Mr. Oleski for that answer. MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. All right. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 Now, I don't know if they knew I was waiting for the photos but I was. And the bigger concern that I have with this is the same code official who I won't identify the person decided to lie in court. And not only do I have my tenant as a witness to both answering the door that day and being in court but I also have a city employee who also is a witness to that. And I'm just wondering how we could address the situation ? MR. SMURL: I have no answer for that. Attorney Gilbride , are we allowed to deal with that at all if it's a court issue? ATTY. GILBRIDE : No. Quite frankly , it's not the City Council 's position to get involved in what would be potential litigation on behalf of a private property owner. That would be up to you to hire an attorney and go forward with that attorney in ways that you think are conducive to making out a case that you think you have. MR. MARGAVITCH : I'm not looking to have any legal action. But I am looking to see what the response is to code officials , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 guess, maybe not doing their job and then lying in court. MR. SMURL: That I believe -- yeah, unfortunate ly that's the administration . Contact -- I don't know, contact the Mayor, Eileen Cipriani . I know I've asked Mr. Oleski to contact you. He told me he had and that's so I -- MR. MARGAVITCH : You all saw my response e-mail. I cc'd everybody but Mr. King by accident . But everyone got that e-mail I sent back as well. That's the last I heard. MR. SMURL: Um hum. MR. MARGAVITCH : That was January 12th if I'm not mistaken . And then lastly, Mr. McAndrew , you read my statement last week. We'll just put a name to the concerned citizen . Is there any way we could do -- if you would please do a right-to-know request for that document that the city claimed they did have? In Fifth Order you read that for me. MR. MCANDREW : So you're asking me -- okay, so I responded -- or I inquired about a property that you had an issue with. And I read and reported out the response that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 received . MR. MARGAVITCH : Yes. MR. MCANDREW : So you're asking me to do a right to know to get more information myself? MR. MARGAVITCH : No, this would be to get the document that states that. MR. MCANDREW : The response -- excuse me, but in the response that I read out it stated that you did receive something , correct ? MR. MARGAVITCH : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. And I don't have it in front of me but that it was satisfied whatever was -- you -- the issue you had was satisfied . So when I hear satisfied , I'm thinking there was some correspondence . I wasn't involved because this is what -- MR. MARGAVITCH : No, I know you weren't involved . MR. MCANDREW : Is this the issue that's 10 years ago or -- MR. MARGAVITCH : Yes, this is a little bit ago, yeah. I'm just wondering if we could have the document that they respond ed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 from. That's what I'm asking. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Voldenberg , the response I received , can you ask if there is any documentation support ing the response they gave me? MR. MARGAVITCH : Yes, but they did say -- they did respond with a document . I just want to know if we can have that document . MR. MCANDREW : Or can they produce that document . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out in the morning , sir. MR. MARGAVITCH : If not, I could file a right to know. Just if it's quicker this way, that's all I asked. MR. MCANDREW : Well, let's see what we get. MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , did we get clarification on whether a property owner needed a right to know to get information on their particular property ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we did not. They would only need to file a right to know if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 they were requiring documentation . That would take some time to present . And they suggest the right to know because it not only protect s the body but it also protects the individual making the request . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. So even if it's a citation or information regarding their own property , the city would rather the right-to-know-request put in for documentation purposes ? MR. VOLDENBERG : It would depend on if it involved extensive documentation . ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , if I could -- MR. SMURL: Yes. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. Schuster , the right-to-know-request that's made on a governmental entity for information that the government has in relation to whatever the topic the person is looking for, irregardless of whether it's an individual 's private property or not, the appropriate procedure is still for that individual to file a right to know. It protects the individual , one, by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 giving it -- the individual some line to show that we've requested this and have not received it. And it also protect s the entity from releasing any information in the future if it turns out that maybe that shouldn 't have been. So that's the appropriate way to do it. And that's any government document irregardless of whether it's your property or somebody else's or the government 's. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . First and foremost , I would like to offer continued prayers to Kyle Gilmartin and his family and the brave Scranton Police Officers who protect us on a daily basis. I would like to ask a simple question . Were these documents received from the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority from the administration ? No. Okay. I thought so. So here's what's going to happen. This isn't the only source where I could actually gain these documents . Tomorrow I'm going to be putting in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 a right to request from the Scranton School District . They have a copy of them. Also a friend of mine who resides in Dunmore will go to the Dunmore Borough Building , request those documents as well. There was a person who actually steered this train down the tracks. Okay, he's current ly incarcerated . Also tomorrow a block down and on the right-hand side, I'm going to go into the U.S. Attorney General 's Office, ask also to speak with the FBI about the RICO Act. As far as I'm concerned there were attorneys that, you know, raised their right hand to do well and follow the laws like Solicitor Gilbride . You know, they respect that and they have attorneys that are questioned . And also 50 easement s that are still unresolved and when there's 50 attorneys , all of them chip in maybe an hour and, you know, take care of them without any additional cost. It's ridiculous . So with that being the case, no documents , I'm assuming they weren't found. Let's rewind. You know, I'm going back some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 administrations here. Let's start with bricks and a budget deficit . That was given to the Wenzel administration . Four years he set up 12 immaculate years of the Connor's administration . I gave former Mayor Wenzel an A-plus. Twelve years of the Council -- I'm sorry, Connor's administration we managed to keep seven pools open, didn't raise taxes once. Everybody was happy, all right, A-plus. Doherty , 40 million dollars in pension , D. Former disgraced Mayor, sold two most important assets, didn't care about us, didn't care about the roads, sold the Sewer Authority for 100 million less than what it was worth, turned around and paid off the debts with low interest rates. Covid hit. Now, if we kept that asset, it would have been worth a lot more today. So instead of using that money dollar for dollar for infrastructure , what does he do? He pays off the bills. We had great credit at the time and here we are today. You know, we have streets that are falling apart, you know, we have DPW employees , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 great DPW employees that work hard every day that are just restricted with their number of hours and what they could do. That was evident from the street plowing . I don't blame the employees . I blame the DPW Director , D. As far as the City Treasurer , I went to the City Controller and I asked about the right to knows -- about the right to knows. They had mentioned to John Murray that they don't pay any fines. Well, I'm going put in an appeal to the Office of Open Records and he could actually track mine to see if it's actually paid. I think these bills are building up because if he can't see them, they're not being paid. You know, at $1,500 a clip, $500 each per day. You know, you get 100 of these, we know all the problems with open records and those issues. It's an issue. All right. And, you know, it's a lot things going on around here. Permits , D. As far as our Mayor is concerned , you know, she wasn't even around for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 the floods, not even from here, also give her a D, don't care. You know, so I was hoping we could do better with somebody with a degree from Harvard . And you know what she might want to do? She might want to call to get her money back because they failed her just as much as she's failing us. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else like to address Council ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just for clarity 's sake, it was mentioned that four of us were at the hearing last night. All five of us were there. I couldn't make the 1:00 one. But at 6:00, all five Council members were there. And I appreciated that. And I do agree with Mr. Dobrzyn . I felt rushed. I had a number of points that I wanted to get through and they, you know, kind of cut me off. Fortunately Attorney Eskra was able to utilize -- she kind of knew where I was heading and asked some questions which allowed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 me to be able to speak about some of the concern s that were expressed to me via e-mail from our citizens to me. So kudos to her for helping. It saved me a little bit there because I had that list towards the end of where I wanted to speak. And I was at least able to mention it later on because at the end of the day, it's the citizens and ratepayers that are most important . But I did want to early on in my comments to make sure that everyone knows, you know, the profits were well over 884 million dollars in 2023. So and then they want to turn around and raise the rates on us after that 70 percent increase in 2023. So to me it's disgusting . Just to give a quick overview of the case a little bit, the Pennsylvania American Water Company is proposing -- has proposed that the 2023 rate case of 203.9 million dollars . The amount of increase in water is 199.2 million and waste water is 4.7 million . The percentage increase in revenues are 22.2 percent , water 24.2, and waste water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 2.5 percent . They said of the 71 million proposed -- they are proposing such a small increase to waste water because they are proposing to shift 71 million dollars of waste water revenue requirement increase to the water customers . That is 94 percent of the propose d waste water increase . So the 71 million proposed to shift, 16 million comes from the combined storm and sewer system of which Scranton is part and the other two CSS systems are in Kane and McKeesport . The effect of this significant shift is that water customer s are paying more than they should pay for water service because they're paying for significant part of waste water service . And it's unclear whether the PUC will allow this significant shift. The Office of Consumer Advocacy is still evaluating the impact of that propose d shift. One of the things that was brought up by the Office of Consumer Advocacy last night, they talked about this program that PAWC was proposing or they are proposing . It's called revenue decoupling mechanism , RDM. Alternative rate design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 mechanism applicable to residential and nonresidential customer s excluding customer s under the contract . The company propose s that RDM will compare the difference between actual revenue collected from eligible customer s under approved rates against cost component s calculated to recover the company 's fixed cost of providing service . If the actual revenue s are higher than they should have been collected under the RDM formula , the difference would be credited to customers in the subsequent year through the automatic adjustment mechanism . If actual revenues are lower than should have been recovered under the RDM formula , the difference will be collect ed from customer s in the subsequent year through the automatic adjustment mechanism . This proposal includes no cap on the amount of the adjustment. And the Office of Consumer Advocacy does not support this proposal as it believes this shift risk to customers is inappropriate . So basically this means that if you don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 achieve the total revenue through the rate increase because of conservation , which decrease usage, they could substitute a fee to get that back. So it's kind of a risky program that, you know, they tried to make it seem like it's all wonderful . But if they don't meet their savings that they expect or the revenue amount they expect, you're going to get a huge bill the following year. So we got to keep a close eye on it because I'm hoping that the PUC heard us loud and clear. And I appreciated all the citizens , most of which most of you sitting here were there last evening and spoke and that was greatly appreciated . And I appreciate all of our local state representatives and Senator Marty Flynn and the work from all of their offices to go out and fight this thing. So hopefully we will see a positive result. And that's all I have at this time. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I guess I'd like to follow up with what Mr. King said. He did a great job last night of laying out all of his points. Although he might have had a little bit more, I think what you put out there was some good information . The point of the hearing last night they started out by saying it was about to see whether we had inadequate rate distribution . And from what I saw from what everybody spoke on, I think they proved that point. And I hope that the PUC gets that message loud and clear. All areas of the city were represented . And I think some of the main points that I took away as a Council person and I think Council laid that out as well is all parts of the city saw poor quality of water for periods of time and also poor quality restoration which is something I've been talking about since I started here on Council . And I would like to see that the restoration that all of our utility companies do -- the restoration that all utility companies do is adequate for our city, which at this point in time I would say it isn't. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 I'm looking for a favorable result of the hearing s last night. And we've talked about it a couple times there is some homes in the City of Scranton that have caught fire and are waiting demolition . Two of the ones that stick out to me or actually three of the ones that stick out to me are the rear 111 of Blair. There's a home also. I think it's in the 1500 block of West Gibson above Tripp Park. And I there's one I think on Lincoln . I know that there's other houses. But can we just get a followup , Mr. Voldenberg , on those houses that have caught fire and are awaiting demolition ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll follow up in the morning . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. I've seen recently it was spoken about tonight with NeighborWorks about homeowner s and money that is put up for new home buyer program s. And I asked about some of the metrics that were used to see if this is a successful program . It seemed like it was and I know people that have used the program and it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 been successful . Recently I've seen some news about some of the business that have received the small business grants or the small business microgrants. And when the Mayor and Eileen Cipriani were here in the Council Chambers for caucus, I specifically asked question s about how the city determines what metrics the city is going to use to determine success of businesses for these small business grants. And I inquire d into the process of about how the BA's Office would -- if they looked at any ways to determine success and failure rates. I don't know if I got the best answer there that night. But seeing some of these business es that receive d some of these grants, I don't know if I want to say fail but may be going out of business . I got a few question s. And I will e-mail them over after the meeting, Mr. Voldenberg . But could the BA's office provide how many businesses applied for the small business grants, how many businesses were awarded grants and the dollar amounts of each, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 when the grant window closed, how many may still be pending, does the city still have funds in their small business grant or small business microgrant account s; and did we determine that the program was successful and, if so, will we be distributing any of the leftover funds? Also, if a business does fail or go under while they are using our funds, do they have to return any of the funding that they received from the city with the terms of their borrowing ? Thank you. And I will e-mail that over. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Also Mr. Gilbride , can you provide us a short update about the Council 's actions and where we're going to be going with the tax relief? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yes, as we talked about last week, state law provide s a way in which to offer taxpayers who are involve d in a serious -- like the flooding that we're discussing . That has -- there was a meeting between all of the taxing bodies, the process 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 was established . In fact, I believe you all received this week an e-mail containing the letters that will be going out to the property owners who were affected in the city because , of course, there is a county component that the county has to deal with as well. I do not know the timing of when those letters will be going. Obviously , that will be handled by the administration . But I know the letter was drafted . It was forwarded around for approval by all the taxing bodies who I believe responded . And I anticipate that will be going out well before the first when the taxes are due, which is in April. So that's where it's at now. Once that occurs, they will receive the application . They will be receiving assistance in filling out the application . And that's where it's at right now. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Also, Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask the administration if there is any new employee s that have been hired that need approval from Council ? I know that we've -- I think at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 beginning of this year we said that we would like to see some of these appointment s come down before they start their first day of work. But are there any employee s that we're waiting on that legislation to come before Council ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll inquire . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. From public comment earlier there was a question about the rental ordinance and I did get an answer from the city administration . It says as the current rental ordinance states, dormitories are not include d in the rental ordinance 's language and their enforce ment. This in line with other municipalities and taxing authorities rules and regulations . However , off campus student housing is subject to the $45 fee per unit and include d in the rental ordinance language and enforcement . That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, first I wanted to also discuss the PUC hearing that took place last night. I'm really grateful that there was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 so many resident s that showed and for all the people who spoke, the elected official s including our Council for being there and many of us speaking . I just, you know, I really hope that they got the point and the message that we need to reject -- that they need to reject any new proposed increases from the American Water. But I hope they also understood just how unfair the increases last year were that occurred that we didn't really have that opportunity to speak to and how much those are still affecting our residents and how we are not getting our money's worth. There's no improvement s that I've seen. I know they say they are doing projects . But they've been doing project s and replacing lines for many, many years. I remember renting a place in South Side when I was in grad school and them doing the same thing with the streets at that time. So it's -- these are ongoing project s and we're still left with poorly paved roads and dirty water that resident s are frequently experiencing . So those are some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 the concern s that I know I had spoken to and I really hope that they heard us and heard Scranton and Dunmore and our neighbor ing communities that we deserve better. And I also wanted to just thank NeighborWorks for coming in tonight . I think it's always really exciting to hear about the different project s that they have been working on throughout the year. And, you know, I real have enjoyed myself being able to participate in many of them. And, you know, the city partner ing with them on so many of the programs , especially the grants like the first-time home buyer and then with beautiful blocks. You know I think it's really great that they are going to be incorporating the sidewalks and that there's an increase in funding for that. So I really hope that word gets out to resident s that people will take advantage of that this year and that there are a lot of applications and people are able to get their sidewalks , exterior of their homes repaired. And lastly, I wanted to bring up a concern from this week. The 500 block of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 Harrison Avenue had two properties -- I don't have the address on them. I think one might be 517, but two properties that had put out a lot of trash in front of their properties well in advance of garbage day. I don't know if one was maybe a move out. I think another one had been cleaned up. But tomorrow is garbage day. So now at this point I don't think there will be much that could be done, but if we could have still our code enforcement officer for the Hill go over there in the next couple of days and see if additional trash is being placed in front of those properties . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have them visit that block. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. Thank you. And that's all that I have tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. Like I said earlier , I was thrilled to have the opportunity to participate last night at the hearing and seeing my colleague s there as well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 as all the other local officials fighting for us and the concern ed residents . Just listening to them was -- is disheartening . Seventy percent last year and 30 percent this year. That's a 100 percent increase . For the level of service we get it's absurd. No one's water bill should be as much as a car payment . It's absolutely outrageous what they are charging us now and proposing -- proposed increase for this year. I too hope for a positive outcome for all of us. And secondly , so I have a few complaints . This one is South Webster Avenue. It's drive up to Saginaw Street. I know we got something back, Mr. Voldenberg ; but I promised I would bring this up. I guess it's a vacant lot, 733 Saginaw Street is becoming a dumping ground. I'm not sure who owns it if it's an empty lot or whatever . But the neighbor s have been trying to clean it up and they just have had it. I know we got an update. But I don't think -- it was geared more towards the responsibility of who is to clean it or maintain it. Get it out for me, please. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 So I got -- yeah, I need an update. I got Hi, Mark, I hope this message finds you well. I was contacted one time for a representat ive for the city that told me they needed some other piece of paper that I submitted the same day and the answer now has been the same we are working on it. This is in response to the only eight people that live in Keyser Valley that received I think it's -- they're referring to the $5,000 that was promised to the residents up there. So can we get an update on who got it -- we don't need names, just how many people received this, what is the holdup for the remaining and why if there is any and just an update on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Meadow Avenue between Moosic Street and River Street desperately needs some pothole attention just as you turn from Meadow Avenue to River Street, the holes are very bad. This is a very heavily travelled area. The road needs attention now. So can you reach out to DPW? MR. VOLDENBERG : They have that as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 of this week again so I'll follow up. MR. MCANDREW : Fantastic . So last week I asked about the DPW dispatch . Do they work weekend s? What are their plans for emergencies like snow and flooding ? Did we get a response ? We got something like they received my concern -- but we got a response ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we did not. MR. MCANDREW : Well, guess what, I reached out to some DPW workers and they said guess what, historically there is a dispatcher on holiday s and on days where there's going to be emergencies or snow that is forecasted. So I found out for myself there used to be a plan. Can you find out -- I mean, that should have been a simple answer I requested last week and all we got was they are in receipt of my request . So can I get some clarification , you know, there was a plan; how come it's not being followed . MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll get those answers . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I got a complaint from a gentleman who lives on Bogart Place on the second floor. This is Lackawanna 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 Avenue, just two buildings down from the Scranton Liederkranz . As you may know, the Liederkranz does not close until 3 a.m. Well, they're probably not supposed . Historically I know that. I might have been there back in the day, which means that most foot traffic doesn't complete ly clear out until roughly 3:15 to 3:30 a.m. This issue I'm facing is the noise outside the apartment during these hours. I understand it's a social club. It's been there for a long time before me and probably will likely be there after. However , it's become a major issue especial ly when I'm working a 24-hour shift and my girlfriend is alone. She gets woken up at 3:30 a.m., can't fall back to sleep due to loud conversation , yelling and music blasting . Especially on warmer nights and over the holidays this noise is extended to 4:30 a.m., with people hanging out after with music playing , etc. This occurs on Thursday , Friday, and Saturday nights into the morning . Trash is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 everywhere . There is some attached photos I could send you, Mr. Voldenberg . The next morning usually tells the story of how many people are lingering and causing a disturbance in these last -- early morning hours I should day. I know this might be something to do with the LCB is part of it and our local police department . But give them a heads up that this is occurring and it's affecting, you know, the quality of life of one of our resident s, okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : And I'll add code enforcement also. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, send everybody . Thank you. And once again I'm getting complaint s about the Weston Field lifeguard situation that's been ongoing for the past three years. We were kind of promise d by the Park Director that, you know, we're going -- well, he was suppose d to be a lifeguard but that never happened. But he did say, you know, we're going to hold some classes and certified lifeguard s and we should be good. So my understanding what I heard is the issues again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 are maybe they're open one day a week. These are paying customer s and residents . We were promised this would be rectified . Can you find out why it isn't and what the plan is for our residents that are paying to rehabilitate and have a social swim there? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And I believe -- well, no, one more thing. So Mr. Spindler brought up a great point. You know, a lot of this -- finally we admitted we have gangs, which I'm thrilled to hear. I realize d we had them for 10 years. But now everybody is admitting it. So when you admit something then that's the first step. So education awareness is key. Mr. Spindler had a great idea. We should have something . I know they are working on it at the schools. I'm part of that school system. I know education awareness is important for every level of learning or something like this gang related , getting information out. So I don't know if we have to have a meeting here. But I think the first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 step maybe is reach out to the Chief of Police, Chief Carroll , and say you know what, please come in for a caucus, a public caucus. You know, you don't have to divulge any strategies that you are using to prevent gangs because that doesn't make sense that, you know, the gangs don't need to know what we're doing. But we need to know like Mr. Spindler said, the public needs to know what to look for. You know, I realize that red is a color or a bandana because I'm an educator and I see high school kids all the time. And I also -- that was a great call by that lady who, you know, actually prevented the shooting single handedly by her just watchful eye and knowing that a Scranton high kid can't have a backpack unless it's clear. So that was a great catch by her. But I don't think the rest of the public realizes that unless you have kids in school. So please reach out to Chief Carroll . Let's set something up, a caucus to come in and but just, you know, offering some education awareness for our public to make them feel a little safer than they actually feel right now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll extend the invite. MR. MCANDREW : And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . The first thing, last week we had complaints about Cedar and Maple and Cedar and Elm. The traffic lights were out. They have been repaired. They had to wait for some parts to come in. But they are awaiting approval to be replaced from PennDOT . Mrs. Schumacher , the existing LERTA ordinance , it was filed of Council 49 from 2018 and file of Council 50 of 2018. It was amended . It automatically sunset after ten years, which would be December 28th or -- December of 2028, that's when it will be over. The administration said it was -- it just had mixed results , nothing great, nothing bad. The South Webster Avenue, the sinkhole there, DPW I believe is schedule d for next week to go and take care of that. The other thing is the Serrenti Center. I don't know why I remember this.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 But years ago Serrenti Center when it was purchased , I believe Council made -- had to approve the sale or something . But I do remember Council saying, well, the fire station up at Petersburg corners if we could sell that or if we're going to sell that that we would use that money, the proceed s from that to pay all of the utilities and stuff in the Serrenti Center until it was depleted . So I remember that. I'll look back on it and figure out if that was true. But I'm almost positive I remember that. The other thing is, I don't know where and I don't know how it came out that the City of Scranton was going to make money on the Serrenti Center. So I'll research that this week. I know after they purchase d it it was purchased for the police department . There's fire equipment up there. There's all kinds of equipment up there. And they use it for a multiple of things, the portable firehouse that they have when they have training and stuff. But I still don't know. I don't understand where we were suppose d to get money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 from that, but I will find that out. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, I don't mean to interrupt . But I do remember hearing that there could be potential -- I do remember hearing that there could be potential revenue streams from other law enforcement entities from outside of the city utilizing the center for some training purpose s that they would, of course, their municipalities would have to pay to train there. So that was a selling point that I remember that I thought was a great idea. MR. SMURL: Yeah, that I don't know. MR. SCHUSTER : I could clarify that a little bit further . I don't recall the name of the system, but the city purchased a -- I don't want to say a virtual reality system; but they purchase d a system that could put police officer s in a virtual live experience . And they were going to use that system as well as the classrooms there to train outside law enforcement and other individuals . It could have possibly been a revenue stream. I think maybe some of that technology is -- isn't up to date right now.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 I think virtual reality is the way they are going to be going. But that was where the training purposes with the equipment that we were purchasing were going to be used to maybe bring in some revenue from outside agency. MR. SMURL: I wouldn't expect the city to charge other police departments and stuff since they do help us on a number of things. But if that's what was said, that's what was said. But I will look further into that. Last thing I have is a letter to President Biden. This is a disaster declaration of appeal. Since we were denied from FEMA I think it was in December , we have this letter made by Paige Cognetti and all Council members have signed it. This letter and all the other counties around are sending letters in to appeal the ruling of FEMA that we don't qualify . I don't see how we don't qualify . We had enough damage through out the area. So but this letter if anybody wants a copy of it, we could get it to you or, Mr. Voldenberg , if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 would make copies of it if anybody wants that letter. And I believe that is it. And Norma did the food drive for next weekend . It is the -- was it the 4th -- MR. SCHUSTER : It sounded like it was next Saturday . I didn't catch the date from her. Is it next Saturday or two Saturdays ? MR. MCANDREW : The 10th and the 11th. MR. SMURL: 10th and the 11th, okay. So we'll bring that up for her. And I believe that is all. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. Smurl. MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, just one more thing. Can we -- Frank, can you reach out to the administration and just check with the technology department . I know that is something that bothered me when I was superintendent of schools when our website wasn't updated . I mean, those things are important . And when people go there that -- just information who, you know, was in charge of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 department . Like, if there's things in there about the swimming pool and the pool doesn't even exist, like, it should be out there. We haven't had a zoo in years. Like, that's extremely important . So I know, believe me, I understand that the technology department is inundated and overwhelmed . But those are things that I think, you know, the public sees. And it's important that it's up to date. So maybe if they could put somebody on that to just go through department by department on our website to make sure everything in there is accurate as far as who the employees are, as far as what services are offered, as far as just the information . I think that's critical . And it speaks a lot about our city if we have old antiquated information in there. So if you could do that. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll reach out to the director . MR. KING: Appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – RATIFYING THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 EXECUTION OF A TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION EASEMENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF SCRANTON AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO COMPLETE THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (“FEMA”) PROJECTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEMA DEBRIS REMOVAL CONSTRUCTION PLANS, WHICH ARE TO BE COMPLETED BY THE DEADLINE OF OCTOBER 31, 2024. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , let me just find a quick date here. My question is in regards to the deadline of the 2018 FEMA eligible projects . So the deadline we did get an extension on that deadline to 12/31 of '23. And we did get some legislation that was requesting that we fast track those process and fast track those project s because of that 12/31/23 deadline . I know I've asked these same questions before, Frank, and I'm going to ask them again. How many of the project s were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 there in total, how many of the project s have been competed , and how many are pending ? And then when it comes to the deadline , did we get an extension on our deadline because I do see right in the title it says October 21st of '24. So I would imagine we got a deadline on that. But Council has not been updated that we didn't complete the project s by December and we've got another extension on. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? And, Tom, I did ask on that. And we did get an extension on that because of the September flooding . We did get an extension on that one because we weren't allowed to get in there at the time. And so this is the bridge down behind the University of Scranton , the complex -- the sports complex , yeah, so that is the one. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, back when we had the flooding , some of the first project s that were done with the September 9th flooding were these FEMA project s from 2018 dredging the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 creeks in Keyser Valley. So it kind of appeared that the city was reacting to the flooding. However , these were projects that were dating back to 2018. They just happen to coincide with a few days after the flooding or maybe the flooding possibly fast tracked them. So with that being said -- you just -- I'm trying to think of -- MR. SMURL: The date? The extension date. MR. SCHUSTER : So what did you just say, Mr. Smurl? MR. SMURL: The flood project from 2018 weren't -- the ones that weren't completed we refiled for an extension because of the September 9th flooding. So then we are now into -- I think it's October , 2024. I did read it, but I don't remember the exact date. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Yeah, there was some question s that came to mind when you had said what you said. But I'll remember it soon and I'll get it over to Frank. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH NORTHEAST INSPECTION CONSULTANTS , LLC (“NEIC”) FOR THIRD-PARTY U.C.C. ENFORCEMENT SERVICES . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , with 5-C can we just reach out to the administration to see how they -- how they felt with the quality of the company 's work, any limitation s that we saw and if they have been addressed in this new agreement ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 MR. SMURL: Okay. And, Tom, I had also asked on that how many bids there were and stuff. It is on the public website , two bids and NEIC was actually the same price as they were last time. So they were significant ly lower. And I didn't hear any problem with NEIC. So anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D.

MR. SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? ATTY. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I mentioned this when we had the hearing a couple weeks ago. But I was sad to see Adezzo go from this location . But I am glad to hear that there is going to be another use for it. I believe the paper reported that it would be a wine bar and that is not something that we really have in our downtown area. So it's always good to see new types of businesses coming in. And so I'm in favor of approving this liquor license transfer . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-B legally and lawfully adopted . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, can I make a correction ? Back on 7-A you had read that you declared Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . I think what you meant to say was that 7-A resolution has failed, zero to five. So the resolution failed. MR. SMURL: I stand corrected . Yes. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : EIGHTH ORDER. 8-A. Resolution No. 6, 2024. MR.
