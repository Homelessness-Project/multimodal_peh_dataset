Inthelimited spacewehadwhenthepolice department leftwewereabletogivevarious departments sections ofthebasement . Unfortunately ,withtheCivilWar Museum intwoofthelargest andbestrooms downtherewearelimited inourspace. Now,theissueoftheCivilWarMuseum in thebasement ontheprevious administration allowed themwhenthatbecame vacated to givethema10-yearlease.Now,Idon't1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 knowaboutyou,butIreally don'thearof ten-yearleases inanyevent,especially a ten-yearleasefornothing . I'mnothere,andletmemakethis veryclear,nooneisdisputing thegoodof thatmuseum.Museums aregreat,the artifacts aregreat,andit'sworthwalking through ,butlastIchecked thefrontof thisbuilding says"Municipal ,"not "Museum."

Whyarewegiving spaceina municipal building ,andanorganization is great,itis,but10years.Weneedthis forthegovernment .Thisisourbuilding . Second ofall,Mr.Wechsler said, "Thisiswherethisshould beincityhall building .Wewanttomakesurethatthe stakes herebecome thetreasure troveofthe city." It'sindisputable it'sagood organization ,what'sindispute isourlaw department can'tarchive andhaveallof thesedocuments ,andweknowthereismore lawsuits coming,iftheycan'torganize this1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 inasystematic waythat'snotfair.

MR.ROGAN:Yes,acouple ofitems. First,Iwanttocongratulate allofWest Scranton ,particularly Shamrock Construction fororganizing agreateventforthekids overinWestSide.Theyhadafirstannual trickertreatonMainAvenueanditwasfrom Ibelieve 3to5.Itwasadaytime event1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 andfromfriends ofminethattooktheir kidsthereittook20minutes towalkhalfa cityblockbecause thereweresomanypeople participating andallofourbusinesses on MainAvenueinWestSideparticipated soI wanttogiveashoutouttoallofthem,and especially toShamrockConstruction because theyweretheonesthatreally gottheball rolling andorganized thisevent. Next,isitwasbrought uptothe podium soI'mgoingtoaddress itbriefly , I'msureCouncilman Evanswillbetalking aboutthisalittle bitmore,isthe reassessment .Forthosewhohaven'tread thepaper,thereassessment ballot question currently isinvalid.Asweknow,the election isinafewdays.Please keepup onthenewsregarding thisballot question because thecounty didappeal,sothat question maycount.SoIwouldencourage everyone tostillvotetheirconscience on thatquestion .Please don'tskipit,just because oneCourtsaidthatitwasinvalid theymaydecideaslateasMonday,theday before theelection ,whether thatquestion1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 isgoingtocountornot.Soonecourt ruling shouldn'tdiscourage everyone from filling thatportion oftheballot out, definitely stillfillthatout. Ihadacouple ofmeetings thisweek thatwereveryencouraging withtwo developers ,I'mnotgoingtomention themby name,butmyself andMr.Evansdidhave conversations aboutitaswell,andthey weredowntown developers primarily ,butour discussions focused ondeveloping inthe neighbor hoods.SoI'mveryoptimistic that thereisgoingtobesomegoodprojects coming aheadverysoonfromtwo well-respected developers within ourcity. Wedidreceive correspondence from OECDregarding theVeterans memorial project thatwasdiscussed .It'salengthy reply fromHUD.Weareawaiting untilthebudget isreleased .Therehasbeentalkthatthe citywillbefunding someofthisproject through thegeneral fundsoatthispointwe willhavetomakeadecision weighing out thebudget aswellastheOECDActionPlan. And,finally ,somegoodnewsonthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 double pension front,andIcan'tfindthe order,hereitis.Asyouknow,council madeamotion manymonths agotoinvestigate thedouble pension scandal thathasbeen talked aboutforafewyearsnow.Soweput in--wenttoCourt,Iwastherewith Attorney Minora andthereweresubsequent backandforthwiththestatepolice and whatAttorney Minora advisedustodaywasa draftorderthatwillrelease the information fromthatinvestigation tous. Thereareanumber ofstipulations inhere, muchofitisinlegallanguage ,soatthis pointintimeI'llturnitovertoattorney Minora todiscuss thisfurther . MR.MINORA:Yes.Ireceived a draftoftheproposed orderfromthe attorney forthePennsylvania StatePolice. AsIthinkImentioned acouple oftimesin thepast,criminal records aresubject to theCriminal History Records andInformation Actoffered referred toasCHRIA.That information isconfidential andcanbe released byapolice agency except inthe limited circumstances .Wepetitioned1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Commonwealth PleasCourttoallowusto review theinvestigation intothedouble pension matter andIwasabletoworkouta compromise inorderforustoreview this document ordocuments thatareordinarily confidential ,sotheorderallows for council toreview everything ,butthatit remain confidential andthatanydocument thatareshowntocouncil wouldbeusedfor thesolepurpose ofproposing legislation whichwouldpreclude orlessenthe possibility ofasimilar double pension problem inthefuture.Thereiscertain stipulations astoit'suse,howwecan-- wecan'treally disclose anyofit publically butwecanuseitforthatsame purpose .IwillhaveJudgeMoylereview it andhopefully signtheorderandatwhich timewewillbeabletogetsomerecords fromthePennsylvania StatePolice. MR.ROGAN:Thankyou,Attorney Minora.Thankyouforallyourhardworkon this.Iknowwehavebeenonthephone everyotherdaysincethissubpoena started , andwhileI'mveryhappythatcouncil will1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 begetting thisinformation toreview,Iam stilldisappointed thatitwon'tbereleased tothepublic.Youknow,afterreviewing it thereisitemsintherethatwefeelneedto beaddressed wecanreview it,formulate legislation tostopitsoadouble pension scandal likethisneverhappens again. Atthatpoint,ifthereisother information inthereIthinkweshould take astepfurther andworkongetting it released tothepublic,butIdothinkthis isanother goodstepandsomething that, unfortunately ,istaking alotlonger than weplanned ,butIamhappytohavethedraft orderheretodayandI'mhoping wewillbe reviewing thesedocument within thenext couple ofweeks.That'sallIhave.Thank you. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Rogan. Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:And,yes,Councilman Rogan,Iwillbetalking aboutreassessment MR.ROGAN:Iassumed . MR.WECHSLER :I'mshocked . MR.EVANS:Shocking .Thelastbit1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 attheapplebefore theelection ,butfirst ofallIwanttothankMr.VolpeandMr. Eckleforstepping upandmaking thiscase toinvalidate thereassessment question .I hopeitstands.ButIalsowouldliketo askthevoters tostillconsider a"yes" voteonthequestion eventhough theresults won'tcountatthispoint.It'svery important tosendthismessagetothe commissioners thatourultimate objective is stilltaxfairness andthemajority feels thatway.Andyousimply wantthose entrusted withtheresponsibility toaccept thatistherejobandallforreassessment immediately . Iwouldliketocomment brieflyon theprepared statement bytwoofthe commissioners onrejection oftheballot question ,CountyChiefofStaffAndrew Wallace onthebehalf ofthetwo commissioners ,notevenNotarianni ,stated thefollowing .Inpartitsaid,"TheCourt recentlysidedwithtwomillion aire petitioners intheirapparent questto disenfranchise thevoters ofLackawanna1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 County.Ifindthatcomment tobeextremely ironic because ifthereisagroupthat doesn'twantareassessment itwouldbethe welloffandthewellconnected andanyone elsethathsalargeproperty holdings in thecounty.Thelackofreassessment , unlike thecommissioners static and unsupportive lineofwerejustprotecting theseniors willactually continue to protect thewellconnected whothrough nearly 50yearsappealsmostlikely have theirassessments rightwheretheywantthem tobeandbecause ofthatit'stheseniors andeverybody elsewhoarepaying forthose productions . Andasfarasdisenfranchising the voters,thathappened longagowhenitwas decidedtopassthereassessment bucktothe voters todecide,manyofwhomaren'teven property owners.Itisnotthe responsibility ofthevoters todecide for thecommissioners ,itistheir responsibility toprovide fortaxfairness . Asdocument edbetween 2014and2016, successful appeals havereducedthecounty1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 taxbaseby44.4million .Thatequates to realtaxdollars lost.Growth thathasbeen wipedout.Moneythatcouldhavehelped balance budgetsandminimize oreliminate taxincreases formunicipalities ,school districts and,yes,eventhecounty and thereisnoendinsightwithout a reassessment .Thestatus quoofabroken system thatsimply isnotworking and totally unfair toproperty owners, government entities ,anddevelopers .Itis almost mindboggling atthispointthatsome localofficials couldbeagainst a reassessment . Iapplaud mycolleagues fornot wavering onthisissueforonesecond and beingearlysupporters ofreassessment .So wheredidwegofromhere?Ofcourse,I wouldhavehopedbynowthatthetwo commissioner ,oratleastone,wouldhave listened totheoverwhelming evidence that Lackawanna County needsareassessment ,and theywouldfinally stoptheproverbial kicking ofthecandowntheroadandbegin thenecessary stepstowardsreassessment ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 butIwon'tholdmybreath onthat. Weallknowthatthemayoral election isnextTuesday ,sonextThursday , twodaysaftertheelection ,Iwillmakea formalmotion andrequest tothenewmayor electorthecurrent mayor,dependingonthe outcome ,andthisissomething Ihavebeen support iveofforalmost threeyears,the motion willbequitesimply thattheCityof Scranton shallinitiate alawsuit in Lackawanna County Courttoforcea reassessment .It'stimetogetoffthe sidelinesandgetinthegam.That'sallI havetonight .

I'mnotsureifthecityisgoingtosubmit aproposal,butIwouldliketoaskthe administration iftheyplanonit.Ifnot, Iwouldrecommend theydo.Ithinkthatis averygoodprogram . ThelastthingIthatIhaveis regarding theCivilWarMuseum,whichhas beenbrought upforquiteafewweeksnow andIhavebeenamajorproponent ofthe museum,asIhavementioned .Mr.O'Hora, whoisthemaintenance manincityhallgot upandspoketonight andIappreciate his concern andhiscomments .Iwillsayafew things abouthiscomments .Number one,I don'tknow,thisisnotapolitical football1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 soI'mnotsurewhatheisreferring towhen hesaysthat.Thisisavery,inmy opinion ,simple issue.Themuseum hasbeen therefor10years.Ibelieve itserves the community verywellandIthinkthatthey should staythere.Theadministration and themayorobviously feeldifferently ,butI wanttotakeasecond justtoexplainmy thought process here. Mr.O'Horasaidthatinfrontof cityhallitsays"Municipal "not"Museum". Whatabackwards wayofthinking about government ingeneral ,aboutthisbuilding . Wehaveagreatopportunity ,actually the unique opportunity inmyopinion tokeepa museum andtokeepmanyoftheveterans who arecoordinating thisthingandhavebeen foranumber ofdifferent yearswiththeGAR working downthereforthecommunity .We should embrace ourhistory .Weshould embrace allofthepeople fromthisareawho losttheirlivesintheCivilwarand embrace theveterans whoareworking down there,andIcan'timagine thatwewould passtheopportunity tokeepamuseum that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 honors theCivilWarandhassomany unbelievable artifactsandreplace itwith fourorfiveroomfullsofboxes.Whowants toseethat?I'mnotsureintheyear2017 thattherehastobeanother waytofind roomforstorage forboxesintheLaw Department orinDPWorwherever elsein thisbuilding .I'msurethatwecanlookto othercities across thecountry orthestate forthatmatter tofindthat. So,again,Ithinkit'sthis mentality ofthat'sthewayit'salways been done,wehavetocontinue todoit.Wehave boxesfullofpaper,wehavetosendthe museum ontheirway.Evenifwearegiving themayearlesseventually theyaregoing tobeaskedtogo,andthat'sfinebecause I understand thatthereistwodifferent trains ofthought here.AllI'msaying is let'susethisasanopportunity toembrace orhistory ,toembracetheuniqueness of actually having aCivilWarMuseum inthe basement ofourmunicipal bidding ,which actually ifyouknowthehistory ofthis building really ismuseum inandofitself.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 Ithinkwecanuseit,thecitycan promote itmore.Wecanworkevenmore closely withtheGARandwithlocalhigh schools andourlocaluniversities and colleges .SonextweekIplanonmaking a motion toamendthislegislation ,5-B,to extend theleasetofiveyears.TenyearI canunderstand maybeabitofastretch , butatleastgivethegentlemen downthere andthemuseum somerelief knowing thatthey haveaplacetostayandthatwearegoing tohonorthemuseum andtakethisnextyear, ifthat'swhatitendsupbeing,finding someplace elsetostorethesefiles.And that'sallIhaveforthisweek.Thankyou. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou, Mr.Gaughan .Justafollow-upon Mr.Gaughan 'scomments ,Iwouldnotliketo taketheopportunity tocriticize Mr.O'Hora.Hehasaresponsibility inhis jobandwecriticize alotofcityemployees fornotdoingtheirjobandMr.O'Horahas beendoingwhathehasbeencharged todo. Thestorage ofrecordsisnotsomething that hejustdecidedtodo.Thestorage ofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 records isrequired bytheCityCode, federal regulations ,stateregulations ,so instead ofcriticizing himIwouldliketo compliment himonhisduediligence tomake surethattheimportance ofhisjobin maintaining therecords thatarerequired . Ididmeetwiththepeople fromthe CivilWarMuseum theotherdayandIagree thatthemuseum should stayhere.Ithink it'ssettled ,it'sinaspotwhereit's accessible tothestudents ,accessible to thepublicandIthinkactually thisdebate thatwe'vehadhasreally awokenalotof people inthecitytothefactthatthat museum isthere.Ispoketosomeone last nightwhoisverywell-knowninthe community whosaidheneverknewthatthat placewasthere,andthisisperson who worksindowntown Scranton andisvery visible andeverybody knowshisnameifI toldyou.SoIdothinkwehavetotakethe opportunity toprotect themuseum andlook atitasanassetinstead ofadetriment . Mr.Rogandidmention theSerrenti Center,Iagreewithhimthatwouldbea1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 goodspot,evennotintheSerrenti Center itself thereisalotoflandupthere,this issomething thatwehavetogetahandle on that'sjustasimportant asthemuseum and thestorage ofrecords .Wecameinto council in2014andtherewasawaterleak thathadreally saturated alotoftheold records fromthecityandtheyweregoingto bediscarded ,whichyoucan'tdo,sowewere ableworking forMr.O'Hora,hegotthe records digitized ,savedtheonesthatwe couldandthat'saresource thatwehave ongoing backwards soIagreewiththe one-yearlease,theone-yearleasecanbe extended nextyearatanytime.Thereason whyIlikeaone-yearleaseisitforces the citytotakecareofthemuseum andfinda repository fortherecords .Ibelieve ifwe gotoalonger leasethanthatIthinkthis thingwilljustkeepgetting pushed downand pushed downandpushed downtheroad,soI support theone-yearlease,Idonotsupport alonger leaseatthistime,butIdothink it'sveryimportant thatthisconversation hasgotten outintothepublic,it'stime1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 forthepublic toactually speakupforthe people thatuseitandusethisopportunity totakeadvantage ofthisgreatassetthat wehavehere. LastweekItalked aboutgetting a copyoftheAmazon presentation thatwas madebyPennsNortheast .Ididreceive a copyofthat,it'squitelengthy ,soif anybody wantstoperuse thatitisinthe council office. ThisweekIattended thePEL meeting ,talking aboutsomeofthe improvements andsomeoftheefforts that havebeenmadeoverthepastcouple ofyears togetusintoalittle bitofafinancial better position .Oneofthethings thathas beenagreatimprovement isourworkmen 's compensation accident claims statistics .In 2015,thecitypaid$2.3million in workmen 'scompensation ,wagelossand medical costs.Thisdoesnotinclude the heartandlungthatwerepaid.In2016,the amount paidoutdecreased to$1.49million , andthisisthenumber thatyouhaveto really payattention to,andfor20171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 through theendofSeptember thattotal amount paidoutisnowdownto$228500. About$2million lessthanwhenwecamein office in2015.Thisdecline claims tobe attributed tovarious initiatives enacted by theadministration andcouncil toinclude hiring afull-timeworker'scompensation coordinator ,increased claims monitoring , thedevelopment ofasafety committee , increased heartandlungarbitration panels, itincreased fromsixtimesperyearinstead oftwice,andthecreation ofalight-duty policy withthepolice department aswellas thenegotiations thatcreate light-duty policies within theDPWandthefire department . Sotheworkthatwehavestarted ,a lotofthiscameoutofthecontracts that wereawarded thatareabenefit tothecity. Atthistime,wehavebeenworking withour unions andreducing costsintermsof compensation anddisability .Wehaveaways togo.TheSafetyCommittee hasbeena greatedition toourcity.Thestatehas recognized itasagoodandfunctioning1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 safety committee sothisisoneofthe improvements thathasbeengoingonoverthe pastcouple ofyears.Andthat'sallI have. MR.GAUGHAN :Ijustwantmakeone point,ifImay.Ijustwanttorespond to Mr.Wechsler forasecond whenhesaidthat Iwascriticizing Mr.O'Hora.That'sjust nottrue.Iwasnotcriticizing Mr.O'Hora Iwasdisagreeing withhim.Ihavespoken toMr.O'Horabefore onthetelephone about thisissueandheknowsthatIdisagree with him,butIasnotcriticizing himatall. Thereisamajordifference between criticizing somebody anddisagreeing with them. AllI'msaying isIthinkthatwe should startthinking outside ofthebox, literally andfiguratively incasewith boxesofpaper.Sowhensomething people arelooking atthebasement andsaying let's fillitwithboxesofpaperthatprobably nobody isgoingtolookeverornoone really caresabout,whatI'msaying isthink ofcapitalizing ontheunique opportunity of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 having amuseum withhundreds ofyearsworth ofhistoryandusingitasaspringboardfor people inthiscommunity tolearnabout theirhistoryandtotakeatourofthis municipal building ,whichasIsaidearlier , really couldbeconsidered amuseum.There isalotofthings thatwentonhereover thelastfewdecades .
