MR. DONAHUE : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community . Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Present . Let's make sure he's on just to make there -- Mr. King, are you there? MR. KING: Can you hear me? Yes. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Okay. Yeah, now we can hear Mr. King. So Mr. King has a work conflict . He's going to be participating via telephone . Just to keep everyone aware that if at any time we can't hear Mr. King, he will have to be marked absent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 and won't be able to vote.

MEMORANDUM FROM CITY SOLICITOR JESSICA ESKRA DATED JANUARY 31, 2022 TO CITY COUNCIL SOLICITOR SEAN GALLAGHER REGARDING CITY APPOINTMENTS . 3-B. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY SPECIAL MEETING HELD MARCH 3, 2021. 3-C. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON REDEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY REGULAR MEETING HELD JANUARY 5, 2022. 3-D. CORRESPONDENCE DATED FEBRUARY 7, 2022 RECEIVED FROM CITY COUNCIL SOLICITOR SEAN GALLAGHER TO CITY SOLICITOR JESSICA ESKRA REGARDING CITY APPOINTMENTS . MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'd like to say thank you, Solicitor Gallagher , for your letter and response to the one we got from Solicitor Eskra. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 And I strongly support your interpretation of what our role is on Council . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to say that, you know, we are trying to work out an agreement with the administration on this issue. You know, we don't know what that's going to look like. We're giving them some time to review Solicitor Gallagher 's response to the letter we received last week. I'm hoping we could come to an equitable agreement because I'd rather not have this fight. I'd rather concentrate on things that are of more importance to the resident s of the City. Anyone else? MS. SCHUSTER : I guess at this time I'd also like to say I support Mr. McAndrew and Mr. Donahue on this. Although we might not -- we may want to move forward with City business , I think this is a fight to have. Taxpayer money does fund these positions . Council does have oversight to review the resumes. And I think in the sake of transparency , Council should get these resumes so they are in public view for the citizens in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 order to make sure we have the most qualified candidate s for these positions . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I have an announcement . So the Licensing , Permits and Inspections Department has receive d complaint s that not everyone has received renewal forms for those whose licenses expired at the end of 2021. The renewal forms were mailed out back in December . So if you did not receive a renewal form, please reach out to the LIPS Department . They could be contact ed at 570-348-4193 or you could e-mail them at LPIAF@scrantonpa .gov for all licenses and renewal s. And then contractor s have until March 31st to renew their license . And one other thing I want to mention , I thought the Ice Festival was very well done this year. I was happy to see that they had it for their second year. And I had gotten a chance to go down and I thought the ice sculptures were beautiful . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 I loved the Olympic theme. I thought it was very fitting . And it was great to see so many businesses involved in it even though it was a pretty cold weekend for it. But it was good for the ice. That's it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . Any update on the status of the 2020 audit? MR. DONAHUE : We did get an update yesterday that they received the Sewer Authority audit last week and that we would have it in the next couple weeks. That was the extent of the update. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I would request that when we contract for -- or I assume that Kohanski is doing the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : They're on contract to do it. We do have to put a request for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 proposal s -- qualifications out for next year's audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. But for the 2021 audit, I think it would be useful if you would put in Third Order the engagement letter, which would tell the public the basic parameters of the audit including when Kohanski expects to give you a deliverable . Now, previous Council meetings I heard the date 30, September thrown out. And we've long past that date. So I'd like to know if they're doing the 2021 audit when they expect to turn that one in. There should be no surprises on their behalf because they know exactly where the bottlenecks are. Any update on the labor negotiations , the contracts still in negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : They're still negotiating . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. One thing, when I downloaded the agenda and printed out 3-A which is Jessica Eskra's January 31st memorandum to Council , I only got the first page. Were there additional pages in that memorandum ? Was it just one page, no signature 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 block or anything ? MR. DONAHUE : It was just one -- nope. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, just curious . I rarely seen that kind of thing. With regard to the recent ice storm, I've got some mixed feeling s on that. It was unfortunate that it hit on a Friday because that means that a lot of businesses are closed on Saturday and Sunday. So they left their sidewalks unsalted, okay. I live downtown . I'm a pedestrian . And I have to do a lot of walking as do other people who live downtown in the high rises. You'd be surprised at the number of people, you know, either they're going to church over the weekend or they're going to Rite Aid to fill a prescription out, whatever . They frequently have to get in and about. Many businesses were very good. They salted as soon as the sleeting stopped on Friday afternoon . So it didn't take a whole lot to at least make it passable and safe. For those who waited until Monday or did nothing at all, shame, shame, shame, you know, because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 it's very dangerous , especially for many of the elderly resident s downtown. It's my understand ing that ordinance s exist requiring business es to clean up after a storm within 48 hours. And I think we should be looking to enforce that. You know, I mean, that is a safety issue. And I think, you know, Council woman Rothchild , isn't that your area of public safety? Or it's yours, sorry. But it's a safety issue. And since we have an ordinance that addresses that, maybe there should be some spot enforcement which is also -- is that me? MR. DONAHUE : No. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. Are we haunted or something ? The ghost of City Hall. MR. DONAHUE : I apologize . MS. HODOWANITZ : But at any rate, also cars, should cars have been told to park elsewhere for the 24 hours afterward s so that DPW could do more efficient cleaning and salting of the streets ? 100 block of Penn Avenue one way, and all they were able to do because of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 parked cars was one narrow path in the middle of the street. And that's where I walked when I went to mass every morning , right down the middle of the street. So I think DPW did a very good job considering the constraints . But if we've got ordinances telling people to salt their sidewalks , move their cars, we need to start enforcing that because it is a safety issue. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka , Members of Council , first thing is regarding the Mayor and operations . We have looked at beforehand that the Mayor has put out the proclamations for COVID and shut places down. And I've always questioned that because under the Home Rule Charter , the health regulations are mandated that City Council is the person who is in charge of health regulations . If there is a health emergency , if there is a -- any impact on emergency situations that regard personal safety other than police, City Council is by City Charter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the one who is suppose d to take care of it. Once City Council rules that an emergency is in place, then it is the Mayor's job to execute City Council 's will. So these emergency declarations by the Mayor because of COVID never should have happened independent of City Council because City Council is actually the body who is suppose d to declare these emergencies . And the Mayor's office under her executive authority is the one who is then suppose d to go forward and enforce what Council has put forward . Stepping into that, we have a new health coordinator . During this last emergency we were paying -- last year we were given a grant and a lot of money for a new health coordinator . And during this entire new omicron variation and the shutdown of City Hall, I've heard absolutely no response , no impact from it. I don't know if the hired position for the coordinator was actually ever here because as a member of the public, I saw no communication whatsoever coming from that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 person in the position of health coordinator during a health emergency . Looking forward at the -- at 7-B, once again, we have a situation where they are coming forward and asking to give authorization to look at confidential information and to process confidential information of a person who is already processing confidential information . This is standard of doing everything backwards. We're going to give the -- we're going to give the person the gun, the badge, go out there, do the job and then when there's a problem , then I guess we'll actually have to put them in the police department . Everything in this administration is backwards. I go back to the Fire Chief back when the Mayor increased by fiat the position -- to pay for the position beyond what was put in the budget and by Council without coming back to Council . Again, the IT Director ; when the IT Director was struck down, she put the IT Director into a management position with no director to act as director to directly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 circumvent City Council 's will and authority . Recently , we've had an exclusion for the six month move to Scranton because any employee is suppose d to move here within six months of being employed . Suddenly , that comes in that an exclusion is needed when it shouldn 't have been in the first place because that is part of hiring the job. This administration -- this City Council needs to be forceful for it because there is a pattern of doing what is wanted and demanding forgiveness afterwards . And if a stern step isn't taken forward , there will be no negotiating . There'll be walking over you. And if that comes to be, I do fear that the Home Rule Charter will be rewritten by the citizens if the government cannot fix its own host. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And the first thing I wanted to talk about tonight was the raising of the flag, the Pan American flag at City Hall on Saturday . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 And maybe -- it was a great program . It was about 45 minutes . And maybe because we were all so bundled up with masks and everything , I didn't see anybody . I don't know whether , Jessica, you were there or anyone else. But we were all -- all we could see were eyes because it was so cold. But it was a great ceremony . And I'm glad I braved the cold to be there and all. And DPW did a great job of clearing the steps and the sidewalks and everything . So it was safe for us to walk out there in that particular area. The second thing I wanted to talk about was, I gave each of you the Valentine Day Food Drive that we're going to have at Nay Aug Park, Saturday and Sunday this coming weekend . This is our second time that we've done this. And it's always a tremendous success . So I'm just asking, you know, if anyone -- if you could only bring one box of cereal or one can of soup, you know, just think that's going to feed someone who doesn't have anything that night. Sometimes we get a little bit in our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 own little bubble and we have such a choice of things when we go to eat. But everyone 's not like that. So I always like working with this food bank, this food drive. And the food goes to local churches that have, you know, small pantries in their church. So I just hope everyone could come out and help us with that. That's from 11 a.m. to 3:00 on Saturday and Sunday. It's suppose d to be warm too I think those days. The next thing I want to talk about was just to commend NeighborWorks and the great presentation that I saw tonight on their plans and their project that they were working in West Side. And we've all driven through West Side and gone to Catalano 's, you know, and their great hoagies and things. So it's going to be good to see what they're going to -- the future holds for West Side. But as I was listening, it brought back to mind that we have to drive down to Lackawanna Avenue to get to West Side. That's the only way I know to get there is to drive down Lackawanna Avenue. Maybe we need a project on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Lackawanna Avenue similar to West Side to get Lackawanna Avenue up and going. I'm not even sure, what is it maybe five businesses along there? I know the train -- the hoagie shop. I don't know. There's a couple along there. But they need some help there too to drive to Lackawanna Avenue to get to West Side. So it's going to be beautiful over there in West Side and then to go through Lackawanna Avenue. And I'm thinking about in front of the Radison Hotel. And I know that we had that discussion before and there was some money that was suppose d to be allotted to fix that wall that's been falling down. That now, that's an awful eyesore to the City of Scranton . And that too can be like a gateway to downtown if it could be fixed. So that's what I thought about along with the wonderful presentation that they made and those sort of things came to my mind. That's it for me tonight . Just don't forget the food drive on Saturday and Sunday. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the list is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . I was disappoint ed to read the paper last week. The developer that owed 1716 Linden Street sold that property to the University of Scranton . We want to sell everything to the University . I don't know why that developer did that. But that would have been a good taxpaying property . And now it's just going back to the U and we won't get any taxes from it. But I mean, they're called the Royals up there. I think we treat them like royalty . And that's wrong. Half the City is the University of Scranton now. I don't know why the developer sold that property . He was going to have 42 apartment s and commercial space. That would have brought a lot money into the City. So I don't know why they are selling everything to the University . I talked about this for years. We're losing so much money. I don't know how many properties we lost to them. But it's ridiculous . And while we're talking about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 University , driving up in the Hill Section around where the Jewish Home is, I talked about this a long time ago. I used to work up in that area. Our parking enforcement people use selective enforcement in this City. I complain ed driving that area coming down Vine Street you're taking your life in your own hands. They park right up to the corner. You have to creep out, hope you don't get hit by a car. And people have talked to me and said they park different places and they get tickets . They let these kids get away with murder parking illegal ly. But the taxpaying citizens get picked on are forced to pay fines. It's ridiculous . I got a ticket a few years ago parked on the side of my house because I was facing the wrong way. I wasn't bothering anybody . It wasn't a safety hazard. I was just ready to pull in my driveway but I got sidetracked , came out and I got a ticket. And I told one of the parking enforcement people about that. And I never saw tickets . The one time there was a car in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 exact same spot right up to the corner for three or four days in a row, never had a ticket on it. And I'm told from people that live in that area they never see tickets on the cars. So these parking enforcement people got to do their job. Next thing, I was going by the old CVS on South Main Avenue in Scranton . And I saw an application for -- to sell alcohol . So I guess is that going to be a restaurant or a bar? Does anybody know? MR. DONAHUE : I think I've heard that it might become some sort of like a takeout place. But I don't know if that is actually happening or not. MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, I saw an application for alcohol . I figured it might be a bar or restaurant . MR. MCANDREW : And it's not going to be a restaurant . It's going to appear to be a restaurant . My understand ing is, it's a company that had some problems out in Pittsburgh . It's a company that comes in and just sells beer, kind of like some of the others on Main Avenue.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 And what they're going to be doing is claiming it's a restaurant , maybe have a hoagie or two on the table. But unfortunately because the license is transferred from within the City, it doesn't come before Council . MR. SPINDLER : Okay. I'll finish up here. Does anyone know when the tax bills are going to be sent out? MR. DONAHUE : I believe it's going to be next week. I could address that in Fifth Order too to not take up your time. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. This really isn't City business . But I hope the postmaster is listening. I know we had the ice storm last Friday. But I was able to get around. I drove around the City. No mail. It was the second time this winter we didn't have mail. Whatever happened to the old post office saying of through wind and ice and sleet and rain? I guess they don't want to get wet anymore or whatever . They don't go by that motto anymore. And lastly, I wasn't here since December and I brought up about an abandoned car on Madison Avenue. It's gone finally . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 saw it there last week. And I went by today and it was gone so finally got it off the street. All right. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I would appreciate if you have the answers if you hold them and do them in Fifth Order because I have quite a few I think you'll have the answers to. And Fay Franus called me before I left the house and asked if I would thank DPW for the wonderful job that they did in that nasty ice storm. We haven't had one like that in quite a while. And I know East Mountain was very well done, except I did feel sorry for Roaring Brook because I think it's going to go from fresh water to salt water. There was so much needed. Now, back to the Home Rule Charter . I think that one of the reasons for going over this document which is over 20 years old is to be able to change things like and A and D would not have happened if this -- if you had a Home 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Rule Charter because it could have been specified better if that was a problem . Also on the audit, you could specify that all authorities use the same fiscal year as the City and that would do away with a late audit all the time. And until that happens , it's going to happen. And then, how long do we wait for a contract with the police and firefighters until we go to arbitration ? Is there some -- is there something that's specific or do we just sit back and wait until we hear something else? Then PEL, they used to provide some items. One of my favorites was the cash flow chart. And I would like to know who is doing the cash flow chart now that PEL is not around and what other items because somebody up there -- I think maybe Kyle went to the meeting s. And he knows what they provided . And I would like to see a list of those and who's doing it now or has it been given up? And on the -- on the OECD and the treasury -- Treasurer 's Office used to both be on the Land Bank. Has that changed ? Did we lose a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 position on the Land Bank or -- and then did we have one or two city engineers ? I recall last fall or maybe closer to the end of the year you all approved a Reilly for -- to be the City engineer . And but I saw somebody in the paper where our former engineer was there. And I would like to know if we now have two. I don't see two in the budget though. And if this Reilly has any affiliation with the one that would be making decisions on where work goes if that's the same Reilly. And when are we going to get an update on the Serrenti project ? It's been very, very quiet and same with the stormwater issue on Keyser Valley. That was one place that something was actually getting done. And I did see something in the paper. I believe it was yesterday that the Keyser Avenue Community Center is putting out a request for stormwater improvements . And I thought that was a City project . But I guess it doesn't matter as long as it gets done. But it would be nice if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 somebody could come and tell us -- I don't know, who has the stormwater on the -- I guess it's a DPW thing? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, that's Mr. King. MS. SCHUMACHER : Who -- which of you up there have -- MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King. Mr. King is the DPW Chair. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then when do we expect to see the survey of what the City members want out of the rescue money as opposed to instead of putting just prioritizing what the administration wants to do? Do we have a date for that? And then it's February . And is that not the month that we get the new acoustics ? I'm out of time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Here I am, Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Okay, I picked up a recycle card. And I never noticed it on mine. But -- or if that's a new one. It said that the electronics are April 2nd, okay. Hopefully we could stay all day. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 And I have a little recommendation there. If you could -- if you're going to require people to pay something on it -- certain items, have a credit card scanner there that you could hand them a bill and it would be helpful , you know, so you're not sitting there writing a check or some stupid stuff like that. And once again, we need a very, very strict emphasis on cardboard . So try and take my recommendation seriously . Leave it behind if they're not going to recycle . Once again, the tax exemptions came up. And we need either for the state to replace some of this money for tax exempts , which is totally disproportionate on this City or we just need to make an ordinance , please no more. Don't come here. You know, find somewhere else to go. That's all there is to it. You know, it's going to be 40 percent by the time this is said and done with a very short amount of time. We're at 36 now. And we have two whole City blocks here and there and everywhere . And it's not going to work. People can lose their home. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 My escrow was higher than a principal and interest right now. So, you know, some day it would really stink to have it just about paid off and be walking out of it. Some good news Saturday , if you want to call it that. We're going to be represented probably in South Side by Mario Scavello . Well, I hope that they know that as far as I'm concerned , our household is concerned , it will be an honor to vote against him with that redistricting scam. It's totally ridiculous . It's totally out of hand. Hopefully the courts will see it differently . And they also had a mid-court judge determine that drop boxes are unconstitutional in Pennsylvania . It's, like, gee, thanks. The quality of life was up. And please just go easy on people -- the lady next door to me years back walked away from her home over that quality of life. Now I have people in and out of there, some good, some bad over three or four years. And it's being rented out for is $1,300 a month with very little external improvements , $1,300 a month. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 That's two and a half times my mortgage . I bought a fixer upper. But -- and put work into myself. But -- and we're now at 900,000 people -- 900,000 people dead from COVID. People are calling it an endemic . Well, guess what, my health insurance went up on the government side 16 percent this year. Well, how many little 16 percents before my Social Security raise is just eaten right up. I should have asked this question a long time ago because it popped into my head a long time ago. What will COVID do for insurance ? So in other words, if you don't want to get vaccinated or you think that there's a microprocessor chip that's going to have the KGB following you, please stay the hell away from me, don't come to my door. You know, don't bother me, just go find somewhere else to go. We should actually have vaccination nights at restaurant too. That would be a good idea to raise some funds, only vaccination cards allowed. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Mr. Dobrzyn . Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. SCHUSTER : Just a couple comment s in regard to Miss Schumacher 's question about the Keyser Valley Community Center. They applied for their own grant. And they're starting to put some of that work out to bid after they got some of the -- I think they needed some soil samples , things like that to comply with some of the state and city codes. So I'm happy to see that some of that work has gone out or is starting to go out. I did get a citizen complaint about -- which I'll give to Mr. Voldenberg , a home on the corner of Elizabeth Street and North Garfield Avenue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 They have a fence down. It's been across the sidewalk for several weeks now and I've gotten multiple complaint s about it. Also, I had a citizen 's request for a streetlight , which I e-mailed you earlier on the corner of Birch Street and South Washington . So we'll go through the process of looking into that. Also, the last one is, can we send correspondence and look into an update for the garage demolition that was done going back a week and a half so. I don't know if there is any more work that needs to be done in the area or if it's all completed . But if we can just get a response from the administration as to where we're at with that project . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have several and just to respond to Councilman Schuster who just asked about the garage demo, I did receive some information today that there were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 blockage s at the top and the bottom of stream, significant blockages . And so it is certainly going to be requiring some more work to resolve that issue. So at least we've got one step down in the process . But I definitely think we'll be receiving some more details on where that's at and what additional work needs to be done. I wanted to bring up something that I think over the past two weeks that a few citizens had mentioned with regards to the survey for the economic strategic development plan. There are a number of issues brought up I think with the development and rollout of that survey and maybe some areas that people felt like were left off of that survey that would be important to them that they would like to see included. So there won't be any additional surveys because that money needs to be used by a certain period of time. But we will be having forthcoming in our caucus here on February 22nd -- but what I would like to do is to get some additional input from residents . So if there was something on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 survey that you felt like should have been there or should have been asked or additional concerns , then you can put that in writing . You could e-mail that information to Mr. Voldenberg or myself or both of us. His e-mail is Fvoldenberg @scrantonpa .gov. And mine is Jrothchild @scrantonpa .gov. And I will make sure that that input gets sent along to the Fourth Economy and prior to them coming in for that so that that could be incorporated into their plan is that everyone is heard. And a few other things that I had responses to. We did receive an e-mail complaint today regarding castle house, which I believe we've gotten a lot of complaint s and there have been issues with over the years. I don't have the exact address of that. But I would like to find out what's going on with that property if we can get an update. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could ask about that I'll forward along the e-mail to you with their pictures with the -- just asking about the status of the house if it's on the demo list, if it's condemned , what's happening 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 there. And then Miss Hodowanitz did bring up the importance of snow removal. And there was an article in the paper over the weekend just notifying resident s, reminding them of the ordinance that we have in place as a city requiring them to remove snow or ice from their property from the sidewalks within a 48-hour period or they may risk being fined. But I just ask that people do that just to look out for your fellow neighbors and for other people in the city. I know that my neighborhood is really poorly cleared and as was downtown when I had gone there over the weekend and trying to push a stroller through the ice and slush. That was a little difficult to do, not only that but as a PT, I can't tell you how many patient s I see every winter and even throughout the year who have fallen or slipped on ice. It's like every day is someone tells me that that happened to them and people of all ages. And you could get serious ly injured in that way. And I'd hate to see that happening 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 to people and to neighbors . So just please be respectful of others and make sure that you clear the way. If, you know, say you're an older person or you're having trouble or you don't have the equipment to do it, find out if you can ask a neighbor to help you along. I know that's something I've always been willing to do. And I think that any other good neighbor would also do. So a couple other quick things here, but for the health coordinator , I do believe she provides plenty of input to the Mayor and with regards to COVID-19 pandemic , I know that we haven't specifically seen correspondence s from her to Council or to publically. I think that the administration makes those announcements coming from the administration and not specifically from her. But if it would be helpful , maybe we can get more of an update from her on how things are going with that -- that position and the work that -- that she's been doing. I think that may be helpful for Council and the public if all Council members are in agreement . And the Pan African flag raising was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 this weekend . And I was unfortunately not able to go. I couldn't take the baby out in the frigid cold on Saturday unfortunately . But I'm glad that it went well. It was a nice ceremony . And I believe that's everything that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, two. Excuse me, so, first of all, Mrs. Hodowanitz brought up a good point about timely protocol for downtown. Mr. Voldenberg , with regards to moving cars, you know, before a storm, before an ice storm or before a snowstorm , can you reach out to the appropriate departments and provide us with the information or the protocol for moving cars before a snowstorm ? I know there's something on the books. But I need clarity . And I'm sure Mrs. Hodowanitz does too. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And secondly, it's National School Counselor week. I'm going to read a little proclamation . I read it last year. I'm going to read it again. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 And this is to go out to all the school counselors in our area, but especially two that I work with, Mrs. Ann Jordan and Miss Nicole Getano. I've seen first hand the hard work that they do and especially the past two years with the pandemic dealing with a lot of -- helping student s through a lot of mental health issues. Whereas , School Counselors are employed in public and private schools to help student s reach their full potential ; and Whereas , School Counselors are actively committed to helping student s explore their abilities , strengths , interest s and talents as these traits relate to career awareness and development ; and Whereas , School Counselors help parents focus on ways to future the education , personal social growth of their children ; and Whereas , School Counselors work with teacher s and other educator s to help student s explore their potential and set realistic goals for themselves ; and Whereas , School Counselors seek to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 identify and utilize community resources that could enhance and complement comprehensive school counseling program s and help students become productive members of society . Whereas , comprehensive developmental school counseling program s are considered an integral part of the educational process that enables all student s to achieve success in school. Therefore , I do hereby proclaim February 7 to 11, 2022, as National School Counseling week. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just briefly , thanks Mrs. Jeffries for reminding me about the wall at the Radison . I have to follow up on that. I know that the Radison and the county were working together to figure out where the -- because they were awarded a grant. They were just figuring out on how to distribute that grant. So thank you for reminding me. I'll follow up on that one. Mr. Spindler did ask about the tax bills. Tax bills from my understanding should go out next week. There was a delay because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 the Tax Office relies on the assessor's -- data from the Assessor's Office which switched over their operating system. So the Tax Collector 's Office had to run additional tests to make sure that the information they received was accurate . So that's the reason for the delay. And they should go out next week. In terms -- so -- on some of Miss Schumacher 's comment s just with the Home Rule Charter , I just want to remind you that there is a difference between the Charter and the Administrative Code. You know, to amend the Charter that's a political process for the permission , you know, that comes up with recommendations . But the Code is something that Council and the administration could work together to amend, you know, on our own without that. So and that is something that we are looking to do because I know you've had question s about in the past about the refuse being put into a separate account and so on. That is something that we're aware of and we're working on trying to, you know, get different language to put in there that's actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 accurate with how the City is operating at the moment. In terms of arbitration , I know there is a timeline . I don't have exactly what that timeline is in front of me where certain things have -- they have to meet so many times before it could even go to arbitration . But I will get that information for you. I just don't have it in front of me. You did mention the cash flow chart from PEL. So we are waiting for an award from DCED for a grant to keep PEL on for an additional year to help us with that. There was some paperwork issues there. But I'm hoping that we're able to announce , you know, in the next week or two that we did receive that grant and then PEL will still be able to assist us through this year in terms of the cash flow. I do believe we do have two representatives on the Land Bank. It's the -- the one on our agenda tonight is just because there's a new Treasurer . So I believe it's Eileen Cipriani as OECD Director and then the Treasurer are the City's two represent atives 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 on the Land Bank. There only is one City engineer . I have to look back and see what -- we might have approved Reilly for something else in the fall. But it was formally LaBelle and Associates . And we will now be moving to Reilly and Associates if we pass, you know, the legislation that's on our agenda as the City engineer . We have been trying to schedule a Serrenti Center update. We've had a lot of things we have had to schedule . And we just haven't locked down a date yet. So I'm hopeful that that happens as soon as possible . And then you did bring up a survey for Rescue Act money. So we are going to have a caucus with the administration on how we're going to move forward in terms of the Rescue Plan money. I know the advisors , consultants that we brought on for ARP money, they're putting together -- like, they're finalizing their -- they're finalizing their report on the final rules on how we can spend it and how it's in different boxes. And then for the acoustics , I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 hoping we get that RFP out in the next couple weeks. And I believe that was all. If I missed anything , please let me know and I'll try to answer that as best I could. I was also going to bring up the castle house because I also got that e-mail thing. So, Frank, I think that would best be Tom Oleski and then also Housing Appeals Board. I know Housing Appeals Board has given the owner of that property extensions in the past because there was promises made in terms of that they were going to make the improvement s that needed to be made so that they could pull the condemnation down. But they haven't met any of those deadlines . So that was one thing I was going to bring up too. And I also was going to -- I also -- lastly, I just have -- I did -- I receive d a couple of complaints , you know, regarding DPW -- snow removal with the ice this week. I just want to urge everybody to be patient with DPW. This was a difficult ice storm to manage. I know there was ice buildup on the plows. It was just one of those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 situations where it was, you know, a lot of precipitation came down and then quickly froze. But just to remind everybody that if you do have any issues where you need DPW to come out to call dispatcher and they'll get out as quickly as possible . And also, it's a little harder when it falls on a weekend where they have to call, you know, DPW aren't necessarily required to come in. But, you know, so they have to call workers in. And then also, you know, they're limited in terms of the equipment they have to use in certain situations . So I just ask that they be patient . I know they do a great job. And they try to do the best they can. But if you do have an issue, just call -- please call the dispatcher -- the DPW dispatcher . And they'll send somebody out as quickly as possible . And that's all I have for tonight . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF THOMAS F. CARROLL , 1610 SCHLAGER STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18504, TO THE POSITION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE FOR THE CITY OF1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 SCRANTON EFFECTIVE JANUARY 25, 2022.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF MEGHAN RADE, 1080 MEADE AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18508, TO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE LACKAWANNA COUNTY LAND BANK. MS. RADE WILL BE REPLACING MARY JO SHERIDAN . THE TERM OF MS. RADE WILL COMMENCE JANUARY 28, 2022 AND WILL FILL THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM OF MS. SHERIDAN WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2025. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'd just like to say I do understand this process . I do understand we might have the time to get the info before final passage and before we get the appointment sent down to us. It was brought up in public comment tonight that this process is backwards. And I tend to agree with that. We have two resolution s on the agenda tonight for a position that has not yet been appoint ed. And it seems that this is happening time and time again. And I don't feel that it's Council that's making this process harder than it needs to be. Last week I voted no to an item in Fifth Order that's in Seventh Order tonight . I'm going to be voting no for 5-C tonight . But I do understand that Council may move this forward for introduction . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , so it's very concerning to me that there is two pieces of legislation in front of us tonight , one 5-C to move and then final passage of an employee -- the Treasurer that historically be appointed -- or not appoint ed -- no, I'm sorry, not appointed but we vote on the appointment . So we have two pieces of legislation in front of us before we even received the actual appointment . So I'll vote to move this one more time to final passage . No way until we get clarity from the letter that our solicitor sent -- but I said this in caucus that it appears to me that, you know, recent communications we had from the solicit or -- but it appears to me that, like I said in caucus, the mere shutdown of City Hall twice and that's her call. But it looks like she's trying to shut us down with regards to doing our job, voting on positions that we've historically done. So I'm not prepared to be shut down. So I'll move this. But final passage it will be a different story if we don't get clarity.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? MS. SCHUSTER : No. MR. DONAHUE : I ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 8, 2022 – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND REILLY ASSOCIATES TO PROVIDE CONSULTING ENGINEERING SERVICES . MR. DONAHUE : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MS. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , I'm going to make a motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 amend this legislation . It was mistakenly sent down as an ordinance . It should be a resolution . So I want to make a motion to amend this legislation to reflect that it should be a resolution and not an ordinance . MS. SCHUSTER : I'll second that. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , like I stated in caucus, so this legislation has been brought to us twice, right, of course, it was a little screwed up because it was, you know, labeled an ordinance instead of -- MR. DONAHUE : We're on the question of the motion. MR. MCANDREW : Oh, I'm sorry. I'll save it for the vote. Sorry. MR. DONAHUE : All those in favor of the motion to amend this resolution , signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ?

MCANDREW : On the question of the resolution , I'll go back to it. So this has been before us, two weeks. There's been multiple questions posed to the administration . I have a simple one. Where is the required disclosure piece about donation s to elected officials or anybody associated with the City? This is the fourth time I'm asking. So like I said, this is -- final passage is next week. If I don't receive that, I will be a no. It's nothing personal to this engineering group. But it's policy. It's practices . It's things that we're used to doing and all of a sudden we don't -- we're not getting information like we historically did. I can't make informed decisions about information that I ask for. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
