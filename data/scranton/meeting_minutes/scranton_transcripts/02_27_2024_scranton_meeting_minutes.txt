You could go to the St. Patrick 's Parade Association website to register or you could register that day at the Lackawanna College gymnasium up on Jefferson Avenue in the morning . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. I have one announcement the Norfolk Southern Bridge on Theodore Street will be closed until further notice. Norfolk Southern is coming down to repair the bridge. The city did put up barrier s a few days ago and made it one lane. But our engineer went up there and there's actually pieces that look like they are going to fall. And I did ask the Mayor to send the bill for the price of putting barriers up there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 to Norfolk Southern . I don't know if they'll pay it but at least they'll have the bill. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN S PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First I want to say how very proud I am and many residents are that Detective Gilmartin will be attending the State of the Union next week in Washington , D. C. It's not just the pride we have and him representing the Scranton Police Department and his selfless service to our community , but, boy, it makes me feel glad that he must be doing very well in his recovery to be able to attend that event, so good for him. Just a reminder that the Friends of the Scranton Public Library is ongoing at the Marketplace at Steamtown on the second floor in front of the Crunch Gym; and books, a dollar to two dollars . It's a great variety this time. There are hundreds and hundreds of DVDs. So anybody who likes to buy a two dollar DVD, this your chance. What I gave you is a flyer, Friends 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 of Scranton Public Library are sponsoring a bus trip which they do every year. This one is on July 27th, a Saturday to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Price is $85 if you are a member of the friends , $90 if you are not. Children ages 3 to 12 are $75. But for that, you get a wonderful day in New York City. At the museum there's the there planetarium, Worlds Beyond Earth Space Show, Blue Whales, lots of exhibits , the Hall of Dinosaurs , the Hall of Gems and Minerals , the Hall of North American Animals, on and on and on. So everybody needs a day to recharge one's batteries every now and then. And this is a nice little thing. The bus will leave from the Albright Memorial Library and will return at 8 p.m. at night. You don't have to worry about parking or anything else. So it's also a nice thing if you have a munchkin. Take your munchkins and let them see a nice museum. It's a fun day for everybody . Speaking of having fun, we still don't have the union contracts on the City's website , Firefighters 330 days since the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 arbitration was signed. We're coming up rapidly on one year and Police is 214 days. You know, this is really unacceptable . These union contracts , personal costs for our unions constitute a major portion of the city's budget -- its operating budget. And those costs are outline d in great detail in these contracts . Also outline in these contracts are disciplinary procedure s and grievance procedures . You need to remember that the City's Ethics Code does not really cover unionize d employees because their contracts supersede the code. So I think all the residents have a right to see those union contracts . And I don't understand why they have yet to be posted on the website . DPW is there. The nonuniform clerical union is there. Why can't we have the police and firefighters ? You can't tell me that they're still discussing the terms and dotting the I's and crossing the T's. If they are doing that, you need to question their competency . We're paying a lot of money for these union contract s and our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 labor counsels . This needs to get, you know, somebody needs to start kicking a wall and find out what's the real reason they're not posted on the website . They have to be done. And the only other thing I would like to ask is, we haven't heard much about what's happening with regard to the Lackawanna River and the siltification that occurred when the dam in Dunmore was opened and the Pennsylvania American Water Company , you know, dumped all of that silt and sediment into the river. Bernie McGurl and his organization spent an awful lot of time and effort getting the river cleaned up. I haven't heard squat from the city on what the city's doing. Remember Dunmore runs into Green Ridge Roaring Brook and then down into South Scranton . And it's basically affected the City of Scranton . What is the administration going to do about it? Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Mr. Voldenberg , will you send a request to the administration to get a timeline -- if they have a timeline on when they are going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 update the city website with the contracts ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident , and I want to start off tonight by thanking the residents of Scranton , Dunmore and the surrounding areas that came out and supported the food drive that we had at the park. I stood here at this podium on several evenings before the drive to urge and let everyone know that people are in need of food here in the City of Scranton . We were able to supply four food pantries with food from what we collected that day. So as I said, when I stand here and I look around and I talk about the food drive, it's very encouraging when members of Council , members of the audience come up to the window and they give food. And I see them. I have to get up and acknowledge them because it just thrills my heart that you would take the time out of your day to help me with something that is very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 close and dear to my heart. I don't -- right now fortunately I'm able to buy food. But food is very expensive . Everyone isn't in the same situation as all of us. So it's just very encouraging when the tables are just overflowing with food. So I thank you each one of you. I thank the resident s. I thank the people from City Council as well as the audience that came up those two days and gave us food for the city. And also, you know, you don't need to stop now. You could always go to your local food pantry that's always looking for food and people are at their doors all the time. So when you see those sales at the store and it's 4 for $5 or 3 for 10 or something , think about your neighbors . Think about those that don't have food on their table. Think about their children that may have to go to bed hungry with no food. The second thing I wanted to talk about was Black History Month. I wasn't here a couple weeks because I was off doing things and speaking about Black History Month. I get into these things, I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 know how but I do wind up speaking about it. One of the things I participated in was that WVIA let me speak for a while on Black History and who did I think that I wanted to speak about. And I spoke about Reverend Leon Sullivan . I'm not sure if anyone knows. I know I mention ed it to a couple of people in Scranton and they had no idea who he was. But Reverend Sullivan was a preacher in Philadelphia . But he developed the OIC, Opportunities Industrialization Centers . And his talk was just like we talked about here tonight . He would go into the bars and things to get young people out of the bars, get them into a training program , get them into something so that they could feel better about themselves . So I'm hoping as they talk about the violence and the things that they want to do with this city that they'll think about the trade program s that they need to get, not things that they have to pay for but things that will help these young people become responsible adults, get them into a trade and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 let them go and be all that they could be. It's great to have programs . I was a little bit disappoint ed when I saw the paper and it had the picture of them live-streaming the program that they had on the violence in the city and there wasn't one person of color in that picture , not that I could see. Now, maybe it wasn't a good picture . But I did not see not one person of color. If I thought that, what do all the other people, the kids think when they look and see that they're going to speak for them and they don't know anything about me. The other thing I wanted to talk about was the barriers that I see up in front of the Radison Hotel. I don't know what that's all about. But I sure hope that it means that they're on their way to getting it fixed. Because I think the parade is going to go by there maybe? Maybe that's why it's getting attention now because no one wants to get hurt if that wall comes down during the St. Patrick's Day Parade. So I guess that's a step in the right direction that that's going to be fixed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Also, you know, I've been talking six years on the street signs and I'll continue to talk about the street signs until we could make a better look, feel to our city. I mean, we have money. I hear them with this ARPA money and people are getting this and getting that for new businesses and startup businesses . Well, let me have a startup business of developing a street sign company and let them get going with the street signs. And then the final thing that I want to talk about was the caucus tonight . Again, I did take tape it so that I could hear it better when I get home because it's not so conducive to listening to everything because you can't hear at all. But I did hear words like someone that looks like me which is always a big deal when you're talking with kids that they want to know somebody that looks like them. And again, I spoke about the West Scranton High School when they -- I think they live-streamed that program that day to all the schools . And that was not a good representation of our city. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Mark Margavitch . MR. MARGAVITCH : Good evening , Council . One question before I start. Can Mr. King hear me and acknowledge me if he wanted to acknowledge me? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King, can you hear the speaker ? MR. KING: I can. MR. SMURL: He said he can. MR. KING: I could hear. MR. MARGAVITCH : A few things that -- that I want to speak about tonight . I do have -- who's in charge of the Licensing and Inspections , what Council member? DR. ROTHCHILD : That would fall under my -- MR. MARGAVITCH : You oversee them? I do have some information I'll give to you after I'm done speaking . It's for me to get my general contractor 's license if you could please forward that to the department . And secondly , I want to know was there any discussion about the QOL fines and the appeal process from last week when I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 brought it up? MR. SMURL: Nothing I've heard. MR. MARGAVITCH : No? No, I mean, did you guys -- like, did you guys talk about it -- the quality of life, the fines and the appeals process that I spoke about last week? MR. SMURL: I haven't spoken to anyone about it. MR. MARGAVITCH : Well, could we? Could we have that topic of conversation ? Please? Not right now. But thirdly , Mr. Smurl, at the South Side meeting this past week, someone had mention ed about the same concern I had about the City Hall being closed and about the calling on the telephone . Do you remember what you told them? MR. SMURL: What was it? The phone lines were down? MR. MARGAVITCH : No, they had to call on the phone to speak to City Hall. MR. SMURL: Oh, call 311 to report? MR. MARGAVITCH : No, no, no. They had to call on the phone to speak to anyone at City Hall down below. They wanted to know why City Hall wasn't open. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. MARGAVITCH : Well, anyway, you don't remember that? Okay. Well, let me -- so you respond ed that it was a safety concern and that this is like it everywhere . I just wanted to say once again, Wilkes-Barre city is wide open. Hazleton , wide open, no restrictions . Also, you can't say safety for the employees when you have two offices that are not behind those doors and we also have officers that are already stationed here at City Hall. So hiring new officers and tax increase wouldn't be part of it. MR. SMURL: I'm sorry, I didn't know what you meant. I thought you were talking about the phone lines. Security of the building you're speaking of. MR. MARGAVITCH : Yes. Yes. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. MARGAVITCH : Now, I did mention that I would be talking about my issues with Mr. Oleski. You know, there's five types of people that I don't really care for in this world, those that abuse animals , those who abuse children , those who abuse the elderly, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 those who abuse the power they have and those who have power and fail to use it. That's really the five things that I have issues with. So before I start to talk about Mr. Oleski, I did invite him here as you guys receive d the e-mail. He's chosen not to come. I didn't want to speak about him without him being here. But, you know, discussion about my situation with Tom Oleski, I spoke to three of the Council members . Mr. King, if you could hear me, we did speak in May. We had a good conversation but you never called me back. So what I wanted to ask you if you would answer is, were you told by the administration to not discuss it further or are you friends with Mr. Oleski? MR. KING: I was never told not to speak to you. Also, it's important to note that any e-mails that you've been trying to send to me, they are not coming to me. Apparently you are putting , like, a number in there. Like, it's Wking@scrantonpa .gov. And I noticed that someone forwarded something to me the other day. You had a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 number in there instead of the I. That's probably why I'm not getting your e-mails. MR. MARGAVITCH : My other question is, did you have relationship with Mr. Oleski that would be conflicting for you to rule against him in any manner? MR. KING: The only time I ever knew the guy since I became a Councilman . I have no relationship . MR. MARGAVITCH : Fair enough. Fair enough. And, Dr. Rothchild , I have reached out to -- for you, you've never chosen to speak to me. So I would ask you the same questions . Do you have any friendship with Oleski or any reason why you wouldn't speak to me? DR. ROTHCHILD : No friendship with Mr. Oleski. I had spoken with other Council members who had an opportunity to speak with you. So I felt like it was being addressed through others. MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. I'm almost out of time. I just want to make one more point before I go. I'll have to start with next week about what Oleski -- my dealings with him. Mr. Schuster , Mr. McAndrew , we both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 spoke. I just would ask you two both the same question . Any friendship with Mr. Oleski or any reason why you couldn't impartially deal with Oleski's allegations I have against him? MR. SCHUSTER : No, I have no dealing s with Mr. Oleski. I think I've only contact ed him through official Council business or anything that had to be passed to his department . MR. MCANDREW : Same, I do not have a relationship with Mr. Oleski. MR. MARGAVITCH : And lastly, Mr. Smurl, I did speak to you at the South Side meeting a few -- two months ago. And you just seemed very -- it seemed like you knew what I was going to say before I said it. And that really -- that alerted me. Do you have any relationship with Mr. Oleski? MR. SMURL: I do. I deal with Mr. Oleski very often, a lot of complaints in neighborhoods , a lot of different situations that I have to contact him. MR. MARGAVITCH : But no friendship ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. SMURL: We don't go out drinking . MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. Well, I only ask that just because this was sent to me. This is your truck at his auto body shop or his repair shop. MR. SMURL: It's one of my trucks. That's actually my partner 's truck. MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. All right. I just wanted to know because , you know, I guess -- MR. SMURL: Mr. Oleski has an auto body shop? MR. MARGAVITCH : A detail shop. MR. SMURL: Oh, okay. MR. MARGAVITCH : Yeah, but I just wanted to know that. I guess I'll speak about it next week. If Mr. Oleski would like to come, I could speak when he's here so he has a chance to defend himself or say what he wants to say, but five minutes goes quick. So next week. All right. Thank you. ATTY. GILBRIDE : The Council members that you have discussed have talked to me about your situations . And I understand that you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 have a history with Mr. Oleski. I'm not going sit here and pretend to know all of it because I don't. It goes back 14 years apparently according to your e-mails. It strikes me though with some of the things that you've said and I'm not going repeat them here; but if those issues, in fact, are correct and provable , then you should be talking to an attorney who could help you through that system because unfortunate ly, I think what you're doing is asking this Council to take actions that they are just quite frankly not empower ed to do. They don't have the authority to hire or fire. That is up to the administration , the Mayor's office. If there is -- if they have legitimately done something treating you differently than somebody else in the community , that could be actionable. But you need to talk to an attorney about that because that is how you're going to get relief. MR. MARGAVITCH : This has cost me enough money. I don't want to soak anymore 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 into it. So I'll do it here and then -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : And I'm just -- I'm offering that to you because , quite frankly , you're not going to get what you want out of this Council . There's no way for them to do it. MR. MARGAVITCH : They don't have -- they may not have an action to do so, but if they have a support to do so, that will mean enough too. They can go to the administration . ATTY. GILBRIDE : And I could tell you they have. So that's my point to you. MR. MARGAVITCH : Gotcha. ATTY. GILBRIDE : I just feel like you're spinning your wheels. MR. MARGAVITCH : That's okay. I'll be back. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is that this week I had an opportunity to go to Motions Court with Judge Geroulo . And I haven't received his opinion yet. But I've asked him to enjoin my ticket from Licensing and Inspections to my appeal in the Court of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Common Pleas that it has to do with Licensing and Inspections . And I think that the resident s here have to find their voice and once and for all determine what the role of Licensing and Inspections is, how corrupt it's allowed to be, and whether the quality of life legislation that the Council created is even Constitutional or if it suspends my Constitutional rights by the way it's structured . And, of course, that will be determined later in a Federal Court because I already have the Mayor and ECTV in one Federal Court. And I have a full-time job so I don't want to start 10 or 15 different cases. But I find it troubling that the Council won't take responsibility for the damage it's doing to this community and its inability to have a Mayor whether the Mayor lives in the city or not, that's a different issue because it's pretty well common knowledge that most people think that she doesn't live here. But when a government moves like you do and you could go all the way to John Lock. You could start there and you could go forward 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 and you could look at what, you know, Benjamin Franklin and everybody talks about him and Madison and Adams said. But really it doesn't even cut that far. I mean, your quality of life legislation , I don't know how your attorney told you it was even legal. I don't even know how the process works with your three building appeals members and the broad spectrum of damage it does to the community in the city in general . And the lackluster kind of opinions you just throw around. You are the gentlemen that created the safeguards in that legislation and the body of the legislation . You are the driving force behind that and all the damage it's doing, okay? And it's time for you to take responsibility for it. And it's time for this Council to do something about Mr. Oleski. And if the Mayor is in the way, then you need to do something about that too because you have a right to do investigations . But the corruption is just so widespread here and you just feel you're entitle d to it. And it's been that way for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 long time. And why should the citizens like me have to go to Federal Court and listen to the Mayor try to dismiss my petition , listen to ECTV try to dismiss and so far it hasn't worked. I think that thing is locked. And my point is, me as a citizen , you work for me because I'm the sovereign here and you're my servant. But you're not really my servant because you want to enslave me and control my property and punish me, whether it's right or it's not right. And then you want to stand there and say, well, I didn't have anything to do with that. This is the Mayor. This is somebody else. No, this is you. And I think really if the people in this city had any common sense and there's a lot of lawyers around here, I think there's lawyer that should step forward or a community group or a neighborhood group and they should take three different entities in this city to Federal Court, the Council , the Recreational Authority , the prior one and this one and the Mayor. And we should take a look at the Nay Aug project and spread the cost of replacing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 that slide against all of those members to see if the City -- the Council , the Mayor and the Rec authorities tore down the slide and whether it was legal or not and whether it met the scope of the project and why it was done. And somebody should have to answer for that. The Scranton Times should be asking that question . The press should be asking that question . The people in the neighborhood should be asking that question . And they should also be asking how Tom Oleski is running the Department of Licensing and Inspection s and what happened to his boss and why the Mayor isn't addressing this problem in our city because to be honest with you, gentlemen , we are not slaves. And you are supposed to serve us. But when we watch you passing grant money around haphazardly , okay, it's just ridiculous . And how can you turn a city around with Licensing and Inspections ? What about the 31 people that had their homes condemn ed and they weren't qualified to do it? It's time to ask some question s and do something and stop putting it on somebody else. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. SMURL: Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . I'll take it for granted that you people have seen and know about this travesty here, $300,000 what the article calls low income. This is absolutely ridiculous asinine disgust ing article by Mr. Lockwood of the use of grants in Scranton tax money. And I wish you would tell me how much we gave for it to get involved in the building , the construction of a $300,000 four bedroom , two bath Taj Mahal I guess for that much money. And the article says this is for low or moderate income people. You know, the expenses and everything involved , the rent, you'd have to be a 50, 60,000 dollar income. That certainly -- that's not low income anywhere in the world. If Mrs. Cognetti and Mr. Cartwell believe $300,000 is low income, they both need their heads examined . I'd like to know who has the title for this property ? What's it appraised at? What are the taxes going to be? How much of a deposit will a person have to put down because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 they have children ? You could imagine a four bedroom house with children what it will look like in a year. I've had a trailer I rented out. I know a little bit what children do, God, in weeks. Oh, gosh. Thirty percent , the paper says they only -- your income has to have it where only 30 percent will go towards this house. When I bought my house in '94, Mr. DeNaples told me to look for a piece of property that would involve one week of my salary. I've never really had any problems financially following that rule. This city has an abundance of low income property thanks to the Zoning Board. My neighborhood was really something 25 years ago. Now it stinks. I got a half dozen boarding houses up and down Main Avenue. You people don't care. You don't do nothing . There's no code enforcement to do anything . There's cars parked on the sidewalk with children coming and going to the buses or in the street. North Main Avenue is like a race track, cars going two and three times the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 speed limit 24/7. My house has probably been devalued tremendously the last couple of years. And here we're talking about a $300,000 rental property . This is just ridiculous what's going on in this city. You know, I've said it before. One time years ago we had a meeting in the library for some reason I forgot -- oh, the elevator . I think the elevators were out. And I said that Scranton just absolutely reeks from the sour stench of graft and corruption . And you can't imagine , I must have a dozen people on my back for saying that. But I had more people on my back that agreed with me. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. There is no one else on the sign-in list. Anyone else want to address Council ? MR. EDSELL: How are you guys? MR. SMURL: State your name and address , please. MR. EDSELL: David Edsell. I'm no longer in Scranton . I was in Scranton my whole life. But I too with the two gentlemen in the back about Tom Oleski, License and Inspection .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 The attorney over here, Gilbride , you said for that gentleman to get an attorney to investigate or go after Tom Oleski. MR. SMURL: You've got to address Council . That was mister -- MR. EDSELL: I apologize . Well, if you guys could ask the attorney who he would recommend to contact -- who he would recommend to contact in order to have an attorney to go after Tom Oleski consider ing it was said before that the gentleman 's problems in the back were address ed to a higher Council which obviously nothing has been done; is that correct ? I mean, Tom Oleski is still in his position ; is he not? MR. SMURL: We do not hire or fire. We do not run that part of -- MR. EDSELL: I understand though but again, you can't investigate or you guys don't have to the right people to go to find out if these issues are true? So for one, I was running -- I was cleaning cars at my house in South Side to which Tom Oleski came and shut it down. And it was a nightmare . I went to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 court for two years. Okay, this isn't -- back on Vipond. Two neighbors he had hiding cameras in trees, him, Don King. I went to court for this. It's all on legal record. And they were giving Tom Oleski and Don King the camera footage , okay, but they run a business at 3213 Vipond Street in Scranton , PA. It's called Heavy-Duty Sewing. I made million s of complaint s and they're still there running the business . I moved out of Scranton because of this. It's a joke. It's a sham. I mean, how pathetic . The guy who runs the License and Inspections comes out, shuts down a detail business which he runs with no permits either. So, like, how is that, like, how does that work? Does anyone know? No answers , right. So he could just -- he's just running wild in the city. He's shutting down people's businesses . He's doing stuff. So my retaliation to him was to come back after the city him personally because I know Tom Oleski my whole life, his kids, his granddaughter used to be at my house. He knew of the whole situation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 before he came to shut it down. So I just don't understand how, like, this can absolutely go on in our city where a guy who runs the License and Inspection has his own business in the city and is going down and shutting other people's businesses down for violation s that he is clearly violating himself . Check it out yourself Deluxe Auto Detailing. So I would love to know all of these questions too. I mean, every -- I requested , right no know denied, denied, denied for the dumbest reasons I've ever heard in my life. There was a girl who came on my property Sara Inomokita {phonetic } whatever her name is. I have video of it. And this is the whole reason the city has dropped the charges of working without a permit because I was going to file trespass ing charges against her for coming on my property when she wasn't supposed to. I got a call last night from a gentleman whose girlfriend actually worked for the city. She was at my house for this whole situation when she worked for the city. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 she knows the girl came on my property when she was not suppose d to and started taking pictures . Did Tom Oleski or Don King do anything ? Not at all. MR. SCHUSTER : Was this a Scranton property that you're talking about? MR. EDSELL: Yes, it is. So I moved out of Scranton and I totally got -- I tried to -- I tried to file for a business which they would not help me with, Tom Oleski and Don King and after all the fines and dealing going to court for two years, it's still not resolve d because all the judges recused themselves . Paul Ware, every judge we went in front of recused themselves of the case. The last one was Paul Ware and that was back in November of '23. But so some of my questions for you guys would be, I think some of you might want to actually talk for the people and see what's going on with Tom Oleski, whether your hands are tied or not. But if someone could ask the attorney after I speak who he would recommend to go to if some of these people don't have a lot of money to pay for an attorney to go after 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Tom Oleski when I think that is completely backwards. I think City Council should be able to run their own investigation s and find out what is going on. I mean, like the gentleman said, he has your truck in the detail shop, an illegal detail shop he has the truck in there getting detailed. I mean, what a joke. And then this guy is going around ruining people's lives, tickets for this, tickets for that. Fines for this -- fines -- and he thinks it's a joke. MR. SCHUSTER : So what was the case with Paul Ware in November of '23? MR. EDSELL: That's for operating without a license for washing cars in my driveway to the point where I stopped washing the cars at my house and only buffed and waxed them in my garage to which I was told it was illegal . MR. SCHUSTER : And this is your business that was on what -- MR. EDSELL: Vipond, 3209 Vipond Street in Scranton , PA. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Competition .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. EDSELL: Whether it's competition or not it's just ridiculous . MR. SMURL: Please, please, either address Council or you have to -- MR. EDSELL: I'm sorry. Go ahead. MR. SMURL: Your last name? MR. EDSELL: Edsell, E-D-S-E-L-L, first name is David. MR. SMURL: All right. Thank you, Mr. Edsell. Do you live in the City of Scranton ? MR. EDSELL: No, I moved out. MR. SMURL: Do you work in Scranton ? MR. EDSELL: No. MR. SMURL: No, okay. Thank you. MR. EDSELL: Yep. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? Anyone else wish to speak? I'm sorry, if you want to speak you have to come up. Anyone wish to speak? MS. KOLOSKI : Hi. Good evening , Council . First, I want to say how nice the basement looked. When we came in that day it wasn't creepy anymore, all painted and fixed over down here in City Hall. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 During the Black History Month I had the privilege of going over to North Scranton to the Stories from Scranton . And at that Stories from Scranton there were two men that told their story of their life in Scranton . One now works I think for the Salvation Army. I think was in their rehab program for drugs and alcohol . The other one was a person who was released from prison after 35 years. And in the discussion on the gang violence -- and this is why I bring this up because I know you're organizing this panel for the gang violence . And I did drop this in the Mayor's ear when she was leaving . We were discussing it. I said to this man, I said, you know, I think somebody like you would have a big impact talking to the kids because you -- he's of their -- where they're coming from. He grew up in a very abusive household . He turned to criminal activity . And he's now reformed. He spent time in prison. And I think somebody like that should be on your board because they -- instead of it just being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 like a study they would actually know -- they know what these kids feel and what these kids -- and how to talk to these kids. So that's just something I wanted to throw out there and think about. Okay, the next thing I want to approach if I still have time is 421 Colfax Avenue, which I know you're sick of hearing from me. I think I sent you a Facebook messenger , Mr. Smurl, if you got it some picture s. And I actually left them in my car and it was raining so hard I didn't want to go back for them because weren't that good anyway. But where we were talking about that sidewalk when I was here a couple weeks ago, those big chunks of sidewalk that are up on the grass making it very hard to walk around the hole where the sidewalks used to be on that end. So I used to walk the other side, you know, the side between the street and the sidewalk . Now there's like a dirt mound piled up there too so you can't get around there. It looks like somebody threw a big hunk of slate in the middle where the sidewalk is dug out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Now I know supposedly everything is under litigation and these people have gotten fines before which probably never got paid because as far as I know the property owner is still Jonathan Olivetti who is still in prison in Philadelphia . I would like to know if any of you could find out for me the lawyer's name that's handling the case that they brought against the city so that they couldn't tear down that property because I would like to just contact him myself and find out if you are not tearing it down, fix that hole in the sidewalk . I don't care if you put a board over it or something , but it's dangerous . It's dangerous even for me when I walk over it with my walker and I know it's there. So people just getting out of their car and walking down to go to the hospital or anything , kids riding their bikes and running down the street, it's dangerous . And who are they going to sue, Jonathan Olivetti because he's in jail. So I'd like to know who's representing him because I'm thinking if he's representing him himself , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 would assume he would have lost his license to do that. So if anybody could find that out for me I'd appreciate it. MR. SMURL: Doris, if he had filed -- I know it was on the demolition list and it was going to the Housing Appeals Board. If you call who is in charge of the Housing Appeals Board, they may have record of an attorney that filed it. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. Thank you. Then the next thing -- 33 seconds I won't get through all of this. The cutting of that curb on Olive and Colfax still hasn't happened . But today when I was driving by to get here it's pretty much flooded with water there. So I don't know where that's coming from either. And I'll try to quickly give you guys a bus update. If you remember a couple years ago when I came in here asking about the bus thing and who handles it and everything ? Well, we got it all tracked down. And now it's supposedly being taken care of by the Scranton Transit Company . The last conversation I had with them is that the PennDOT engineers have come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 out and that they ordered the shelter and the bench. And it should be in in 20 weeks. So I'm very excited about that. And we'll see if it really happens because I never really celebrate anything until I actually see it there. Let's see. No, that's pretty good. Have a good day. Bye. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Doris. Anyone else? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, Tim, I read your comments every week. Now onto business at hand. On the antiviolence committee we were just talking about putting the money forward to, it's nice when you have police when you have the State Police, city police, county, and all of these organization s. But I would like to see at least one seat on there for the Public Defender 's Office, the people who see these people come in here from the other side who understand what their family, their upbringing is, what challenges they come forward and what environment they're out of. A lot of -- my mother did capital 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 cases, murder cases. And one of the things she did for murder cases down in Philadelphia was it's called mitigation where you go out there and you take a look at what environment they were from, how they were raised, what they went through , to basically look and show all the hardships to try and keep someone from being executed , they would serve life in jail rather than being put to death. And that's part of a normal process . Unfortunately when we get police enforcement and all that, sometimes we miss the viewpoint from the other side of the defense attorneys who come in there and actually take a look at it and have to deal with the people and all the people around them and the circumstance s that brought them in. I think a viewpoint from that side would be critical to have on anything for gang violence as well. The issue that you were confused about for Licensing and Inspections I think was the nonrefundable $300 fine that was brought up last week. Looking at the paper, I notice that Paige Cognetti was down -- well, we all know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 that Paige Cognetti was down in D. C., and met with Biden. We all had hoped that she was down there for the refusal of the FEMA funds when our FEMA grants got denied for our flood victims. We went, great. She's down there. She's in D. C. She's sitting down with the President . She's obviously down there to take care of the neighborhood that was denied FEMA funding . Well, tucked away in the back of the newspaper was the fact that she's down there for an appointment to advisory committee for trade policy and negotiations in D. C. Do we know if she's moving to D. C? She's going to be put on the trade policy out of D. C., maybe she should go down there. Mr. Smurl, are you ready to take up the office of Mayor because you're next in line for that. We don't have a newspaper person here. The reason why we don't have a newspaper here is the newspaper for the Times has to have their edit by 4:00, 5:00 at the latest. So from this point going forward what they do is they take a look at the minutes -- the agenda. And they put on their opinions from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 the agenda itself devoid of any public comment . They might come back a day later, look at public comment from ECTV and report on it from them. But it's a sad state now that the newspaper has to look to ECTV to get the information to do the reporting that it can't do here anymore because it's not a city newspaper . We've lost a whole lot at this point including our representation by the media. You have a bill before you right now for lights -- new lighting on parking garages . It would be nice if you actually had them set up for motions, motion detecting like most airport s have and any new construction . Whenever you put up a new facility , you have lights in there -- LED lights that are dim. When you pull up into them it detects them. It kicks the lights up on a higher light standard . And then when you leave that area, it kicks them back down. I think that should be part of the code if you're going to deal with parking garages for lighting because that takes care of a lot of the light and glare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 issue. Last two things, thank you for allowing me to speak and show my presentation . I know it was hot last week and it was a mediated agreement between us. I want to thank you for coming together for that mediation and offering it. And for all the people who have asked the city government here for responses , City Council men and get back responses saying we're in receipt of your response , maybe it's time for every one of you Council members to put forward -- have Frank put forward for you right to know requests at the same time even though you're not required to file them because if you put a right-to-know request in, they have six days from the time that comes to answer you back. And it's not an answer of we have this in receipt and will never get back to you. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , resident of East Mountain . I still want to go back to some old things. But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 first I want -- I don't know if any of you saw the paper. I believe it's today. But a woman who is -- was -- because this is an obituary of Karen Foster. I know there are a lot of people -- she was very, very active in the West Side. And I know all the kids who skated are thankful to her for what she's done so they could skate. But she's done a lot. And I just wanted to call your attention and maybe if you know Mike, give him a call. Then back on the old things that we never hear about after they're passed. Two, the lobbyist and the nurse that you approved , what have they done for us? Would you mind telling me since we don't get any reports or -- we did have one -- I know last year I believe it was the lobbyist . MR. SCHUSTER : We had a second one. Frank, can we send those both over to the administration . And then when we get that answer if we could get them back into Third Order. I don't -- I did ask for an update on the health coordinator . That's the position you're talking about.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MS. SCHUMACHER : It changed around because the county, everybody now needs a -- just spend our tax money on what -- MR. SCHUSTER : She had left the county and I feel like we did get word that they were going to take the leftover money and try to get someone into position . But I don't think we got any update on it. So if we could get an update on that one, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : They advised us this afternoon when I followed up that we'll have an answer by next weeks' meeting on both Nossaman and the coordinator . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And then once we get that we can get it into Third Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. And then last week or the week before you were talking about the pave cut position . And that was on my list one that got dropped off because I ran out of time. But if you look in your budget that you approved last year, there is no -- that position is gone. You took the position away. So that's probably why we don't have one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 And can anybody tell me what's going on and if it's ever going to end at the corner of Wyoming and Lackawanna at the old -- MR. SMURL: There's underground utility work and that should be fished shortly . MS. SCHUMACHER : What's your idea of shortly ? MR. SMURL: Well, the last time we checked maybe three or four weeks ago they said it was about a two month end to the project . So within the next few weeks I expect that to be completed . MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm not a betting person, but I will be -- I would be on that one. MR. SCHUSTER : The corner's been over a year at this point. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, well over a year and it's a mess. And it doesn't do any good for our city to look like that. MR. SMURL: Mr. Voldenberg , I believe we got a response , did we not? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, Mr. Oselinsky with the water company was in our buildings and he said just what you stated it will be done in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 a few weeks. MS. SCHUMACHER : And now another old thing. Does anybody -- does the -- the name Patrolman John Wilding , do anything -- anybody -- okay, yeah. He was a patrolman and back in I believe it was 2015 he went out of the car to go after somebody who had done some bad thing. And he went up to what he thought was a wall but it was really the wall of a stairs and he went over that and he did not survive that. And the city said they were going to do something about that. Now I thought -- they never said what it was but -- I'll give them that. But I thought that they were going to say if you have one of those walls on a deep staircase then you should have some kind of railing and that never happened . Now the state did something and the state was something like they shouldn 't run or -- I don't know. It was pathetic . But I think that with be a worthwhile thing to look into doing. I don't know how many we have. Okay. Thank you for your time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SCUTNICK : Brian Scutnick {phonetic ) West Side. I sent you guys countless e-mails regarding a lot of issues with code enforce ment, Tom Oleski. You guys all know is clearly a problem . So we'll start with a couple right to knows I did, all right? Tom willing ly lied to the State in an investigation . The State documented such when the State proved Tom was lying. All of a sudden the documents Tom said they don't exist popped up. Gracie Franko turned them all over. Tom actually in one of the cases submitted one affidavit signed and everything saying he has the documents . It's a safety concern . Three weeks later when the state said there's no safety concern he submitted a second affidavit stating we don't have those document s. They don't exist. So right there, State even called him out and told him it was a violation under Title 18 4904. So we went through . I had Gracie Franko also gave an affidavit telling the State these documents do exist and turned the document s over.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 But Tom wanted to say they don't exist, went through the same thing with Andrew Sunday on another right to know. Andrew tried to also claim we don't have those documents . The documents again did exist. So to get into a little further because everybody is talking about his detail business I guess tonight , I did the right to knows on that as well. As per Gracie Franko, the zoning exists for it to be a detailing business . The zoning that does exist for the detailing business is not the correct zoning. There was a zoning variance issued to him for an auto repair business in 1992. And my understanding from talking to a previous zoning officer for the city zoning, variance s expire once the business closes that the variance is given for. So technically that zoning variance would be out the window. Gracie Franko said flat out in her right to know she said that there is no sign permits for the business . There is no business license . Later time Gracie Franko provided the documentation saying that there is no Certificate of Occupancy that exists for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 business . Here's some e-mails, Mr. Smurl. You, in fact, did know that this detailing business exists. Here's an e-mail sent to you August 31st. Here is another e-mail sent to you by somebody else, both of these e-mails by someone else January 5th also telling you the detailing business exists. So you were fully aware of that. MR. SMURL: When was it? MR. SCUTNICK : August 31st you got one of them at 9:36 a.m., and January 5th, you got another e-mail regarding such. Frank Voldenberg could attest because that same person followed up and Mr. King was the President of Council at the time and said we don't get involved in that and acknowledge d the entire e-mail so that did all occur. Sound about right, Frank? You sent an e-mail back to a city employee that resigned and told her that we don't get involved in city employee matters even though she was telling you there was illegal activity going on? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did advise that employee Council does not get involve d in those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 matters, personnel matters , I believe , and legal matters . MR. SCUTNICK : It's not a personnel matter when somebody that is put in a position of trust -- position of public trust is violating everything about public trust. Do you know what I mean? As of today at 1:30 this afternoon I was given a phone call by the State Department of Environmental Protection . They opened an investigation also. The business at the Oleski house also does not have a permit required under federal law called National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit in order to put anything in the wastewater as a detailing business . So I don't understand how you could run a business at your house and shut other businesses down that are doing the same. Is it extortion so that we could promote our own business ? I mean, nobody from administration wants to answer. Everybody from administration doesn't answer a single thing. The only person I got that gave me any kind of response was the Solicitor at one point sent me a certified 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 letter telling me that I have to provide her every document I possess that I think that I could say that Scranton is corrupt that deems that I have permission to say Scranton is corrupt . I mean, Tom Oleski is a good example . You at least got rid of Selina. I mean, driving around without a license . I mean, that was pretty good. She was in a good spot. So while we're at it, McAndrew , do you want to give an apology that you want to make? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, well, guess what -- MR. SCUTNICK : I reached out to you trying for help here because there's problems . MR. MCANDREW : Well, I'll be honest with you. I agree that there is problems . I agree that there is some stuff that needs to be looked at. But I'm going to be honest with you. We were advised not to respond because -- MR. SCUTNICK : (Inaudible .) MR. MCANDREW : Please let me finish. We were advised not to respond because some of this stuff is being looked at. MR. SCUTNICK : By whom? Because the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 person that you hired as an investigator -- MR. MCANDREW : No, no, no. We didn't hire anybody . This came from administration . MR. SCUTNICK : Okay, I'm going to tell you what you guys don't know. The city hired a private attorney to do an investigation . The investigating attorney went to the person that wrote a seven page e-mail to you guys advising that the DEA -- the DA's Office was involved , advising you that the DA's contacted that they were looking to do a joint investigation with the FBI so the city did and hired an attorney. The first attorney they hired set up meetings with everybody including myself and then backed out and said I can't because my business partner is actually suing the city for a resident against code enforcement . So they hired a second attorney . The second attorney set up a meeting with the person that wrote the letter. He set it up at Ufberg's office is who represents the city and then didn't show up to his own meeting . Is that a non bias? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MR. MCANDREW : The details that you speak of, we did not get. MR. SCUTNICK : You might not have got them but I got them. I'm just saying that's the problem . That's what your administration does. But even when, like, I'm trying to reach out to anybody because nobody from administration will listen, everybody from administration says nothing . They don't answer. So, I mean, you have Tom in this position . I have four other people to talk about with this, you know what I mean? For instance , Mark, I texted you because somebody said, hey, this is the person that is going to help you the best. You couldn't respond . But you tried to forward my text message . You copied and pasted it to me and whoever you were trying to send it to, you wrote I got this from Scrutfuck . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so let me -- MR. SMURL: Sorry, you're finish. MR. SCUTNICK : That's his text. That's your Council member. MR. SMURL: You're finished . Time's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 up. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I'll answer it. I'll answer to it. So guess what -- so I texted something real quick. I'm not that savvy with a phone. It was an error, okay. I apologize . I didn't realize I did it until a day later until -- the stuff you're showing now. So I apologize . MR. SCUTNICK : We're just looking for help. Everybody is looking for help in this city because the administration won't answer. You guys say it's a safety concern for anybody to be in the building . But you guys know my other half worked here. It's because nobody's in the building . They all had these work from home positions because they don't even live in the county. You have three officers here on day shift, full-time officers , two officer s and a sergeant . How is that a safety concern for people to come here? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Scutnick , just so you know, all of your concern s that you've sent Council , the Law Department does have. And Council in the step that we're in and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 process that we're in has been told that the Law Department and labor attorneys are looking into each of these issues. MR. SCUTNICK : Again, the lawyer that the Law Department hired didn't show up to his own meeting against the person that made the original complaint . Somebody wrote a seven page letter showing illegal activity , showing a permit issue going on, everything . They gave details. And they gave details in August and then they gave details again in January when they finally resigned. Nobody from the city has contact ed that person besides Kaylee Pikulski to continue her ongoing harassment even three weeks after the employee left, still would text and call this employee . For what? MR. SCHUSTER : As I said, this all went over to the labor attorney s and the Law Department . And I would assume after tonight we're going to be getting something back. I don't know what their investigation entails. But, I mean, this is making it active right now with you speaking . MR. SCUTNICK : Well, like I said, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 have the right to knows for everything . Gracie Franko did the work and even said all of his stuff at his own house -- how could you shut down somebody else's detailing business besides for the reason of if I close 50 percent of -- if I close his business , his business has to go somewhere . Mr. Smurl went somewhere to get his truck detailed, right? It worked. MR. SMURL: Are we finished ? All right. Anyone else? MS. MCDONALD : Hello, I wasn't planning on speaking here tonight . My name is Kelly McDonald . I live in Scranton . I was not planning on speaking here tonight . But when the woman in the gallery asked all of you if you knew who Patrolman Wilder was, nobody said a word. Do you not know who he is? MR. SMURL: Of course we know who he is. MS. MCDONALD : Okay, well, then why did you not say something ? He deserves the respect at least to acknowledge that. He gave his life for this city, for whatever . But I take that as disrespectful that nobody acknowledged his name. I'm very good friends 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 with his wife. I think that was disrespectful amongst all of you that you did not give her the respect when she brought his attention -- or your attention to his name that nobody said anything . That's all I have to say. I'm not going to go into a whole thing about this. But that was awful. That was absolutely awful. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Smurl, can I speak to this one? MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : It's not something that I speak about often, maybe once as I have on Council . Patrolman Wilding was a friend of mine. And I am also friends with his wife. I haven't spoken to her recently but I kind of taken a cue from her. I don't want to speak on his family's behalf or his behalf. But he did give his life for this city and he was an individual that I knew personal ly. I think about his family. I think about his family a lot. I was younger at the time when it happened . Me and him are around the same age. And it's something that with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 events that recently occurred has been a thought on my mind a lot. When individuals come up to speak, they do speak to the Chair of Council . So I was just being respectful of Council when I did what I did. And like I said, I respect -- I've never been granted the liberty to speak on his behalf from his family so I really haven't. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . First and foremost , continued prayers for Detective Gilmartin . He should have been promoted by now -- well-deserved promotion because he's the blueprint of the strength of our city and that's our first responders , continued prayers and recovery . Tonight I had first and foremost we had a safety concern . And that was with a bridge. I'm request ing that all bridges be inspect ed immediately . This body and the City of Scranton have been made aware of the situation since last July just to be ignored until very recently . The city needs to become more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 proactive instead reactive. Somebody very seriously could have been hurt there. All right, safety concern , safety first. Let's get all the bridges inspected immediately . Last week you guys spoke about a bond savings of about $200,000. You know, it's great we're going to save money, but where is it going to go? Towards lawyer expense s. What's the going rate for a lawsuit these days, say, against the city Marty Flynn's mother for wrongful termination ? What is it, $400 an hour through Ufberg? How long is that going to go? How about the one right behind you, the one that's been discussed here quite a few times tonight , Kristen Chizek{phonetic }. You know, we do one thing the right way and then we tend to do five or six the other. We throw money at something just to get rid of it. Well, when you have good employees , the last thing you want to do is get rid of them because that's the end result. You know, it's a lot of money. And, you know, with taxes going up we want to spend it wisely. I also talked to you guys several 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 times since last October about the sale of the Scranton Parking Authority and the Scranton Sewer Authority . I want this addressed one last time. If not, next weak Andy Mehalshick is going to be here. I want to know. I want the answer tonight . The retainage, both of these document s are suppose d to be retained forever . If they're not here, I want it addressed. I want the authorities notified immediate ly. You are in violation of municipal law. Department of parks, resign immediately . That jack in the box is still up in Nay Aug. I hope we could get those Halloween -- Halloween -- holiday decorations down before the parade. You know, it's arrogance at its best. The Mayor would rather soon pick out an outfit for the parade as opposed to picking up these holiday ornaments and things. You know I -- I've been looking at this. You know, you have a department of parks director who is supposed to have been licensed to actually become a lifeguard . He sat right here, right in front of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 you and you approve d it. What's he doing? Sitting on his butt down at Weston Field refusing to get licensed . Resign. Tom Oleski, department of wherever you want to call yourself , resign. You know I've been motivated here for several reasons . Number one, I called the Mayor when there was an issue with the trash fees. I introduced the Mayor of Scranton and Jimmy Connors to the Mayor of Allentown . So I have a lot of experience in that. So I left a message for the Mayor, right in the garbage . Then second time, I called the Mayor about splitting the taxes after one year of delinquency . The city gets their portion back, only that and Philadelphia split after one year, right in the garbage . Then the third one was a little bit personal . This involved my son and his passing . And I wanted to discuss with her things we could do to help families out, right in the garbage . Third time. You know, it's one thing to do the right thing. It's another thing to be arrogant . Your arrogance will become your downfall. I assure you of that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 You know we put our officers at risk because we went to a new program as opposed to LEAB. You know, LEAB, most of our officers are part of that. And I think we need to go back to that because every time you hit that gavel, it cost a lot of money. I'll be back next week to tell you how to fix things. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. LAFRANCE : Good evening , Council , Pat LaFrance , city resident . I too as you know had some problems with the zoning department . But the first thing I want to get to is, Mr. King, I owe you an apologize because the last time I was at this podium I made a comment about two years down the road. And when I went home and I looked at the YouTube video, it seemed like I made a threat to you about two years down the road to me. And I don't like doing that. And I want to apologize to you for that because I didn't mean two years down the road I'm going to run against you. What I meant was, the next election there is definitely going to be a lot of videos 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 and stuff going around on who helped who here, who did what for who here on this side of the wooden railing . And it's just disgust ing the things I'm hearing tonight . Mr. Smurl, you're a South Side resident . I'm a South Side resident . I'm not at all happy about the gang situation in Scranton . But I don't want to go into right now because I'm not prepare d. But I do know from experience one sign of gangs in your neighborhood is sneakers thrown up around the wires of the streets. On Hickory Street and Prospect Avenue there is two sets of sneaker s right in the intersection . Can we get them down? I asked one resident he said it's been there a while. I asked another resident , he said it's been there a couple weeks. MR. SMURL: When did you see them? MR. LAFRANCE : I saw them there this morning , Prospect Avenue and Hickory Street, right in the intersection . If I'm coming off Prospect from Madzins or 606 towards your house, they are right in front of me right in the middle of the intersection . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. SMURL: Okay. I know they had removed them a few weeks ago. MR. LAFRANCE : Thank you. I appreciate that. There was another thing I wanted to mention . I forget what it was. The train bridge, we're going to shut down the road for that train bridge for unsafe, right? MR. KING: I believe it is shut down now. MR. LAFRANCE : It's shut down now? MR. SCHUSTER : It's already shut down. MR. LAFRANCE : All right. So we won't see a train going over that bridge tonight ? MR. SMURL: I didn't say that. Below is what I saw are pieces of concrete . They say it is structural ly sound, their engineer . MR. LAFRANCE : Love it. MR. SMURL: So that's the report we got. MR. LAFRANCE : So where we're at right now it's shut down for the public underneath the bridge but the train gets to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 keep on rolling . MR. SMURL: That's correct because pieces are falling . MR. LAFRANCE : Okay, I got it. MR. SCHUSTER : I've seen the detached wood underneath the bridge and that was Norfolk Southern . MR. LAFRANCE : Oh, yeah, they do it. And they put that (inaudible ) in there and everything . But it just amazes me that the public can't use their own road because of the train bridge that belongs to the train company that we've been complain ing about for years and the train gets to still use that. All right. One other thing I wanted to mention . And this has to do with the Licensing and Inspections and Permits . I have a video of me -- I have many videos of me going into the zoning office because when I go into the zoning office every time I went in, I have my phone here in my pocket. I have a pocket t-shirt on and I have my phone recording every time I went in there. One of the times I went in there which was in -- I'd have to look at the video, but I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 believe it was midSeptember . The video clearly shows me filling out two complaint forms. I filled out the first complaint form against Tom Oleski. I filled out the second complaint form against Robin Selemba . I feel I have enough evidence that those two came at me in a personal manner. So I wanted somebody to look at it. And I never got any -- nobody ever contacted me. I -- about three or four weeks later I contact ed Oleski's boss by voicemail , never got a call back. A couple weeks later I sent an e-mail out and I get ahold of Gracie Franko and she says, yeah, if you want to make a complaint you got to come. I said, no, no, you don't understand . I made the complaint s. I have it on video. You could clearly see the girl at the department taking my two complaints , stamping them, copying them, putting them wherever they want to put them and giving me the two copies. But according to Gracie Franko those complaint forms don't exist. Somebody threw 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 them in the garbage . It's unreal the ethics. Mr. King, I saw you in last week's video you said you were heated about corruption because somebody said something about corruption with Council members . And I'll agree with you. I can't sit here and say any one of the Council members have committed any corruption -- but the ethics. Mr. McAndrew , that text that Brian was talking about when you sent it back look what I got from him, who was that going to? Was that going to Tom Oleski? MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. LAFRANCE : No. Okay. Thank you, sir. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer and so forth. Here once again we have -- I brought -- found it today when I was getting papers ready for recycle , reservoir dam project muddies local waters. And it's just a shame that these are the type of people that were put in charge of our environment . And we've been paying them to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 keep our environment clean. But I will point out before you come up here and recommend big fines and maybe resignations would help from boards of directors or something . But you're going to pay in the end for any huge fine that's levied because the Susquehanna River down in Sunbury or Harrisburg or wherever is polluted from this dam which it will be (inaudible ) by then. It certainly will reflect in your water bill which is excessive as we speak. And they come into the neighborhood and they just do what they want. I have a pile of pipes and everything in front of me. But the one thing I'm concern ed about I had a blue stone curb. And I don't know what they plan to replace it with, but we had to point out to the neighbors slash tenants across the street that it wasn't acceptable to park up over the blue stone curb that was there for a reason to prevent erosion . And I really don't need somebody turning -- turning the whole front of the property into a mud pile. So hopefully I'm going to have to contact them. I have a phone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 number and demand that my blue stone curb be put back. I don't care for it to look like a poorly constructed false tooth or something like that. And it's just unGodly how many days we've been without water or partially without water or -- and a couple weeks ago I mentioned about Detective Gilmartin . And I hope he's doing better. He seemed like he was doing better in the paper. I seen his picture today. He's going with Matt Cartright to the State of the Union address . And when I said that we could have tactical teams when shots are fired, that's what we should have. They're maybe trying to get on top of it but we really should have those guys protected a little more. And it could be a training opportunity for somebody on the police force that, you know, you have a couple two or three specialist personnel . And then they -- if they get called in off the regular post to respond to shots fired, that's very serious business . And it's not -- it's certainly you don't want it happening in your neighborhood . Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 There's a lot of stuff being said with the elections coming up about dementia . And you know dementia goes two ways. I mean, some people think that because you're a little slower or you talk a little slower you're demented . Or I have a relative that -- mostly older relative s that -- they passed on but one person called me on the phone or I called them trying to talk to somebody in the house. And they were all fired up about St. Jude and all of the commercials asking for money for St. Jude. And I told them, well, Jesus, you know, they're only asking for donations buddy. Those kids might be dead by now and some of them are. And he called me a Polack. Well, I'm damn proud I'm a Polack and not thinking on his behalf. Thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thanks. Anyone else? Attorney Gilbride , before we go forward again, are you prepared with any backup information for Mr. Mancini about the Sewer Authority and stuff or is that still -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : So after last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 week's meeting I did reach out to the lawyers for the city administration . I requested the same documentation that you did. I was assured that I would get them. They said they did not have them but they had requested them from the other bodies. I will tell you I did not receive them today until this point. They will be reached out again tomorrow to see when they are coming and when I could expect them. MR. SMURL: All right. Thank you. MR. MANCINI : May I ask a question to you and ask him directly ? What's the retainage for these documents ? Is it suppose d to be for lifetime or are they supposed to be on premises ? MR. SMURL: That also is in the question so we will get that. ATTY. GILBRIDE : I believe it's -- I don't believe it's lifetime because it's a contract . The contract s under the laws in Pennsylvania it is general ly seven years after the end of the contract . Those contracts are not over yet so that seven years hasn't started running .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 MR. MANCINI : -- it's an asset so it's to be retained forever . It's not just a natural contract so the retainage has to be for life. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Again, they did not get rid of the asset. They have a contract to have the assets used by an outside party. So it's a contract . MR. SMURL: All right. Thank you, Attorney Gilbride for giving that information . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. Coming up -- I think the rest of the Council got it. I was in some discussion with Mr. Voldenberg , some representatives of the railroad and we had some conversation about homeless encampment s along the railroad and on private property .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 The DPW and Scranton Police Department were brought into that conversation as well as the Mayor. So we're going to have a meeting coming up on the 11th of March to talk about some of the camps that are there and hopefully we'll talk about some of the -- actually not hopefully , we'll get some updates on the bridges as well. One of the things I would like to say is one of the business es in the area of Olive Street -- and I guess before I say this, myself and Mr. McAndrew went on a tour with one of the neighbor s along Silex and the railroad and river corridor in that area. And we've, I mean, got to see some of the camps that were along there. And also one of the businesses in that area recently they decreased their working hours from 8:00 until 7 p.m., due to some of the individuals from these camps in the parking lot and in the area. So, you know, I'd like to put it out there that when we're seeing these business hours decline , we're seeing lights turned off. We're seeing eyes that are not on the streets 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 that could see anything that is occurring or crime that is occurring out there. So it's a real shame that we're giving up ground to some of these individuals . Last night there was a stormwater meeting for Tripp Park and North Scranton as well as some other West Side project s that will be part of the stormwater improvement s that are going to be done to the city. Anyone in Tripp Park and North Scranton may see some drones in the area. They said due to the nice weather this week they're going to be collecting data with drones. So in North Scranton and West Side, you may see some of those in the area. Last night after the meeting a resident did approach me. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to give you an address . I did send an e-mail out to Morgan Fetsock because she seemed to be handling what was going on in Keyser Valley. But the address is 118 South Cameron . It's a property that is actually -- it's on Cameron Ave. But the water that escaped the banks on the creek on Frink Street came right through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 this yard. There is a drain -- drainage basin in the middle of the yard that gets clogged from time to time. And they seem to feel that it was clogged again if we could get over there to clean out that basin on Cameron Avenue. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll send that right now. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Mr. Smurl handled the update for Theodore Street. I guess that will be all for tonight other than to wish Detective Gilmartin good luck and a good time at the State of the Union address . He'll represent the City of Scranton well. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thanks, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. First, I wanted to check in on a request that I had from a couple of weeks ago regarding an updated demolition list. I don't believe that we've been in receipt of that. Is that correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We haven't, Dr. Rothchild . And as I mentioned earlier , as of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 this afternoon , the city advised us that we'll have everything by next meeting . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Including the demolition list? MR. VOLDENBERG : They're behind on those requests . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, because I know there's a number of properties that I've been contacted about that I wanted to ensure are still on that demolition list. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes. That's correct . They are focus on the Cottage Avenue address also. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And then there was another address from some time ago that I've received multiple complaint s about too. I think the last correspondence that I have from you, Mr. Voldenberg , is back from last month. And they were still looking to see if they had gotten a date with the magistrate . Andrew Sunday was suppose d to be checking in on that. So that was the rear of 621 Alder. MR. VOLDENBERG : We're still waiting for a hearing on the Alder Street address . DR. ROTHCHILD : It's been months. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 It's been since like maybe the early fall. MR. VOLDENBERG : It has been, yes. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, well, if we could check back once again. That was all that I wanted to check in on at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motion or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I do. So I'm starting to get complaint s again about not being able to get a permanent exoneration on properties , whether , you know, people are still being billed double garbage fees, triple garbage fees. The house might have been a triplex in the 70s. It might have a double in the 70s or 80s. But these residents have proven every year that no one lives in the supposed apartment s that the city believes they have. And these people are approaching -- if not on fixed income, are approaching fixed income. So nobody should have to pay say if they assume the house is triplex $900 for their garbage bill and then have to wait until the end of the year to get the money back or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 exoneration . It's not working -- or a double. So now with this said, these same resident s are coming to me. So we need to go back and ask. I mean, why -- I know it's -- why. We heard why. But it's just easier to do. Just because it's easier to do doesn't make it right. Or we were told, well, you know, we don't know if someone is going to sneak a tenant in. If there is no one living there 20 years, they're not in the sneaking a tenant in. Right, this process needs to get better. If we have to amend it or do something in the form of an ordinance , then so be it. It's affecting a lot of people that can't afford it. They're deciding on whether -- whether to pay this bill versus that bill because $900 or $600 is getting tied up to the end of the year. It's a lot of money to some people. But in tandem with that, the same people have the issue with the Homestead Act, okay. So what that means is, you're not getting that Homestead Act credit that they get from, you know, the casinos if you own a double 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 and you only live on one side. But it's suppose d to go to the primary resident , the person. So an issue with a young lady that I was speaking to that, you know, she only gets half the homestead because once again she has a double but she hasn't had a tenant in at least 20 years. So she's getting whacked with that. And then she has to pay double garbage fee and wait until the end of the year and have to prove it every year. I think after you prove it one year there's got to be a process in place that not holding these resident s hostage and that's what is seems like with regards to tieing up their money. It's not fair. So this isn't the first time we brought it up or discussed it. But I think it's getting worse. People are getting more irritated and so I think, Solicitor Gilbride , can you take like a look at this or see what we as Council can do to make this more fair for our residents ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yes, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 Also, Mr. Voldenberg , do we -- remember last week I inquired about when you appeal with the LIPS Department the $300 nonrefundable -- whether you're appealing or $50 citation or whatever fine that you have to come up with $300 and it's unrefundable. I don't remember exactly what the rationale was for that. Did we get that or clarity as to why it's 300? Why is it 300 every time and why it's not refundable ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Those same question s were sent out last week and they are part of that group that they claim we will have by next meeting, the answers. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So we're still waiting for them. Okay. And I know I asked a question . It's over a month ago. We had snow twice since then. We didn't have a lot of snow this year. But it was the question regarding a dispatcher which historically was on for the weekends if they knew there was an event or an emergency , whether it's rain or -- and/or snow. This year they didn't do it. We had two -- we had two -- only two snowstorms , both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 were without a dispatcher . And I just want to know. I asked why and what's the plan for that because I got a lot of calls on the one weekend , you know, that the streets were being paved -- not paved, listen to me -- well, that too but that's in the summer; but, you know, plowed and they didn't know who to reach out and no one was responding . So I asked that question a month ago. We still didn't receive anything ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . That was a second request . And per my conversation with them today, they said we'll have -- that will be part of next week's answer. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. McAndrew , if I could chime in on that, I did get an answer although it was unofficial . We do have a dispatch . However , the weekend that the complaint s came in they were not doing DPW overtime from my understanding . So maybe if that's what comes back or if we need to clarify our question at all, it might be the fact that they weren't issuing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 overtime that weekend that we had the snowstorm if that helps. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thanks. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few items. The following were from the South Scranton Neighborhood Association complaint s, 805 Cedar Avenue, trash and other violations on there. A citation was issued. 114 Crown Avenue, a vacant property for trash and I guess furniture in the yard. There was a citation issued there also. 425 Beech Street, issued a citation for trash on the property and also for having a rooster on the property . I guess roosters are not allowed in the city. 217-219 South Irving Avenue, there was trash around that property . It looked like it was in a large bag. I guess code enforcement was there and they were revisited again. And the City Law Department was called again on the following request s for the section of Decon Street to be changed from a one way to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 two-way street. And also the same block on the 301 Green Ridge Street where Schoenberg Salt is, the dead end block of the 1600 of Gardner to vacate that to I believe we want to turn that over to Schoenberg Salt because they have been maintain ing it and it's just a dead end. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MR. SMURL: Okay, so we won't have to do that gain. One other thing, something new that we've started looking at. I asked for the camps again, the garbage fee -- not the garbage fee -- the garbage and the cleanups. And I was asking when we were going to start the cleanups. Evidently we did start the cleanups. Scranton DPW and the police department are working together on cleaning up the camp sites. They sent me picture s all of the units that they've -- or the areas that they have cleaned up so far. And also, there's a sign now that they are using -- the city is using. They put it on site and anybody that wants these picture s just let me know and I'll e-mail them to you. It says City of Scranton and it's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 trespassing sign. It also gives them a warning that in 72 hours the city will be there for further cleanups. And that is to protect the city from any lawsuits for invading their privacy . But I do have all of that. And they actually -- they gave me the tonnage of what they removed so far. The total tonnage they removed to date is 15.4 tons of garbage they cleared up. And it's still all over the place. But they are working on it. As for sites, that's up to Director Pietreface . He goes out. He picks the sites and then they put the signs up with the police department . And that is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

SCHUSTER : Do we know if there has been any changes to it since it was first introduced to us? MR. SMURL: I do have the changes . MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe there were, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yeah, the city's previous parking lot charge what they call a fee. And now that is being changed to a license so that we actually -- the cost remains exactly the same but the license now gives the city a way to have them inspect the building s and also give us structural reports and lighting and other things, stormwater management , ADA compliance , and other blight issues that might occur there. And that's the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 change that they're looking to put into that. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Yes.

SCHUSTER : To the snow, all right. Is there -- were we informed in any way that we wouldn't meet a deadline ? MR. SMURL: They do have a time schedule that they are trying to stick to. That's why I asked that it be moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. I know they had a schedule -- I was going to ask you but I wasn't sure if you knew the -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : They do, in fact, have a scheduled time in which they need to have the documents provided back to them so they could get out to the market at the appropriate time where they feel it will be the best time for them to get the best benefit out of the redo. So time is of the essence . MR. SCHUSTER : I'm looking at the schedule that they had now. Final sale was on the 11th of -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : We are a week behind on it already . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. A fee list was requested , Mr. Gilbride . Did we receive the fee list? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 ATTY. GILBRIDE : It was requested . I did not receive it. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I mean, this is something I spoke about countless times that Council requests something to be provided prior to final vote. And it's not provided . I was just trying to see if we could work around this schedule here to get the information that was requested prior to the final vote. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , just and I know, Mr. Schuster , we've spoke about this before. I did ask them to provide what they could by way of a fee schedule . Obviously , the fee schedule cannot be calculate d until such time as the bonds hit the market. So at best bet what you will get is what they believe to be their opinion as of right now. That could be drastically different from the time they hit the market. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. They did speak to us about if it doesn't meet a certain threshold that they wouldn't be going out for the bond. So I guess I will have to take them for their word on this one here.
