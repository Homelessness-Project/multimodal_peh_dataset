REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN 'S PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comments : ) MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any comments or motions ? MR. PERRY: Just two quick things. I just want to say thank you to DPW that got that light fixed on 17th and Division Street. It actually went up that Monday morning before we even had our meeting so thank you for that, that's taken care of, I know that was out for awhile with a pole being down, it got fixed, the light went on top, so we're good in that area. And really the only thing else I wanted to address with the parade this weekend , I want everybody out there have a good time, stay safe, which is one of the most important things, be mindful when you are driving , there is going to be a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 people, a lot of children out. Like Mr. Rogan said, Colts is having free bus rides. There is Lyft, there is Uber, there is taxis, there is no reason to drink and drive, stay safe, watch out for each other and, you know, don't just visit the downtown , I know downtown is the hub of the parade day, but there is so many other local businesses out there that celebrate and a lot of pockets in the community that have a great time, so just get out there and enjoy yourself . Show your Irish pride and if you are not you can pretend you are for the day and enjoy yourself . That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I just have a couple of comments . I got a couple of complaints last week, actually the week before about the handicapped sign that was out in front of city hall that it was defaced with some sort graffiti , so we reached out to DPW and they took that down to clean that and that will be put up as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 soon as possible . I also got some complaints about the traffic light on Pittston and Birch that was blinking for five or six days and we did reach out to PennDOT and they were reaching out to the signal contractor because they had just put new mast irons in and from what I've seen that issue was fixed. I haven't seen any blinking in the last couple of days, and also there was a sign on the top of River Street where River and Meadow meet. There is a "No Right Turn" on that where you really can't take a right turn, but some of our English as a second language people are taking it more literally that they couldn't right from River Street onto 81 South, so we reached out to PennDOT and they were going to look into that, too. And, also, again, I'd ask for the permits for the Birch Street project . Mrs. Reed, would you be able to -- that's been about three weeks or so since -- and I haven't gotten them, so would you be able to reach out to Mr. Hazzouri again to request those? And that's all I have. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, thank you. First I'd like to talk about the decision to stop the verbatim of the transcription of the public comment beginning with the first meeting of January of this year. First of all, in retrospect yes, it could have been handled slightly better and maybe we could have announced it at our first meeting in January . And, yes, I would be putting more information like the subject of the speakers comment s and maybe some additional information in the minutes in addition to just the name of the speak and I think we work towards that, but you can be assured it was never an intent to deceive anyone from the city council . From my perspective , based on the fact that the city, you know, there is a video record on YouTube , there is a DVD in the library , I wasn't -- to be honest with you, I don't know why there was a problem last week. Clearly technology is made the need for transcription obsolete . Some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 the comments of some of the speakers last week, in my opinion were, quite frankly , over the top. In a world that could always use a little more civil discourse , civility was clearly missing from that meeting . Since I have been on city council we have strived to be efficient and cost effective in our operations , Granicus is one example , the idea sessions are another . Tonight 's resolution for a shared services committee with the school board is another and yes, reducing meeting costs is an another example . To study what other city council s do across the state, Scranton City Council is the outlier with this issue and with other meeting benchmarks as well. Allentown , Altoona , Bethlehem , Easton, Erie, Harrisburg , Hazelton , Lancaster , Reading , Wilkes-Barre, and York not one municipality that was studied transcribed their meetings , and not only just a public part of it, they do not transcribe any part of their meetings . Tens of thousands of dollars have been spent, probably more approaching well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 over $100,000 over the years in transcribing meetings . Was this necessary and needed once the videotaping of meetings began? What we are doing is not good government , it is wasteful government . Additionally , over the course of studying how comparable cities and how their council operates other changes , other things came out, for example , their regular council meeting schedules . Allentown meets twice a month. Altoona meets once a month. Bethlehem meets twice a month. Easton meets twice a month. Erie meets twice a month on the first Wednesday at 9 a.m. and the third Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Harrisburg meets twice a month for a regular council meeting , but has two work sessions included with their meeting schedule . Hazelton meets twice a month for nine months for nine months and once a month for three months. Lancaster meets twice a month. Wilkes-Barre meets twice a month, but also has two work sessions in their schedule . York meets twice a month as well. So you can see Scranton , again, is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the outlier where other council meetings are twice a month or less in every city reviewed . Only two city council s meet as much as Scranton does, yet, they still only have two regular council meetings and are both supplemented with the addition of two work sessions . Personally , I feel the Harrisburg and the Wilkes-Barre model tend to lend themselves to better government and a better dialogue among council members . By having two work sessions , they are able to more fully discuss agenda items together ahead of the regular council meetings . They can more fully discuss other city issues together and also allows them to bring special guests, etcetera , on more regular basis. This is a meeting model I think will make more efficient meetings and more effective government . Over the next month or so, I plan on making a trip to Wilkes-Barre to sit on a work session held by their city council to see firsthand the process that they use and if it could be beneficial . At that time, I will report 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 back to my colleagues and fully discuss this issue. Now is time for such a change? Maybe, maybe not, but I will say there should always be time to make time for good government . So that's all I have tonight on that issue. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the transcription issue. You know, first of all, I think to say that maybe we could have done better, we could have definitely done better. You know, I think it was completely mishandled . As I said earlier in response of Mr. Morgan, I had no clue that we were just ending transcription of public comment , and the fact that the City of Scranton is an outlier to other cities, you know, maybe that's a good thing. You know, when I look at some of the issues that have gone on in this city over the last four years whether it's the Sewer Authority , backdoor meetings with other officials , closed door meetings , you know, what's the harm in transcribing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 public comment or at the very least if, you know, the majority of my colleagues want to end transcribing public comment at least have a summary of what the citizens spoke about, as I think almost all of the other cities do, and I don't think we should work towards that I should it have been yesterday if that's what my colleagues want to do. But, no, I don't think that you know, maybe we could have done it a better way, I think it was mishandled . It was never discussed publically . It was just done with a click of the finger so I had no clue that was being done and I really don't agree with it. Second thing, on the Arcadis study, I have said all along that the administration needs to come to a public caucus, give us an update and when the study is complete , because we have been told time and time again it was going to be done I was told last November or October or November you know, now it's the first quarter , now it's the summer. Well, what's the hold up here? I know that we are having trouble 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 getting a meeting with the Scranton Sewer Authority , but we do need a public meeting on that because it was a very important topic and it is going to continue to be a hot topic in the city. I did receive , again, and this is the third or fourth time, but a traffic issue with trucks driving from the Stauffer Industrial Park on Main Avenue, turning up Oram Street and then turning onto West Gibson Street and getting struck. So we did ask the city engineer months ago to address this issue. The gentlemen that is having some problems with this, he lives on West Gibson Street, sent me pictures again the other day. This is actually an issue so I'm going to get together with Mrs. Reed after the meeting and we'll get in contact with PennDOT because it's my belief that there has to be more signage and I don't think we can ignore that any longer. Also, received some issues, a complaint about Birch Street and South Washington Avenue, residents wanted to know if we could put a streetlight up there -- or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 not a streetlight , a traffic signal. We did get a response from the city engineer that we would have to find funding for that. It could cost somewhere in the $250,000 range and we would first have to have a study completed , so I'll update the residents on that as information becomes available . Also, if we could reach out, Mrs. Reed, to Director Gallagher again about the 1600 block of Church Avenue. Residents are still complaining about flooding there. I did send him pictures , but I haven't heard back yet. As far as I know, we didn't receive anything from the letter I sent February 6 regarding information on the Civil Service Commission , so if we could ask them if they are going to respond to my request or if they are going to just simply ignore it I'd like to know in case I have to do Right-to-Know request . I did before the meeting tonight had a pleasure of meeting with residents of the Greenridge apartments down on Dickson Avenue. I mentioned here before about some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 of the issues that they were having with the management company , Clover Management . I met with -- there was about 30 or 40 residents there, the room was packed, and Jason Kavulich , who is the executive director of the Area Agency on Aging, and Nancy Barrasse , who is their solicitor who specializes in elder law was there, and I really appreciated them answering questions . I continue to be extremely concerned about what is occurring down there with these residents . There were a number of people who actually live there and then there was a lot of people there who would no longer lived there because they were forced out one way or the another . So what happened at the meeting is Attorney Barrasse and Director Kavulich are going to reach out to the Attorney General this Friday and we'll go from there and see what happens , but I just want to -- for those senior citizens in the audience tonight and those who are watching at home, there are a lot of great programs through the Area Agency on Aging, so you can get legal representation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 at a very low cost and there are other services , so I think one of the things that came out of this meeting was you don't have to be afraid. There are people who will listen to you, and I think that was really, you know, a big part of the meeting , people just felt that they weren't being listened to. So there are people that can help you and I think we are on the right path there. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. A couple of the items and then what came up from the meeting then two larger items. Two points, actually three points I want to make first. First is any speaker that brings up something that's incorrect or only partial ly true about my record or something I said is going to be corrected , whether it's on their time or on my time it's going to be corrected . If the speaker would like an additional 30 seconds because a council member was engaging with them that's a courtesy that always should be given to any speaker . Secondly , this is the last time I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 going to address this item regarding the meetings on Monday, the council meetings are set on a date that works best for the five members of council . I know that other members of the community have other engagements and other items going on, but they are set around the five council members schedule s. Since the time I have been on council , I have met on Monday nights, Tuesday nights, Wednesday nights and Thursday nights. The only night we have not met was Friday. So council meetings have changed with the schedule of council , and that's the last of that item to be addressed . Regarding the minutes , and again, this is the last time I'm going to address this item as well, Council Evans hit the nail on the head. I did apologize to my colleagues . I should have announced it at the first meeting and I think I said that last week that it should have been announced publically about the change. That was an error on my end. Sometimes as council people we are so involved in the things that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 we know what we know but we don't think to relay it sometimes , so that was an error on my part. But anyone who is suggesting intent is anything other than to save money and prevent duplication of an item that really is, as Councilman Evans mention ed, extremely outdated is wrong. That is the reason why it was done. And I know another resident brought up that they watch the meeting s on YouTube , I'll say it until I'm blue in the face, that format of seeing of live video, live video or taped correspondence in the meeting is much more powerful than reading the words. So much can be lost in tone and inflection and what's actually meant in the words. When you hear it, you hear it. And if you want to do a gotcha or go back and bring a future recording of something that was said you can still do that as well. That information will continue to be out there and if for some reason there was a problem with ECTV or something happened we would work to continue to make sure meetings are available for the public. So that is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 last time I will address that item as well. Onto some matters of business , there is two items that really could help the City of Scranton that, unfortunately , in most cases the five members up here don't have much control of, one are school property taxes and the other is reassessment . On the issue of reassessment , I did get a little bit of good news and I did forget to mention this in the caucus, but in the meeting with the mayor this morning he did get a reply back from the county from the letter that was sent quite a lot over the last months regarding the reassessment , so a meeting is going to be scheduled with members of the administration , myself and I was going to invite the Finance Chair as well to be part of that meeting to try and convince the commissioners to pursue a reassessment . If that does not happen, I have been on the record of supporting suing the county to force their hand regarding reassessment . Hopefully it doesn't come to that, but if it did it's something that I would certainty support , so that's the first issue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 The second one is school taxes, specifically , school property taxes, and the reason I bring this up is there was an article in the Sunday Times, there was also a number in the regional paper, Citizens Voice, same article , "Legislation to introduce bill to replace school property tax system." Over the last number of the years I have spoken at length about Senate Bill 76, formerly House Bill 1776, Property Tax Relief Act, and as many of you know this bill would eliminate your property tax bill entirely . There are some people that think that's a great idea, I'm one of them, because if you look at your tax bills, which we have all just recently received , your school taxes is by far the biggest portion of your taxes. So in this article , people who support it, people who oppose it go there and discuss their points, but I do have to take issue with something that was said by our senator . Senator Blake says that it's disingenuous for supports of the Bill to talk about it in this way and say they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 touting it. What really upset me about reading this comment is a number of years ago when council was pushing Senator Blake to support Senate Bill 76, he was telling residents , his staff, was telling residents that called up his office that he was going to vote "yes" in support of Senate Bill 76. That vote was a tie vote in the State Senate. Passed the state house on a bipartisan vote, Democrats and Republicans were for it, in the Senate it was a 50/50 split and Senator Blake voted "no" and if he truly believed that this wasn't the best thing to do, that's his choice to believe that, but to tell residents he was going to vote one way and then go there and vote another and now say that it's disingenuous that the proponents of the bill are framing it one way it me is ludicrous . So I would hope that Senator Blake would continue to look into this issue and maybe change his mind for the third time and go back to the supporting the bill because it really would help our city and particularly the senior citizens in our city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 who are paying for enormous tax increases by the school district . On the school district , I'm glad to see we have legislation in regard to shared services , hopefully that could save the school district some money, but how they are funded is still a state issue and it's a major issue and unless our senator gets his act together and starts working on some property tax relief those tax bills are just going to continue to go up. That is all for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Just because I forget to mention it earlier , regarding the public transcription just so I'm clear, are we going to direct the stenographer to include a summary what the speakers talked about? As Councilman Evans said, we are going to work towards that, but when, next week or -- MR. ROGAN: Yeah, that's something we can discuss in caucus more. I don't think would it be on our stenographer to do that, I think it would more on our clerk or our assistant city clerk, but that's something that, as we discussed in caucus, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 we will put a brief summation , for instance , speaker spoke about this issue. That's definitely something that we can certainly put into be in line with all of those comments that councilmen mentioned . MR. GAUGHAN : And the reason I bring that up, just as I was sitting here thinking about this whole controversy that it has turned into, you know, my great-grandfather, Ed Nolan, was president of the South Side Surface Protective Association , so he fought against , you know, the mine companies and the mine owners and the holes that were opening up on Pittston Avenue and my grandmother always told me and my brother and my sister about how we come down to the council meeting s so I was very interested to see if there was a public record of that, and we did look back in the 1940's and he did get up and podium and he spoke and there was a record of that. So I do think there is an importance to that even if there is video and YouTube and all of that kind of stuff, it is a good historical document to have, but putting aside the fact you might 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 not agree with what everybody says and maybe it doesn't make sense or it's totally off topic, but there is a historical background to that so -- MR. ROGAN: I couldn't agree more and when our grandchildren watch the meeting s they can not only read it but be able to see it as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Not everybody has YouTube . Thank you. MS.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE FORMATION OF A SHARED SERVICES TASK FORCE IN COOPERATION WITH THE SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT TO EXPLORE SHARED SERVICES , COSTS AND EXPENSES . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'd just like to make a friendly amendment to change where it reads "Task Force" for it to read "Committee ." MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the amendment passes. MR. GAUGHAN : And then on the question , you know, the concept of shared services has the potential to not only save tax dollars though economies of scale, but to improve both the efficiencies of the school district and the city. Instead of duplicating parallel services , we should really be joining forces and it's my belief that this should have been done a long time ago but I'm very hopeful that this will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 the first step towards not only the city and the school district working together but the city and the county and the school district and all municipalities , Boroughs and townships that surround us. I think that that there will be resistance because of a common mentality , and I have mentioned this before, a mentality from both the school district and the city that this is the way we have done things for the last 100 years so we need to continue to do it this way. I think that when we are forming this committee and they report back to council and we are looking at ways to share services we need to rise above these fears and everybody who has their fights in the city and the school district , and these old ways of thinking, this old mentality, and we need to do what's best for the taxpayers in our community . And I read a very interesting quote from an article from Governing Magazine and it was about shared services and it said, "When common sense does battle with common fears and practices , good new ideas will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 crushed in the conflict ." So I think that we need to make sure that we do not let good ideas get crushed in the conflict and we need to work together with the school district because it benefits both of us and it benefits the taxpayers . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? MR. EVANS: Yes, on the question . I will comment on one phrase that Councilman Gaughan made is exactly true, this is the way it's always been done. That is the death nail of efficient government . Over and over and over again that is what stymies improvement and efficiencies in government , sort of like transcribing the minutes , just like that. Always been done that way. MR. ROGAN: Yes. MR. EVANS: Anyway, that's all I have on that comment . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else. MR. ROGAN: I want to add, too, when we're looking at we are going to meet and report back to council , the full body, but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 when we are looking at different ways, I mean, right off the top of my head, and I think this has already been discussed , where we can share services , purchasing , our IT Departments , legal services , things of that nature and really when you look at other communities not only in Pennsylvania , but across the country they have been doing this for decades now, so I think we are behind the times on, you know, tearing down these barriers between whether it be the county and school district and the city and other Boroughs and municipalities , tearing down the barriers to be able to work with them and share services , because we need to do this for what's best for all of the taxpayers in our community .
