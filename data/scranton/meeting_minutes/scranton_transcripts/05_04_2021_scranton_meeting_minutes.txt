MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world, for those who have passed away recently in our city, especially Sam Vitris former DPW employee and Union President who served the City and served honorably for over 40 years. Mr. Vitris was hired June 26th, 1980. DPW workers often don't get recognized enough for the dangerous and often difficult job that they have to do. And Sam Vitris performed his duties honorably . He fought on behalf of the employees in the DPW for years and our prayers go out to him and his family. This is a big loss not only for the DPW, and it's a big loss for the City of Scranton . We also want to have a moment of silence again for all of the people in our community , in our country and around the world who are suffering because of this pandemic . Let us continue to pray for the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals who seek to heal and help those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 affected and who put themselves at risk in the process , may they have protection and peace.

DONAHUE : I would just, you know, my thoughts and prayers go out to, you know, Sammy's wife Judy, his kids and the rest of his family and the DPW as a whole.

So there are a lot of events and things going on. You can go to the website Observe scranton .org. There is plenty of information on there. So it's a great opportunity to learn about Jane Jacobs and what she stood for and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 participate in some of the events. I also want to give my condolences to the family and friends of Sammy Vitris. I'm very sorry to hear of his passing. And I also wanted to mention someone else who passed a week ago. She was actually a neighbor . She lived a few houses down from me, Beverly Coyne. She was 81 years old. But she was the secretary to former Mayor James J. Walsh and then she was a clerk to District Justice Eugene Cadden. And she was also married to a retired fire captain of our Scranton Fire Department . So, you know, definitely a great loss to the Coyne family and I wanted to give my condolences to them as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Earlier today Governor Wolf announce d that his administration is lifting the COVID-19 mitigation orders for masking -- except for masking at 12:10 a.m., on Monday, May 31st. So Council will reassume in person meetings in Council Chambers starting on Tuesday , June 1st, 2021. Masks will still be required . We will have further details on any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 safety protocol s for the in-person meeting s in the next few weeks. As I mentioned in the caucus tonight , we do have a new City Clerk which I want to welcome Frank Voldenberg . Frank took over yesterday and was sworn in by Magistrate Corbett . So anyone who is going to submit public comment for the next three weeks because we'll be doing the Zoom meeting for the next three weeks in May, you could send your comment s to Frank's e-mail. His e-mail is Fvoldenberg , V-O-L-D-E-N-B-E-R-G, Scrantonpa .gov. And that goes until Tuesday at 3 p.m., the day of the meeting at 3 p.m. That's the cutoff. And if you want to mail your comment s and, of course, as always send them to 340 North Washington Avenue, attention City Clerk, second floor, 18503. And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Patricia Nestor, John White, Joseph Healey, Norma Jeffries , Marie Schumacher and Charlie Spano. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mr. Voldenberg , will you please read the comments into the record at this time? MR. VOLDENBERG : The first submission is from Miss Patricia Nestor and read as follows : I would like to know what authority Chrissy Manuel from United Neighborhood Center has over city property ? She never ran for public office nor has been elected by taxpayers . On what authority does her and UNC get to decide the fate of Capouse Pool or paint hideous murals in our neighborhood ? If she wants to make decisions regarding public parks, she should run for office! Once again nonprofits have more say in the city than the taxpayer . Penn Ridge is a pool, not a splash pad! 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 On Friday April 30, 2021 Mayor Cognetti stated that Capouse Pool is set for demolition . When did you as a council vote on that? When did you even discuss it? Why is the fate of city property in the hands of a nonprofit ? The United Neighborhood Center should not be making decisions that the representatives of the taxpayers should! UNC is making decisions based on the goals of their financial backers , not the tax payers. The taxpayers built that pool with the intention of keeping it as a pool. It's a shame city government let it become a mess through lack of care and maintenance . That doesn't give nonprofits the right to take over. Who ordered the demolition of Capouse Pool without your authority ? MR. VOLDENBERG : The second submission is from Mr. John white and Reads as follows : City Council : I'm writing today to gain your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 attention to an ongoing health issues in our neighborhoods . The dust, dirt and other debris from pgw making cuts in the road for gas lines. We can't keep our neighborhoods clean. Every land fill truck that goes by Our homes kicks up more choking grime And many trucks travel wheeler ave every day. Among other issues of nuisance ,we have, in our neighborhood . The very serious health issues of asthma, copd and more. Here are some cheap and effective things that can be helpful in remedying this issue city wide.* * enlist our fire department to power hose right behind the utility vehicles . *agree with university , hospital or other non profit to do the same. *Contract . With Mr. Denaples to do the same. *encourage neighborhood citizens to organize and hose down the fronts of their homes, regularly . *future Scranton times article : “Scranton Voted one of the cleanest cities in U.S.*.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Encourage neighborhood citizens to organize and pick up their hoses sand hose of their properties regularly ...not. If I haven't been successful in relaying the severity of this situation , please feel free to join me with coffee tomorrow morning or any time in the 500 block of wheeler to breathe for yourself . Wear your mask. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : The third submission is from Mr. Joseph Healey and reads as follows : I was very encouraged to learn that Scranton has joined with the city of Lancaster and Delaware and Montgomery counties in an amicus brief that backs the Philadelphia /CeaseFirePA lawsuit . At last weeks meeting , it was a bit unclear though if the resolution to become a member of "The Pennsylvania Gun Safety Alliance " was in order to join the amicus brief or if this was a separate measure being taken? Councilman Schuster hit the nail on the head when he said, "Council is starting to get into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 things that are out of the jurisdiction of a municipal " because that is the exact point of the entire lawsuit . The state should be enacting common sense uniform laws from border to border to protect Pennsylvanians , but since the Republican held congress simply will not do this, it is absurd that cities within the state (besides Philadelphia ) are unable to enact safety measures on their own and must sit and wait for their citizens be victimized . Many citizens were extremely concerned about the safety of poll workers and voters during the 2020 elections (and how right they were to be so) and when I had asked council if they could at least enact bare minimum safety measures like prohibiting firearms within so many feet of polling stations , I was very kindly informed by attorney Hayes that the city's hands were in fact tied because we are not a class 1 city and therefore are prohibited from enacting any such common sense safety measures . If joining the "Pennsylvania Gun Safety Alliance " or any other organization that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 can help facilitate the city's power to protect its citizens then I would strongly urge you to do so. ISSUE 2 Could anyone please explain the sudden change in parking patterns for the residents of St. Ann's St.? Was parallel parking always the law there? Did some legislation recently change this, or was it simply never enforced in the past. MR. VOLDENBERG : The fourth submission is from Miss Norma Jeffries , the letter states: Regarding : Street Sign Project . Over the last 4 years, I have been given the opportunity to discuss my concern on the condition of the street signs in Scranton . At that time, in 2017, I was a new resident of Scranton and was constantly either late for appointments or lost in the city because of the lack of street signs. The condition of the street signs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 throughout the city became a passion of mine. City Council was gracious enough to listen to my concerns , as I asked for updates on the project . Whenever , I requested an update, it was always freely given. The last update, I was told that a grant was being requested for the funds. Therefore , it was with great excitement when I was told that a grant had been secured for the replacement of the street signs in the entire city of Scranton . What a gift to the residents and visitors to Scranton . I want to take this opportunity to put a stamp of DONE on my letters and to say Thank You to City Council , Thank You, Mayor Cognetti , Marty Flynn and Kyle Mullins for assisting and securing the grant for the Scranton Street Signs. I look forward to seeing the new signs in place in the near future. Again, I say,,,, Wow!! Wow!! Wow!! For a job well done. MR. VOLDENBERG : The fifth submission is from Marie Schumacher and it reads as follows :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 First I want to give a shout out to our City Forester , Tony Santoli . The wind gusts we had last week could have caused havoc if Tony hasn't been marking dangerous trees for trimming or removal for over two decades without receiving a penny from the taxpayers . About a decade or so ago Tony campaigned to place trees in front of homes if the home owners were willing . Thanks to his efforts we have streets with beautiful trees. Some have flowers in the Spring while the leaves of others provide vivid colors in the Fall. Which ever they add much beauty while cleaning the air. Next, I would like to welcome City Clerk Frank Voldenberg . As reported by the Times Tribune , Astra Wealth Advisors will be moving to Clarks Green. While the owner spoke well of Scranton he also mentioned some negatives and I wonder if any member of Council had or has scheduled a debrief which might help in the effort to bring business to the City.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Mr. Gaughan will probably be the only member of Council who remembers the December 2015 release of the Chamber of Commerce Community Revitalization plan that it hoped would secure the top prize in the America 's Best Communities competition and provide vision and unity to guide redevelopment of downtown Scranton . I am asking the Chamber be invited to Council to report the outcome of this five-year effort. I believe it was 2018 when Council authorized a ten-year LERTA with the expectation ten-years downstream there would be a substantial property tax increase . The missing element was a definition of substantial . I am asking Council to ask the Administration to begin using expectation metrics when a new program is sent to Council for approval and report regularly on those metrics if approved . While on the LERTA topic I would like to report that I saw a new, what I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 consider bait-and-switch, billboard . This one went Make Scranton your home office. Pay zero taxes for 10 years. Mr. Gaughan , you know LERTA only applies to the increase in improvements made. I do not know why the CIty allows such misinformation on billboards . What Finally , I have never known a responsible organization developing a new system without maintaining the current system until the new system was perfected . The City's website is an embarrassment . It is a beautiful skeleton but there is no meat on the bones. You can' find nothing . This has got to be corrected . MR. VOLDENBERG : The sixth submission is from Mr. Charlie Spano and reads as follows : I would like to thank the Council , the Mayor and the great employees at DPW for your assistance in this effort to honor and remember Walter Pasiak. He was a real hero and a great example of an honorable , good man. Thank you. See you at Noon May 8th at 416 Breck St. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MR. VOLDENBERG : And that ends the public comment . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . Okay. On the question for the public comment . MR. DONAHUE : On the question , first off in terms of Miss Jeffries , I just want to thank her for her strong and consistent advocacy on the street sign issue. Back when I was new to Council about three years ago, I don't know if it was right before or right after I got on. I can't remember . But I know that when she first brought this up, I know Councilman Gaughan inquire d with then Business Administrator Dave Bulzoni who reported back to Council that there was a need for an up-to-date assessment and list of signs throughout the City in order to even apply for these grants. So, you know, back in September of '18 we, you know, unanimous ly approved a contract for the company to perform that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 assessment. So I just wanted to just say so in addition to, like, the current administration and State Representative Flynn and Mullins , I also think that Councilman Gaughan and Mr. Bulzoni should also be recognized and thanked for spearheading the legwork that was necessary to get us to this point. And then also on Miss Schumacher 's comment s, I also saw those billboard s and I had the same thought . So, Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to reach out to the Chamber of Commerce regarding those billboard s to see exactly what they mean by those? Because I know a LERTA isn't 100 percent tax free. And that's all I have on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, Council man Gaughan , I will do that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I'd like to speak to Mr. Healey's issue too inquiring about the sudden change in parking patterns for residents on St. Ann's Street. So about a couple months ago we started getting a couple warning s it was on Facebook that, you know, parallel parking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 would no longer be allowed . And it's been allowed for my 58 years that I have lived here. So I dug a little deeper and found out that some residents were complaining about the parking. And then I also received residents on the other side saying why are we no longer being able to park? It's the widest street in the City. So my understanding is there was never legislation on the books that allowed for to us park for -- for angle parking . So in order to do so, I requested a study be done, a traffic study to see if, in essence , we are actually able to do it and have that approved . So that's where we're at with that. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? I just want to address a few items that came up in the public comment . So first I want to thank all six of those individual s who submitted public comment . As I mentioned earlier in the meeting , we will get back to in person meetings on June 1st. So, you know, this obviously has not been the most ideal situation conducting a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 public meeting like this. It's worked for our circumstances with the pandemic . But again, we are going to get back into chambers on June 1st. Miss Nestor's comment s about the United Neighborhood Center and Chrissy Manuel. So there's no great conspiracy theory that's going on here between UNC and the City. The United Neighborhood Center has been a huge benefit to the City of Scranton , huge benefit . Just in terms of what they did in conjunction with the City and other entities on Cedar Avenue in South Scranton , there's been a major revitalization there. We're hopefully going to see the same thing happen in Pine Brook which is desperately , desperately needed. So again, I know the term non-profit has a negative connotation sometimes . But there are non-profits who do very good work and the United Neighborhood Center and Chris Manuel do a wonderful, wonderful job. In terms of Capouse pool, Council would not have any control over the Mayor's decision to demolish the pool. I know that there has not been a final determination on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 what exactly is going to go there. I know that the initial conversations were that they want to put some sort of recreation there which I'm in favor of. But that decision has not been made yet. And Miss Nestor's comment s that the City property is in the hands of a non-profit is not true. The City still retains control over that property . So I hope that clears that up. We'll send Mr. White's comments to the administration about Wheeler Avenue and some of the issues that he brought up, which I think were very good. As for Mr. Healey's comment s, I think I could answer at least one of his questions about the Pennsylvania Gun Safety Alliance . His question was, did that have anything to do with the City joining that -- the lawsuit with the City of Lancaster and Delaware , Montgomery counties . No, those were two separate things. So the resolution on our agenda last week which was tabled was completely separate from the lawsuit that the administration entered which Council did not have a vote on or anything to do with.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 So the Mayor was able to make that decision on her own without Council 's approval . So I hope that answers that. I want to thank Miss Jeffries for her comments and for her activism on that issue of street signs. Miss Jeffries always comes to Council with good question s and good ideas to help the City and saw the fruits of her labor come to fruition which is nice. And then Miss Schumacher 's comments Councilman Donahue address ed one of them. We'll try to get some answers for some of the questions that were posed. And I would agree with her on her comment about Tony Santoli , the City Forester . He's been a great asset to the City over the last few years. And he does it for free. He does it as a volunteer . He does not get paid for that position . And that's all I have. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : I have nothing at this time. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have no motions or comment s tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I'd just like to welcome Mr. Voldenberg and wish him the best of luck in his new position . The City's paving program started . Some of the streets have been paved already . I know one of the -- two of the worst sections of the City I think besides Boulevard Avenue were the Wintermantle stretch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 from Beech Street -- or Birch Street to the dead end. And that has been paved. And another one that was like a -- it really was like a roller coaster going down was the 18, 19 and 2000 blocks of South Webster Avenue. And that (audio interruption ) I think that those really are beneficial because those were, you know, two of the worst stretches in the City. Also, the Keyser Valley stormwater and flood mitigation study has officially begun. We approve d that contract about a month or two ago. But, you know, just a reminder this is a necessary first step to begin to address the flooding issues the resident s of the Keyser Valley have been dealing with. So that has gotten underway. And one of the request s I have for the administration maybe we could try -- I guess we'll send it to the Business Administrator , Carl Deeley but, Mr. Voldenberg , could you just request an update on the downtown kiosk project ? I know that we've gotten -- got a lot of information before the pandemic regarding that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And I know -- I think they even set up places where they were going to go. But I don't think we heard anything since then. So -- but that's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of that, Councilman Donahue . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Just a couple things, Miss Schumacher had asked a question a week or two ago about the RACP grant for City Hall, for renovations to City Hall. Eileen Cipriani responded today that the City did apply again for the RACP grant in the most recent round that closed March 31st, 2021. The City applied for 1.8 million . And she's hopeful that they are announcing the awards by the end of May. So we should hopefully know something by the end of May which is a good thing. We had -- I had two citizen 's complaints . One was a dangerous tree on Drinker Place in Green Ridge. A neighbor had called me about it. So I did send that over to DPW and they are going to investigate that. And then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 there's a building in Hill Top in the Scranton housing complex . I've gotten complaint s about this over the years and it's nonstop , loud vulgar music and a bunch of other things. So the neighbor s up there are very upset about it. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'd like -- we've done this before. But if we could send another letter to the Scranton Housing Authority and the Scranton Police Department just making them aware. The police department is aware and so is the Housing Authority . But for whatever reason there are still issues up there. So if can you just let them know that we're starting to get complaints again. That would be good. MR. VOLDENBERG : Okay. MR.
