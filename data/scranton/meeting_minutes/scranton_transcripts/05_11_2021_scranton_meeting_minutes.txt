The second announcement I would like to make is about a fundraiser for Shane Conway. Shane Conway happens to be our City Clerk Frank Voldenberg 's son in law. And I just want to read from the Go Fund Me page and just explain kind of what's going on here in case anyone would like to help out and help Shane and his family. So there is a fundraiser right now a Go Fund Me page to benefit Shane Conway and his family during his recent medical emergency and ongoing treatment . If you know Shane which I do and I know some of us on Council know Shane, you know he's a lighthearted , funny and very sweet person.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 After a sudden onset of headaches , his parents took him to the ER. Following testing , the doctors discover ed a large mass in his brain. He was transfer red to the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia for -- in Philadelphia and following testing , they did a brain surgery to remove half of the mass at that time at the University of Pennsylvania . His fiance' Jess and his parents, Kevin and Karen Conway travelled with him while their 16-month-old daughter Caroline remained in Scranton with family members . Following his first surgery , he developed brain swelling which required another emergency surgery to relieve pressure on his brain. A third surgery was then perform ed to remove more of the remaining mass. Shane and his family now have a very long road ahead of them. He'll require frequent trips to the University of Pennsylvania for followups , rehab and treatments to continue his fight. Last Saturday or two Saturdays ago while Shane was in the ICU, Shane and his fiance Jess Voldenberg were married over Zoom 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 in a beautiful ceremony attended by immediate family. Shane is fighting very hard to regain his strength through rehab and continue to heal following his multiple surgeries . And Shane and his family are in need of love and support and positivity at this time. Donations will be used to assist Shane and his family with expenses like medical , household , travel and care during the time of need. So I'd ask everyone to please keep Shane, Jess, Caroline and family in your prayers. And if you would like to donate which I hope -- I know that the City of Scranton always comes through . They actually have raised a lot of money for Shane already . If anyone would like to donate, you could go to www.gofundme.com and has it's hashtag Stand With Shane. And know that how expensive it is with medical bills and household and travel so literally every penny really will help this family out. And knowing Shane personally , great guy and anything that we could do to help him 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 would be greatly appreciated . And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : Did Bill get kicked out? MR. SCHUSTER : Would you like me to make a motion to accept -- MR. DONAHUE : At this time, someone please make a motion to accept public from the following individual s -- I don't have the list in front of me. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll read them. MR. DONAHUE : Thanks, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. John White, Ms. Fay Franus, and Misters Meyer and Joe Moskovitz . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept public comment . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a been a motion made and a second to accept public comment . Mr. Voldenberg , please read the comments into the record. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. There have been three submissions . The first submission is from Mr. John White and reads as follows : City Council , Thank you so much for attending to our street cleaning on Wheeler . It's nice to be able to breathe fresh air. We have another serious and potentially dangerous situation in our neighborhood in the 500 block of Stipp Court. It is overgrown with vegetation ,litter,face masks, cigarette butts, empty liquor bottles , beer cans and other crap. Kids play there. Very dangerously . We hope that you could rake a look into this. Some of us will be glad to volunteer to clean up this mess. We would need permission and protection to do this. We invite you to our neighborhood for a tour anytime . Some suggestions to consider : Enforce ordinance that requires utility companies to clean up Dailey. Enlist fire department to power wash streets (wouldn't have to move cars) Request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 university , hospital or other non profit assistance . (Have you ever noticed how beautiful the U of S grinds are? Their grounds crews are great). One of my day dreams: Future Scranton times head line: Scranton voted one of cleanest city's in US. Thank you John white Wheeler Avenue MR. VOLDENBERG : The second submission is from miss Fay Franus and read as follows : Council , I would like to know if council will consider forming a commission to review the Home Rule Charter to see if it can go on the ballot to revamp it. It is long overdue . Scranton really needs the Home Rule Charter to be revised so that the residents can not be constantly taxed any amount the city deems necessary to cover their bills. Right now I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 believe there is no cap on the amount you can tax the residents . You know as well as I do and the resident that this is the way to go to protect the citizens from Scranton 's enormous taxes. There was a man on the talk back segment on a local radio station yesterday who said "If you are thinking of buying a home DON'T BUY ONE IN SCRANTON ! Because when you go to sell it you won't get anything for it because of the high taxes-no onne will want it" When I asked this question weeks ago Kyle Donahue told me the state had a lot to do with the taxes in Scranton . That is NOT TRUE!! Scranton has the say as to how high to tax their people. Everyone knows any mistake in past administrations like Mayor Courtrights they simply tax the people to cover the cost of their mistakes -- Example Ned Abrahamsen 's lawyer's fees. $400,000 or more with no receipts to show what he did to earn that money. The list is very long but you know exactly what I am talking about.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 The Home Rule Charter needs to be put on the ballot for an overhaul and revision . The people have had enough of being taxed out of their homes. Please do not come back to me in your replies about the State again--Scranton needs to take necessary steps to find a way to pay their own bills without going to the taxpayers all of the time. You always want to take the easy way out by thinking "WE'll just tax the people we've been doing it for years we will just keep doing it" Allow the people to make that decision , form a commission and get the Home Rule Charter on the ballot. I would also like to know this evening where each council member stands on reassessment -for or against . Fay Franus MR. VOLDENBERG : The third submission is from Misters Myer and Joe Moskovitz reads as follows : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Dear City Council Members : Please accept this brief correspondence representing my concerns with the above referenced property located at 616 Cedar Avenue, Scranton . By way of introduction , I am the owner of a property at 610-612 Cedar Avenue located immediately adjacent to the subject property at 616 Cedar Avenue. I cannot express my immense gratitude to City officials for including in your proposed demolition contract this long standing condemned and dilapidated eyesore that has posed a significant risk to my property and the surrounding community for more than a decade. However , I do have some very serious concerns pertaining to the demolition of the structure at 616 Cedar as we share common walls that can pose issues in maintaining the integrity of my structure during demolition . Again, please allow me to stress that I am excited about the possibility of the City implementing a process to finally remove this hazard. As I note, the two structures share a two story common wall and I would like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 information as to how the demolition contractor might address my concerns . Also, I have a second floor tenant that could be affected by the proposed demolition . I could share much more information with Council on the many years and challenges I have endured in dealing with this less than responsible property owner. The purpose of this correspondence is to be placed into the record in order to apprise the appropriate City officials of my interest and concern in this demolition proposal . In conclusion please permit me once again to thank City Council and the Mayor for your consideration and your efforts in remedying the removal of these blighted properties including the property listed at 616 Cedar Avenue. Sincerely , Myer Moskovitz (Concluded public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MR. VOLDENBERG : And that ends 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Citizens Participation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . Okay. So there's been a motion to accept public comment and a second. On the question ? Anyone on the question ? Okay, a couple things, first of all, I want to thank Mr. White, Miss Franus and Mr. Moskovitz for submitting public comment . As to Miss Franus's comment s, I've been on record, you know, now multiple times supporting reassessment . I know there was an article in the newspaper today. I think that's common sense at this point. But I've been on the record and had stated my thought s on that in the past. But, yes, I am in favor of it. And, Mr. Voldenberg , can you forward Mr. Moskovitz 's comment over to Eileen Cipriani from OECD and try to hook him up with her. She would be the person to talk to in regards to demolition of 616 Cedar Avenue. Maybe they could work that out. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, I'll handle it, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And that's all I have. Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 question ? MR. DONAHUE : Just on the question quickly in terms of Miss Franus's comments , I'm 100 hundred percent for reassessment. I think reassessment is about fairness and equity. I think the commissioners are fighting a losing battle by continuing to fight this lawsuit . The same argument they've used has been shot down in two different counties in similar cases already . I believe it was Allegheny and Beaver. So I think they're going to lose it anyway. So let's just get that process moving. In terms of her comments regarding my comments to her comment s last week I believe , it is -- it's not that the state controls it; it's that the state controls what we could tax. And we have to modernize our revenue so that we can modernize our government and make it sustainable . I know that was a point that we've, you know, this whole Council 's made. We made that point back in the 2021 budget. And just reading off one of Mrs. Franus's comment s regarding the 2021 budget, she did state, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 know, and I quote, "Mayor Cognetti wanted to create new jobs and give raises. Did you ever stop to think let's trust the Mayor's judgment on this and allow her -- plans to go through , no, not any of you wanted to broaden your view on how Scranton can grow. Shocking." A way Scranton could grow is by modernizing our tax base so that we get organic growth out of the taxes we do bring in so that we're not raising rates. That is the way that we grow. That is my point that we need the state legislation to be able to actually grow the City and modernize the City. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have two things quickly . First, to Mr. White's participation , I did e-mail him because I am interested in visiting his property to find out about some more of those issues. I am in his neighborhood . So I'm aware of some of the things. But I'm going over there to find out more. And secondly to Miss Franus's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 comments with regard to the Home Rule Charter , I believe that we do need to take a look at the Home Rule Charter just because it has not been thoroughly reviewed. And I don't know when that's actually happened. So I do think that is a good thing to regularly review that if there are any changes that need to be made or updates to the Home Rule Charter . But that's -- I think that's something that we can bring to the administration 's desk to see if there is anything that we can do to start reviewing that or if that is already on their agenda. The second thing on reassessment , I'm also on record as being in favor of reassessment. I strongly stand in support of that. I would love for the City to be able to do something about it. Unfortunately , we need the county to take up that measure first and if there is anything we could do to add pressure on them then I would like to. That's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 reassessment question posed by Miss Franus, I've always been in favor for reassessment and continue to do so. So I'm answering her question . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : And then also to answer that question , I would also be in favor of reassessment . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : I did have a few comments . One, I was happy to see the police department honored the 13 officers who died in the line of duty. One of those I personally knew, he and his wife, a great individual and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 great father. The second is about Keyser Valley. I know there's going to be a couple comment s about the complaint s received about Keyser Valley and there was water issues up here during the recent storm. I was thinking about getting some discussion had about the maintenance of storm drains. We did have a little bit of a discussion during caucus. And I think there will be a motion possibly made tonight to -- as a step one in the situation of clearing up some of the water issues that occur all over the City. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a motion and a couple complaint s that I'd like to put on record. So first the motion, back in December the administration informed us that there was a surplus . We've seen it in TV ads. We've seen it in flyers. We've inquired about this surplus a few times and received no information . So with that said, I would like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 make a motion to request the amount of the City surplus and all related data explaining and showing this surplus . MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , I did pose this question a while ago. And the answer that I received on it was that they could not give a definite amount on the surplus yet because they were still paying bills from 2020. So that is the explanation that I got. And that was, jeez, maybe a month, a month and a half ago. I don't know if that has changed. But I'll support the motion because I would also like to know what the end result is on the surplus . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 ayes have it and the motion passes. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So I have a couple other concerns . Some of these were brought forward -- that I brought forward a few months back so bear with me. So back in November , a concern citizen approached me with regards to the 1200 block of Lenahan Avenue. There's all types of debris scattered . And the response from the LIPS Department is that an inspector will go out. So I also received another complaint regarding this property , you know, with a bunch of pictures . So I don't know what the outcome was from the first visit from the LIPS Department . But looks like it has gotten worse. So I would like Mr. Voldenberg to please send some correspondence as a followup . And, Mr. Voldenberg , I mean, I will forward the e-mails I have because there's a bunch of picture s so you'll have something to go off of, all right? So that's the first concern and complaint I have. And then let's see, this was on March 22nd. I brought this up in Council in the Fifth Order. There was a gentleman that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 lives across the street from 812 Luzerne Street. This is a property next to my home. There's been problems for years. I went through all of that. And then I received -- and I don't think anything was done there. I'm not sure. I need a followup on this. The e-mail I received is very lengthy . I'll just hit some bullets here that I guess there was something sent but showing up as nondelivery and non claimed . I guess the landlord has moved out of state. But the amount of debris and safety issues still remain. There's a chimney that's half -- that has almost fallen down. They're still finding hyperdermic needles . The smell of marijuana continues . This is lengthy but there is multiple mattresses , garbage bags, loose trash, TV sets, etc. This was the original complaint that was in March. So also, Mr. Voldenberg , I will forward so that, you know, so you'll be able to compose a letter to send to the LIPS Department and probably the police department because there's a lot of safety issues here and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 criminal activity . So that's the second one. And we were talking about, you know, stormwater . I know it's a big issue. I know we talked about it in caucus. I know that we approved an engineering outfit to do an overall assessment . And we know it's going to take years. But this complaint was last week. So this is a gentleman that lives on 12 Ridgeview Drive in Scranton . That's the West Side part of Fawnwood . So I guess there is two storm drains, one below and one above him. The owner that he just purchased his house from was promised that they were putting another one in because there was a need. It was identified as a need. So this gentleman spoke to someone in the -- MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, we lost your audio. MR. MCANDREW : -- front of my home and through my backyard. The neighbor to my rear also experiences extreme flooding to his backyard and water passes through my property onto his. He's experienced the issue since his home was built 11 years ago. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 The remedy of this issue is simply installing a stormwater drain in front of my home. And this was promised to him -- not to him to the previous owner. Both of my neighbors across the street from me have drains install ed but are undersized to handle the amount of water causing it to come onto his property . So his needs are simple. I know we're looking at a big overall assessment that will take years. But I guess someone did come out to look at it. And I don't know if he was satisfied or if nothing was done. Mr. Voldenberg , could you please send correspond regarding this one and like I said earlier , I will forward you the e-mail that I'm reading from so it will be easier to do so. And in closing , all three or four that I'm submitting , please, you know, ask that we get some feedback , especially the ones that, you know, that we talked about in the past that were a couple months ago and make sure we get updated on all of these. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few. First, as we spoke about in caucus, we did receive a response from Mr. Deeley about our request for a personnel report. However , we only received information about the current open positions with the City. And we're looking for more of a comprehensive report. So I would like to ask Mr. Voldenberg to send a second correspondence to them clarifying that we were looking for a more complete report. We appreciate the information that we've already received so -- and, if not, why they wouldn't be willing to provide that to us. And what I also mention ed in caucus is that the building permits task force started meeting last week. And I was interested in hearing from more resident s or a contractor s, workers in the City who've had issues with our permitting process because I think the more that I hear from others about it, then I'm able to bring those concerns to the task force to be addressed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And we did receive an e-mail. I'm not sure if anyone else had forward ed it along but I'm happy to if not. They are actually properties that I sent in complaint s about previously to the LIPS Department . And that's -- those were from Mr. Brian Grassi regarding the 200 block of Harrison Avenue right after the Harrison Avenue bridge going eastbound . There are two properties adjacent to each other on that block and they both look like they are in pretty poor condition . So I'm also interested in knowing the status of those two properties and so if Mr. Voldenberg could send that complaint up to the LIPS Department . If we need their exact address I could get that and forward that along. And then one other thing, I seen some complaints about -- was related to some work that they're doing over near Geisinger . And I believe it's the water main replacement . And there are construction vehicles that are operating pretty late into the evening . There are operating as late as 11:00 last night. So it's disturbing to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 resident s and the neighbors there. And I would like to have correspond ence sent to DPW to find out, you know, if we can keep them within a certain time period. That's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just a couple comments on some issues regarding DPW I received . A gentleman reached out regarding the road, like the pavement on Rachel's Place. It's just a little one block, not even a whole block -- road off South Garfield over by the Villa Maria in West Side. I did reach out to DPW today. And they did have that on the list to have it patched and then swept. Also, I know I sent a couple requests regarding a storm drain on Emmett Street that still has not been fixed. We did -- after our last request about three weeks ago, we got a reply from PA American Water that it will be fixed that week. But, you know, as of today it was still -- so we'll followup on that one too. I did talk to Tom Preambo a little bit about that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 this afternoon . And I also talked to him about some flooding issues at the end of Froude Avenue up on East Mountain , a resident had reached out. It's sort of at the dead end there. And the water is just flowing up and -- flowing up the end of the street which was recently paved by PA American Water. And it's already starting to erode the street and then it's going down the side of the property and eroding the side hill there. So I know that they are going to send out a supervisor to look at and to see and determine if it's, you know, that was caused by the water company 's project or if it's something we can easily fix. But I know there are, you know, there have been a lot of issues especially last Tuesday regarding some of the upkeep of some of the storm basins. So we'll also request , you know, from DPW what, you know, an outline of what they are doing currently in terms of properly maintain ing our riverbed, our stream beds, our, you know, conduit beds to make sure that we don't have any issues. That's usually how you avoid issues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 is by that preventative maintenance . But I'll put that request in tomorrow morning . And we'll go from there. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few things. So it seems like the theme of tonight is stormwater and flooding problems . One thing that I will mention is that I know because of the storm the DPW has probably been inundated with all sorts of problems across the City. So I know they are trying to get to all of these different sites and take care of these issues. But, of course, you know, it is going to take them some time. I do have two issues over in North Scranton that I was approached about. Frank, I would like to -- if you could reach out to DPW and I know the DPW is aware of both of them. I would just like kind of an update on exactly what the plan is to address these when they get time. So the first one is in regards to Leggett 's Creek in North Scranton . I was approached by a gentleman who lives in the 500 block of Leggett Street during that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 unbelievable rain storm that we had within the last week, a woman actually had to be evacuate d out of her home, a couple homes on Leggett Street were flooded pretty badly. So in speaking to this gentleman , he had told me kind of the history behind that part of Leggett 's Creek. And at one time the DPW used to go out every so often and dredge the creek to make sure that things like that did not happen. He told me that the City was out there at one point within the last year or two but something happened they had to pull out. And they couldn't do it. He said it was something to do with DEP. But he believes and other neighbor s down there believe that dredging the creek would probably prevent the flooding issues when we have a major rain storm like that. I'm not an engineer . And I don't know if that's true. But it seems the history of the area prove that probably would be correct since they were back there for a long time. And, Frank, I'll send over to you via e-mail. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 But the 500 block of Leggett Street my question would be, does the City have plans to dredge the creek? When was the last time the creek was dredged ? And what is that process like because I don't really know anything about it. The second one is 189 Yard Avenue I spoke with a woman this afternoon who lives at that property . Her backyard was completely wiped out. A pool was -- an in-ground pool was destroyed , all sorts of problems there. Mr. Preambo was there out, a gentleman from DEP, Chris Kulick was out there as well at one point. And I'd just like an update as to what can be done out there. She is afraid that this is going happen again. And she also mentioned to me about the creek being dredged . She told me that it used to be dredged years ago every three years to prevent this type of stuff from happening . So I would like an update on that, Frank, and what the plans are there. Also, I met with former Councilman Mike McCormick and Steve Ward who is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 representative from Scranton Tomorrow . Steve is actually running the maintenance operations for downtown -- the downtown cleaning program that they have. And we met regarding a piece of property where garbage is being dumped. And Mike McCormick had sent me picture s. But the pictures don't do it justice . It's right before you get to the underpass going from Scranton High School up to Vine Street right before the train tracks. It is a dumping ground. I've never seen so much garbage in my entire life. And if you are driving by -- some people notice it driving by. You might miss it. But it's on the right-hand side if you are coming from Scranton High School. So we were looking at that. And then we went over the railroad tracks next to Penn Paper. And I never in my years on Council have ever seen anything like it. It is a dumping dumping ground, garbage , blankets , coats, clothes , food container s and people are just dumping it over this bank. And it's really bad and everything is blowing over then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 onto the street as well. So it's really a bad situation . So, Frank -- and I'll get together with you on this too tomorrow . We need to find out who owns this piece of property , number one; and then I'd like to find out if we have a contact for the railroad because I believe the City should talk to them about right next to Penn Paper. It's really a dangerous situation . What we'd like to do eventually is have a cleanup of that area because it's so bad. But we can't do that until we find out who actually owns that piece of property . So I'll get together with you tomorrow on that. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Gaughan , I actually missed one and I apologize . MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, sure. Go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : One more concern , I mean, everybody wants to be heard. I don't want to miss this guy's complaint . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, sure. No problem . MR. MCANDREW : All right. I received a letter. Mr. Voldenberg , I'm just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 going to forward all the e-mails to you. You could act on them. Good afternoon , Mr. McAndrew , I was wondering if you could help me out. I heard Rachel Plot in West Side was suppose d to be paved this year. But I saw the City's paving list and it's not on there. I was at least wondering if someone from DPW can patch it and street sweep. It's a complete mess. The last time the sweeper came down was 10 years ago. Thank you. I appreciate whatever you can do. So that's another issue that I'd like correspondence sent to DPW. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Billy, for letting me jump in. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, no, no problem . Thanks, Mark. MR. DONAHUE : Mark, and that was the one I mentioned . I thought it was Rachel Place. But I think they went out. And they should have either been out there today or if not, it was on the list to do this week to patch. So that should be taken care of. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay. Mr. Voldenberg . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 95, 2015, AN ORDINANCE , ENTITLED “AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 79, OF 2015, AN ORDINANCE AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 145 OF 2007 ENTITLED ‘AN ORDINANCE RENAMING THE EMERGENCY AND MUNICIPAL SERVICES TAX (“EMST”) TO LOCAL SERVICE TAX (“LST”)” AND BY IMPOSING A WITHHOLDING OF $52.00 FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015 AND THE SAME SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT ANNUALLY THEREAFTER BY INCREASING THE LOCAL SERVICES TAX WITHHOLDING FROM $52.00 TO $156.00 FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015, AND PROVIDING FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION FOR ANY PERSON WHOSE TOTAL EARNED INCOME AND NET PROFITS FROM ALL SOURCES WITHIN THE MUNICIPALITY IS LESS THAN $15,600.00 FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR 2015 UNDER AND PURSUANT TO THE LOCAL TAX ENABLING ACT, ACT 511 OF 1965, P.L. 1257, 53 P.S. §6924,101 ET. SEQ., AND THE MUNICIPALITIES RECOVERY ACT, Act 47 OF 1987, P.L. 246, 53 P.S. §11701.101 ET. SEQ. AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AMENDMENTS ’” EFFECTIVE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2021. THIS TAX ENABLES THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO CONTINUE TO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 LEVY THE LOCAL SERVICES TAX AT THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 FOR A TOTAL MAXIMUM LOCAL SERVICES RATE OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX ($156.00) DOLLARS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2021 EFFECTIVE RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY 1, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , just a point of clarification , so I did pose the question to Pennsylvania Economy League this morning , Jerry Cross, and he respond ed. And my question was could the City levy the LST Tax even after we exit distress ed the status most likely next year. And the response was that the City does have the authorization to levy the LST at the increase d rate of $156 after the Act 47 distressed designation is rescinded. The City would not have to go to court to continue the higher rate post Act 47. The legislation allows the City the higher LST rate as long as the City's pension 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 funds are rated severely or moderately distress ed under the terms of Act 205, the Municipal Pension Law. The City has an obligation under the authorization to use all LST funds above the $52 base rate toward the unfunded portion of their pensions . Because of this requirement , the City should consider separately budgeting the LST next year into to two parts; up to $52 for general fund for services allowed under the usual LST Act 511 uses. The City can then budget the excess revenue to specifically go to the annual pension MMO. That way the uses of the funds are established in the budget ordinance . And then in the future the Business Administrator would review the City's ability to continue the higher levy based on whatever the condition of the pension fund would be each budget year. There would be no other review of that LST authorization outside of City government . So I thought I read in the newspaper either last week or the week before that the City would no -- once Act 47 -- once we were to exit Act 47, the LST Tax would go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 away. That is not correct according to the Pennsylvania Economy League. I just wanted to make sure to clarify that for everyone . Anyone else on question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.

GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , I mentioned this two weeks ago, I'm just going to repeat myself. I just feel the City is going outside the confines of municipal government . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 We're dealing with state laws. I did reach out to the Scranton Police Department and to look into the legislation and to look into this group. I'm just waiting to hear back from those on front lines that have to deal with these types of legislation s and this type of (inaudible ) the City would make. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question . So -- MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, we lost you again. Your audio went out. MR. MCANDREW : Can you hear me or what? What's the deal? MR. GAUGHAN : Now we can hear you. You're good. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So I'm voting to move this forward . But that doesn't mean I'm a yes yet. I've been doing a little research . I've been talking to people that have better knowledge of this than me that have concerns with this. So like I said, I'm not sold on this yet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And I'll have the information and formulate an opinion and vote either way, you know, in final order.
