Andtheeffect ofthat,thereistwo negative effects,oneisthatwehave contractors thatarelooking forworkwithin thecitythatfeelthatit'snotworthwhile andwedefinitely wanttohavemorepeople working inthecity,andtheotherpartthat effects everysingle homeownerintheCity1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 ofScranton iswhenyouhaveasmaller pool ofcontractors thatarewilling todowork inthecitythecostsaregoingtobemuch higher.Sothelegislation thatisbeing proposed ,atleasthowitwasexplained , thereisquiteabittolookthrough here, itwillmaketheprocess ofbecoming a licensed contractor intheCityofScranton muchmorestreamlined .Itwillbeaneasier process .Myhopeisthatoncethis legislation becomes lawitwillencourage contractors whoarecurrently notworking in thecitytodobusiness inScranton ,andthe bigbenefit ofthatwillbetotheresidents thatwhentheywanttohaveimprovements doneontheirhomethat,one,theyhavemore options tochosefrom;andtwo,theyshould beabletogetalowerpricebecause there willbemorecompetition ,andthatislikely howthefreemarket workssohopefully that willmakethecitymuchmorebusiness friendly .

Additionally ,thereshould besome concessions onpension reform asan additional goodfaitheffort byallofthose involved aspartofthefinalsettlementand disbursement oftheaward.Also,Ihave askedthemayoronseveral occasions toshow hiscommitment topension reform andgivea transition toanewwayofdoingbusiness by requiring cabinet members andallnewhires thatarenon-unionpersonnel onagoing forward basistoswitch toa403-Bora 401-Kstyledefined contribution plan.It willbeapositive message tosendtothe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 financial community aswellastothe taxpaying public aswecontinue tosort through thelarger issues related toreal long-termpension reform.That'sallIhave tonight .Thankyou.
