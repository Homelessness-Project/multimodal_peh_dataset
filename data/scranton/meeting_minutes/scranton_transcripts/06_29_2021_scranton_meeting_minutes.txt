GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have one comment just to point out that 3-C is the Single Tax Office financial statements for the year end of December 31st, 2018. It was pointed out last week that there was pages missing . So it's on the agenda today and the pages are there. Anyone else? If not, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one, not really an announcement . I would just like to wish everybody a happy and safe upcoming 4th of July weekend . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I have a few. City Hall and DPW are off Monday, July 5th in observance of the 4th of July holiday . Garbage will be one day behind. As you could tell, Pennsylvania has lifted the mask mandate. So masks are not required in City Hall or in Council Chambers . However , obviously if you are not vaccinated the CDC recommend s that you wear masks and social distance for your own safety. And it's your own choice if you would like to wear a mask or not. The Chamber of Commerce is attending a caucus on Tuesday , July 13th at 5:45 p.m., to give us a general update on their activities . And just a reminder , each speaker has five minutes. When you come up to the podium if you could please state your name for the record for the stenographer . And keep your comment s to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 agenda items and City Business . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : First speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First with regard to the City's dispute with the County Tax Claim Bureau, I have to agree with the Times-Tribune editorial of June 27th. The County's attempt to split Joseph Joyce's 10 percent legal fee with the County does nothing to lessen the financial burden on delinquent taxpayers , some of whom may have been victims of the pandemic . They still have to pay the full 10 percent while Joseph Joyce continues to enjoy favored vendor status with the county. I can't wait until 2022. Maybe then this contract will be bid out. Next, I'm still waiting for the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Firefighter 's Union and Single Tax Office to be reposted on the City's website and waiting and waiting .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Next, I see you included the complete Single Tax Office's financial statements in Third Order. What happened last week with those missing pages and take a look at page seven, one of the missing pages. The total for checks to taxing authority slash expenses should be $165,166,082, not $163,340,055, a difference of $1,826,027. Who in City Hall is responsible for checking these documents for accuracy ? Shouldn 't the Controller 's Office do this? Maybe I'm overreacting but after all, it's nothing but monopoly money. Next, with regard to the Serrenti Center, how much money have we already spent on this facility and how much more will we invest before the building is completely renovated ? Next, with regard to the Controller 's May, 2021 report, do we have an explanation for the nondepartment al expenditure for special items totally $8,970,803.95? Onto new business , first, with regard to the City's overtime , why did DPW admin exceed its overtime budget by 374 percent in the first six months of this year? And what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 about the other department s that also exceeded their budgets? I'm talking about the City Council , 120 percent ; LIPS, 161 percent ; DPW engineering , 119 percent ; and DPW cleaning and maintenance , 177 percent . The City has already spent 69 percent of its entire overtime budget. Next, I'm impressed by Larry West's government experience starting in 2007 as a Dickson City Councilman and continuing in 2010 as Senator Blake's Regional Director . I am less impressed by Carl Deeley's training and experience in information technology . His resume strikes me as little more than MBA buzzwords. And I should know, I have an MBA. Why do I get the impression that Mr. Deeley was given the position of IT Director as a consolation prize for being replaced as the BA? I think you should be offering more than $64,000 as salary for that position . It's key to the City's operations . You get what you pay for. And finally , I support the Mayor's request to repeal the 2017 state law allowing the sale of aerial fireworks to the public. I'm tired of these people, many who are on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 drugs and alcohol firing off these explosive devices. What's the point of paying taxes if the City can't protect its residents ? And I'll listen to your answers in Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Jack White. MR. WHITE: Hi, Council , Jack White, Hill Section , two blocks from Nay Aug -- beautiful Nay Aug Park thanks to Bob Gattens and his crew. I take my dog to the park every day and I take enough poop bags for a lot of people. The noise continues . It's going to be the 4th of July. So that's acceptable I think, otherwise , something should be done. The Council President said something about Louie DeNaples last week and his concern about the hazardous waste and family and kids and, you know, what's happening to them. The neighbors in the City also have families and children that are experiencing this garbage on the streets . Trucks continue to plow by heaped to the brim with leachate and sometimes even spilling onto the streets . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 So I think we all have concerns about that. The difference is I guess what we can do as citizen s to come here and tell our leaders that we're concerned . And then our leaders have the power and authority to do something about it. I'm not aware of anything being done about it. I know Council does things behind the scenes, very good things. But I haven't been hearing anything about what's being done to help this situation . So if it is being done behind the scenes, thank you. And I appreciate it. I'm sure everybody else does. I hope you all have a good holiday . And I hope that the people you love and love you back are safe and well. And I'm going to return the rest of my time to Council and hopefully we can hear some feedback about what we have been discussing here because I don't think we hear much feedback . And again, much of it is behind the scenes and thank you. So but again, I return my time to you and hope we can hear something . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I planned to come forward and talk to you somewhat on platitude s being the 4th of July and Independence Day and talk about citizens who came forward asking for changes in government and who asked for service s for dusty and dirty streets and maybe put forward that if these concerns were there that they had, maybe if they brought forward a suggestion or a request to City Council such as for DPW to make an extra run with the street sweepers in their area because they are facing a difficulty in bringing that forward , it would be a move to a resolution for them at least on a temporary basis. Changing City government is a wide task. Starting a commission to evaluate a Home Rule Charter including what should stay the same, what should be different is a long and arduous task. It's not just wiping one thing out. It's moving forward and dissecting where we want the government to move forward to in the future and that is at the base of the independence and the structure of our country .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 That's where I planned to go this week with those platitudes . But I have to take a look and address the appointment of Carl Deeley to the IT Department . We have the Avero contract which has been tabled I believe for a period of time. And that was Act 47 gave us $50,000. I have no idea what the earmarks on that $50,000 were, what it could be assigned to other than that specific area if that funding could be used for an IT position for an increased pay for IT position . We were given forward an IT solution and we have funding aside from it with no definition s of what that funding actually could be used for if it's only exclusively for this purpose or the City can under advisement move it to different position s that may need that money more than a temporary position to an outside contractor . Looking at Mr. Deeley's IT experience , it is severely lacking . And to understand this, we have to take a look at what an IT Department does. It processes your e-mail. It keeps your financial . It stores your data. It keeps your secrets . It keeps 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 your City running . It deals with your communication between your departments . Everything you touch in operations between employees is the base point of the IT Department . The Fire Department when the Chief came forward , suddenly City Council had a rate of pay set for but that rate of pay was increased as money was suddenly found for. Yet the IT Department does not get that same respect . The real world ramifications of this are plain and evident , not only because of the incursion last year because of infrastructure holes and allowed ransom-ware hit this setting . But in the physical viewpoint of it, the IT world in dealing with the City's infrastructure , is like dealing with a high rise building in Florida . When you undermine the foundation of the IT and your IT security , everything that is built upon it is prone to collapse and destruction . The foundation of the IT Department should be a critical juncture for this -- us at this point especially considering the expanse of funding that has been allocated over this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 year and the coming years specifically for IT without direction . It is a building that is being put up with a bad foundation that is ripe to collapse and when it does, it is going cause irreparable harm. We need to take money. We need to allocate it towards IT. And we need a person who is properly educated in all the aspects to be put in that position . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good even, Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . As Joan said, last Saturday in the paper was about the Mayor's -- local mayors they want the law repealed to sell the aerial local fireworks . And it was also on the news a night or two before. You know, that's not the problem . The problem is you got to enforce the laws that are on the books now. I have been living in Tripp Park for 33 years now. And this law is only four years old. I have been putting up with these fireworks for 32 years. People go to New York and buy them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 if they can't buy them here. They just go over the state line and buy them there. So having them legal in Pennsylvania isn't the problem . In Scranton anyway, what they have to do, put every -- all the police officers they have working the whole weekend and saturate every part of the City and arrest these people that are doing these illegal fireworks , not only is it unsafe and annoying , sometimes they are doing it past 11:00 at night. It's also -- it could be deadly as was proven last year where I think a gentleman from South Side was killed when a firework went off and killed him. That's unfortunate . But as I said, these laws have to be enforce d. I think it's 100 or 150 feet from a residence you have to be that far away because nowhere in the City were you 100 and 150 feet away. Even the Mayor of Pittston said that about Pittston . He said that. So we just have to enforce the laws we have. All right. That's all I have to say on that. Yesterday another 18 wheeler got lost and was in my neighborhoods again. It was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 last evening . I didn't hear it. I was in the shower. My wife told me about it. He went to go around my corner again and just missed my daughter 's car. If he didn't stop, he would have dragged her car with it. She lives next to me. She had come out and move her car for the guy to get down the street. I spoke about this weeks ago. I said they should put a sign on Main Avenue that there is a turnaround on Dorothy Street. Was anything done about that? MR. GAUGHAN : We did communicate it to the DPW and, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could followup on that. Obviously the sign was not put up. But we'll follow up. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Pave cuts which I talked about the last couple weeks, I said last week they made a fourth pave cut on my block. And this goes past the curb. And that last one they made it's like going down beneath the rest of the street. You have to come almost to a stop to go over that. You're going to knock your front end out of line. They make these pave cuts. They don't fill them in right. Maybe they will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 eventually but something has to be done. You shouldn 't have to slow down to almost a stop to go down the street. These utilities are ridiculous . They get away with murder. Next thing, last week Tom Coyne came up to me and said the week before I had left when he spoke and about this parking enforcement people ticketing people parked the wrong way. And he told me they're not suppose d to be doing that. Was that looked into? MR. GAUGHAN : Not to my knowledge , but I know that there is something on the books. If you are on a two-way street you have to park in the direction that the traffic is going, otherwise you'll pull out and that's dangerous . MR. SPINDLER : I don't know. I thought he told me something different . MR. GAUGHAN : There was -- according to Councilman Schuster , there was a request made. And, I mean, common sense for the most part, you know, it's -- they're going to ticket you every time. They came to my street the one day. I got ticketed a few years ago. So I just started parking the right way and I didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 get ticketed again. MR. SPINDLER : Sometimes people pull by the house for 5, 10 minutes. MR. GAUGHAN : I understand that. I think they have to use discretion . I get that. But, you know, they have to enforce the law too. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Lastly, favorite subject of mine I spoke about it for probably 20 years now is what I call our illegal garbage tax. And for years, previous Council s have told me it's not a tax. It's a fee. And I said, no, it's a tax. And it was just proven this year. It was on our tax bill. So it's a tax. We pay our property taxes to have our garbage picked up. We shouldn 't have to pay $300 more a year to have our garbage picked up. It's illegal . It's taxation without representation . And I don't know if that has anything to do with what these people have the lawsuit against the City. But like I said for 20 years, it's not a fee. It's a tax. And I hope something is done about it. Thank you for your time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. I came in when the discussion was taking place about a stormwater collection fee. And, you know, I don't know, does anybody on the Council know who owns all the water in Pennsylvania ? Anybody ? The Commonwealth does. So my question is, why is the Commonwealth going to tax residents for their water? What's occurred in the Commonwealth is that this Commonwealth has not maintained storm collection systems for decades. And they are collapsing so they need money. So they pass the laws and implement ed a fee schedule and a way to fine communities for not following their dictates . But I think that this case needs to go to the Supreme Court and somebody should fight it, not a lawyer, a group of citizens , Pro se litigators because if you hire an attorney and he makes a mistake , your case is done. Okay, once a Court reaches a decision on something it's finished . That's my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 opinion . Now, the Scranton School District received 58 million dollars in COVID aid money but they've closed a school. I think they need to rebuild a school on that site. Rip the building down and renovate it and build a new school. I think we've shortchanged the citizen s, children in this community for much too long. I sat down with the coordinator that the Governor sent here a long time ago and talked about education in the Scranton School District . And I think it's time for the politics to end. And I think it's time to start educating children . Now, the Mayor wants to hire a group to come in here and talk about people leaving the City and the population decline over many decades . Well, that's why reopening and the Council -- I agree with some of the stuff the previous speaker spoke about here because any Home Rule Charter commission that's going to sit is going to look at the charter , look at things that could be changed whether it's worth it to rewrite the charter or just abolish it because we need to come up with solutions for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 what's happening in this City. And for a long time City government and City residents have stuck their head in the sand and ignored all the red flags. We have the Parking Authority or the parking operators come in here and talk about money. But yet still we had a former Mayor here who sold them and he didn't go to jail for selling the Parking Authority or giving garages away. And he didn't go to jail for selling the Scranton Sewer Authority off, very troubling things that came through this Council , okay? I mean, you have to look at the reality of what's happened in this City over an extended period of time. And to be honest with you, a lot of Council men have made a lot very big mistake s and the resident s have paid for it. And resident s don't even care anymore. The 2.4 percent wage tax has to go away. Why are we paying all of this layer after layer? You know, at the end of these meetings maybe somebody should tell the residents -- the Council should tell the residents how many times the City's pension plans were fully funded in the history of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 City's pension plans and let them know exactly what's happening in this City and all the politics that's been played. And talk about Mayor Dougherty changing the person that was running -- Melon Bank was taking care of the pension plans and he shifted it and they lost millions of dollars , okay? And then he offered people double pensions . I was in these Council Chambers when all of these things took place. You know, the things that we've experienced in this City are just remarkable . And last thing I have here is, you know, we shouldn 't name anything after President Biden. We should take it down, okay. We see what's going on in all the major cities. We had a vice president that was collecting money to bail criminals out. And then a week ago we had a shooting in Chicago where they executed a man right outside of his car at point-blank range. This is what the Democratic party has to offer to the residents . And, you know, if we had a government that wanted to empower people, then we name -- we take that initiative and we put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the Home Rule Charter on the ballot and let people run to be representatives on the ballot and empower people to change their government . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . I'm going to continue wearing my mask in protest of the people that refuse to get vaccinated even though it's free. I helped somebody with their vehicle last week. And it seemed like they weren't feeling too good. Well, guess what? Six days later they're not feeling too good either. They still don't have the wisdom to go get tested and maybe get some monoclonal antibodies. And if that's not the case, the test will tell them so. So fortunately , I'm vaccinated and, you know, we had a lot of good news about the Moderna making us immune. And one of the things that when I was a member of the taxpayers on school funding , it always seemed like the people that raise the biggest families three and four kids, their kids are out of school, they're graduated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 or whatever ; and they're out in their life. And they seem to think that they shouldn 't have to pay taxes anymore. You know, I saw an article -- a news article that the Chinese government wants to have people have more children . It used to be one and you went for an abortion the second time by law. And the Chinese women were saying how am I ever going to pay to educate two or three kids? Now, the capitalist over there, probably American don't pay enough taxes to even educate the Chinese children . So, you know, that's something to think about. One of the problem s with our government is we never seem to disclose the cost of what we as individuals impose upon the government . And once again, I was only fooling last week with you guys when I said, what's the matter with you when you couldn't make up for 40 million dollars a year, 30 million dollars a year. That was that was just a joke. But who did it? Where did it start? Under Governor Corbett . You know, so it's something to think about. It's really -- I'm against closing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 schools . Those kids have to walk two miles almost to the nearest school. And some of them are six years old, seven years old. They have to walk on Main Avenue, cross over where there's a railroad bridge to get on Euclid Avenue to get back in there. Isn't that where they have to go? I mean, you go around that turn, you don't see anything . It could be icy. My father was taking us to Central when the bus company went belly up. And I saw the kid at Main Avenue in North Scranton . And he was on the other corner. And he ran catty-corner. Now the A-pillar of the car -- that's the pillar that goes down with your windshield was blocking his view. The kid ran catty-corner right into the front of my father's vehicle . And I yelled at him to stop and he stopped . But the kid practically ran into the front of the car and fell down and my father's insurance was sued for $18,000. So that's the kind of stuff that this could generate . And on voter once again, 1-888-483 -- 453-3211; 1-202-224-3121 and 1-202-225-3121. You will get your choice of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Congress people that you wish to talk to. And call them and tell them every day or as often as possible if you have free dialling which I do to -- well, it's not free. I pay for it. But, you know, we hear all of this stuff. And, I mean, they take my picture at a hospital . Why can't we take our picture at the polls and then they know that I voted. And that's it, you know? None of this somebody stole the election noise. It's disgusting already . Hopefully we'll deal with them in the Courts. Have a good day. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Miss Schumacher ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening, Marie Schumacher . I'd like to start with 7-A tonight . And I'm concerned about that Serrenti building and what's going on there, what's not going on and the plans that may be -- are being conceived someplace but certainly not shared with the taxpayers . Councilman Gaughan , I'm going to read from the -- one of the minutes . It says Council Bill Gaughan cast a lone dissent at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Thursday 's meeting saying the City does not know long-term costs of renovating and maintain ing the facility . He cited a conditional assessment last year that pegged estimate s of required repairs at $652,600 including a new roof costing $120,000 and utility upgrade s and recommended $352,430 in other repairs. That's exactly the way I feel right now. We don't know the long-term costs. We don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what has already happened. And I think until somebody comes and explains what this -- what are they calling it now -- an emergency -- anyway the new name. Somebody needs to tell us about it and give us a long-term plan at least five years out of what they're going to be spending . And if the Mayor's correct , we're going to get revenue because other people are going to be coming in and using that facility . And I'm not too sure considering all the equipment that's in it that's a really good idea either. But I think we need to have that before you go ahead and throw some more money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 at that building . Did the -- what's in where the former Engine 15 headquarters was now? Does anybody know? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know off the top of my head. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, because -- do you know, Mr. Donahue ? MR. DONAHUE : I think it's being used as storage . But that stuff is supposed to move to Serrenti is what I -- what we were told previously . MS. SCHUMACHER : See and back then it was suppose d to be used by somebody else and there was -- and the revenue was going to be used for the maintenance of Serrenti . So it's just -- MR. DONAHUE : And just -- we did make a request to the Police Chief and any other members of the administration to come in for a caucus before our summer recess to discuss the issues you just brought up regarding Serrenti . MS. SCHUMACHER : I think everything should be put on hold until it's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 discussed . And then moving from there I guess to IT, something has got to be done with the website . I don't know how much time I wasted this weekend trying to get on the website . And it's just very frustrating . I don't have a lot of spare time. And when that keeps happening , it's very disappointing . And when I called Monday because I still couldn't get on Monday morning , Frank was kind enough to run it down what was going on and I already put a call into the Mayor's office. And I did get a call back that they were working on it. But somebody -- IT is important . It's important 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. And I can't believe that there is not a person here who can deal with that on weekends . And then a month ago I think it was on the 25th of March, I don't know. Anyway more than a month, we talked about the minutes from the Mayor's tax policy meeting s be put into Third Order and, Mr. Donahue , I think -- are you on the committee ? MR. DONAHUE : I am. And I did make a request that they be put on the website . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 then we -- so I haven't been at a meeting since we spoke about that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I thought they met biweekly . MR. DONAHUE : One of them was cancelled and I couldn't make one of them. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. MR. DONAHUE : But I did request that the previous ones were -- would be put onto the City website and then moving forward we could put those into our Third Order too. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, when do we think we'll see something from that group in -- MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. MS. SCHUMACHER : It's sad. MR. DONAHUE : Because there are issues with the website like you said. MS. SCHUMACHER : And the other thing, I came here saying, you know, the operating budget should be on the website . Couldn't find it. Turns out Mr. Gaughan sent me an e-mail I believe on it and somebody else. The titles going across the way it says service s and there's a hammer. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 So now isn't that the place you would go and look for an operating budget? Not I. And now there's -- the audit's there, the operating budget. But the capital budget is still not there. So I would like -- I wanted to look and see what the Serrenti building had in the capital budget. But you can't access it because it's not there. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. Okay. Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, I'm sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MS. SCHUMACHER : I have more. I'll see you around. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. I'll address on the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple so -- and these I'm just revisiting some issues that, Mr. Voldenberg , you did a fantastic job, you know, reaching out to the departments and you got me some information back. But I think we have to circle around on a couple. So the first one would be 622 South Irving there was trash issues, okay. This warning was issued for trash and the response we got -- and have permits in review. So and that we got maybe last week. So the gentleman that initiated this concern or this complaint said, you know, it's still going on. Trash is still here. He'd like an update. The neighbors want an update. They just want to know how many chances this person is going to get because this has been going on for five years. And I said, you know, of course, I'll pass this along and inquire . So that's the first one. The second one, okay, so help me understand this. So this I didn't bring up at Council but I sent an e-mail. So this was in regards to 503 Fellows Street. And it was a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 rooster complaint , okay. And, you know, it was determined after you first sent correspondence that it's a zoning issue. And the updates of the ordinance does not have -- does not differentiate between rooster s and hens. But I don't know, maybe I'm mistaken or my understanding was you could have hens and not roosters . You could have two chickens and not roosters . So can you just follow up one more time, please? Did anybody else here ever had this situation brought to you before in the past? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. There's a couple issues on that one. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so just let's circle around again just to be positive . All right? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then, okay, so this is -- this I brought up maybe a couple weeks ago. These are two overgrown lots on Hampton Street, one next to Willard School, one across the street. I know this was a couple weeks ago. They're still overgrown.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 I don't think anything has been done. And I got a call about that. And then I'd also like an update on 125 to 127 -- 125-127 North St. Francis Cabrini . I first brought this forward in April. And we were told, you know, there were some police raids. There's a -- it's a nuisance property . There's in and out drug activity . There's trash and, etc. You know, there's -- criminal mischief has been on the reports . But the latest update we got was that from -- it was from Mrs. Cipriani that, you know, we're looking at all of this stuff. We're going to start this code enforcement task force and we're going to look into this and we're going to improve the processes in this. So this was April. And all of this still continues there. So please circle around for that one. Also, I have another issue -- so this has just been brought to my attention . So back in May we had a beautiful rollout of the Hometown Heros Banner Program . It was fantastic . And it was great to see all of these family members, very proud to see, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 know, their own heros displayed on poles. So what's happened recently is I just drove on the way here, I saw three or four that are -- they're falling apart. I don't know if it's the installation was the issue or the hardware itself because it looks more flimsy than the hardware on other banners that are in Taylor or any other borough . So and here's the thing, so I know there's a Leadership Lackawanna Program that they were -- you know, it was just a program or a project they would hand it off to the City. And then, you know, the City pretty much is going to hand it off to a veterans organization . But how they were installed , the City didn't install them. But they secured someone to do that. So maybe we go back and look at or reach out -- please reach out to Mr. Preambo because he was involve d in the installation and the Mayor to make sure that -- you know, I think it's still our responsibility to keep them up. We promised we would keep them up for a year. They are only up a month. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 until the total handoff to these organizations , I still think it's the City's responsibility to make sure that these are corrected . They look -- it's very sad to see these driving up the street. And that is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just wanted to respond to a few things brought up during Citizens Participation I felt that there were some very important subjects brought up. And one of them with the repeal of the fireworks state law I feel would be really important . I think the fireworks are bothersome and a quality of life issue for our resident s and affecting veterans or people with PTSD, animals . I believe last year as a Council we had called for the state repeal of the fireworks . I'm glad to see now that there were several local mayors who also joined in that call for potential repeal. I would love to see that happen. And I'd love to be able to take my dog out at night during the summer because he doesn't want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 to go out now. He wakes us up more than the baby does in the middle of the night. So the other thing that I wanted to bring up was the Home Rule Charter . And I believe I've been on the record before being in support of a review of the Home Rule Charter . I do believe that we need to get the ball rolling and form the commission in order to do that. And I think it's just due time to review that and see where we can improve upon the Home Rule Charter . And regarding the website issues, yeah, I think with any new website it's going to be a work in progress . However , I've experienced the issues myself and I could understand the frustration . And I've had my own frustrations with IT so far. I called to get my e-mail fixed yesterday morning . And I still haven't received a call back. So if as a Council woman I can't receive a call back, I can imagine that it might be difficult for other City employee s or residents . So I hope to work on resolving that and making that a better process for everyone . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 And that's everything that I have for now. I'll respond on the question regarding the legislation tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly . Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to ask -- would you be able to send a request to DPW asking them for an update and/or list of how many streets were cleaned with the street sweeper to date maybe through June 30th since June 30th is tomorrow ? I know we have a limited number of street sweepers . But we do have more than we've had in the past. And I know there is a new process being used this year. At the same time I think the ultimate goal is some sort of alternate side of the street parking . But let's see how this is working to date. Myself and Mr. Gaughan , were at a meeting last week between City officials and DEP regarding the flooding at the Leggett and Leach Creek. It is -- there is no easy solution to their issues over there. But I was happy to hear tonight that DEP did issue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 emergency permits for Leach Creek one section of it and the eastern side of Leggetts Creek. And a lot of frustrations boiled over. And one of the things that I wasn't happy about at that meeting was the way that the representative from DEP and also a representative of DPW spoke to residents . I know if they were in the public sector that they wouldn't be employed anymore if they spoke to customers like that the way that they spoke to residents . But at the same time we still need to all work together . I know Councilman Gaughan and the rest of Council are looking forward to developing long-term solutions to some of these issues. Also, for -- I brought up a couple weeks ago some issues with quality of life concerns in South Side. I know 1601 South Webster has received zoning, fire, code enforcement and SPD warnings about all cars and tires. Hopefully they followed up on that since then. 2204 South Webster Avenue was issued a door tag, an inspector will follow up to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 if anything has been done. 1030 Cedar Avenue was issued a door tag and an inspect or will follow up to see if anything has been done. 524 Gibbons Street which has been an issue for a few years now, they actually have violation letters sent. And then one property , the issue was actually taken care of before the inspector got out there. We also received a street paving request for Pike Street. And we did receive a response that Tom Preambo and Chris Jenkins assessed this street. And it does not warrant a complete paving. But the pothole s on the street were fixed. And that's all I have for right now until on the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , would like to add a correction to his comment s. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, Mr. Voldenberg , I apologize . This is the second time I've done this with this complaint . It's with regards to the overgrown -- the two properties . One is next to Willard and one is across the street. It's actually Eynon Street and not Hampton. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 All right? Okay, so thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few things tonight . We heard a presentation during the public caucus from HRG who is looking at the stormwater management issues in the City in the fact that we do have to act. And after hearing the presentation tonight in my opinion , it would be absolute political malpractice if we do not work together and approach stormwater management on a regional level. If we do not work together and we go it alone or other municipalities and boroughs go it alone under the MS4 permit in all the regulations and requirements , we're going to lose out on major savings . We'll lose out on major efficiencies if we try to attack this as like we do with other things in the county as little political fiefdoms and not as a region. Yes, this is an unfunded mandate . I asked the question of the gentleman from HRG tonight what happens if we do nothing . We get fined eventually . If the hammer comes down, $10,000 a day. There's many people -- and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 understand -- understand it who are upset about the fact that this is an unfunded mandate. But the longer we stand around and complain about that and I hear a lot of misinformation about the rain tax and other things. And if we don't do anything , the more out of compliance we get. And the worst of flooding issues are -- the interesting point that the gentleman and the woman that were here tonight from HRG made was that all the development in the Abingtons , all the things that are going upstream obviously affect Scranton . Councilman Donahue and I saw that firsthand as we were standing at Leach Creek and Leggetts Creek. So it's no -- this just didn't come out thin air. Yes, there are -- the storms are worse than they were 50, 60 years ago. I'm sure climate change has something to do with it. But it also is because of things that are happening outside of Scranton as well. So we do need to do something . I was very pleased with the report. But we do have to approach this on a regional level. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 just does not make any sense whatsoever to do this on our own. So I would like -- and I was happy to hear that meetings are going to be set up with the county commissioners immediately so that we could get the ball rolling on this. To address Miss Hodowanitz 's questions -- and I hope that I get all of them tonight . The Controller 's report last week or the week before, Mr. Voldenberg , can you touch on that? That was a -- Mr. Voldenberg spoke with the Controller 's Office. That was a TAN payment . Am I correct in saying that? MR. VOLDENBERG : That involved two TAN payments, Mr. Gaughan , April and May on the May report. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So that was two TAN payment s that were combine d in the Controller 's report. That is why the figure was so large. The question on overtime in City Council I could explain that one. So City Council had $500 in overtime budgeted for 2021. We spent $602.46. So we're over budget by, yes, 120 percent . But in all reality it's $102.46. And the reason for that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 is we had an employee who was out for quite a few months. We were working with the City Clerk and only one employee in our office. So that's the explanation behind that. Mr. Voldenberg , if could you please put the memos that Council received from the DPW Director and the Fire Chief regarding 6-B and 6-C, the transfers out of the contingency fund into Third Order for next week? We'll speak more about this when we get to agenda items. But we asked for an explanation on 6-B and 6-C. And we did receive a lengthy memo from the Fire Chief and a memo from the DPW Director with some explanation . I know in talking to the rest of Council there is some additional questions . But I think that did clear up some of the issues from last week so if we can put that into Third Order. In regards to the tabled item, Avero Advisors , I did ask Mr. Voldenberg to put that in Eighth Order under Old Business . I'm not sure if we're going to bring that back next week. There are still additional questions on that. And I do think we'll eventually make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 amendments to it. The next issue I wanted to talk about was the IT Department . Obviously there are issues with the IT Department . As Dr. Rothchild pointed out and others, I do think at this point that Council should invite Mr. Deeley and any other City official s, the Mayor, whoever else into a public caucus to give us an update -- a full update on everything that's going on within the IT Department . We are spending a significant amount of money. I believe it's over $12,000 a month with Bedrock Technologies . There are other issues that have been raised. So I think bringing everything out onto the table and, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could invite Mr. Deeley and whatever other City official s to an upcoming Council caucus I would appreciate that. We did get a response I think this goes back to another one of Miss Hodowanitz 's questions about the CBAs on the City website . So Mr. Deeley did respond that the Single Tax Office and Firefighters ' Collective Bargaining Agreements will be added to the website this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 week. They didn't really have an explanation as to why they were deleted off the website . But they will be put on according to him this week. Mrs. Jeffries had a question last week as well regarding Clay Avenue and Vine Street. And Corporal Butler is on a military obligation until next week. So once he's back they'll take care of that request for -- or look into her request on Clay Avenue. This is a question that I posed a few weeks ago and I still don't quite understand it. We didn't get a response yet. But, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could pose this again, as everyone knows on the agenda tonight we'll look at some grant funding for parks throughout the City. We pushed for $50,000 to be put into the Parks and Recreation budget for a casual program . In the past under different City administrations over the years, there was usually a casual program specifically for Parks and Recreation , hire high school kids, college kids to go and help cut the grass and weed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 whack and things like that. Why they're not utilizing that money in the budget I don't understand . So if we can follow up and find out why that money has not been tapped yet and why that program has not been instituted I would appreciate it. Back to the IT Department for a second. We receive d a letter or I was copied on a letter and so was Councilman Schuster from the City Controller . And he had concerns about the professional services line item in the IT Department . In the 2021 budget they have a -- we budgeted $245,000. To date, the IT Department has spent $227,331.90. So the remaining balance is $17,668.10. As I mentioned or alluded to earlier , we're spending $12,500 per month per the April emergency declaration and another 5,000 per month for other service s. So Controller Murray was concerned and rightfully so that we're going to max out of that budget line item. There was some other concerns as well that he listed in the letter. Mr. Deeley had responded they're going to transfer funds from a salary line item. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 don't quite understand that. I think we need further clarification . There's, you know, money being moved around all over the place in the IT Department . So again, I think we need to bring them in and figure out exactly what's happening there. The other thing I would like an update on, we have not talked about this in quite some time is the Act 47 recommendation updates . A couple months ago I had asked for an update. Mr. Deeley did provide a timeline or a snapshot of all the recommend ations that were listed in Act 47 Recovery Plan and where the City was with those recommendations and implementing them. One of them out of the many that are in there was debt management policy that Council was very interested in. The other one that we have not heard about in a while is the Payroll Preparation Tax. There was also one that I have always been interested in for the last several years which is the updated Human Resources Management Plan. And there's a list of others. So if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 we can get another update to Council on where the administration is with fulfilling those recommendations I would appreciate it. Also I got a request from a resident in Minooka , Mr. Voldenberg , Murphy Court right off of Davis Street needs pothole patching if they could address that. We are going to discuss amongst the Council -- and I mentioned this last week the zoning board appointment s. So we do still need to fill Mr. Marcks's position . His term expires July 1st, 2023. And there is another open position for a five-year term. And then there are two alternates . So we will have those discussions and then Solicitor Hayes will draft the legislation and we will appointment those people hopeful ly within the next two weeks. And I think that's all I had -- oh, the last thing that I had on pave cuts; since I've been on Council , we've gotten complaints about pave cuts every year and again, rightfully so. This year it seems to be much, much more complaint s about pave cuts. We do have a new pave cut inspector. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Three or four weeks ago I asked for a report from the pave cut inspect or from the DPW on how they're approaching this, are they doing it different because we are getting an unbelievable amount of complaints about pave cuts. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could circle back around again with the DPW Director and ask that that information be provided I would appreciate it. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 56, 2021 (AS AMENDED ) WHICH AMENDED FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 8, 1987 AND FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 87, 1976 ENTITLED “PROVIDING FOR THE LEVY AND COLLECTION OF A LICENSE FOR ALL PERFORMERS , ENTERTAINERS , SPORTING TEAMS, MUSICAL GROUPS, BANDS, THEATRICAL CAST, DANCING GROUPS, RECITAL GROUPS, PAID LECTURERS AND SPEAKERS BY INCREASING FEES” TO REDUCE THE ONE DAY FEE IN SECTION 3 FROM $50.00 TO $20.00 DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC .

WEST, 220 LINDEN STREET, APARTMENT 509, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18503, TO THE POSITION OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , I have a couple problems with this. So I know we received this gentleman 's resume three weeks late, four weeks late. He's in the position already . And yesterday I asked for a job description . I asked to have it by today. I was able to find the IT job description that is on the website . But it seems that this doesn't exist. So when I look at the resume I don't see any experience or education that would comply with any business administrator job description . So with that said so -- we talked about -- early in the year we asked for job description s. They were being created . Clerks were furloughed the beginning of the pandemic . They were brought back with new job descriptions based on their skill set. They were told, no, you can't bid. You have to take this job. So and this used to happen at the school district . So now I'm not okay with approving -- and this is nothing personal . This definitely is nothing personal . But I'm not okay with approving a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 person who doesn't have the skill set. So like I'm in education . So it would be like having, you know, the gym teacher -- nothing against him, teaching honors calculus . It just doesn't make sense. And I know this might upset a couple people. Like I said, it's nothing personal . But I know this might upset a couple people in administration . But I would rather that than upset, you know, 70,000 taxpayer s that, you know, I need to focus on their best interest because this is paid by them. So like I said, just swinging back, my role is to review and scrutinize legislation that is put in front of me and formulate a decision with my own thought process . And this one I think right now is the right decision for me to vote no, you know, taking the interest of the -- the best interest of the taxpayers . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, also on the question , I do have some concern s with this with the City exiting Act 47. And having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 people with financial backgrounds in the past I do think it's a necessity to have someone with a financial background . Again, it was an uphill battle on the School Board and we did interview for several different CEOs of the district and didn't hire one. We took one from inhouse. But that uphill battle was to get someone with the correct skill set. So with this being said, I did compare and contrast the description in the Home Rule Charter to this resume. But I do think I would further need a job description or at least the administration to come in and explain what their vision is for the City. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Just one thing, I've known Mr. West now for eight years even before that when he was the Chief of Staff for Senator Blake. I've always had a really good relationship with Mr. West. He's always been very professional . I saw how he ran Senator Blake's office and did so with integrity and was always really on the ball and on the spot with information . So I will be voting yes. I think he will do a good job as the Business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Administrator . And like I said, I think he in the past has proven himself as Chief of Staff for Senator Blake and doing a very, very good job. So I'll be voting yes. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. GAUGHAN : The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF CARL DEELEY, 711 NORTH WEBSTER AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18510, TO THE POSITION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) DIRECTOR WITHIN THE OFFICE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , similar concern s with this position as with 5-C although both very nice resumes . Mr. Deeley has a background in mechanic al engineering . He may be more fit for the DPW. But when looking at this it was brought up in public comment overseeing IT operations , security risk, performance matrix, these are some of the things that are part of that job description including in that job description there is six years experience in IT operations , two years experience in IT teams and project s which aren't there. When looking at the Controller 's report for the month of May at this point in time after five months of the year, we've used 92 percent of the professional services budget for the IT Department . And I'm seeing a pattern that is starting to occur in several different department s in the City where maybe some of the blind spots of the department head are being supplement ed by services and consulting groups and they're costing the City money. And I don't think it's in the best 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 financial interest . So I will be voting no to this as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , so I pretty much have the same rational e as the last resolution . I mean, I like Mr. Deeley. He's a nice guy. This is nothing personal . But I at least got that job description . There's one for the IT Director but not the Business Administrator , which is probably the second most important . It could be debated the most important job in the City. So but I got this. The other one doesn't exist. But at least I looked at this. And it's like I said, it's nothing personal . He was the Business Administrator and all of a sudden he's the IT Director . I just have a problem with that because like I said, I'm in education . So I work at the Career Technology Center. I teach culinary arts for umpteen years. It would be like my boss coming to me tomorrow and say, you know what, Mark, come fall you did a great job 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 as the culinary guy. But come fall, you could teach welding . It doesn't make sense. So I look at it this way. I look at the best interest of the taxpayer s that, you know, that I'm here for and represent . And it just -- the shuffling of position s. And it's not the first position to be shuffled around since I'm here or since the new administration . So I just want a little more cohesiveness and more, I guess, bang for the buck with regards to educational background and skill set. So that is why I will be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I'd like to add I understand the concern s related to Mr. Deeley's background and this position . I would say that I also know they've been looking for some time to fill the position . And they interviewed several candidate s and had difficult y finding a candidate with I believe the appropriate skill set because of the salary. I think that was a factor and making 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 it more difficult to find a candidate for this position . And I know that we're not going to be changing the salary because it's already set in the budget. So I don't see an alternative at this time. So I will be voting in favor of Mr. Deeley as IT Director for that reason. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : Nay. MR. GAUGHAN : The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-E.

I appreciate the administration moving pretty quickly on this to get it on our agenda. And I think that this will have a great impact in helping him not, you know, not face these flooding issues and all the other issues that he faces because of the flooding at this creek.

ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , a few weeks ago this was introduced in Fifth Order. And I had a couple questions on it. There was -- the original contract that was with the prior company from 18-19 was they were to do a study on three City-owned facilities and headquarters . And one of the questions I had was, did we use that study that came out of that contract to, you know, work off of for the RFP for this contract ? And I didn't get any answer to those questions yet. So I'll move it forward with the introduction . But I would still like to get an answer as to whether we used that study from the 2018-19 contract to decide what we're going to do for the RFP and to move forward on this work. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR.

SCHUSTER : I'd just like to say that I'm glad to see the City is applying for grants to make these upgrades to our parks. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? This is a beautiful area in the City of Scranton . The -- I was reviewing the plans today for this park. It really is going to be an outstanding project . The one question I had and this goes for all the other grants that are on the agenda tonight , the City is going to commit a match to this project . This specific one is almost a $20,000 match. I just wanted to be sure if we can confirm where those funds were coming from. I believe there is a line item in the budget -- a grant match line item; but I just want to triple check on that. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-I be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , again, I'm glad to see the City is applying for these grants. I think it might be helpful for Council to know how many of these grants the OECD has applied for since January and how many have been accepted or approved . I know a lot of grants are going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 out. But how many of those -- how many grants are -- have been written and how many have been approved ? MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? This is a great project . I have hung around when I was younger at Robinson Park. It's the only park in the City with a lake. And one of the things that I didn't even realize until I read through this legislation was that this park is actually 30 acres of land in the City of Scranton . There's trails. There's a basketball court, a playground . The only bad thing with this park over the years is it's been neglected in terms of investment . We do have to give credit to the East Mountain Neighborhood Association . They have been really, really pushing for this. So they do deserve a lot of credit. And again, the plans for this park they look outstanding . And I'm looking forward to seeing this project through . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE CITY OF SCRANTON APPLICATION FOR GRANT FUNDS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH FINANCING AUTHORITY OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR A FLOOD MITIGATION PROGRAM (FMP) GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $500,000.00 FOR THE MEADOW BROOK FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, COORDINATE AND DISBURSE THE GRANT FUNDS AS APPROPRIATE . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-J be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , back on March 16th we passed Resolution 135 which was the sponsorship and agreement with DEP. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 So I'm taking it that this is the next step in this process . At that time I inquire d to Joe O'Brien if there was going to be a request for qualifications regarding the law firms that would be working to secure the easements. And I know -- we asked Joe O'Brien on the 16th of March if there was going to be an RFQ for the qualifications on the law firms that are going to have to secure these easements . So we are looking to get a process , what's the administration 's process for choosing those law firms. MR. GAUGHAN : So one of the things, Councilman Schuster , that I would like to ask for that I think will answer your question in the -- within the legislation , one of the requirements from the state, City official s, Reilly Associate s is that they meet with City official s and meet with the neighbors to update them on the project . So I would like to ask for a public caucus with City official s, Reilly Associates who is the City engineer so that they can bring us up to speed on where we stand here, where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 the neighbors stand. I have been getting a lot of question s from neighbors on this. And as we know from the last time we were updated this is going to be a lengthy process . As Councilman Schuster noted, we did -- the City did enter into a sponsor ship agreement with DEP. Based on that agreement , DEP will be the ones performing the construction activities while the City is going to be responsible for adoption of the watershed stormwater management plan, acquisition of project lands which is a huge part of this. And that's probably going to be the most time consuming is going out and acquiring some of the land there and some of the homes, removal , relocation and adjustment of any conflicting utilities and structures . Again, that is also going to be a time consuming process and then just the operation and maintenance of the completed project . So the request for funding here is in the amount of $500,000. The City is providing a $348,386 match. And the request for funding is going to be used for the acquisition , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 removal , relocation and adjustments of the utilities and structures and then the operation and maintenance of the completed project . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could ask for a public caucus with DEP, Reilly Associates and City officials so that they could give us a complete update on this project . And then we'll obviously get that out to the property owners and hopefully they could be there as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Now with that just being said, Kevin, was that something that we followed up on after that meeting ? I know it was thrown out there. Me and you had a short conversation about it. ATTY. HAYES: (Inaudible .) MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, they're not -- I don't think they're near that -- like, they're not -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I was just looking at preemptively before we get into a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 situation where we have law firms, you know, making hundreds of thousands of dollars here on these acquisition s. It might be good to get that answer upfront. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 by title of Item 6-B. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-B pass reading by title. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , we did get a response back from DPW that will be in Third Order last week, but the main thing I got off this is that routine service wasn't being performed on these trucks. And it wasn't being completed as scheduled due to a lack of reliable spare trucks to fill daily slots of 14 trucks. I think that's one of the problems we have in the maintenance part of DPW. We only have three mechanics . And they're on the same -- their shift is the same shift as when the trucks are going out. So in order to perform maintenance on trucks, you have to take the trucks off the road. Going back probably a little over a decade there were five mechanics in DPW. Three that were on during the day to deal with normal things that came up throughout the course of the day and then two that were on schedule that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 was after the trucks had already came in and then that's when the routine maintenance was performed . And I think that's something we need to get into because if you're looking at this, we're spending $76,000 for six months to rent two trucks. I mean, if you were to times that by two to bring that out to a year, you could more than pay for two more mechanics with $140,000 -- $150.000. That's all I have. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I have similar concerns too, Councilman Donahue . I do appreciate that we've received the information we requested , a lot more details on what repairs were needed for both 6-B and 6-C. However , some of these issues are dating back to, like, 2019. And this is the first that we're hearing about it. And these repairs were not budgeted for previously . And that's why the transfers are coming to us now. And even so, they've already gone ahead with the rental of refuse vehicle s and the repair of the Fire Department ladder. So I still don't understand why this is coming to us now and the repairs have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 already taken place. So if we voted this down, what other option would they have, where would they find that money within the budget that they were already provided for these departments ? I don't have an issue with making sure that these two department s have the supplies and the vehicle s that they need. That's very important for them to perform their job functions . But I just take issue with the process of how this is coming to us. That's all. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , last week I was glad to hear that several other Council members had the same concern s as I had with these couple -- with these two 6-B and 6-C. You know, just as our Council woman said, there is no issue with these department s getting this. But the process that is occurring we asked a week ago for information on these two things to be expedient . And at this point in time I still haven't gotten a chance to read those e-mails. So I'm glad that the e-mails have come through . But with my work schedule 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 and getting here to meeting s when they're coming on Tuesday -- I don't know what time they are arriving today. But I don't have any time to process through those answers and make an informed decision . So I'm glad to see it came. And I'll have time to read those before it goes into Seventh Order. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?

GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I share everyone else's concern s. My other concern is that -- yeah, I don't -- I want to check back on this. But I don't remember the City -- a City administration using contingency funds this early in the year. We have $400,000 budgeted and we've almost used half of it already on things that should have been budgeted for and why aren't we transferring money from within department s which is the way that I've seen it done in the past. So I would like further clarification on that. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question with that being said, President Gaughan , I have seen the same situation occur as I process over the IT Department . We knew there was going be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 an upgrade . Yet this year in the budget there was less of a line item. We're down I think three positions . So that should shore up some money. But we are still overbudgeted in that department . It just doesn't make sense. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 179, 2021 – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE GRANT FUNDS BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (DCED) FOR THE 2015 LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT GRANT (GAMING FUNDS) MONROE COUNTY IN THE AMOUNT OF $225,000.00 TO CONVERT THE SERRENTI MEMORIAL ARMY RESERVE CENTER, LOCATED AT 1801 PINE STREET, INTO AN EMERGENCY SERVICES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 CENTER AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, COORDINATE AND DISBURSE THE GRANT FUNDS AS APPROPRIATE . MR. GAUGHAN : What is recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chair for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage Item 7-A. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , did we get the information that we asked for last week on the total expenditures on this building ? MR. GAUGHAN : No, we asked for -- Mr. Voldenberg request ed a caucus with the Chief of Police and any other City officials to update us on this project . We have to go back and look in the records. But we did receive a pretty lengthy analysis of the money that was spent to date and other items that we had requested . I don't have that in front of me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 right now. But obviously that is probably changed now. It's been a few months. But we did not receive anything yet. But I'm hoping that within the next week or two that we would get those official s in to give us an update on it. MR. SCHUSTER : Is there any kind of timeline or deadline with this money? MR. GAUGHAN : On page number three, prior status deadline , funding must be spent by June 30th, 2021. MR. DONAHUE : I think that's the issue that we have here is that, you know, it's money that was awarded to something else. So unless we reallocate it, it's either use it or lose it situation unfortunately . MR. GAUGHAN : Right. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm looking forward to an update on the Serrenti project .
