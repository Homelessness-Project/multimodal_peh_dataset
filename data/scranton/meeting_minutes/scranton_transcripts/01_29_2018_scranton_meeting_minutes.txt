This is the last week that DPW crews will collect Christmas trees if they are left at the curb. They should not be in bags as they will be recycled, so if you do still have your Christmas tree up this will be the last week for collection . MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers gave public comments : JOAN HODOWANITZ . LES SPINDLER . LEE MORGAN. SAMANTHA MALONEY . MARIE SCHUMACHER .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, I have couple of quick comments to make. I want to thank ABM for the quick response after our meeting last night, getting meters taken care of. It was a heartache on a lot of businesses and people that use our downtown so thank you for getting that taken care of. Hopefully a lesson was learned and that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 doesn't happen again. If there is any issues with meters that definitely won't get bagged and a tagged for not parking . I don't think anybody here agreed with that. Ms. Reed, I have a request for the police station on Olive Street a crossing path. It was brought to my attention from the people that use the Lackawanna river trail a lot of running groups down there, every spot across the way has a nice marked crossway , but actually going from the parking lot to the beginning of the trail on Olive Street and there have been some I know issues in the past of runners getting hit with cars and as was explained to me cars will do a courtesy stop for people if they're crossing the street there, but it doesn't always happen so it becomes a little bit of dangerous situation so if we could get that off to the police station so we can see if we can get that taken care of. I'll touch on the Knowel's insurance report because you brought it up in caucus today, it was brought up today. I think I speak for everyone on this board we are all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 in agreement that this information should be let out, but the issue is the proper procedure for getting that information out. We are not the ones that make that policy on how that information is released. It was given to us but we are not the ones that are able to release it unless we are told it's public information . Unfortunately , it wasn't. We did get it released with legislation last March, but once it becomes part of the legislation it does become public so are we splitting hairs here? Probably . Do we all agree this should be released? Yes. But as Ms. Hodowanitz has mentioned , Ms. Reed is going to put in a Right-to-Know Act and we hope to have that information released as soon as next week. We hope it's a five-day turn around and it's done and it's over with. We all want this, it's just put us behind us and not -- I don't think we should be talking about this anymore . It's just we should all have this out, but unfortunate ly, it's a procedural issue right now, it has nothing to do with any one of our opinions on having it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 released or not. And you know what, that's it. That's all I have to talk about. The ABM thank you, Knowel's insurance report and then if we can get that crossway looked at for Olive Street. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. First, I'd like to just echo what Mr. Perry said that, you know, we would like to get that information out as quickly as possible . Secondly , on what Mrs. Maloney spoke to about the gerrymandering resolution , I'm 100 percent in support of us passing a resolution to Senate Bill 22, in support of the Senate Bill 22 and House Bill 722, and my hope is hopefully that maybe we would be able to get it on the agenda for next week. This is an extremely important issue on how our system of government functions . Voters should pick their representatives , representatives shouldn 't be picking their voters and, I mean, I personally believe that the continuing dysfunction in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Washington is the direct result of gerrymandering across the country . Representatives pander to the extreme fringes of their respective parties instead of where the majority of the people are, which is right in the middle and then although , you know, the PA Supreme Court has just recently ordered the withdrawing of congressional districts that only correct s the previous wrong and it's going to be a require a legislative fix to fix this issue moving forward . In caucus tonight we had Chief Graziano , and I would just like to publically just commend him on his leadership of the police department . And another thing we talked in caucus was possibly I have been going back and forth with a few school board members about the possibility of setting up some sort of working group committee to explore areas where the city and the district can share services . Me, personally , I'm fully aware of financial issues of the school district . I mean, I spent two years on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 board warning about their deteriorating situation but when my term was up in 2015 I wasn't very confident that the board would sufficiently address the issues, but all that steep hill decline moving forward , I believe the combination of new board members and some logically thinking former members sort of creates a situation where we could maybe start to work together to find some savings . And that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, do you have any motions or comments ? MS. EVANS: Yes, I do. Tonight I'm going to talk briefly about a very important topic, one that is integral to the lifeblood of the community , in fact, this is a subject that in many ways defines a community and how we treat this issue says a lot about who we are as citizens of free society , that topic is the arts. There has been a lot of noise lately about the arts in our community I want to be clear and reinforce my opinion on this matter. I have always been and always will be a supporter of the arts. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 have the utmost respect for the creative class and we all should in our way appreciate the talents and sacrifices of those who make the arts their calling . One of the most visionary moments in the history of Lackawanna County government occurred when the county established a modest arts and culture tax. While I'm never a fan of any new tax, this one not only created a sustainable recurring fund for great institutions like the Everhart Museum, the Lackawanna County Library system and the Scranton Cultural Center, it also created funding to promote and assist hundreds of artists throughout our community . Additionally , this generated significant economic and cultural growth in Scranton and through out Lackawanna County. The mission statement of Lackawanna County Office of Arts and Culture reads in part: We will advocate and support high quality arts opportunities and programs for people of all ages throughout Lackawanna County. The office provides services and grants for artists and art organizations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 throughout our region. After more than a decade, they are been brought in these services . I have one word for the work of the Lackawanna County Office of Arts and Culture, bravo. And, finally , the arts should always transcend politics . I would like to read two quotes about the arts to reinforce that belief, the first from John F. Kennedy who said, "If art is to nourish the roots of our culture , society must set the artist free to follow it's vision wherever it takes him." And the second quote is from Ronald Regan who said, "In an atmosphere of liberty , artists and patrons are free to think the unthinkable and create the audacious . They are free to make both horrendous mistakes and glorious celebrations . " I think people would agree where there is freedom art succeeds. That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. I'd like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 make a motion to place a resolution in support of the Citizens ' Commission for Legislative and Congressional Redistricting on the agenda for next week. MR. DONAHUE : I could second that. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, On the question . I am going to BE supporting this next week. I agree with Mrs. Maloney and others who have also supported it tonight and in the past. I do think that gerrymandering is a political weapon to maintain political power at the expense of voters throughout the state and I think in the interest of fairness and transparency that should end so I will be supporting that. MS. EVANS: On the question , my question is procedural , would we require that to be on the agenda as a resolution or it something we can maybe have a motion made and voted up or done? I'm not sure. Amil, maybe you can touch on that or what are your thought on that? MR. MINORA: Well, there is certainly nothing wrong with a written 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 resolution , but I think a voice vote on a motion, you know, also would be appropriate so it's I guess it's the discretion of the board and the council . MR. ROGAN: Well, it's your motion, Mr. Gaughan , so -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, the resolution is already been written up, I don't know, we would probably wouldn't want to make any changes to it. I can just, to be proper, it should probably be voted on. MR. MINORA: Okay. I mean, a written resolution is fine and you would have to vote on it, obviously . MR. EVANS: I'm fine with that. I just want to make sure that it was a matter of procedure because it's not our resolution , it's obviously a resolution written for us, but if we put it on as our resolution . MR. ROGAN: So just to be clear the motion is to vote on the motion, to vote on that resolution next week? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, place it on the agenda.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? MR. PERRY: I'm in favor for that. That will give us the time to take a look at it, and again, gerrymandering at it's root is, as we all said, it's political manipulation . It has been used for that by whoever is in office, whether it's a Republican or whether it's a Democrat . That's just something you look at and I'm sure you are very familiar with it. If you look at the state map or any state map or time after time after time it just changes by how they want it to change based on data and the more data that you have, which is right now pretty much everything that you could have at your fingertips, it's pretty much going to get edited right down to the street on where they want it, so I have no problem with that, obviously we can take look at it and we can vote on it next week. MR. ROGAN: On the issue, obviously , I'll have more comments on the materials . Next week I don't know have a problem giving it a vote. I'd just like to remind all of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 the councilmen , any type of motion should be given to the members in advance though prior to the meeting if possible . Anyone else? MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Just a follow-up on Councilman Donahue said about working together with the school district , as the chairperson of the subcommittee on intergovernmental relations , I am very much looking forward to being a part of a city, school district shared services committee. I also think we should eventually include the county. I think a jointly legislative committee on government consolidation and shared services is not only a good idea but a necessity especially in light of the condition of the Scranton School district . As the school district goes, so goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 the city so any areas that we can meet together on, work together and collaborate is a good thing. We need to look within ourselves as a city and to our neighbors to share, partner and collaborate to better meet citizens ' needs and make progress towards the future. Shared services and collaboration is sometimes met with suspicion and resistance . That's the way we have always done it attitude. We need to make sure to look past this and recognize the opportunities that are present . Municipalities across the state and across the country are sharing services to deal with lagging revenue and fewer resources . Sharing services allow local governments and school districts to decrease both the cost and the complexity of the services they provided their constituents while providing a higher level of service overall . I believe that it's time that we explore innovative ways to control costs by eliminating duplicative services and we should also seriously explore providing services at a regional level. Some of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 areas in which we can work together are through administrative functions , joint procurement of professional engineering services is one example . It will allow us improved purchasing power if we work together with the school district . Legal counsel , sharing legal counsel , health insurance , general operations , IT functions , public safety, storm water issues within the city and the county. One of the examples of intergovernmental cooperation that we have been a part of over the last few years is the land bank, a great example . Almost 50 properties so far have gone through the land bank and they have and put back on the tax rolls. Another example of working together with the municipalities and boroughs around the county is SAPA, the Scranton Abington Planning Association . That's also been successful . So I think that she should use a great challenges that face the city and the school district and the county as an opportunity through this committee to work together towards the common goal of insuring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 our stability into the future while lessening the financial burden of our citizens . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just two quick items, I guess one of the benefits of being president is everything that mostly everything that needed to be said was said but I do want to thank ABM again for their quick work on getting their meters back up and running for our downtown business district . I think last week every council member addressed that issue and it shows that, you know, you get public attention on something and things get done, so I'm very happy to hear about that. A couple of comments , it is an agenda item but I'll bring it up now, it is the alternative to arrest community policing legislation and one comment that was made that kind of bothered me in reference comparing this program to what Philadelphia is doing. For those who don't know, Philadelphi a is considering allowing safe zones where people who are addicted to drugs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 can go and do the drugs in a safe manner. This is the exact opposite of that program where instead of encouraging people to continue to use drugs it's encouraging them to seek help to go into rehab to better themselves , but to do that by giving them a second chance. Not every person who is arrested for a minor drug issue deserves to be in jail. Many people deserve a second chance. We have all had second chances throughout life. I'm proud to support this program and I really think Scranton has a number of great departments , but one of our best is our police department and Chief Graziano does an amazing job at looking at programs like this that many of other police departments aren't even looking at. This is something that's innovative that can help the community , and if you think an issue doesn't touch you it does. There is countless stories every day of people who are effected by opioid addiction . There is also a crime component . Somebody who is addicted to drugs needs to fund their habit, whether that's through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 property crimes, whether that's though more serious crimes, but the cure to this problem is by programs like this and if they work and they are successful at something I think we can expand and really make it into something that can be a national model for other citizens to follow, so I do want to thank Chief Graziano for that -- for coming in and explaining this to us once again and be very happen to vote "yes" on this program . I did mention property crime, I forget to mention this earlier , if we can send a letter to the police department . I have been in touch, I have heard from a number of residents , a couple of people in South Scranton that there were burglaries again to steal copper out of the homes. This was a big problem a number of years ago when the price of metals was much higher. It did seem to dissipate as the price of copper and other metals dropped. We are seeing once again in vacant homes and homes is that have under renovation project so if anyone is watching if you can keep and eye 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 on your neighbors and just so our police department knows that this is something that is unfortunately rearing it's head again. And that is all. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 58, 2016, (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “ESTABLISHING A REGISTRATION PROGRAM FOR RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES ; REQUIRING ALL OWNERS OF RESIDENTIAL RENTAL PROPERTIES TO DESIGNATE A PROPERTY MANAGER FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS AND PRESCRIBING DUTIES OF OWNERS, PROPERTY MANAGERS AND OCCUPANTS ” BY AMENDING SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS , TENANT, TO ADD A DEFINITION UNDER THE LETTER (H). MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? On the question , this is a very small amendment to the rental registration program . Actually there was -- in last year's version there was a difference of interpretation between 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 what council passed and the administration enforced and the purpose of this correction is to ensure that people who own a property say they own a duplex and they rent out the other half that they are not being assessed a rental registration , which was never the intent of this ordinance to go after homeowners , but there were some discrepancies on interpretation s so this will clear that up and so if you are out there and you own a two-unit property and live in one unit and rent out the other, both units will be exempt from the rental registration . On the question , anybody else all? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye.

PERRY: Yes, just on the question , Chief Graziano was in our caucus today and I believe Mr. Evans is the one that brought this up, this project is still -- we are still committed to having this being grant fed. I know there was some questions on whether this was going to come from our general fund or move budgetary money to keep the keep the Serrenti building up and running , but as of right now all the monies that we'll be using for any kind of upgrades have been coming through federal grants. And, also, it was brought up by Mr. Evans whether we are still on track with if we sell the building , the property on Ash Street, which is now being used as a training facility , once we have the Serrenti building up and running we get everything out of there and that property , wheat we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 would like to do, and the chief is not against us putting that money aside to use for occurring costs that the Serrenti bidding will generate as far as utilities . MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , I have provided objections to this project before we voted on it so I'll be voting against this tonight just for the simple fact that I don't think that we should be converting the reserve center to an emergency services center for the pure fact that it's going to add additional stress, maintenance , especially maintenance stress on future budgets moving forward .
