MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community and also especially for Detective Kyle Gilmartin and his family and also Jack Seitzinger , Arlene Shahum, Louis Boino, Robert Brown, Pauline Sallusti . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. At this time would the family like to come down for the proclamation . MAYOR COGNETTI : -- and I saw each other -- a couple of things, Bill, a couple of times in the last years but then we -- I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 it was just in November or December -- UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: It was in actually October because it was World Polio -- MAYOR COGNETTI : Yes, World Polio Day and we mentioned , you know, of course, and talked many times that her mother was the first female City Council member. And I said -- she said I think it's been 50 years. And I said, well, 50 years we really need to do something in the month of January which would have been the 50th anniversary of her swearing in. So we wanted to honor Grace O'Malley Schimelfenig being the first woman to serve as a City Council member -- a first woman City Council member. So it's wonderful , of course, to have Dr. Rothchild up here with us as well. There still haven't been too many female members serving in obviously the Mayor's seat or on City Council . So we're very excited to honor her here today. So we have this proclamation jointly from the Mayor and all of Council . I'll read it to you all because she deserves a full bio. Whereas , the City of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 applauds the 'firsts' in our history and seeks opportunities to honor our rich past while progressing into the future; and Whereas , Grace O'Malley Schimelfenig was the first woman elected to the Scranton City Council , where she served on the Community Development Committee from 1974-1978; and Whereas , after graduating from Technical High School, Grace began her career at WVIA-TV/FM and supported public affairs programming , support services , and production ; and. Whereas , Grace not only was elected to City Council , but also led her party's eight-candidate race with the most votes received in the general election ; and Whereas , after her service in Scranton , Grace became the first ever Borough Manager of Old Forge, PA, where she managed the borough 's budget, finances , and contracts for two years; and Whereas , Grace continued her life in public service through a role at the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services supporting hospitals in our region; and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Whereas , for decades , Grace advocated for women in professional spaces, having served as a Board Member for the Lackawanna Commission for Women, former President of American Women in Radio and TV, the women's division of the National Association of Broadcasters , and former President and Woman of the Year of the American Business Women's Association ; and Whereas , Grace retired in 1997 to Lake Scranton Road after a fulfilling , civic-minded life, and it is clear from her life of service , community involvement , and volunteerism that she merits recognition . Therefore , I, Mayor Paige G. Cognetti , along with Scranton City Council Members , honor the legacy of Grace O'Malley Schimelfenig on this day, January 23, 2024, and thank her for trailblazing paths for women to participate in our local government . MR. SMURL: Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MONTH ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2023. 3.B. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON POLICE PENSION COMMISSION MEETING HELD DECEMBER 20, 2023. 3.C. MINUTES OF THE COMPOSITE PENSION BOARD MEETING HELD DECEMBER 20, 2023. 3.D. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REGARDING TWO (2) BUDGET TRANSFERS . 3.E. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT FOR THE YEAR TO DATE DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND YEAR TO YEAR COMPARISON REPORT FOR THE YEARS 2022 AND 2023. 3.F. CORRESPONDENCE DATED JANUARY 21, 2024, FROM BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR /ARPA DIRECTOR , REGARDING AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN UPDATE. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a comment on two order items, Item 3-A just to bring it to everyone 's attention . There's over $76,000 in labor counsel billing for the month of December . I'm still waiting on my response from labor counsel on billing . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 And if we could check in for updates. I know they have been telling me for quite some time that they are getting them together . But if we could just check on those updates for labor counsel . And the second thing is, $4,000 payment for Nossaman . Since it's on the billing list if we could also check into speaking with maybe the Business Administrator to see if we could get an update on some of the actions that Nossaman has done since we got that last update I think in March of 2023. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Item 3-D just to point out as well, it's a budget transfer . It's $72,000 that's being transfer red into H. R. Professional Services . And that's going towards labor counsel . So that $72,000 was something that wasn't budgeted in the 2023 budget. That has increased in the 2024 budget by several hundred thousand dollars , but just pointing that $72,000 was not included in the 2023 budget for labor counsel . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. SMURL: Any other comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one or two. I wanted to mention the Scranton Ice Festival that will be coming up and that will be taking place February 9th and February 10th. February 9th is a Friday. So I think it will start in the evening I believe 5:30 and then go throughout the day Saturday . There will be ice carving demonstrations , music, food, a lot going on downtown that weekend that I think will be just a really great way to get out during the wintertime, just, you know, put some layers on if it's a cold night and enjoy the ice carving s that will be around the city. And I know we had a flyer placed here. I'm thinking Norma might be the culprit . I'm not sure if you wanted us to announce it or not. I was going to anyway. So for Valentine 's weekend that same weekend as the Ice Festival , the 9th and 10th, there will be a food drive over at Nay Aug at the normal drop-off place at the community room for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 other drives that they've run. And Saturday will be from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and then that Sunday, February 11th from 12 to 3. And they're looking for nonperishable food items as well as cash donation s. Everything will go to local food pantries. And then lastly, I just wanted to mention I was really happy to see that Detective Gilmartin was released from the hospital from the acute care side of things today. It sounds like he will be going into a rehab facility for some time while he continue s to recover and rehabilitate from his injuries . So I was happy to see him making that progress forward . And in my field I feel like I'm, you know, maybe a little better understanding of what is ahead for him. And I wish him all the best and his family. I've been really happy to see the continued support for them. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'm sure by now everyone is aware and heard of the fantastic news that Detective Gilmartin was release d from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Geisinger and moved to a rehabilitation unit in Philadelphia . I watched the video of him coming out of Geisinger today -- excuse me -- I'm sorry, surround ed by his family, his brothers and sisters in blue. He waived to the crowd. I also watched the video of Detective Gilmartin being received by the Philadelphia Police Department . Both videos were extremely moving. I continue to pray for Detective Gilmartin , his family, and his brothers and sisters in blue of the Scranton Police Department . Detective Gilmartin is a true warrior. And that is all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. KING: I also would like to express how happy I was -- actually relieved to see Detective Gilmartin leaving that hospital today and seeing his arm raised and wave to all of his comrade s and colleagues and family and friends . It's truly a miracle that he's still alive considering the way that he was ambushed . So we will all continue to keep him in our thought s and prayers . And I know there's, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 know, lots of fundraisers out there to support the family. And we're fortunate that, you know, we'll continue to pray that he has a full recovery as possible from this terrible , terrible attack on him. So we'll continue to pray for Detective Gilmartin . Just a reminder , the City Council meeting next Tuesday night has been moved to Wednesday , January 31st with the caucus at 5:45 and then the meeting at 6:30. And the reason for that is due to the PUC hearing that is scheduled here in Scranton at the Scranton Cultural Center at 1 p.m., and also at 6 p.m. And I'm schedule d to speak on behalf of the citizens of Scranton . I don't know what time but I did receive confirmation that I am on the list to speak and I filed my formal complaint today across the street. So hopefully everyone else will continue to file those complaints . And when I do speak next week, I would encourage anyone to send me an e-mail. I'm obviously going to speak on behalf of my personal situation with increases but to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 honest, I'm more concerned about everyone else's increases , the way that they've been affected by these. If anyone could send me an e-mail, you know, at W King at Scranton , PA dot gov. If you would like me to mention something while I have the opportunity to speak about maybe your own unique situation or how this -- how these rate hikes have affected you and your family, I'd appreciate it if you would just send me an e-mail with some bullets or some highlight s that maybe I could mention in my remarks on January 30th. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? And anyone else that would like to speak at the public hearing , if you go online -- PUC online, there's a number there. You have to call to get on the list to speak there. So it has to be by the 25th. MR. KING: You could call or e-mail. I e-mailed. And they e-mailed back. And I believe Dr. Rothchild did the same thing. They respond ed and told us that we're on the list to speak. MR. SMURL: Okay. But if you want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 to speak, you've got to contact them first. Okay. Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Mr. McAndrew , would you please stand up and show everybody your T-shirt? You've got great taste. Turn around. You too could be fashion able. Okay, speaking of police and the firefighters , still no contracts on the City's website . For the firefighters it's now 296 days. For the police, 179 days. And, Mr. Schuster , I'm glad you mentioned the Controller 's report with the Ufberg Associates being paid $76,263.26 in December . They are the city's labor counsel . I'm sure that is due to these union contracts , which he's been working since November of 2021. And then the budget transfer in HR, $72,000 from the nonunion health insurance to professional services which, of course, is quote, we have outstanding labor counsel bills. I would love to know how much money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 we've paid Ufberg since November of 2021. That's got to be a major, major bill. But nobody is telling me anything . Please in Fifth Order if you would update us on the status of the tax relief legislation for the September 9th flood victims . Item 5-C, the legislation to reopen Center Street, I saw on the legisla tive cover sheet that they are looking to select an alternative site for this pedestrian living alley. Does anybody know if they have anything in mind? MR. SMURL: They haven't said anything to me. All we received was the Center Street, they came to a decision on that one. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And with regard to the concern that everyone has about gang activity in the city and the county, I understand that everybody is joining together and ideas for various task force and the city working with the county and other municipalities and various law enforcement agencies . I would like to point out that one of the safest places for children to go to that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 is fun, educational , and safe is your public library . They have scores of various programs for children . We have the county children 's library just up the street full of programs for young people be they, you know, toddlers up through teenagers in high school, all kinds of things for them. So my recommendation is that as you join together and brainstorming ideas to counter this activity with gangs and children trying to join gangs that you include the local library . And the CEO Scott Thomas I'm sure would be very happy. The other thing is, we have to keep in mind that, you know, Covid had a major impact on socialization of children , loss of literacy. You know the director -- the Executive Director of the county library system which includes the Scranton Public Library sits on the county literacy committee , which is specifically targeting , you know, this issue of the loss of literacy among our children . So please keep in mind that one of the backbone s of our community is the public library . It serves the entire population of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the city. You don't have to have any money. All you do is ask for a library card free of charge, there it is. So I can't emphasize how important the role of the public library is in this community . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And the weather held me up for two weeks. And I was wondering do I get my five minutes -- do I get 15 minutes now tonight ? I always have things on my mind. But I have to start with saying I too was thrilled to see the news and detective coming out. I had tears in my eyes to think that we all prayed so much for him and this medical team and everything , you know, so kudos to the team that worked so diligently . And our prayers were certainly answered that he's been moved to a rehab center. So prayers will continue that he'll be up and around. And I don't know the extent of his injuries if he will ever be the same person again but I do pray that we could expect a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 miracle in that area. I want to start off tonight by thanking Chris Kelly and the article that was in the Sunday's paper on the shelter offers support and alternatives to gangs. And he went through a very good description of what goes on down at the Northeast Pennsylvania Teen Center down on Wyoming Avenue which is where Maureen Gray runs that organization down there. And they have open houses very often down there. So I'm surprised at when Chris Kelly said in the article that he did not know that. So you could expect me going forward as soon as I hear that they have an open house down there that I will be mentioning it so that people know what goes on down at that center. They do a great job down there. I have been down there. I don't volunteer . My time is -- my calendar is full of volunteering , but I do go down. And I do order things off Amazon and I want to give the website of Amazon so that you can order and the things will be delivered right to their center. Is Https slash slash A dot CO slash 7 UVEQ4U at Amazon.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 And they have a list of all of the things that they need there and just very easy to do and just order and it's delivered there to the shop. And you know why do they have to order, because they do give the kids a hot meal when they come in. They've got a laundry there. And they've got a counsellor there. So it's a wonderful tool that we could use to help our teens as they go through this troubling time of trying to belong. And also in the same Sunday paper finding the right path. And this was because NeighborWorks I think put this one outside . And that was another great article and helping our teens. These kids are our future. I do a lot of volunteer work out in the city. And if I could touch one person, if I could keep one person from going to prison and being down in Lackawanna County Jail I've done my part. I did look up and see how many residents do we have in the City of Scranton . We have about 79,000 people in Scranton. If half of us did a little bit, that would be 40,000 of us reaching out to these kids to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 offer some help to them to build these program s and to volunteer . I know that everyone can't volunteer but they could help in any way that they can, just reaching out to Maureen Gray to reaching out to organization s that are helping NeighborWorks and all that are working with these kids. I want to give Maureen 's telephone number too to anyone out there. Her number -- she could be reached at 570-904-7449. So I just -- my heart just goes out to kids. I work with kids and tutor kids after school on Mondays. You know, I was up there with your kids, Mark McAndrew . You know, it's just such a heartwarming feeling when you know that you are doing something to help these kids. So that anything that we as a public can do to keep them from getting into trouble and to becoming a part of a gang, you know, we're all going to feel better because like the article said in the paper, gang violence requires community solutions . And we're all a part of that community . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mrs. Jeffries , will you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 provide Mr. Voldenberg that e-mail address for Amazon? MS. JEFFRIES : I'm sorry? MR. SMURL: Will you provide Mr. Voldenberg with that e-mail address for Amazon? MS. JEFFRIES : Oh, sure. MR. SMURL: So we could maybe get it on our website . MS. JEFFRIES : Sure. I'll send it to him in an e-mail. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Ms. JEFFRIES : Okay. MR. SMURL: Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : First of all, I want to congratulate Mr. Smurl on his presidency . I also wanted to mention I don't know if it's been fixed, but the website -- your website was not working this morning when I went on. It was saying that you didn't have an update entrusted certificate . And then when I went through anyway, it was all weirded out and it wouldn't open up. So I don't know if it's fixed by now. I also want to commend the nurses that were on strike up at Geisinger CMC this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 morning . They are short-staffed . And I back the nurses. And I think we all should. I also want to congratulate them. They really did a wonderful thing. They did not take away from patient care. They did it on their breaks, their lunch hours and the ones that had days off. Nobody went out and struck and the patient s didn't have their full normal staff. I think they should be commend ed for that. I also want to talk about the Northeast PA Youth Shelter . But Norma actually said most of it. I'm very familiar with that also. And it's a wonderful place to donate. It's a wonderful place for kids. Maureen Gray is an amazing woman. They have a music studio in there where the kids could make records . And it's wonderful . And I think with the gang violence , what we need here and we talk about the parks that we have and, you know, we talk about pickleball courts which are all wonderful and everything , but what do we really have for the kids that's free? I know we've been trying to get the city to put up a basketball court up at Nay Aug. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 You know where kids that don't have enough money to join private clubs could bring their own ball, just like the volleyball thing up there. It's wonderful because kids in the neighborhood , they bring their own ball and then they come up there and they actually have whole groups of them that, you know, make their own games going. We need more free things around here. When I grew up we had a lot of places to go as teenagers . I don't know where any place where teenagers go now. Of course, I don't have any teenagers so there might be more than I know of but I really don't think there is. Okay, so moving off that since Norma said most of it, I just want to mention that that curb was never cut on Olive and Colfax. They never did anything with that. I know it's winter but I'm hoping in the spring maybe they could do something for that. And then I want to talk about on my block, 421 Colfax Avenue, I know that it was slated to be torn down. I know that Mr. Smurl told me one day that they took it to court so now it's held up and it can't be done. I mean, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 this goes over and over again. There should be some kind of court limit where they -- of how much. But meanwhile, the sidewalk , and I know you because I know Mr. Smurl and his crew cleaned up that whole part for us which was wonderful . It was last summer. But there is no sidewalk there. It got pushed up by the -- when they had the dumpster up there and they were paving the street. They pushed the dumpster up and all the big hunks of it got pushed up onto the lawn. It's very, very difficult walking there. And now it's even more difficult because it's winter. And I don't know if something could be done with that. I know they were talking sidewalks just now with NeighborWorks I couldn't really hear it. I know beautiful blocks happened . I know that's a whole separate program . But is there anything that the city does where people just keep on stalling so that their stuff can't be torn down when they are hazards like this house is? Is there anything they do that they could put in where you make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 it more walkable ? MR. SMURL: I don't know in the city because it's in litigation right now it's in court. I know it's not finished yet. But I don't know if the city can touch that. Mr. Voldenberg , will you send that down to the Law Department and ask them if the city is allowed to touch that? There's a big piece of slate sticking up there. I saw it. It's a hazard, even putting a horse or something on it. But being that it's in court right now I don't know if -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MS. KOLOSKI : Yeah, I know you know what I mean because you guys did a great job, you and Frenchy and the gang there. We really appreciate d it because before you couldn't walk through it all. And because I walk with an apparatus , it's harder for me. But people with stroller s and stuff, it's hard for them. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Doris, the eight pickleball courts and two multipurpose courts and plus all the things behind the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 community room at Nay Aug Park is starting this spring. It's already funded, and it's on its way. MS. KOLOSKI : No, I understand that. MR. SMURL: That's as fast as we could go. MS. KOLOSKI : Yeah, I'm not even picking at that. But what I'm saying is we need more things for the youth for the kids. I mean, the pickleball courts are going to be used probably by people my age and between 40 and my age. MR. SMURL: I don't know if you could take that walker on the court. MS. KOLOSKI : But I would like to see -- but I'd like to see basketball courts or, you know, things that kids don't need to go out and buy expensive equipment to use, just food for thought when you have your task force. MR. SMURL: Thank you. James Barrett . MR. BARRETT : Good evening , City Council . I'm just here to talk about the stormwater runoff that is on Snook Street and Seymour Avenue. You brought up in the public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 caucus that there is work in progress for possibly in the spring for it to be fixed. But the main concern was over the weekend several calls went into DPW and there is no dispatch er on duty on the weekend to receive calls. It was sort of like an emergency situation up there the amount of ice. And one DPW worker did post something online apologizing to people how bad it was. It says what you're looking at is 10 to 18 inches of ice buildup on Seymour Avenue and Snook Street that was left all weekend , knowingly trapping resident s in their homes and damaging the vehicle of those that tried to traverse . Union leadership spoke to a supervisor about this Saturday and they were told not to run overtime . This is again saving a dollar and putting resident s in extreme danger. Resident s called DPW all Saturday night and Sunday but could not get through because the DPW does not have a dispatcher on the weekend s. These type of things need to change and we want to say to resident s that your DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 union workers are on call 24/7 for these type of emergencies but can't fix them if we're not even called in or even a person at the desk to receive calls. But I have pictures . I don't know if you guys want to see how bad it was. But DPW did come up yesterday morning with heavy equipment . They dug out the whole street. They brought up the big dump truck. They hauled everything . I compliment them for everything they did. Does anybody know -- MR. SMURL: Yeah, Mr. King in Fifth Order he will update you on that. We're not waiting until spring to correct it. That will be done very shortly . The engineer was there today. But Mr. King will update you in Fifth Order. MR. BARRETT : I know Pennsylvania American Water was up there about two weeks ago and the contract or that was hired by Pennsylvania American Water had opened up a drainage pipe that was in front of this house where all the water was coming from and they didn't like that that was going into the sewer system, I guess --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. SMURL: It can't go into the sewer. That's why it had to be shut. MR. BARRETT : Yeah, he shut it off. MR. SMURL: Right. It has to be stormwater . MR. BARRETT : All right. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? There's no one else on the list. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First I want to start off with the health coordinator position . Has the remainder of the three year grant that was given to the City of Scranton , has that position ever been refilled? I understand the city was supposed to provide a cost analysis on the job to validate it's actual funding. Was that ever complete d and can we view it? And if it was not refilled, what happens to the remaining of the -- did we just no longer collect any funds from the -- I believe it was Mercy Hospital ? Is there an update or any news on the Serrenti Center and the misapplication s of funds and where we currently stand on it? We currently have a code blue. But I'm going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 call back to code red I asked about when we had the Canadian wild fires. Are we ever going to address a code red situation again or are we going to forget that because it was in the summer? What I presented to you, I presented you a spread sheet on the Recovery Act funds, the public facing portal seems to be lacking updated information as even Nay Aug pool is not listed as obligated . As Council was told, the revenue loss amount of 10 million dollars has already been 100 percent allocated . But obviously of that, none of that is actually listed as allocated . Three million is actually allocated out of that entire fund. We also have three lines for payment in public health with blank descriptions . And we have four places where dollar figures were actually calculated to the trillionth of a penny. They must be really good in account ing if they go down to the trillionth of a penny, ten decimal places after the period. Is someone just not paying attention ? It was also brought up to me on a phone call that evidently water bills failed to go out last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 month and they are doubling up on this month. And the water company is tacking on a late fee for all of those water bills. So they are taking on a late fee for not paying a bill for something that they never billed. And the only way for citizens to actually get that money refunded is they have to call up and complain to the water company directly . They are not being refunded late fees for bills that they never received . I think that's a big issue with the water company as well. Now moving onto my appeal with the office of open records . My response to the City of Scranton restated my position . The crux of the argument is the city contends that the city is not in possession of a record that mirrors the language of an organization that was specifical ly seeked in my request . It is not that records do not exist unless on a suit being resolve d we are to assume that the City of Scranton on payment and settlement immediately destroys all documents , Enron's it in violation of its own three year retention policy for all documents after creating a nonpublic PO and invoice for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 everything and changing it to AP posting dates. We're to assume that the City of Scranton pays out $5,323,701.29 and has no records to confirm this action or no tracking , a serious breech of fiduciary responsibility . Second, I asked -- physical examination of the records and that was never addressed . Last, I provided a format to limit the direct scope of the research . It was support ed that it is reasonable to block a request because it does not mirror specific language in the way that records are combined . It will only force more broad terms for all documents , e-mails, copies of legal suits filed, interoffice communication related to any settlement by court and mediation regardless of the format. I put it forth in the position I did and the wording I did to limit the scope and the burden on the Right to Know Office. But it seems that we no longer have the ability for a right to know because if you don't ask for specific words we're denied. And this is in bad faith and in serious opposition to the intent of the law. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. King and Dr. Rothchild , you are both speaking at the PUC meeting. Is that something that you could perhaps bring up because everybody 's bills were late last month and they were charged a finance charge and I heard Mr. Schuster say that his was in the mailbox and they called and said his bill is late. So maybe it's something you could bring up. Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, one other comment there. Mr. Voldenberg , the -- Mr. Coyne asked about the health coordinator . Can we get his questions -- the question s that he had are some of the same questions I had for a while. So if we could get his questions answered . Also, I'm going to turn over this paper to you. But there was three pieces on the ARPA funds that are blank. I did take a look at that online. But the dollar amounts for public health are $37,151.28, 4,275.72, and then $7,478. If we could just find out what the subcategory and what the spending was for those in public health with the ARPA funds? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. DR. ROTHCHILD : And I had recently asked about the public health coordinator as well. So I'll explain that response when I get to Fifth. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . I wasn't -- I wasn't going to come tonight because my furnace went out at the house. By the time it was fixed I was just in a bad mood. But I read today's article about this problem . This isn't a new problem . Years ago I stood right here and told you like a little fat 15 year old from Wilkes-Barre tried to sell me a gun over on Luzerne Street. This has been around for -- growing and growing . Meeting s aren't going to solve it and grants and loans and people coming and speakers . I've lived on the streets in my younger days. You're going to have to -- you're talking about adding lessons . They find bad more interesting , colorful, more alluring, especially the females . You see that in movies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 sometimes , but this is a fact. I wish I could relate some of the -- my experiences from 50 years ago because it was same then as it is now, same. You're dealing with irrational people. You got to remember that. And you got people trying to protect their children from reality from the real world and that doesn't work either. I don't know how you could attack the crime of younger people except by pure shocking some of them and sitting them down and making them see the results of bad. You show them blood. Show them the death -- what death is like. Show them a wrecked car with brain matter all over it. These things are reality that they don't -- they don't acknowledge or something . You know when a young person dies they put up I love you signs and some teddy bears and some crosses and then they go on. That's not really reality . I think when you're young you think nothing can happen to you. I certainly did. You got some -- I've talked to a couple teachers over the years at Sheetz at night for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 a minute or two. They tell me they have some children that the guardians don't get up to feed them. They wear the same clothes two, three four days a row at school. Schools are nothing but just caretakers now for these little adolescents and their heros are bad. I was at the car wash on Providence Road last summer, and you should have -- you should have just heard some of the remarks that I heard them talking to each other. They're sitting there smoking , which doesn't bother me. I never encountered these things because my boy grew up, bad was skipping school or something , you know? You people got a problem . And you're handling it wrong. You're handling it like talking it over and all. You're going to have to do something serious . Jail doesn't seem to bother big people. You see that smirking fool come out of the cell. Let's see what he looks like in a year and then you show that to your children . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , city resident . I wonder why we start things and then they just disappear . The one that I'm interested in right now, the fire station study. Where does it stand? When does it end? When does the public get to input? MR. KING: Marie, I believe that legislation was put before Council . I'm trying to remember if it was 90 or $100,000 to do a study to try to replace Engine 10 or whether to refurbish or put it somewhere else and City Council voted it down. We said take the 100,000 and figure out how to use that money to put it -- leave it right where it is, expand it on the existing property there rather than waste the 100,000 or $110,000 to do a study. We know from the past that fire station is greatly needed up in East Mountain . They took it away for several years and there was a horrendous fire up there. And it took quite a long time for our fire department to get there. So that's kind of where that study is pertaining to at least Engine 10. Legislation was shot down to do a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 study. So I don't know if there is any further movement in terms of, you know, expanding into 10 or not. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, what I worry about then if it's not put in -- if somebody could bring it up again in six month? MR. KING: Good question . Why don't we send a question down to the administration and ask them since that legislation was denied by Council , what's the game plan for improving Engine 10 up on the East Mountain or expanding it if you could, Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you, yes. That's good. The LERTAs, has that program ended and do you think it was a good program or not? MR. SCHUSTER : We've never gotten any information on it. MS. SCHUMACHER : No, we -- no, I mean, you -- well, maybe not this Council but Council -- MR. SCHUSTER : You were looking for some of the metrics on how we prove that it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 worth our while, but we've never received anything like that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, maybe somebody from the Chamber of Commerce because that's who you had market it. MR. KING: Frank, maybe we could have the administration look into the most recent LERTA program and see how successful they've been. I know that the one thing that people get concerned about with KOZs and LERTAs is that they take advantage of the tax breaks and then once the LERTA runs out or the KOZ runs out, they pick up and move out of town. I know that was a concern when I was Superintendent at the Lakeland School District . So we rather than just agreeing to a 10 year LERTA, we had them put some skin in the game and had them -- worked a deal where they paid 5 percent of the tax the first year, 10 percent the next year, 15, working their way until ultimately the 9th and 10th year was 50 percent . And then it became a full 100 percent so that minimally if they picked up and left after 10 years full tax break, at least we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 recouped some taxes during that time. So maybe if we could reach out to the administration and see what active LERTAs are existing within the city and find out if we could determine the success rate of those. I would appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. And I'll reach out to the Chamber also. MR. SCHUSTER : And I think find out when it ends. I'm pretty -- from by recollection I think it began in 2015. So I would imagine that we have -- probably 2025 I would think it ends. MR. KING: If we can find out the beginning date and termination date of that. Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Can we get something on Meadow Brook 2 Program ? How -- I mean, we got a lot of rights of ways we need to do that program . And I think it's scheduled to start; isn't it this year? MR. SCHUSTER : We contracted with someone to get the right-of-ways done. I know at one point we only had one right-of-way. But we did contract with them. So that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 something else so if we can get an update on Meadow Brook to how many -- have we secured any more right-of-ways and where are we at with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's with Attorney Hughes. I'll reach out to him. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, I'm sorry. My time is up. MR. KING: No, we're going to extend it because we talked through a lot of your -- MS. SCHUMACHER : But, yeah, if you could do that on a regular basis that would be -- that would be nice. The rest I could hold until next week. MR. MCANDREW : So, Mrs. Schumacher , I remember you posing a LERTA question within the past two years. And I remember we got something back. MS. SCHUMACHER : You brought -- you had a caucus. You brought the person from the Chamber of Commerce because you gave them the job of marketing the whole program . But then -- MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, there was specific criteria versus a KOZ, you know, but I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 remember you asking -- posing this question at least two years ago. Frank, there's got to be something maybe in an e-mail with one of our responses . And, of course, we'd want another update since then where we're at with it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : But I do remember you asking. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , Rick Little, Scranton . This problem with a lot of things and people talk about it. Behind the scenes there is a much bigger problem and that is -- of the judiciary , the judicial branch of the United States after Marborol {phonetic } versus Madison . Tom Jefferson and his letters to John Adams would talk about how this thing of caselaw is like thieves in night. And it will develop -- it will destroy the country if it keeps going on like this. And I think we're really at this point where there -- you watch the news -- and I will add the news into the second most biggest problem that we have because there is no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 information . Everybody watches the same news and they think they're getting what they're getting and, you know, they're talking about, you know, their rights -- their civil rights and where we're going to -- and personalities of people. But the rule of law is gone. And since I've been living here, I lived here about 14 years. I came here after a nervous breakdown fighting in New York State to keep my child. A simple way to put it is -- and this community should know it very well that the family courts are trafficking children . They are the highest paid courts of any court system about between two-thirds and three-quarter s of the money goes to these family courts. And all the problem s that we're having now is the fatherless homes. The kids have nothing to do. And the lawyers -- like the lawyers here and the kids for cash thing, this is happening in every state. There was a point where I was -- there was one lawyer named Stuart Cole who lived in San Diego. And he was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 a good lawyer and Pro se. He was doing a thing to a class action suit. And I believe they murdered him. But, you know, I was getting all of my information from him. But I'm going through court and it's a process . They just keep you in the process billing hours and the judicial branch there's lawyers . And I have been doing it too. I mean, I've been fighting to stay where I live for a long time. I figured out who put the people in power who are my landlord s and that's the City of Scranton . They put the people on the board of commission ers. They've been there about 28 years. Three things came together around 1996 when they wrote the lease that they prosecute everybody in with the same judges, Judge Farrell , Judge Moyle. And they're not following the Rules of Civil Procedure . And they certainly don't listen to a Pro se litigant . I was evicted today despite the fact that, you know, I received on December 15th, you know, dismissal of all of my preliminary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 things. And I have to go to trial. So I forgot about, you know, Lackawanna County because it's really crooked . I mean, so I looked into Federal Court. I had applied for removal to Federal Court. The magistrate court ignored it. They are supposed to stop proceedings until the federal question is answered . And the same thing happened again. I've been awake most of the time the last couple weeks writing my federal paper. I did a Notice For Removal that I got in yesterday and the judge goes ahead with the trial anyway and decides she said she was going to evict me a long time ago. But so I need federal help. If there is anybody out there who knows a good federal lawyer who could help me because the federal law library everywhere is closed in Lackawanna County and everywhere and I'm going to be homeless . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Is there anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Hello, Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . If there is anybody out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 there in TV land that can scrape the bottom of their pockets and donate some money for Officer Gilmartin , please do. And every dollar would be probably appreciated . The only thing that I can think of that we need in that respect is when shots are fired, we need a tactical team to respond , not somebody in a police car. We probably really need to beef up tactical ability . And it's like I said when shots are fired, it's getting serious . Somebody is getting hurt or whatever and it's really unfortunate . And the man's injuries may be permanent . I mean, you don't get shot and happen to not lose anything or recover to perfect health. It just doesn't happen and so anything that you could do to help. And try to make sure that it's a legitimate -- because there's a lot of fraud out there, a lot of fraudulent sites and stuff. Like the FOP police union has a deal where you could send it there or whatever . And that would be the best place to send it. Two weeks ago I was here and I mentioned recycling . And there are buckets and tubs available . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 you should be -- it's incumbent upon Council to find out and announce it. It was -- we saw it online. And another thing we should encourage landlords seeing as they're now paying the bill in their taxes to try and get their tenants to start to recycle too. It does cut the cost of tipping although we pay a tipping fee at the recycling center. You know, it's a help. And if we can ever contact somebody in government -- higher government , larger stamping s on some of those bottles and stuff. You can't even see. You have to get your magnifying glass out. You feel like Pink Panther or something . And there's also a date. I think it's March 26th for offing televisions . So before they appear on a curb near you as in being somebody else's television , which has happened to me and I had to pay to get rid of it, not that I'm made of money but there was nothing else that could be done with it. We should find out about that and announce that. And in New Hampshire they are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 voting tonight . And once again our Democrat party took it on themselves not to even consider it worth making a showing there. They keep making some awful costly mistakes if you are dedicate d to the democrat side of things. You got to be pragmatic . I hear a lot of people I'm not going to vote again. I'm not standing in line or I'm not doing this or I'm not doing that. Well, guess what, do you really want to go to rallies and get beaten up or have somebody show up and start a fire or something and get blamed for it or blamed for the behavior , and then nothing is getting done anyway. You could go to all the protest rallies you want. I don't believe in -- if somebody comes and behaves badly, the person that was killed out in the west coast over the Gaza thing, I attended school with him. His name was Paul, his first name, you know, went to a really and started waiving the flag around and somebody probably punched him or something and he fell down and now he's gone. So thank you and have a good night. MR. MARGAVITCH : It's okay if I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 could pass something up quick? Good evening , Council , Mark Margavitch , Scranton . I just passed out photos. And, Mr. King, I gave you an e-mail I sent where I spelled your name wrong. So that's why I gave you that e-mail. So what I passed out were photos. And this was taken at a property of mine in West Side. And I requested this from the right to know request . The date this was, was February 24th of this past year. This was the photos I received . They were all similar to that. The reason why they were there is not important . But does anyone up there see my concern where these photos were not taken on February 24th, 2023? I do have a large photo I could show. MR. SCHUSTER : There's leaves on the trees. MR. MARGAVITCH : Yes, there's leaves on the tree. So I want to know if Council could go back and don't have them send me more picture s with leaves on the tree. I know it wasn't February 24th. I do believe code enforcement is suppose d to take photos when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 they do go out. And I would like those photos. I did have it confirmed from another code enforce ment official that was the procedure and that a right to know request is not needed from the property owner. So if we could delay all the time, I'd appreciate if someone could follow up and get me that answer or there will be five minute of silence next week. No, I'm kidding . MR. SCHUSTER : Your question was can you get the photos of your property , was your question , correct ? MR. MARGAVITCH : Yes, the photos. If they don't have them, they could just tell me they don't have them and then we could address that another day. MR. KING: So, Mark, let me understand . So they're saying that code enforcement goes out February 24th of 2023. MR. MARGAVITCH : Correct . MR. KING: And that they took photos. Is that a copy of the photo they said that they took? MR. MARGAVITCH : That was from the right to know request . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. KING: They provided that to you? MR. MARGAVITCH : Correct . Yeah. MR. KING: From February 24th? MR. MARGAVITCH : Correct . Now, I'm not -- MR. KING: -- forget last February but -- MR. MARGAVITCH : Now, I'm not saying the right-to-know officer that they didn't claim that that was correct . I'm not blaming it on the right-to-know officer . I'm just saying that if they do send you more photos, just don't send me picture s with leaves on there. And there is a reason. This is going to be -- I promise , this will be the easiest question I ask you guys. So if anyone could tell me if maybe I could get an answer this week. I did send an e-mail to the code enforcement official on the 5th. I did write something out but I can't find my glasses so I got to go from memory, the 5th, the 10th which I carboned -- cc'd Tom Oleski. And that was the one he responded 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 back to me. I wasn't interested in getting into the other details at this point. I didn't want to confuse too many issues. So I wanted to -- that is when everyone got the e-mail except for Mr. King but I did try. I didn't have my glasses on. You got the easiest name to spell and I spelled it wrong. MR. KING: I believe it's Wking@scrantonpa .com. MR. MARGAVITCH : I put "A" by accident instead of an "I." It was close. But anyway -- MR. KING: Frank, can we have Tom Oleski or someone from code enforcement look into the situation and try to get a better understanding of how that picture was provided for what I think was they were trying to indicate was a violation back in February of last year. There is no way that picture -- maybe they are saying it was the summer or something but -- MR. MARGAVITCH : They were all taken from basically the same, just up and down, so was the same day. But does anyone know if I have to do a right-to-know request or can I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 request those? MR. MCANDREW : We're requesting them right now. MR. KING: Yeah, we're going to request on your behalf. How does that picture indicate the issue also, like, are they saying that your tree is extending over into another person's property and it needs to be -- MR. MARGAVITCH : Well, there will be more to say about that. But it was part of the initial -- you can't really tell too much from that; but it was part of it. MR. SCHUSTER : And hearing this, Frank, the question I have and I think it's the same question from the speaker , can we find out if code enforcement is required to take a picture of the property or the issue on the property when they go out to a property for a violation ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe they are but I'll confirm . DR. ROTHCHILD : I thought that was standard . MR. KING: That's standard procedure . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. MARGAVITCH : It sounds standard but I just wanted to make sure. MR. SCHUSTER : And I guess with that, does the property owner need a right to know to get a copy of the photo of their property or do they have -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I don't believe so. I'll reach out to Mr. Oleski and his team in the morning , February 24th of '23. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MARGAVITCH : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Frank, you could have my copy, if you want. You got one? Oh, okay. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . First and foremost I would like to offer my continued prayers and prayers to work and I heard those gunshot s at 4:42 in the morning . And I could tell you prayers do work. I was one of the first -- we've had many throughout the city, throughout the region and throughout the country . We have a brave officer , honorable officer , strong. We saw that today. We all hope for his continued recuperation . And I hope he gets back in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 police force because you have to be really good at what you do to be part of that force that he was part of. You know, we're losing an officer right now. But I hope we get him back soon and several just like him. I want to offer continued prayers to the Scranton Police Department and everybody who protect s us on a daily basis. And I would also like to ask Council to keep your comment s until Fifth Order. Solicit or Gilbride , hi, Mike Mancini . You weren't here back in October of 24th of last year. The prior solicitor , Gallagher answered a few questions for me. I would like for you to please answer the same questions . Regarding the sale of the Scranton Parking Authority , the Scranton Sewer Authority , these are document s that I requested since October the 15th. As we all know there is several attorneys that have been question able over the years. And these document s are important , not only to me but also the taxpayer s and the citizens of the City of Scranton . Our former 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 corrupt Mayor sold our service for 300 -- actually good service 300,000. My fear is that there is rain tax in those documents . And in your opinion , municipality experience and I've talked to three other attorney s with over 50 years of experience , is there the possibility of a rider or a provision for a rain tax in those documents ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , can I answer? MR. SMURL: Yes. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. Mancini , as you stated I have not reviewed those document s. I was not involved in that case. I do not have an opinion in regard to that. Could there be a rider, just like any contract there could be riders. However , it requires the agreement of both parties to the agreement to have a rider. MR. MANCINI : Okay. Furthermore , I have another question . Since of my displeasure of the fact of not receiving these documents on a timely basis, I put in a right-to-know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 request about the right-to-know request . Okay, we're looking at $1,500 per violation with $500 a day. To my surprise , this administration does not have that list. It's called a striker list. All right. It should be looked at on a daily basis by our Business Administrator who receives the most amount of money out of any employee that works in this building . All right. She's not even from Scranton , not even from Lackawanna County. She's actually from Pittston . Okay, so not knowing the area and blatant disregard towards these right-to-know requests , there is no list. So my experience with the Home Rule Charter Act I could also request this same very information from the City Controller ; is that correct ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : You're asking me to answer a question with regard to how this administration -- MR. MANCINI : No, I'm asking based upon -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : Can I finish? Can I finish? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. MANCINI : If I could request this directly from the Controller . ATTY. GILBRIDE : You can request anything from any public official . What my issue is, I don't know that the Controller is going to have that information . MR. MANCINI : Okay. Well, let me ask you this question then. In regards to the sale of the Sewer Authority , former Solicitor Gallagher said that any elected official in the City of Scranton has the ability to look at these documents , the sale of the Sewer Authority and the Parking Authority . They are able to view them immediately ; is that correct ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : I never asked anybody that question , so I can't answer it. MR. MANCINI : Okay. The reason why I'm asking is because Business Administrator who is not even from Lackawanna County told me a week ago that they can't even find the documents . So it's a major concern of mine. So as this administration plays games and the Mayor decides to tick-tock. The silent majority tells you tick-tock. Good evening , Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 MR. SMURL: Is there anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: With respect to Snook Street, I did speak to Scott Pietreface today this afternoon . He's the head of the DPW. They were up there as Mr. Barrett indicated yesterday and they were up there today. That whole situation is going to be include d as part of the HRG Stormwater Project . That's going to take some time to ultimately move that forward . However , the most recent situation resulted -- came as a result of I think PA water had -- what was it, Jerr? MR. SMURL: They had multiple lines in the sewer drainage system which you're not allowed to put in. I guess someone -- they were a contractor doing water mains. And the runoff water was filling the hole. So they took it upon themselves to I guess to dump it into the sewer, which you're not allowed to. So I believe the Sewer Authority was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 there, saw multiple lines in there and pulled them all out because you can't put them in there. So who did them along the way, I'm not sure. But that is where all of that is coming from. MR. KING: What Mr. Pietreface indicated to me he was there today with the Tom Reilly the city engineer . They are working on possibly declaring an emergency . And I think maybe even bringing in an outside contractor to come up with some type of plan to ameliorate the situation until ultimately the, you know, stormwater program is able to happen. That's a little bit more long-term. But in the meantime , we can't continue the way this is existing for those residents . In fact, I think one of our solicitors for the city lives on that very street along with some elderly individual s who have to get to the hospital for dialysis and various other situations . So it's not -- interestingly enough, Marie Schumacher predict ed this was going to happen. And she was right as she usually is on most things. But he did tell me that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 have -- they are going to hopefully declare an emergency so they could get in there and come up with a plan. It sounds like they have a plan. MR. SMURL: Yeah, the city engineer was up there today. I believe they came up with a solution -- temporary solution to divert the water to catch it and divert it to a safe spot to divert it. You don't want to push it out into another street or something . So that we will know more about when the city offers it. MR. KING: Right. So I know it might not be the answer you wanted to hear but just know they're on top of it. They know how urgent it is and a plan is in the works to try to address that. In terms of the LERTA Program , the City of Scranton in conjunction with the Scranton School District and Lackawanna County, they passed a LERTA abatement on all residential , commercial and industrial properties located within the city. And the LERTA projects received a 10 year 100 percent tax abatement on owner improvements to properties within the confines 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 of the city. Tax exemption s apply to improvements to the land or building only. The land itself is subject to standard tax rates. The question is how long this program -- I can't say when it official ly began. And I can't say when -- if there's an end date to it. It sounds like it still exists. And, you know, I'm actually on the Scranton Plan, the Greater Scranton Chamber of Commerce website right now. And that's kind of what I read to you just to give you some information on that existing LERTA Program . But we'll try to get further answers for you on that. Other than that, I think that's all I have at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. I would like to start by echoing my statement s from last week. My family and I have been sending thoughts and prayers to Detective Gilmartin and his family as well as the Scranton Police Department family. I have been following up on updates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 and very happy to hear about the continuous improvement s that have been occurring. And the efforts and support from our city have been very overwhelm ing. And I'm very proud to be from Scranton when I see these things occurring for one of our own. With that being said and what we talked about with Snook Street, I'd like to thank the DPW workers for helping out with the snow removal and working out in the cold environment the last few days. I did speak to some of the workers that were up on Snook Street taking away some of that ice and what was described here as -- I mean, I really don't know what to say with that one. So a couple things I'm going to ask, Mr. Voldenberg , if he could help with. I would like to get an update on the Scranton Individual Disaster Recovery Grants from the 9/9 storm. Can we see from -- I don't know if Morgan's working on it. I know Morgan's involved . But I don't know if it would come from Miss Cipriani or Morgan Petsock {phonetic }. Can we get data on how many resident s applied 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 for the grant, how many grants have been issued, how many grants are still pending and also if there's a deadline or deadline information on this grant that we can report out to residents ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Also, in terms of this, can we get an update of the permits of any of these resident s in these affected areas, how many permits were applied for, how many were approve d, how many were denied, and if there's any permits that are pending for those homes that were affected ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Some of our past contracts , so also, can we get an update on contract with Press Record Communication in New York, LLC? Back in May the city contract ed with them to perform communication and marketing services for the city. This contract pays 25,000 a year annually for the next three years. I know they were doing some PR and press releases . If we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 could get a list of the actions they've taken and press releases they've worked on since this contract began? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank. Also, can we reach out about the Muflehun report, see when the city plans to have the report in our hands. I've been waiting for that since we approved that contract . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. The last one is, I've noticed for the past few weeks I've seen billboards for the Scranton Times. It appears -- their billboard s for our recycling program . It appears to be a way to update and educate resident s about the city's recycling program . Can we inquire to the administration how much the city is spending on the billboard s, which line items the funds are coming from and what metric the city is using to determine if this billboard campaign is effective for city recycling program ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And if it's a donation from the Scranton Times, I thank them for their assistance . That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, can I just chime in? I think I do have an answer to one of Mr. Schuster 's questions . We receive d a memo from the Mayor this afternoon . It says the city's ARPA team and its consultant s are continuing to review individual disaster recovery application s, supporting documents . To date, as of January 22nd, 14 residents have received checks, an additional 10 resident s have been approve d and receipt of their checks is pending largely upon their completion of grant application s and other final documents with the Scranton Area Community Foundation . In total as you will see in January , 2024 ARPA report, more than $117,000 has been or is ready to be issued to residents from the more than $542,000 allocated for individual disaster recovery . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 answers some of it. MR. KING: It says there's 105 applicant s it looks like. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, 105. MR. SMURL: Tom, you should have that e-mail. I'm pretty sure it went out to all of us. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. It came out today though, right? MR. SMURL: I belive it came out this afternoon . MR. SCHUSTER : That's why I don't have that information . Also, last week I had asked about the Housing Authority had some funds that we were looking to issue towards similar grants for affected resident s. And my question why was would we choose to go through the Scranton Area Foundation . Did we ever get an answer to that question ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did receive an answer. I'll send it out to you. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Was that one also come in that e-mail today? MR. VOLDENBERG : No. That was last week, the end of last week.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. SCHUSTER : All right. I'll take a look. Thank you. That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have just a couple of quick comment s. The first one being on the question I received about the public health coordinator . I was also wondering if someone was hired or if there were interview s going on for that position . So I asked Mr. Voldenberg to contact the administration about that. And so far the only response I received was that, yes, the city is looking to continue working with an onsite public health coordinator . So I believe -- I think there was, like, a year remaining of that funding that went unused because Dr. Saxena had left the city. So it's my understanding that if someone was hired that there would be a year of funding for their salary still remaining . And the other item that I had found some additional information on we were talking some more about the LERTA Program and I had looked back in my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 my e-mail. So Council had received a memo back on December 12th of 2022 from Miss Eileen Cipriani . And there were some questions regarding LERTA that we had at that time that were answered , like, if there is a way to judge the success of the LERTA Program . And she had said at the time the initial order did not establish metrics for evaluation . However , OECD has tracked LERTA application s and the outcome . The city has seen an increase in commercial project s but is difficult to establish the role LERTA has played in the project versus other incentive s in place either through the city or state. And then we had asked how many had applied to the LERTA Program . She had some information between the years of 2018 and 2021 that there were 32 applications , 15 approved , 3 pending , 3 denied. And then in 2022 there were 23 applications with 3 approved , 16 pending , 3 denied, 1 withdrawn . And so that had shown an increase in applications I believe over that time. But it would be nice to have figures for 2023 for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 those applications . So if we could include that in our questions regarding LERTA. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. That's all that I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. So a few weeks back I posed a question that was present ed to me by a concerned resident . And the question was have any condemned properties in the city have been rescinded back to the owner without following the normal appeal process . So the first response I got was we needed more information . So I said I thought the question was simple and just wanted an answer. So then I received an update. So one example given was the property located on 515 Breck Street. It was rescinded back to the owner after condemnation with no appeal required . We were unable to locate the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 documentation to support that a property condemnation was rescinded without going through the appeal process . Code enforcement conduct ed a records review and identified a property , again, located at 515 Breck that had been condemn ed and is no longer condemn ed as of this Friday. As code enforcement located a release from condemnation letter in its files, which indicates the owner satisfied the issue. So I just wanted to report that out. So it's a little confusing. They had it. Then they didn't have it. But I don't think it's a normal process . The houses are rescinded -- the condemnation is rescinded and given back to the owner without an appeal. But that is the answer we got. We'll have to see. Secondly , so Mr. Mancini has been up here a couple weeks asking about the Sewer Authority sale and the Parking Authority sale. He's hit a couple roadblocks being told these -- the documentation doesn't exist. So and he posed a question to our solicitor . So I'm just going to pose a question 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 myself. So, I mean, either these documentation exist -- it should. They are the two biggest assets the city sold or two of the biggest or two of the biggest . There should be documentation somewhere . And I'm going to request for Council , for all of us to supply us with this -- any and all documentation related to the two sales -- them two sales, all right? Let them tell us they don't exist. That'll be crazy. All right. So and next, so we've had a lot of emergencies weather related , you know, the horrible flooding . So to hear that there is no dispatcher for emergencies on the weekend , I find it -- I'm sorry to hear that it doesn't exist. So Public Works is -- they work for the public and should be able to respond to emergencies . So what is the process when an emergency occurs over the weekend ? Who do you call or who is suppose d to cover that? All right. Hearing that there is no one to reach out to is concerning to me. So could you please contact the head 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 of DPW and ask them to provide us with whatever their emergency plan is on weekends ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Who makes the call and who can the resident s reach out to that, you know, they work for them. MR. SCHUSTER : Something -- can I also say something here? MR. MCANDREW : Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : When it comes to situation s like this too when it comes to that dispatch , it's one thing if it's a regular week in the summer where we're not having any weather events. I think it's another thing when there's a snowstorm coming and we know it's coming. I thing -- maybe, I mean, that's something to think of if we could add that to the question , what do we do during a weather event when it comes to dispatch er for DPW. Thank you. Sorry to jump in. MR. MCANDREW : No problem . So also, I mean, I got a lot calls about the water company bills, you know. There's an upcoming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 public hearing on their ridiculous increases that they want us to pay. But they are charging a late fee for a late bill. And the bill was late because of them, not because of the resident not paying it late. And they have the audacity to charge a late fee instead of an apology . I would expect an apology instead of a late fee. But, you know, people make mistakes. But Jesus, you know, this is -- this is beyond belief, especially with the upcoming hearing . I just wanted to share my concern on that. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Attorney Gilbride , will you update the public on our progress on the tax relief for the flood victims ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yes, Mr. President . I was invited to attend and did attend last Friday a meeting of representative s of all the taxing bodies. All three were present , and it was determined that there is current ly state law that provides for the taxing bodies to offer relief to individuals who were unfortunately found in circumstances like the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 individuals in Scranton in September . That is currently being worked through by all of the governing bodies. The citizens who were affected will be notified and informed of how to start the process . The city will, of course, assist them in moving that process forward . I do not anticipate at this point any additional legislation will come before City Council at least during the first part of this process . However , after that's done based upon what happens , there may be some additional legislation that will come before you for approval . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Attorney Gilbride . A few things that Council is still working on is the traffic -- the truck traffic on Railroad Avenue. We haven't given up on it. We're still pursuing a request to the Scranton Police Department for citation s and if there is still something we could do to stop those heavy trucks from going across. It is marked for over 10 ton trucks. So we're still awaiting a response . The second one is 819 Pittston Avenue. I spoke about this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 for a few months now. And presently there was a large -- big large commercial dump truck across the sidewalks . And, of course, the sidewalks are destroyed now. But I was told that they were given a curb cut. And it turns out they were not given a curb cut to have a driveway there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would advise SPD that they were not given a curb cut by the city or the state. It's a state road. So they would have to get it by the state. So they are illegal ly crossing the sidewalk that they destroyed already , if you would update them on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Right Center, we contact ed code enforcement to issue warnings to the owners about clearing their sidewalks during snow events. And 3200 block of Pittston Avenue, excessive speeding there. So we're looking for the police department for enforcement and also for advice on an electric speed sign to be put up on that block. I don't know if we have one. I saw 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 it up on Harrison Avenue. But I don't know if it's a permanent or a temporary thing. That's all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
