KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two. So this Monday, February 20th from 1 to 8 p.m., the Fortis Institute would like you to know that Scranton for our annual Give Kids a Smile Event. It's a free dental exam, cleaning , x-rays, fluoride , sealant s. It is for ages -- children ages of 3 to 17. A legal parent or guardian must be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 present with their child. And each child will be given a bag of dental supplies to take home. So that's a pretty cool thing. And then next, St. Lucy's will be having their Pre-Lenten Mardi Gras Bake Sale. The Women of St. Lucy's Altar and Rosary Society will celebrate Mardi Gras by holding a bake sale on Saturday , February 18th before and after the 4 p.m. mass and Sunday, February 19 before and after the 9 a.m. mass. The bake sale will have homemade Italian baked goods as well as other tasty and sweet treats of breads, cakes, cookies and pastries . So if you could make it, that sounds like a cool thing too. And then also, I would like to wish everybody out there, all the sweethearts out there a Happy Valentine 's Day. And hang in there, boys, St. Patrick 's Day is right around the corner. And that is all I have. MR. KING: I'd just like to thank the Recreation Authority . They had a food drive this past weekend . Unfortunately I could not be there. I was out of town. I got home late on Sunday. From what I understand it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 an incredible turnout. They had so much food, Norma Jeffries couldn't find any boxes to get them the food distributed . So it was a wonderful turnout. And I thank the Rec Authority and all the volunteer s that helped assist with that. And just to remind everyone that St. Patrick's Day Parade is coming up on Saturday , March 11. The parade kicks off at 11:30 a.m. So we're looking forward to that. Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: First speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . And how is our 2021 audit this fine evening ? MR. KING: We're getting there from what I understand . I met with the Mayor yesterday . I think we're probably a few weeks away from that being finalized . MS. HODOWANITZ : And is the Mayor considering a 10 percent penalty for the late audit? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. KING: I did ask her about that. And she took note and said that she was going to look into that further . MS. HODOWANITZ : If she decides not to, I'd like to know her reasoning why not. Now, just so you know, Kohanski did four audits starting in 2018. That audit was late. It came on December 26th; 2019 audit, February 21st and the 2020 audit February 25th. So there's a pattern of lateness . And are we still waiting on GASB-75? MR. KING: I believe that's the last piece. MS. HODOWANITZ : And who is responsible for that piece? MR. KING: I'm not exactly sure. I believe it's someone in the administration . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And this is all with the help of Rainey and Rainey, of course, because they're still up in the BA's Office. What about the arbitration on the police and fire unions? MR. KING: My understanding I believe the fire had another arbitration hearing yesterday . That's progressing . The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Mayor is hopeful that both of those will get resolved this spring. I don't know exactly when, but I believe it's binding arbitration so -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And I was looking at the website , making progress inch by inch. But it's been five months since the DPW contract was approved and we still don't have that (inaudible ) that's still being tossed back and forth to dot the I's and cross the T's? MR. KING: That's what I'm to understand . But I will try to get an update from the Mayor. MS. HODOWANITZ : Five months is a long time for them to be crossing T's and dotting I's. And in Third Order we have an update on payroll preparation tax returns , which isn't very favorable because it looks like for 2022 there's a 66 percent return rate which means we're down about $614,000. So if that rate continues for this year we'll be down another $800,000. Has anybody analyzed what the problem is and what we're going to do about it? That's an unacceptable return rate, 66 percent . I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 it's a new tax. But it's been a year now. So they have until the end of February to get the 2022 payments in. And I'm not real hopeful . I think that needs some attention and some questions should be asked. And I was very pleased to see that Mr. Basalyga is providing space free of charge for the Civil War Museum which used to be in the basement of this building . I don't know if anybody on the dais if any of you ever visited that museum. It's quite amazing . It's a piece of local history . And it's something we should preserve for future generations . So thank you, Mr. Basalyga . I saw in the legals today I was surprised to see a bid for fitness equipment for DPW. What is that all about? I mean, I could see maybe the city needs fitness equipment for police and fire, but DPW for, what, maybe picking up trash cans or something ? I mean, what's that all about? MR. KING: We discussed it during the caucus. None of us seem to know what the story is with that. So we asked Mr. Voldenberg 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 if he could look into -- MS. HODOWANITZ : All right. And that -- just my personal opinion , but I think the police and fire should have equal opportunity on that equipment and the clerical union too. And finally some good news. I see Commonwealth Court is going to try to get some tax dollars out of not for profit hospitals . Go Commonwealth Court. If they appeal it I hope they lose their appeal. And this could be windfall for this city. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , city resident . And I wanted to start off tonight by I'd like to give thank yous where appropriate . And when I was reading the paper Monday -- and Joan already hit on it with the Civil War Museum downstairs . And there was a lot of discussion on that. I don't know if everyone remembers that that they wanted to just dump them out and they wanted to use that space down there for storage and things. So, you know, when you get the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 paper and you sit down at your table and you have your coffee and you open the paper and you see some good stuff on it like that the Civil War museum was salvaged . It's going to be in a very visible location down at the Marketplace . So that was a good thing. So I too thank Mr. Basalyga for stepping up and to helping out that situation . The other thing I wanted to ask about that I don't understand is that there was a grant that's going to be written for the signs on trails in the Lackawanna County I guess it is. And is it just a grant that's going to be written ? And I was wondering how the grant was going for the street signs that for the city and I know that I was told that there's a grant that's going to be written or it has been written so that more street signs can be put up in the City of Scranton . I could not find any update on that grant. So if someone could also update me on that. And also -- not only -- and when I say that, I say update me, it's not just me. It's the citizens of Scranton that we're all looking for better street signs and directions as we go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 about. I was also glad to see that there is some work going forward on the walkability study. And it seems that there's antenna s, I guess, that are up in the city that are starting to, I guess, count the number of traffic or the foot traffic that is going. So I did read that that's moving forward . So that's a good thing. So that's two things that I've sat here at City Council and listened to and that was the Civil War Museum, which is moved now. And that was a success and then also the walkability study is moving forward . So that is also a success . Also a success was this weekend with the food drive and, you know, Bill King already mentioned that. But I could do -- if I was a dancing person, I could do a happy dance right here on the floor as to how successful that food drive was. And with today's economy with things being so expensive at the store, the citizens of Scranton /Lackawanna County and there were people there from Taylor that came to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 deliver -- and I'm sure other places as well. So I'm just so thankful to the people of Lackawanna County and for Scranton to come forward like they did. The tables that we had -- one table was this side, it was filled completely . We divided into five different organizations . And one of the tables were just packed with food for them. And they were just so appreciative when they came today to pick the food up. And they just wanted to thank the citizens and they said if I could thank each one of the people that gave food today and to help us out. And, you know, that just gives you a feeling that you're doing the right thing when you just take a can of soup, a jar of peanut butter, that's going to help the next person because there's so much we could take for granted as we go into our kitchen s. And we have that choice to make as we stand and make our breakfast . Everybody doesn't have that choice. And to be able to help with that, you know, is just such a great feeling . So I thank all the Council members , you know, they all were there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 and my fellow teammates here from the -- that come to the Council meetings . You know it was just so good to see people and to be able to say hi, hi, you know, and know who they were and put faces with names. So thank you again to the citizens of Scranton and thank you again for anyone that helped. I also want to give a shoutout to Gerrity 's Market. I don't know if it's doable or on, you know, but Gerrity 's Market on Meadow Avenue was just absolutely fantastic with me. And each time I called -- I needed a boxes. I needed boxes. I needed boxes. But I had no idea how many boxes I needed until last night I put a blast out on Facebook we need boxes. We're running out of boxes. That's how much food we got that we're running out boxes to pack food up. So, you know, again, just thank you to everybody . MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Beverly DeBarros . MS. DEBARROS : Hi Council , Bev DeBarros , Quincy Avenue in Scranton . I'm here to talk about voter suppression in our city which has been going on for years and years at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 the county jail. I know the jail. We're on the same street, Washington Avenue is run by the county. But still it's in our city. I feel responsible as a citizen that year after year after year we've appealed to the board of -- the prison board. Nothing is done. I've reached out to the League of Women Voters. It's -- this should not happen. There are 800-some inmates in there. Most of them have the right to vote. Here's the pamphlet that tells who can and cannot vote. Most of them are eligible . However , they need to get their ballot -- their mail-in ballot. And that doesn't happen in there. Some of them need to have -- make an application for -- well, all of them would need to make an application for mail-in ballot. Everything is complicated . This is -- are the directions . This is the actual form. But then it has to be sent in. It has to be -- put a stamp on it. They can't have stamps in there. We can't give inmates a stamp, can't even get in there right now with being a volunteer . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And then some people aren't even register ed to vote but they're eligible to vote. And they don't register to vote in Scranton . They vote and register to vote in their official mailing address whatever city that they come from, their home address . So all this is complicated paperwork back and forth. It can be done. But it has to be done, you know, methodi cally, organized . They need help. Since the prison itself with all of those counsellors they have and workers they have in there have not taken this on, I'm hoping that maybe a justice group from the University of Scranton or Marywood College , anybody that has a conscience and ability , please come forward and try to rectify this. I mean, you all know the value of a vote and, in fact, this is another election coming up in May. And in addition to receiving the paperwork to apply for their ballot and mail in their ballot, they need to be informed citizens . They need to -- again for years I've been saying we need newspapers in that jail so the people know what's going on, you know, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 issues, the people. And right now the only thing they could have is their notebooks , no magazines like we had previously . They have tablets and with the phone company GTL that provides these tablets , makes a huge profit. Tomorrow there is a prison board -- afternoon , and some other people speakers will be speaking about that the outrageous profits that are made on tablets and other things that happen in the jail. However , there are people who can't afford their extra fee. They get a free hour on a tablet and that's to do other correspondence . And it doesn't last long. And even if there was a newspaper provided on there, it would take more than half that time to educated -- to read the newspaper in an educated way. So there's a lot going on here with this and just ask you to be aware, concern , if you have any influence , any contact , anybody else outside of this room that knows somebody , this -- what kind of citizens are we if we are denying this from our fellow citizens . Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. KING: Thank you, Miss DeBarros . Derek Raines. MR. RAINES: Okay. I see the clock. So somebody 's going to have to work on the time. Derek Raines, 919 Monroe Avenue, Scranton , Pennsylvania . I'm going to preface my conversation -- my wife said make sure I'm not yelling . So if I'm yelling , I don't mean to be. All the people that are here -- is Mr. Coyne here today? Mr. Coyne, you're a great man. I love listening to you. I can't -- all the people that are here, you folks come time and time again and you say all these problems , what about Nay Aug, what about this, what about that, and you guys ask these same question s and you get the same answers every day. And the same answers are, oh, I'm sorry. I don't know. I'll get back with you on that. And it's just so disheartening to hear as a taxpayer to pay my $6,000 a year for my property taxes. I love this city. But I just don't think the people of this city are getting what they're paying for. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 And all of you folks, Mr. King, I'll start with you. I watch you guys every -- I can't see. Mr. King, where are you? I mean, to listen to you talk and all of you guys talk, Mr. McAndrew , Dr. Jessica . I mean, I love watching you guys on TV and listening to you because I'm now legally blind. I can't see very well and listening to you folks and the questions , they're just wonderful . And all the people that are here, I'm just so happy to have these citizens who come here and I wish we could get more people to come here. Okay, I am a certified safety and health specialist . I probably wouldn't pass my test now, you know that. Your building just coming in, first off, the Department of Justice does oversee the American s with Disability Act. The parking spot that they have put in does not meet the American with Disability Act. It has one sign. And it's a 15-minute parking spot which is illegal . It's time as needed. You go to your bathrooms , you have the sliding door locks that you put in, you know, an old room you don't want anybody to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 touch or anything . Those have been against the law for public access places for decades . And I complained about that -- it's got to be 15 -- I'm going to go 10 years ago at least. They're against the law. You have people that work here. Department of Public Works, these people have to see this stuff every day. Are any of the employees actually certified in safety and health? I am. Dr. Jessica , I know you know a lot about what stuff should be done. But do the people who work in Public Works, are they taught safety and health what they're suppose d to do, how entrance and exits are suppose d to be made. And it just disheartens me, especially now that I'm really a disabled person. This building is not handicap accessible . And I don't know how I could contact somebody in the Department of Justice to help me file a lawsuit against the City of Scranton . I don't know. And I think Mr. King -- whichever way he is, Mr. King seems like the person who I could ask any question to and he would probably send me back an answer.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 And what was my other thing? Oh, the street about our problem with the street not being taken care of. My van, the water just flows everywhere and it goes into all down my yard. It's definitely a bacteria breeding place. When my granddaughter -- when she comes to our house, when she walks on our property , when she comes in the house she has to take off her shoes because you do not want a kid coming into your house after being on the 900 block of Monroe where all that sewage and sludge sits. You don't want this stuff coming into your house. I mean, it is for no better term cooties . I know there's a much more technical term for it. But this city has got to do something with my street. I have curb on the thing. They don't have an American with Disability . They don't have the thing on either corner for a blind person to know -- hey, oh, how about that pothole that's been there for how many years that DPW still has not fixed? I mean, I could get a couple neighbors and a bag of concrete and fix it. And the City of Scranton has done zero to take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 care of these problems . I am, as I said, I'm a 27-year veteran , civil service ; and I expect this city to be able to do simple things such as this because they're not really that complicated problems . My time's up. The misses told me. But she put her name and she's going to talk to you about the true health consequences of the sludge. Thank you so much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Raines. We'll look into those concerns you expressed to us. MS. RAINES: Hi. My name is Jill Raines. I'm Derek's wife. I also live at 919 Monroe. My big issue is, we paid twice this year to have this dirt removed from the front of my house in my driveway . And then unfortunately , we had DPW had to dig up and they had to pump all this water out of this hole that was filled with mud. And they completely filled it with mud again. Derek has to get on a van. The county van picks him up and takes him to his doctor appointment s, to physical therapy . And it's all ice and it just lays there. Getting in the house every time we drive through it, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 see cars that parked in my driveway . They drive through it. It comes up on the sidewalk whoever is walking on the sidewalk is walking through this mud. And I just redid all my landscaping last year and it's all now down in the back of my yard because it just comes down and it just is like a waterfall right down the middle of my yard when it rains because it comes right down Ash Street. Myrtle Street goes right across. It doesn't go any further than my house. It just goes out into my backyard . So like Derek had mention ed, we have a granddaughter now. And then my daughter is trying to get her out of the car. You can't even get out of your car because you have to jump over this mud. You can't get to the sidewalk without jumping over all of this mud. And I know people come up and talk to us about it and they say that it's because the center of the road was never graded. They keep paving over it and not grading the center of the road. So it just basically keeps getting steeper and steeper . And then every time they paved the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 road it's nice the road's paved. The potholes aren't there but my gully gets deeper when they do that. So they really have to grade the road before they pave it. I know Derek put in for a grant for some of that money that's floating around to get roads repaired . I don't think anybody 's even read it yet according to what he did. I'm only going to talk for a few more minutes , but anyway it's just something that I know we keep talking about. But in the summer it's especially a health issue because the odor that comes from this dirt that's there and the mosquito s and it's just -- like I said, you're driving your car through it and then you're walking through it on the sidewalks and you're bringing it into your house. MR. RAINES: And I have to drive through it. MS. RAINES: And he has to drive his chair through it because a lot of times he'll go down to Zummo's for lunch and he's got to go out on the road to drive because he can't ride his chair on the sidewalk . So then he has to drive through it and then drive down the street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 and back through it. So when it's muddy, it just gets all in his tires and then it comes in the house. MR. KING: I'm going to contact DPW and see if maybe I could stop over there with someone from DPW and take a look at it myself and see what can be done to try to get that issue resolved for you. MS. RAINES: Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. RAINES: Thank you so much. Thank you for listening . It really makes people feel good if you actually listen and comment . I mean, that's nice. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Raines. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Good evening , Council . First again, I'd like to thank Mr. McAndrew and Mr. Schuster for appearing at the zoning board meeting in relation to the solar installation . It's unfortunate for them that they failed to understand how clear cutting would be viewed and a lack of a runoff plan controls for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 that mountain would be observed . It was complicated by the lie of 23 temporary jobs and 70 permanent jobs. When pressed , all the jobs would most likely be remote monitoring by the internet. Lawyers and maybe if someone found the solar installation particularly interesting , it might spawn a job at a coffee shop, big money for the City of Scranton . They may have succeeded if they tried a smaller footprint to start. Consider on water issues and we're not trying to push the idea that power generation would go to local PP&L substation misdirecting the intent as opal power supply here and not just the entire grid. Their misrepresentation failed on all accounts . On current issues, I present ed you with info -- a lot of info over the last week, some on electric cars, some on the use of Recovery Act funds and the ruins of the use of parks. I understand it's a lot of information . And I leave that all to you to review. I would hope that when there's a caucus on Recovery Act funds that citizens will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 get to address questions this time as it is a decision -making forum. I believe that just submitting questions and asking by proxy isn't sufficient because when that has happened in the past the administration has dodged the question multiple times. And then after three or four times of dodging direct questions , they get a pass on it and then things get moved on rather than being held to the fire. If someone can confirm the zoning process , I believe the last time it was introduced in a comment period and then it was tabled as it was required for a month for any written comments . Is this going to be the same procedure ? I assume that the delay is due to the MCP requiring county and contiguous municipalities having a comment period after it's put forward . I'd like to verify if that is actually going to happen. I'm concerned based on Mr. King's statement the City Planning Commission about Geisinger writing the city directly for specific changes which was quoted at one hour and five minutes into the Planning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Commission meeting . I have a right to know currently out for those documents , but they are delayed by 30 days. I will most likely receive the information around 3 p.m. on the day before it will be scheduled for the final vote. The city plans on presenting -- to present me with a right to know response on March 13th. Last, per the state requirement , the Planning Commission lacks one requirement and skips a giant benefit. Municipal Planning Code 301A, section four require s a transportation plan. I haven't seen in the rezoning ordinance an actual transportation plan baked into it. Last, the SALDO provision allows an additional -- an addition of mandated public dedication . This requires developers to dedicate land or pay a fee to a municipality for parks and recreation facilities . This is referred to a fee in lieu of land dedication . Public dedication is essentially an impact fee, a fee imposed on government on a new development to help pay for services that the new development would convey of the government. Development creates an increase 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 demand for municipal services requiring developers to provide amenities or funding for expanded enhanced public amenities is an equitable way to offset some of the impacts for this new development . I do not understand why at this time in looking in both pilot and park aid we are not looking at an available process to fund parks that is currently out there for us with this change in the zoning. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening and Happy New Year -- no, Happy Valentine 's Day. I'm a little tardy with this but not too far. I just want to bring it back and say I did get mine on the 26th of January . So I was very happy when you decided to put some out by the door so I could have one until I waited for the postal service or whoever mailed these out. Now, we've talked about the nontaxable properties . And I just think it's worthwhile to let you know who does pay. First of all, it is about -- if you go take the ratio, it's about one-tenth of one percent of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the -- of the nontaxables pay anything . And the people -- I won't read how much it was. But there's Lutherwood, Goodwill at North Gerald T. Langan apartments , New Life Baptist Church, Polish National Catholic Church, Scranton Housing Authority , University of Scranton , Harrison House Personal Care Home and Covenant Presbyterian Church. Those are the people who have. So there's an awful lot left for you people to go out and get those pockets turned out and the administration certainly . It's sort of ridiculous that we get so little. Now, I think also that you people need to be more aggressive on seeing the things that you pass happen as you intended . Now for instance -- and not all of you were here I know. But does everybody on -- up there think that the LERTA program was good and did the job that was expected ? Okay. Okay, for instance , we've got a new big project coming up in two years and that is the Meadow Brook Stormwater Program . It's schedule d to start in 2025. Now, I think as of today you recall there were 48 rights of way 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 that had to be obtained before the thing can go forward . Now two years may seem like a long time. But I remind you that 2015 I believe it was we sold the Sewer Authority and we still have the sewer building and project . But now we still have a Sewer Authority . And why, because we're still going after the rights of way that had to be -- did everybody there ever go into a meeting and ask them when they think they'll be able to wrap that up? I might suggest it. Oh, and then on the demolitions , I did get the -- as I mentioned last week, I did get the materials from Frank. And I did get to go through them. And I have now sent for a right to know to get the information that I need to provide what -- when -- how many there are on the list and when they're going to happen. And I guess that's it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . Okay. I've been on this for a while and it was just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 mentioned , tax exempts . I'm not criticizing anybody . And I have pointed out in the past that any donation s are strictly voluntary and it's a matter of the institution feels well enough to donate or whatever . But we're now at last count, we're at 38 percent . I'm pretty sure we're well-approaching 40 percent . I don't know if that recent demolitions up near Geisinger , taxes are due immediately or is because the land isn't in use yet but get ready. And then on Spruce and Wyoming , a building was just sold for 1.6 million and once again, I don't want to criticize anybody , they're tax exempt. But I would love to see a whole group of tax exempts go with us to the state to appeal a replacement of at least some of that tax money, half of it, whatever . But it's already getting to the point where it's putting a hefty pinch on people that may or may not be able to afford it. And it's an awful shame when the landlord buys a house like next door to me for a couple thousand dollars , puts a couple thousand dollars more into it and the rent on that house 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 even though it's pretty shabby on the outside is $1,200 a month. That's a lot of money. That's $14,000 a year, whatever . That's quite a bit of money. He made his money back the first year and he's been operating for five or six years. So now we really need to start looking at this situation . And we have more apartments going in downtown. And I contend that anybody that has put in apartments , if possible , or is current ly constructing apartments should have to at least put in that apartment parking space, at least one parking space maybe two at the parking authority in the garage because Friday night I go down to Buona Pizza. I'm around the block three times until something finally opens up all while my $22 specialty pizza gets cold, you know, so -- and they've been around since 1966. And I presume their place would have been taken off of them if they hadn't paid taxes and everything else to the city. And once again, we're on the PUC. And it's just one after another editorial in the paper about their unfair price hikes. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 when they consider cost living, the reason it's not working out for working class retirees is that these people are raising their rates and, you know, I just bought a topnotch performance CD -- musical CD for six months. They used to be 18 and 20. So all of that gets figured in against inflation . Our gas goes down like it did in 2009, we had 10 percent of our workforce laid off. So you know gas prices declined . Energy prices declined and the elderly got no raise, retirees . And just quick, renewed lawsuit against the county for using slave labor to sort stuff out down at the Recycling Center. I'll handle that a little more next week. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to be heard? MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . I was expecting Mr. Bulzoni to come to address my character assassination of him. But I guess silence is his answer. I don't know. These people seem to think that no one is listening to my addresses here and then I'll go away. I've had six, eight people this week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 mention it to me. So there's got to be a lot of people that watch this program and whether they like it or not have comments . One of them was, have I lost my mind. I don't think so. My neighbor next door told Mr. Ware years ago I had -- he threw her out of the office when she was finished talking . That's the one that was here years ago that said I fell through my garage roof. I've been on the streets you could say my whole life really. I know the heart of this city and the people. And Council seems to be in a different plane. You're business oriented , financial ly oriented . The people I talk to are family oriented and interested in their homes and their neighborhoods . There doesn't seem to be any response from the city except for developer s. You people are developer inclined . Mr. Bulzoni made a statement several years ago that we should give the developers more grants, loan forgiveness , tax abatements . These people have lawyers and financial assistants do their utmost to -- taxwise not to pay one penny more than they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 have to. You know, the result of that is poor neighborhoods because once they -- people were talking about higher salaries would bring better people in. I have no argument against that. How can you defend Mr. Oleski, Mr. Sunday? Tell me. Nothing is being done about them. He waived tax -- that's money that his office needs. He has no authority whatsoever , not one of you lifted a finger to see what's going on in the -- in that office. I think that maybe Mr. Powell should do something and investigate it. Who knows. I'm not trying to embarrass Council , alienate it because I know I need Council . But Council -- Council is just a step away from the knowledge of what's going on around here in our streets . You just -- you just don't talk to the right people. You're in a different plane. Your friends and acquaintances and business partners are in a different plane than the voters. You're just fortunate there is so much voter apathy and ignorance of elections . Real quick, a lady at the Taurus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 club told me -- this is about her own son. He voted for the first time. So when it was over with she's asking him -- he voted for a straight democratic ticket because his girlfriend told him they're for drugs and abortion . That's the only thing he came away with for the last election . And these are people that are going to be sitting in your seats some day. They have no knowledge . They don't have any interest in our community for some reason. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. SHAW: Good evening , Council , Darwin Shaw, Scranton resident . Let me say Happy Valentine 's Day. We're going to (inaudible ) let's talk about the Sewer Authority . Now, do you guys know if we're in compliance with the M4 permit? Does anybody know what the M4 permit is? Yous do honestly because I watch the message -- I watched all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 the YouTubes from three years ago until now honestly . And what everybody is talking about is right. I haven't been around because my lung collapsed . And I passed away honestly and Geisinger helped me through a lot. And I'm here today. But while I was recuperating nothing got fixed in this city. And I ran for Mayor. And I feel -- I feel vexed honestly because everybody starting talking about resumes , everybody started talking about experience . And I was born and raised in Scranton and nothing got changed from when I was a child to now. Certain county bridges still look the same way. The M4 permit needs to be complied with within two years. And in two years our Mayor is gone. If the M4 permit is not complied with meaning that we do not have enough green infrastructure to minimize the nitrogen which the county already took care of. And it's the city's part now to collaborate let's say what, 21 other municipalities that fall under are the M4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 permit now which is new. This is the first time anybody needs to do it. Now I'll say 2025, DEP is going to come back here to see if we are in compliance with the order. And if we're not, they extended let's say, I would say due to Covid they probably extended the permit. But did they did not extend the completion date which is in 2025 when we're not going to have a mayor. And every time election year comes up, not you guys, I'm sorry. I love you guys. I do. But this is business . I live here. I'm a citizen here. I went through a lot and it took Scranton to get me through what I've been through and to see us squander funds that have been coming from the federal government and even they can't even cooperate and us locally we're not supporting our citizens even our children and there is multiple amounts of homeless people up here. I go to the soup kitchen every day for the past two months. And I've been feeding them. And I feel heartbroken because individual s I know live on street and they cannot get no help at all. There is no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 financial stability at all within this city's structure , individual s in their home struggling to feed their families . I'm an individual that is struggling to feed their family. This is beyond politics now. This is a way of life. And we're all Scranton ians are we not? And we all live here, all of us. So why is it that five individuals have to argue with an individual that has to send (inaudible ) and can't sit down and talk about why our first responders are going into arbitration , why you can't agree on giving them the proper funds that they need to protect the city, respond to individual s in a timely manner and even fix our utilities . It's not happening . It's not okay to step in front of a camera but you step away from citizen s when they address physical and real life problems to you. I struggle every day. But I'm not going to give up. Yeah, I died, but I'm still going to be here to run. But I want to cooperate with everybody . I'm a kid. I'm a kid. I don't know what I'm doing. But I shouldn 't even be doing what I'm doing. But I'm not going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 watch my daughter and even elderlies and individual s that help me get where I'm going struggle anymore. For what? For what, a political game, a smile, a check? It's not cool no more. It's not okay. It is unacceptable from adults. I'm a child. Please, can we do something ? Whatever I have to do I'll help. But they're going to come back. The federal government, everybody that applies for these grants -- we don't even have the individual s in place to compete to apply for federal grants to get the grants done on time. We don't. Our City Controll er makes less than me as a graphic . I could make 85,000 if I move to Miami. You really think I need to be up there doing -- I don't. But I don't. You got -- it's going to be horrible . It's going to be horrible . And I don't want to leave here. Call it pettiness , call it loyalty . I don't care if (inaudible ) and I don't want individuals that I call my family and my friends due to individuals wanting political gain. I don't care about politics . But I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 care about this city being back on the track that it was when I watched it change from drugs, corruption to murders . There's a massive amount of fentanyl and methamphetamines out here, maximum amount. And last time I was here I asked you guys not to pass a law or help the Mayor legalize that situation due the federal government and local government . Federal and local government does not supersede (inaudible ). Honestly at that, if you don't mind answering me this question because I did write a speech and I'm not going to do that. It's all right. What ordinances -- MR. KING: Mr. Shaw, I'm sorry, your time is up. MR. SHAW: All right. You're right. You're right, because I did. I got -- we need to change that five minute rule but I do understand why because people can ramble. I'll see you next week. MR. KING: Thank you, sir. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. City of Scranton declared an emergency declaration on 1007 Quincy Avenue. It's a five-story building . It's been on the condemned list for a number of years. And it's pretty much on its way down here. So they are going to raze that building . That happened I believe yesterday . And, Mr. Voldenberg , will you send a message to Director Duffy and ask when the Christmas lights are going to be put away at Nay Aug Park? We were up there Sunday for the food drive and all of the decoration s are still out. MR. VOLDENBERG : I did reach out and I'll reach out again, sir. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. That is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : Last week I asked -- and I asked Mr. Voldenberg to reach out to Don King about the zoning ordinance . Mr. Voldenberg , did you reach out about the wording 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 in the updated version of the zoning ordinance to Mr. King? MR. VOLDENBERG : I did. I haven't received it as yet. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. If we could please reach out to him again. I have a concern there that, you know, the copy that we have isn't the exact copy that the city is working from. I mean, it's not a spirit of the law type of document here. It's going to be our new zoning ordinance . So I'd like to make sure that whoever , whether it be the Planning Commission or Council that they're voting on the exact document that is going to be passed. We spoke about it tonight in caucus. There is in Third Order tonight there was a budget transfer that occurred with the HR Department . I know you're going to reach out about that. It was for $60,000 for professional service . If we could look into that to see if we get some information because $60,000 is quite a lot of money. And that's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, thank you. I had a few things to address tonight . The first was a complaint that I received . And I mentioned a couple weeks back about Bloom Avenue, the 17 and 1800 blocks. There is some vehicles like the DPW trucks were not able to get onto the street if there were vehicles parked on both sides because it is a narrow roadway . So we had gotten the engineer s from Reilly and Associates to go out there and make an assessment which they sent us. And it looks like their recommendations are to change it from a roadway that you could park on both sides to just being able to park on the westerly side of the road. So you'll have to ask the administration if they plan on making that change then with the appropriate signage along 17 and 1800 blocks of Bloom Avenue in line with the recommendation from Reilly and Associates . And I just want to quickly address the ADA accessibility of City Hall which was brought up tonight by Mr. Raines. And that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 something that I had contact ed city administration I think code enforcement a while ago about. And I looked back in my e-mail and I think it was actually in August and we received a response from John Eastman who was with code enforcement who is no longer working for the city now. But he had a number of recommendations on how we could make City Hall more ADA accessible and compliant . And I'm not sure what action has been taken on those recommendation s. But I would like to check back on that again, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would be able to send out correspondence to see what changes we need to make or plan to make for City Hall to become compliant with the ADA accessibility . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I did want to -- I missed this earlier but I did want to congratulate over at Nay Aug Park the Rec Authority Board and the city for the food pantry. It really was successful . And it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 was great to be able to see all the donations that were there on Sunday. We really appreciate that because that's going to help out other food pantries to sustain them for a few months and to help people that are coming in and need food. And also I want to congratulate the Garden of Cedar on their successful popup event for Valentine 's Day weekend . And it was a great way to be able to get people out to the garden to see what work they've done there. That's on Cedar Avenue. And I think it will be a really nice thing to see in the spring once they start planting there. People could still go and visit and walk around and see the hearts that are there currently . And, oh, there was another thing that I wanted to check in on, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could send correspondence to DPW about changes of signs downtown for the handicap parking . That was something a while ago we had spoken on. I don't think we've gotten an update since. They were going to be looking into a few things on that matter if I remember 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 correctly . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get an update. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. It's pretty sad that Mr. and Mrs. Raines have to keep coming here with the same issues that are valid and concerns , you know, one being safety issue, their road, the ADA compliance issues with City Hall, the curb cut -- the handicap accessible curb cut for their house -- in front of their house and I remember bringing some of these forward . Even when you -- when both of you aren't present and you send me an e-mail and I remember some responses as, well, there's no money. I remember one that was a response for some of the ADA compliance with regards to front and the back, well, there's no money. And then I remember on your street where they wanted to fix that storm drain or the cuts or we took a look at it but, you know, there's no money. But sitting here the past 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 two months, the ARPA money is flying around like crazy. I think you deserve to have these things taken care of and then these safety issues aren't just for you. This is for your neighbor s. So please, Mr. Voldenberg , along with, you know, the other requests for -- you know, with these concerns I want some answers, solid answers in writing . We kind of get this different answers throughout the past three years. These concerns aren't new. We brought them forward more than once, more than twice, more than three times. And we pretty much get the same answers from administration . But I think we need some type of resolve for you. You're a taxpayer . You're handicapped . And your quality of life is in jeopardy because of this. I mean, last winter these drains are backing up. There's ice on your driveway . The van can't even come and pick you up. I remember all of these concern s. And I remember passing them along and never really getting the answers that we need and most of all that you need. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 So please again, like I said, even go back and look at the prior e-mails with the concerns . We want solid answers. We don't just want, well, we can't. We don't have any money. We'll try. We'll get to you. It's not working . So we need to fix this. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll pull all the histories and advise back. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And please keep all of us updated . That is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few responses from prior meetings . Joan Hodowanitz I mentioned and we talked about it earlier . We sent a request to the Business Administration Office regarding the 10 percent fine due for the late audit. And I also spoke to the Mayor about that personally about that yesterday . So I'm hoping to get an answer on that by next week. Mr. Ellman had expressed concerns about the following properties 2611, 2613 North Main Avenue, parking on lawn and sidewalk ; 2618 North Main Avenue, parking on vacant lot; 2700 North Main Avenue parking on vacant lot.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 Scranton Police Department traffic officer advised the following finding s 2611, 2613 North Main Avenue, no vehicle s were parked on the sidewalk at the time he visited that area; 2618 and 2700 North Main Avenue, no vehicles were parked on these lots. It did appear that vehicle s are parking on these lots possibly during the evening . But these lots are private property . It would be up to the owner of the lot to rectify this or have the vehicles removed when they are parked on those lots. 5759 East Parker Street, City Code enforcement did not confirm any boarding house issues. Property was cleaned up. Tenant have had concerns with the landlord in the past, yet the landlord has been very responsive and correct ed any issues in the past. 2620 North Main Avenue, the vacant property with damage roof. Code enforcement issued notice and followup is set for February 23rd. Citizen Jessica Osborne had requested permit parking on the 1300 block of Sanderson Avenue. And you may recall this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 the area where the new brewing company had moved in. You know, I find it interesting some people make the assumption that we don't do anything other than come to meeting s. But believe me, there's a lot more that goes on other than these meeting s. So we get calls from citizens . We're out and about, you know, trying to work around our work schedule s and jobs and try to get out. I personally in this issue on the 1300 block, I videotaped the situation at 8:50 p.m., on a Friday night, February 3rd. In the meantime , Jessica has since videotaped the concern s that are happening on the 1300 block of Sanderson Avenue. So the Scranton Police traffic officer submitted a report to the police chief for approval for permit parking on that block. Now, I know she had initially come in request ed it prior to the brewing company opening. But we really couldn't do anything until the business was actually up and running and we were actually able to see what the impact was from, you know, all of the cars in that area. So I would expect that that will be coming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 before us for legislation . Fay Franus had expressed concerns . She asked us to send a request to Parks and Rec Director for review and update on the swings and other playground equipment at Nay Aug in addition to all city parks. So that request was sent in. Have we heard anything on that, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, Mr. King. MR. KING: We haven't. Okay. Well, if we could just check on that again I would appreciate that. And in terms of pilots that were mentioned , we have the list of present not for profits. And, you know, I spoke to the Mayor about this yesterday . And she indicated to me that they have already sent out mailing s to all of the non-profits requesting payment in lieu of taxes. However , as you heard, that list is not very long. I think the total of payments in lieu of taxes equals $250,000. To me, that is excessively low. I believe that we can do a far better job to reach out to these non-profits . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 I know one thing, if there's a fire, they're going to count on the Scranton Fire Department to show up. If they need police, they're going to count on Scranton Police Department to show up. They need the streets to be plowed. There are great benefit s that many of these non-profits are receiving . And I think being good neighbor s, I think it would be really nice for them to in turn even though they are not for profit, to make some type of financial commitment or donation to the city to help offset some of these costs. So we're going to work on that. Furthermore , the Mayor indicate d that they're going to do that HUP test to look at certain non-profits that initially qualified for non-profit status and now, you know, it may have been 10, 15, 20 years ago. And now time has past. Do they still fall under that not for profit ordinance ? And if not, they need to get back on the tax rolls and start paying their fair dues like everyone else. So we're going to continue to work on that. And thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RE-APPOINTMENT OF ROBERT GATTENS , JR., AS A MEMBER OF THE SCRANTON MUNICIPAL RECREATION AUTHORITY . ROBERT GATTENS , JR.’S FIVE (5) YEAR TERM IS EFFECTIVE UPON EXECUTION OF THE RESOLUTION AND WILL EXPIRE FEBRUARY 15, 2028. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I wanted to thank Mr. Gattens for all the work that he's done over the years at the park. It has had a tremendous impact. And I'm happy that he wants to continue to serve on the Rec Authority Board. So I'm happy to vote on introduction tonight of this resolution . MR. KING: I totally agree. I've seen Mr. Gattens , the work and time and effort that goes into everything that goes on up at Nay Aug Park. And he's a dedicated volunteer for the city in that park. So we're very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 fortunate to have an individual like that serve on the Rec Authority . MR. MCANDREW : I also think he's the best. And I'm thrilled that he's being retained on this board and wish him the best of luck. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 51, 2023 – AMENDING THE MEMBERSHIP PROVISIONS OF THE HOUSING BOARD OF APPEALS . MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. SMURL: Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I spoke about it I think the last two weeks. I do like the current setup of the board. I do think it guarantee s that there would be a quorum of three. So I'm going to be voting no for this tonight . MR. MCANDREW : I also have an issue with this. And I mentioned it last week. I'd even entertain if they had to have three for a meeting or not have three because we need balance . There's five people up here. There's nine on the school board and to have two for a quorum just doesn't make sense to me. I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's fair to the citizen s who are appealing. I don't think it's fair that we're changing the game. So what's next? Are we going to start reducing numbers on other boards or authorities ? It just -- it's doesn't feel good here. It doesn't feel good here. I'm a no. And in addition to that so -- even if we keep it the way it is, you're going to get three. That's all we've been getting is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 three with two alternates . So why change something that's really not broke? I really don't understand the hard request to have three because they can't fill the five. I get it, but they're already filling three. So I'm a little -- I just have a problem with that fixing something that's really not broke, the language is what I'm trying to say. Thank you. MR. KING: I will be supporting this this evening due to the fact that Mr. Smurl who sits up here on the City Council and has served on the Housing Appeal Board has indicated it's extremely difficult to get individuals , contractors , people that are qualifi ed to serve on this Housing Appeal Board, people that actually understand and know how to read blueprints and have that knowledge . I know that they tried very, extremely hard to get contractors and people that are certified to serve on it. And it's been a complete challenge . That's why I'll be supporting this this evening . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'll be supporting this as well. I disagree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 that this is not broken. I mean, I think it is broken. That's why we can't fill the seats on it. And if three is what we've had, then I think the ordinance should reflect that three seats is what this board will have in the future with the two alternative s. And I think that it's going to be easier to get -- find people who could be alternates . And if you don't have three who are able to attend that meeting , then that's when you call in an alternate to be able to attend. So they should be willing to at least do that. And they're monthly meetings . So I think that this is more reasonable . It seems to be how the board is already operating . And so for those reasons I'll be voting yes. MR. KING: Roll call. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS.
