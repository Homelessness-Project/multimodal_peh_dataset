DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two. So Saturday , September 24th at Weston Field House 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 presents the Hometown Boxing. Doors open at 5 p.m. First fight is at 6 p.m. And secondly , Saturday , October 1st, North Scranton Neighborhood Association invites everyone to the October fest. It will be between 5 to 8 at the VFW Number 25 on Rockwell Avenue. Donation is $20. It includes food, refreshment s, and entertainment . And, you know, I got a little backup on this. The money that they raised for this, they do a lot of great things. So in the year since their last October fest, we've hosted the following free events: A kids Halloween party, tree lighting and Christmas party, breakfast with the bunny. And they also in addition to that make multiple donations over the years with money raised to St. Francis soup kitchen , and Our Father's House, Kinship Kitchen , Mary Mother of God Parish, Neil Armstrong . They helped out with uniform s, bookbags, coats. The Scranton Police Department Winter Coats for Kids and the NEPA Youth Shelter. So it looks like this group of people do a lot of great things. And if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 can, we should get out and support this. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have one more announcement . So over the weekend the Scranton Fire Department and Police Department had a memorial event. So I would just like to bring back to Council a certificate and a flag. I would like to thank the Scranton Police Department , the Scranton Fire Department and the EMS team that was on hand, especially firefighter Zach Fannon, Ed Smeden, and AJ Samuel and police officers Mike Morrison and Pat Van Wei. So on Sunday, September 11th they participated in the Memorial Stair Climb at Crunch Fitness and they climbed 110 floors with the occasion of 9/11. They presented the City with a flag that flew at Alpha Company 102 infantry regimen at their compound at the Horn of Africa while Mr. Fannon -- one of our members of the Fire Department was deployed there. So it was an honor to attend the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 event. I'd like to thank them again. And I did bring our flag back to City Hall. So we'll see if we have a place to hang it indoors here. Great job guys. Thanks for your service . That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any other announcements ? I have two. An executive session was held this evening between Council and the City's solicitor and labor attorney to discuss personnel . Also, next week at 5:45 we'll have a public hearing on the capital budget which is on tonight 's agenda. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowantiz , Scranton . Speaking of executive sessions , can you tell me if there's been any movement or progress on union contract negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : From what I have been told they're still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, pushing nine 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 months there and counting . So that's a lot of money being paid for the labor counsel . But more than that, you're edging closer to having to finalize a 2023 budget. My major concern isn't the money we're paying Ufberg and Associates . My concern is concocting a 2023 budget without any firm salary and wages issues and healthcare and all the other benefits that go on in labor negotiations . Oh, 17 more days and we will have the 2021 audit. How's that going? MR. DONAHUE : We're still hopeful that we'll receive it by the 30th. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, you believe in the tooth fairy too, don't you? Oh, my goodness . Item 3-C the information from the Single Tax Office, for the year-to-date comparison as of September 2nd and it says Business Mercantile Tax but we're also talking Payroll Prep Tax. And as of this time last year it was 2.2 million dollars and change. And this year it's $145,000 and change. Now I understand that we've just begun to implement the Payroll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Preparation Tax. But I do recall several months ago that Lazor and McGovern sent you a memo and raised the issue about what are you going to do with the self-employed and rental income. And I guess you said that we're working on the issue. Council is looking at it. When are we going to get that information ? When are we going to get those answers ? MR. DONAHUE : I'm hoping we're able to schedule a caucus on specifically the Payroll Prep Tax and its implementation this year and to answer some of those questions publically sometime in October . MS. HODOWANITZ : Sometime when? MR. DONAHUE : In October . MS. HODOWANTIZ : October . MR. DONAHUE : In preparation of moving into the budget season. MS. HODOWANITZ : You're putting a lot of people, you know, in a difficult position . You know, they pay or they don't pay. And it's not an easy thing to do. You could be talking about some serious problems for people. So I hope that gets resolved . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. DONAHUE : And just to clarify too because the Single Tax Office collects the Business Privilege and Mercantile but Berkheimer collects the payroll . So that's why those numbers are so far off too. MS. HODOWANITZ : Do we have any -- MR. DONAHUE : Because the Business Privilege and Mercantile on this would be delinquent Business Privilege and Mercantile which is still owed and -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Do we have any figures for the Payroll Preparation Tax? MR. DONAHUE : We're hoping to get those relatively soon. MS. HODOWANITZ : Speaking of figures on taxes, what about the database for property taxes and garbage fees. That was put on your Council log as of one April. Are we still working on that? MR. DONAHUE : Excuse me? I'm sorry, what was the -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Remember the database where you could look up an individual to see if they were delinquent in their taxes and their garbage fees? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. DONAHUE : So we actually got an answer on that today. The data was provided by the City Treasurer to Larry West for review. And they're just awaiting a response . MS. HODOWANITZ : So does that mean that you might before the end of the year see that database on the City's website ? MR. DONAHUE : I'm hoping we see it by the end of this month. MS. HODOWANITZ : That would be nice. That would be nice. And I saw Item 5-F about the grant for Lackawanna College of up to 15 million dollars . I understand that that's a grant so it's not coming out of the general fund. But it seems to me that we've done quite -- a lot of money has been funneled to 401 Adams Avenue. And it would be nice to see if some kind of priority could be given to student s from the Scranton area since we're helping them and supporting them in getting that. I don't know if that could be done if that's even legal. But it would be nice so that we can, you know, take care of some of our own residents and the children . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And a lot of time on the grants too, the City just acts as a conduit for -- MS. HODOWANITZ : I know. But we do support them -- MR. DONAHUE : But Lackawanna College does all the legwork, right, in terms of applying for it. They just need us to sponsor it. MS. HODOWANITZ : I understand that. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Next on the list, Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I wouldn't even be here tonight except for, Mr. Donahue , your total disregard and some of the Council members -- not Mr. Schuster or Mr. McAndrew though -- total disregard for everything I said last week. You sat there last week and said you would address the situation on Lackawanna College using Chick Feldman Field. You never once mentioned anything about that. What you said is the short-term solution for -- we're going to have to figure out a long-term solution . They're using it now temporarily . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 You said until we figure out. What do you mean we? Since when does Council have to figure out where Lackawanna College plays their football games and practice s? And, you know, also, you made a statement last week that wasn't true at all. You said that they don't use the stadium -- Memorial Stadium . They use the outside of it, like, the grass at the far end. MR. DONAHUE : They use that for practice . MS. FRANUS: They use the field for -- MR. DONAHUE : For games. MS. FRANUS: No. Just let me finish, okay? I spoke with the -- I spoke with the Scranton School District Bert Gentilezza . He told me Lackawanna College is ruining their turf. That's why they don't want them there. And they also were using the middle of the field of Memorial Stadium for practice , not the outside , the middle of the field. And they are ruining the turf. They said they have to put their student s first because they have to have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 place to play because Lackawanna College is practicing day and night, every day and every night. They weren't stopping . So you're not putting the citizens first. This is a public park that they are using, a public park. And there's supposed to be -- and I don't understand you as President of Council , how come you don't ask Marissa Duffy to come in and answer all the questions ? Ask her why she answered all the question s they say she did and lied about everything . She said they had an agreement , they don't have an agreement . She said it was on the agenda before the August recess. It wasn't. She said they're waiting for Council to approve it. She said that Lackawanna College did not own the field at Sweeney Beach. Lackawanna College does own the field at Sweeney Beach. So how come none of you up there said why aren't they using their own field instead of ruining our park? You didn't say that, did you? So let me tell you another little story. When I went there and saw them playing I -- the language is terrible . The coach -- you wouldn't believe -- I wouldn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 even repeat the words they were saying. My sister was in the car in the parking lot. And she said to me, did you hear them? I said I sure did. So I called Eric Larson and told him about it. He said he would straighten that out. And when I went back again, same language , screaming . Take my word for it. That's not right when there is women and children there and citizen s to hear that language . So the one day I went over about 4:30 and I was taking some picture s. So the assistant athletic director said to me what are you taking picture s for? I said because I want to. He said it's against the law. He said I'm going to turn you in. These are minors. First of all, it's a public park. Second of all, they're not minors. So so much for him trying to intimidate me. Do you know that I did a Right To Know and there is no agreement . So everything I gave you, all the information last week, Larry West said there was an agreement . That was a lie. All of these things that Marissa Duffy said are lies and just let her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 get away with it. You don't say one word about she shouldn 't have done that or why did she say that or why doesn't she know what her job is. If she doesn't know the right answer, she shouldn 't have that job. But she did know. She did know there was no -- nothing on the agenda. And she did know that Lackawanna College owns that field. And she did know that there was no written agreement . And she still lied about it. So she's a parks director. So the Mayor is her boss. And the Mayor, the buck stops with her. And nobody is doing anything about Marissa Duffy. So shame on you for not even calling that out and saying why aren't they using their own field. Not a word about that. Nothing . How about taxes? Are they paying taxes? Even the Scranton School Board said they don't even pay taxes. I have a Right To Know in to see if they're paying anything . I didn't get it back yet. So I just want to check something else here. I don't know. I just want to know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 what you're going to do about it. Are you going to -- do you agree that they should be using that field and ruining it? And you say short term. Well, all of a sudden, okay, the Mayor wanted a financial chair. She got the William Foundation and guess who else she got to pay for it, $95,000, Lackawanna College . Come August, Lackawanna College doesn't have a field to practice in. Oh, we just gave them 50-some thousand dollars . Let's see if we could use Chick Feldman Field, not quid pro quo. That's just my opinion . But a little sneaky here. Everything is sneaky. It's a coverup. Everybody is lying and everybody is covering it up. And you just let it go. You don't want to ask anybody why they did what they did, why they're doing what they're doing and why aren't they using their own field. They say it's too small. You saw the size of the field. And they cut the grass all the time. So if you don't do something , shame on you. And I expect you to do something . But I don't think you will. I think you'll let them use that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 college -- that field as long as they want because you care more about the colleges than the people. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . After talks like that, I think maybe I don't need to say what I have to say. But in any case, I wanted to come with a lot of thank yous tonight . Thank you for our First Annual Electric City Flower Show. It was a huge success . I want to thank all of Council members that were there that came over to greet us. And I want to just -- it means a lot to us after all the work that we put into it to see that the resident s and City Council was there to support us. And I want to thank all the citizens of Scranton that came to support us. And there were even citizens from New Jersey, Binghamton , New York. So it was just great to have those people there. So I thank you. I want to thank ECTV as well. They did a great piece on the Flower Show -- the Electric City Flower Show. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 I keep wanting to say Philadelphia . It's Scranton Electric Flower Show. But if you get a chance to look at our ECTV, there's a great interview . I just happen to be on it. But it was great, you know, talking about it, interviewing the people that were there. And I must give a great big shoutout to Pennsylvania Water Company . They supplied us with so much water. They ran out and they went and got more water for us because it was a very hot and humid day. So they kept us very hydrated . And I can't thank them enough for bringing that water for us. I mean, we did ask them to come but we didn't think that we would need it as much as we did. I want to thank Mr. Schuster -- Councilman Schuster as well. I wasn't here last week but I did listen to the rebroadcast. And I appreciate you with the street signs and asking -- I think Mr. Voldenberg was going to send a letter to Larry West to find out the status of the street signs. I refuse to give up. I've called. They don't call me back. At least Mr. Preambo would call me back. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 But nobody calls me back. So I'm still, like, so interested in the street signs. And the City of Scranton , I've been back here I can't believe it's five years now. And I like the City. I love the City. I want the City to be better. So one of the other things I think we had gotten a grant as we come out of Lackawanna Avenue and that part right next to the Radison Hotel that's falling down there. I think we did get a grant for that. So I don't know why that's not being done. MR. DONAHUE : Do you want me answer now or do you want me to wait -- MS. JEFFRIES : You can't answer now because I might run out of my stuff here. But also, as far as the City, you know, we have people coming in for the flower show. We had the bike race. We had all of these little things that City and Scranton Tomorrow is out there bringing in things and other divisions are bringing in things to the City. And we can't get our street signs. We can't get that part at the Radison Hotel fixed. We are better than that. We are truly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 better than that to let that wall -- if it was any of your houses, you would have had it fixed by now. I'm sure you would not let that wall sit there like that. And if you had your house signs, you would have your signs up. So I want to thank you, Mr. Schuster , for following up on that because they didn't follow up with me. I also wanted to thank Mr. Voldenberg and the office staff. A couple of people came up to me. They can't come to City Council and talk. I don't know why. But they came up and said, boy, what a great job they did for me. I called down there and I needed to know some e-mails. I needed to know this, that, or the other thing. And they said they were just so gracious in helping them. I told them, I said, anytime I call Frank is always there to help me as well as the other staff members there. So just feeding on what was said last week about how helpful the office is, you know, I just want to add my thank you to the office staff as well as the other people that I run into. So I know you probably hear it too because I hear it as well. So I just want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 thank you all. And next week I'll have my complaints . Now I just want to say thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here today I called the Mayor's office. I called DPW. And I called Council and directed a message to Mr. King about ECTV's drone being stuck in a tree. And I think that the City should send their bucket truck up and get that drone out of the tree. And why do I think that, because it's Electric City Television . It's funded through Council . And it's a very important asset that belongs to this City. And I think it's the right thing to do. But we'll see. Time will tell what will happen. But to shift gears here a little bit, you know, I've been doing numerous videos on a rewrite of the charter. And I think that if the things Fay said here tonight to this Council don't wake up enough Scrantonians as to just how broken this City government is, nothing will. You know, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 did a video. It hasn't been put up yet about the Pine Brook project with the grant money. It's just utterly ridiculous . All this grant money being spent in this City over my entire lifetime was misdirected . You cannot bring a City to revitalization by throwing money around all over the place and chasing blight. You have to create employment centers . This City needs a small business incubator , a real one like Scranton Lace would have been. But, of course, more grant money was thrown at that; and we lost the building that would have been just perfect considering the amount of weight that those floors were designed to hold and the amount of area and parking around that building . You know, when you look at where the grant money is being thrown around, Nay Aug Park building a pool, what kind of a pool is the City really going to build because if it's anything like Novembrino , it's all a waste of money. Are we going to tear the slide down? Are we going to tear the pool house down? You know, we need to put residents in control of almost every aspect of this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 City's revitalization because the Council s and the Mayors over a protract ed period of time have proven themselves unwilling or unable to turn this City around because the first thing everybody is worried about is politics . You know, it's very troubling that the Scranton School District is in almost a complete collapse and the City is too. And we just come out of distress . All I ever hear from this Council is grant money and taxation . But took take a good look at this city and see it for what it really is. We need a business incubator to create employment opportunities in the City. And the other thing we need is, we need a partner in the county to revitalize Scranton 's downtown because there's absolutely nothing there. Nothing . Walk around the downtown . You could throw all the grant money you want around. Look what you did down by Buona's, just totally unsuccessful . I think that was 50 million dollars . Look at the waste. Why isn't some -- why hasn't -- why hasn't -- just let's pick a figure like the 15 million we're going to give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 to Lackawanna College . Why isn't there a revolving fund in the City of Scranton for property owners to borrow money from the City to repair their properties and start really doing something about the blight in the City? Why isn't there? And why when we built this program wouldn't the City take first position on the mortgage on that property so that the City would always get its money returned to it because we don't have a government by the people or for the people. We're getting money from Harrisburg , Washington , everywhere . And the people, they're just an unimportant consequence because the Council has a solicitor for a reason. Think about what you're doing. You're torpedoing the City. And it's just a terrible thing. And I know that I'm 63 years old and I won't live forever . But look at all the people who came here and spoke and they're at the cemetery and nothing 's changed . MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Jessica Osborne . MS. OSBORNE : Hello. My name is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Jessica . I was here back in November to ask you guys about getting a parking permit for the microbrewery that's right across the street from me. I know times -- things have changed . Kyle, you're now president . And, Mr. King, you're on this now and there is a new police chief. I did talk to Frank corresponding with him through e-mail and whatnot asking him the status of what was going on. He told me that there was a police officer , Sergeant Justin Butler that was in charge of this assessment. I question if he is -- actually has to do this, like, what kind of degree does he have? Is he an engineer , like, is he qualified to do this? Furthermore , I went and I looked up the ordinance that you guys have here. And you are supposed to put in the newspaper that you're going to have this study to be done. It was not. I read that paper faithfully . I did not see that in there. There was a lot of things overlooked . I feel like he only looked at Section A1 for the Section 439-66, Article 6, Chapter 439. That's what I'm looking at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 right now. There's a lot of things. There's a bus stop that is directly across the street that's on here for consideration . I have Scranton Prep that's using a practice field. That's part of educational . That is on the street. There's a lot of no parking zones there. I don't have a driveway . And I'm sorry, I just feel like I'm being dismissed here. And this was not done properly . So I'm asking if you guys could reevaluate this. And I want to know why none of this was followed . MR. DONAHUE : So there was a study -- MS. OSBORNE : Apparently . MR. DONAHUE : I remember you being here. But they did it and they denied your request . MS. OSBORNE : Apparently . I got -- it was more on the lines of in the e-mail, like, oh, yeah, by the way, you didn't qualify . I have no report -- no official report. Again, you guys were supposed to put this in the newspaper to let everybody know in my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 neighborhood . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, so that's not us. MS. OSBORNE : Well, not you but I mean -- MR. DONAHUE : I get what you're saying. MS. OSBORNE : Well, the City is suppose d to do that as an ordinance . It says right here as you're shaking your head. I'm highlighting everything right here. If I'm wrong, please correct me and send me -- tell me where I'm wrong, where this ordinance is wrong. If it's not -- let me know. MR. DONAHUE : Can you leave your contact information with Kathy? MS. OSBORNE : Frank has everything . MR. DONAHUE : Frank has it, okay. So let's -- so I don't have -- MS. OSBORNE : I have another question too. How come you guys rely on the Scranton Police Department , like, tremendously for a lot of stuff and there's not one person here to represent them besides the person that's assigned here for duty? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Like, there's nobody here from them because when I ask about a traffic thing too they said they were the ones that control the traffic and be up to them. And I feel like you guys rely on them an awful lot, and there's absolutely nobody here to represent them. MR. DONAHUE : So we can put in a request . Let me try to find out exactly what, you know, why it was denied. I don't have the ordinance right in front of me either. But let me look into that. MS. OSBORNE : Yeah, I appreciate that. MR. DONAHUE : I'll give you a call tomorrow or Thursday . MS. OSBORNE : Yeah, or e-mail me, either way. It's easier to e-mail me because of work. I'm sure you guys understand that. So if you can correspond that way, that would be great too. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MS. OSBORNE : I would appreciate that. Thank you very much guys. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Doris Koloski .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Doris Koloski , Scranton . The last meeting Mr. Donahue had said something about voting on the zoning in October . He said it should give Geisinger enough time to meet with the neighbors . I need to know if that means that all that Geisinger has to do is meet with us and then call you and say they met with us, they fulfilled their obligation because they told us what they wanted to do and then you vote. Or if they come to us and we meet with them and they're telling us things that we are not acceptable to, like, well, we're going to put up a five-story garage across the street or we're going to -- or we don't know what we're going to do again. And we find it unacceptable , then what does that mean to us? I mean, if we find everything they say unacceptable or one or two things that they say unacceptable , does that mean that you are going to review that to see if it's really -- if you guys feel it's unacceptable along with the neighbor s and maybe write a revision type 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 thing or are you going to give them carte blanche and just do a vote? That's basically what I wanted to know because I know from the Freedom of Information Act and the documents that we received that when the City planned this ordinance , the zoning change, they did not plan it with the civic. And when Geisinger saw the zoning change they said it wasn't acceptable to them. And they contact ed the City Planner and he said they wanted it changed. And they said okay and that was without coming before us or I think you. I don't think you guys knew either. So, I mean, this is what I want to know. Now that we're getting down to the nitty-gritty and we're hoping to speak to them. We made contact and we're hoping to speak to them. I mean, they were telling who they don't want and they're saying, you know, all this other stuff. MR. DONAHUE : Have they been in contact with you recently ? MS. KOLOSKI : They were in contact with us finally after three or four e-mails 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 from Mr. Schwartz . They finally answered back yesterday . And we read it at our meeting . And they said something about, yes, they would meet. But they had their things. They want to meet at 4:00 in the afternoon . I mean, that's not acceptable because people are working . I mean, so we are contacting back with them. They were sent back. I don't know what was said in the letters yet because that is when they finally contacted -- but he had contact ed them three or four times before they contacted us back. And so this is what I'm wondering about and worried about. MR. DONAHUE : So when I said, you know, end of October , that's at the earliest because what needs to happen, I mean, we've been pushing for them to meet with the neighbor s, address their concerns and -- MS. KOLOSKI : Right. But is it just address our concerns ? MR. DONAHUE : Process wise too, right, we're still going to hold another public hearing . And it still needs to go to the county for an additional 30-day period because there were enough changes, you know, in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 overall plan that it has to go back to them for review. MS. KOLOSKI : And what happens if they say we want no changes ? We listened to you but we don't care. We don't want any changes . This is what we need. What happened then does it just -- MR. DONAHUE : So we're taking in -- we're taking into consideration everybody 's point of view on this. MS. KOLOSKI : I hope so. MR. DONAHUE : We're trying to find a middle ground here. We're pushing for a middle ground. You know, we've had multiple meetings back in the spring. You know, we have been pushing for them to show rendering s of what their plans are. And if that's not acceptable to Council as a whole, we're not going to accept that. MS. KOLOSKI : That's fine. MR. DONAHUE : We're going to continue the conversation , right, it's -- MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. Yeah, because I think the neighbors should have something to say. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . MS. KOLOSKI : We've lived there a long time, kept up our property , paid our taxes and they've done nothing . And so I really think that we deserve to be taken into consideration . MR. DONAHUE : From what they've conveyed to us that they were going to be setting up a meeting -- and this was last week in the next week or two and -- MS. KOLOSKI : No, they have not. And the other thing is also, it's very hard. I hate to -- I don't like to call people liars. I mean, I really don't. But it's very hard to trust them because when they did their 99.1 million dollar expansion -- I have to find my T-shirt so I could wear it here next week. They told us a lot of things. And they told us the one thing that they would never put a big large building at that school thing with parking . It would only be underground parking . They told us a whole lot of stuff that now they want to wipe it away. And they want to wipe it away by changing it to civic so they could do what they want. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. DONAHUE : Please let us know if they reach out this week. MS. KOLOSKI : Like I said, they did send an e-mail back but they did not ask for time. They just said they'd like it to be in the afternoon , like, 4:00, 4:30. That's not going to be acceptable . People are working . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. MS. KOLOSKI : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. WILLIAMS : Good evening , Joann Williams , City resident . I'm here this evening to speak on the Geisinger expansion . I have a few questions . One of them is one that Doris has asked. Is there any progress as to a day set for a vote from this body? And another thing is, has any one of you with the exception of Jessica taken the time to walk and talk with the residents of blocks that Geisinger is targeting ? When we vote you into those seats, we put our trust and relied on you to do what is best for our families of all the neighborhoods . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Civic zoning is not for the Hill Section . We are and always were a residential community with beautiful homes and families that took pride in their homes and their neighborhoods just like generation s past. We have in our neighborhood now a park, one of the many gems in our City. Just imagine civic zoning by Nay Aug. You go to Mulberry Street, it's a gateway to the park. Imagine families , the elderly, the walkers , the children trying to get to Nay Aug with all of that traffic , noise, pollution . These conditions will not be pleasing to Nay Aug visitors . And I'm worried about Geisinger and I always have taking over Nay Aug Park. Now I know from my grandfather that Nay Aug was willed to always be a park. And I just want to reference to Mr. King. Mr. King, you were my superintendent when I worked at the Scranton School District . I know your number one priority is what was best for the children and the staff. And I thank you for that. Mr. Schuster , I worked with you too. You worked with special 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 needs children . And your devotion and compassion to those children never went unnoticed . All I have to say is it's time to vote no to civic zoning and keep our neighborhood residential . It's time Geisinger -- they want to build their hospital or they want to improve and I understand . But they need to comply with the neighborhood 's needs. And, Jessica , I want to thank you too for reaching out because that is what Scranton is. Scranton is our neighborhood . Yes, it's our businesses . It's other things. But it's our neighbor s that bring -- our neighborhood s that bring family and children . And I just have a remark about what one speaker said about our Scranton School District going downhill . My grandson is Northeast Intermediate , wonderful school, wonderful teachers . I love this City, always have. I love my neighborhood . Please do not destroy it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . In the news I noticed that there was another -- even though it's a year or so ago there is another police officer that was listed that evidently had custody issues who is now on 18-month home confinement who is retired at this point after 30 years with pension and all the benefits . At the time when we're negotiating a new contract with the police union and the Fire Department , maybe there needs to be attention put to the responsibilities to that Oath of Office. This officer had some minor charges for carrying a baseball bat up and threatening his ex-wife over child custody . But it was mentioned in there and I don't think he was charged with is he also called 911 and made a false report. I understand that must be trivial to get 18 months sentence served at home and still retain all of your benefits , all of your pension and everything from your years of service when you broke that Oath of Office while you were still an officer on the police force. That's an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 issue. Later on in this session you're going to be touching on the employee again who you want to give a waiver to. I'd like to remind you that not only has this been done countless times before and it seems that at this point this body is willing to pick and choose which laws it follows and which laws it decides to hand waivers out to. This is not an option. When you place a law on the books and a rule on the books it should be followed . If it's not, why do we have Council men from the City of Scranton ? Why do we have a Mayor from the City of Scranton ? Why not hire the best person from the entire country to actually take these bodies. Because if all that matters is the best, I'm sure that there's a ton of people across this nation who have brought things out of financial ruin who could sit on this body if they did not have to live here. There's a problem when exceptions become the rules. We had a gentleman come before this body to speak, not to change laws but to speak 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 and he was challenged because he was from Wilkes-Barre. He's a taxpayer . So he's allowed to speak. But it calls into question when this body stops someone 's voice in a public audience because Council rules say they have to be from Scranton and because they are not from Scranton , they are not even allowed to voice an opinion on the City, on the region around them or anything in front of this body. We strip them of a voice because they are outside of the City of Scranton or non-taxpayers . Yet at the same time we hand waivers for people who are suppose d to be contracted to become employees of the City of Scranton with a waiver for nonresidency . It's a dual system and it's wrong. You seek to punish people who try to express their first amendment rights to voice before this Council and this body an opinion . And at the same time turn around and say that what the opinion of this body is can be changed for the convenience of this body. I talked slowly about this because it does matter. We're not in an emergency situation anymore. We are not in a pandemic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 where we need to put down emergency orders six months after the person is already hired in place. We're in a point where we should be looking at what is on the books and what is our duty to the Oath of Office that was taken for these seats. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton and taxpayer . Once again because of the importance of it, I feel obligated to speak about this proposal to have the dump's water of Dunmore Landfill dumped into the gorge -- Nay Aug Gorge about three or four miles from the Lackawanna River. And I hear all about the Lackawanna River. Well, if I really needed a drink, I would prefer water from the gorge than the Lackawanna River in the first place. And it's just ridiculous . Every time somebody decides they want something that we have, they have to give it up. You know, we just have to give it up. Our wants don't mean a hill of beans 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 to the billions that the landfill is raking in over the years. And people have become billionaires based almost solely on the landfill . So I would hope that the Mayor and all work a little more in the future and Council to start to address this and address it very strongly because if -- I think they are just trying to side step monitoring their discharges . That's all they're trying to do. Some day it will be good almost drinkable on the way out of the landfill one day and then as soon as your back is turned, whoopee . You know, there's radioactive drilling cords being deposited there. It's like I said, anything and anything . It's a free-for-all for -- since 1980. I was up there in 1984. It was also a truck junkyard . And we were pulling a huge transmission out of a truck and everything and anything was deposited there. And with this -- I don't understand changing the subject why such a small college really needs a football team. You know, what is the point here? Why do they need this stuff that -- they're like a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 little tiny building with a handful of student s and they have to have a supports team? You know, what are they trying to do here, attract money? I just don't know. I'm not a big fan of high school and college sports. If we're going to spend a lot of money that we don't have then -- and eat up a lot of resources out of town -- Fay Franus does have a point here. They're wearing out public property and incurring expenses on us. And it's just ridiculous . We don't have it. I still have them to thank for the sale of the sewer plant. By the way, my water bill is more than twice as much as what it was eight years ago. And probably if they charge me five or six bucks a week more and every other customer or every other customer a month more or 10 bucks a month more, we probably could have done all the upgrades ourself. And we wouldn't have needed Mr. Amoroso in here. Now, the vote is coming up. And, elderly, be ware. I'm not young anymore, just immature . I'm 68 years old. And there are candidates running -- there is nothing you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 could do here. I don't know what Dr. Oz thinks, but they want to start relegislating Social Security , Medicare , Medicaid . They had 60 votes to destroy Obama care in four years. And we also have some constitutional amendments ]coming up in Pennsylvania . Every last one of them is about the equivalent of a drink of that water flowing out of the landfill . It is garbage . They stripped the Governor of emergency powers. Now they want to strip everything else and run it themselves . Only trouble is get them to agree for once. Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , City taxpayer and resident . My first item for this week had -- waiting for the outcome of the meetings that have been held on the letter of Mr. Lazor and McGovern . Do we have a time when that's going to be resolved ? MR. DONAHUE : When what -- I know there was a meeting held with Mr. Lazor. MS. SCHUMACHER : And has anything changed or are we going to get a definition of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 what the payroll preparation includes or excludes ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe that's going to be covered when we have a caucus. MR. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry? MR. DONAHUE : It's going to be covered when we have a caucus. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. 7-E which is the out of city employee , again was that position advertised ; do you know? And how many people responded ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe it was. I believe there was eight. There were eight applications . MS. SCHUMACHER : And we had to pick one from out of town. I think that is -- MR. DONAHUE : Well, we didn't pick them. MS. SCHUMACHER : No, we, the City. On page five of Item 3-B on the ARPA things, it says that on page five of that thing of the 20 pages it says that there is no expenditure for category two as of August 25th, 2022. But I couldn't even find a category one. So I don't know what category two -- what we're missing by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 not having anything for category two. So do any of you know what that -- which one -- what is category one and what are we missing in category two? I guess not. MR. DONAHUE : No, I mean, there is no other ones that are classified as categories . But we could get some clarification on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, well, I mean -- yeah. Okay, then moving on. Also though for 5-B it stated that Anser -- I'm sorry, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : So when I'm looking at this, Miss Schumacher , the first slide on page four, what's covered there is that category one, I would imagine . It's not labeled as such. But there is the chart on top and the spending underneath . And then when you switch to the next one that pie chart there -- what's labeled there I would take as category two. And it's saying no expenditures . And then as you switch through each side there's a pie chart with what expenditures for each of those slides. So it does appear that that's for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 what's covered on that slide on page five if that makes sense. It's not labeled though. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, it should be labeled , I believe . And also it says that the Anser Advisory which already has a contract to -- with us on that ARPA that they have engaged the Institute For Public Policy and Economic Development . Is this coming from the contract money they already have from us or is that going to be an additional cost and do we know how much that is costing ? MR. DONAHUE : What page is that, I'm sorry. MS. SCHUMACHER : 5-B. I don't know what -- I didn't write the page number on that one, I'm sorry. MR. DONAHUE : I don't have an answer, but I'll get one for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Yeah, I would like to know the answer to that. And then Nay Aug pools, when are we going to get a decision on getting some pools up at Nay Aug? I attended a function on Sunday and people did not realize what had happened to the pools. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And they were just really not happy. And they were, you know, again wondering where we have pools anymore. And 8-A, what are we waiting for? What's going to change that will bring that back, if you could. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few things. I know that we're going to be meeting up at Robinson Park I think it's next week with some of the neighborhood association , a few leaders. And there's been a feasibility study from what I understand concerning Engine No. 10, the possible closure on the -- I don't know of Engine 10. And I know that they strongly fight against this. And quite frankly , I'm against it as well, not only because I live on the mountain but I just know that, you know, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 closest fire company to East Mountain is in South Side or downtown . So, I mean, it would be I think tragic. It would be a disaster if a fire took place on the top of that mountain and it took forever . And I know that there was something recently that talked about it's one of the least utilized , you know, fire departments . But I think every section of the City has a Fire Department . And it's there for a reason. I'm frankly glad that it's underutilize d. That means that there haven't been any tragic fires. But when there are fires, we need to have that fire company there. And I know that they also respond and help out in other parts of the City when needed. So that's something that I know I'll be discuss ing with some of the people from the neighborhood association next week. I had the same question that Mrs. Schumacher had concerning Nay Aug Pool. I know there is talk of a master plan for the Nay Aug Pool Complex . And I think that's all well and fine, love a master plan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 It should center around a new pool complex at Nay Aug Park. Build a pool and not a wading pool, not a splash pad, a swimming pool for adults and for children . I think that we can -- we've seen plans of a complex there that could benefit the entire city. And I know that there's been questions about whether we could use some ARPA funds for that because it doesn't necessarily fall under the low income designation . Well, you go two or three blocks away from Nay Aug Park, it's already been indicated that the majority of the people that would utilize Nay Aug Park live in 18510 and 18505. Well, I could guarantee you all of those families , a vast majority of them would fall under the category . And furthermore , the people that don't live in those areas would certainly want to be able to utilize the swimming pool at Nay Aug. So a master plan is great. I think it's going to take a long time to do this master plan. We've already gone three years I think without a swimming pool. It's filled in up there. I want to see this pool moved along. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I've been on this Council for just about nine months now. You know, we've talked about it repeatedly . We've had meeting s about it. I feel like it's just constantly being pushed off. And I know that there -- I would be willing to say that we can legally use ARPA funds to help us build a pool complex up there. Also, I have in my notes here about the Payroll Preparation Tax. I know that the City had met with Mr. Lazor. They have not met with Mr. McGovern. I would like to request that we have a meeting here in caucus with Mr. Lazor and Attorney McGovern to get their professional opinions . And when I say professional opinions , these two -- I mean, Mr. McGovern is an attorney and a CPA. He used to be the attorney for the Tax Office. Mr. Lazor has more letters after his name in terms of his education and experience and background having to do with tax law than anybody I know. And he serves on a multitude of boards for the City. So I think Council needs to hear what their concerns are because quite frankly , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 I'm concerned that if we continue to move forward with this PPT tax and we end having to go back and pay this money back, it's going to be detrimental to the City. So I think it's important that we have that meeting sooner rather than later. Also, I don't like to bring up a lot of complaint s that I get through the City. I try to forward them to Frank Voldenberg as I get them and I speak to the citizens . But this one is just driving me crazy. It's near Mountain Lake. I've been complaining about this. And all of the neighbors -- I can't walk the streets . I can't go to the Waldorf . I can't go anywhere without people on me about this vehicle on Birch Street near Mountain Lake. It's been there -- I've noticed it for over nine months. I complain ed about it probably back in -- or inquired about it back in March or April. And it has no plates on it. It's been abandoned . We all know that. Apparently it's a leased vehicle that was just left there. And now there's even marking s on the road from utilities that it's got to be, you know, causing a problem for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 them to be able to do whatever work they need to do. And furthermore , it's just a problem for the neighbors . And it shouldn 't be. I mean, it needs to be towed out of there. I don't know what we need to do to make that happen. People are constantly complain ing to me and rightfully so. And I just feel like as frustrated as they are because it just has to go. I spoke to an individual again today that had concerns about the Weston Field indoor swimming pool program that they are paying for. And I know things were scaled back on them in terms of I guess there was a lack of lifeguards or whatever the situation was. Since then they gradually have been increasing the number of days. I guess it's now up to one day. It's suppose d to go to three days and ultimately four days. So I'm happy to see that that's happening . But, you know, it probably should never have happened in the beginning . We need to, you know, proper planning prevents poor perform ance I always say. So you know that the summer is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 ending. You know that you're going to lose college kids. You're going to lose high school kids to be able to be lifeguards in that facility . But yet, people have paid for this on top of paying their taxes. So I think it's important that we get that taken care of, get it staffed with lifeguards on a daily basis so we can meet our obligation to our citizen s. So that's important . Recently we received a letter from an individual . And I don't think they live in the City of Scranton , but they visit here often. It sounds like they know a lot about the city. In fact, I think that they watch these meeting s whoever this person is. And they complained about two things. One, they complain ed that we shouldn 't allow people to speak about national or state politics . You know, I don't know. It's -- everybody has their right to come up and have their five minutes to speak. I don't necessarily agree with that although I would prefer if people would focus on the things that we could actually focus on and work on as a City Council or at least have the ability to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 address . But the other one had to do with -- I guess this individual would come into town arrive at River Street exit there, Meadow Avenue, maybe stay at the Four Points or go down and stay at the Hilton or Radison . And they expressed concern about the weeds over growing , you know, like Meadow Avenue and River Street, signs, maybe political signs or signs about events happening that are long over or elections that have long gone by. And I agree. I've driven by there and I think it's important not only at River Street and Meadow Avenue but every entrance throughout our City. So I spoke to Larry West today who is, you know, kind of acting DPW Director . I asked him if we had a specific crew that was assigned to addressing those things but it was mention ed earlier , Mrs. Jeffries mentioned we have the Italian Festival here. We have the Electric City Flower Show. We have a half marathon . We have a marathon . We have a parade. We have people that are coming in and out of the City that are, you know, parents attending colleges -- the five college s that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 have in the City. There's people coming and going into the City. We want to leave a good impression about our City. I talked to Larry. They do not have a specific crew that's assigned to just doing those types of things, cleaning up, you know, the streets, weed whacking. That's a big issue. I told him if I could find an hour, hour and a half, I would be able to go down and weed whack and just address it, clean it up, make it look like we care. And I think that's important for we as citizens here in Scranton that, you know, I care about our City. I want it to look attractive . I want outside rs when they come to think, wow, this City is clean. It's well taken care of. So he told me that he would try to send a crew up there. And he does work with Parks and Rec and some of the people to help assist with some of those things. So I would like to see down the road that we actually develop -- I don't know -- a department within DPW that is strictly assigned to addressing those issues throughout our City to make sure that, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 know, weed whacking , garbage , these areas of entrance to our City and throughout the City could be addressed. And last thing I have, I mentioned something in caucus a couple weeks ago. It's something I still am interested in pursuing is some type of ordinance about an AED requiring business that have -- and I don't know what the exact number would be but requiring business at least have maybe 2, 300 capacity to require them to have and AED available . I mentioned at the caucus a few weeks ago that I was at a place where someone passed away. Someone died. And there was no AED available . I'm not saying that if the AED was there that the person would have lived. All I'm saying is that maybe, maybe they would, possibly . But I know that schools are required to have them and there is training involved with that. And I know the cost of them are extremely expensive . But I think it's something if we can -- I could ask our attorney , Attorney Gallagher , if we could look into something like that down the road I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 it would be beneficial and could possibly save lives down the road. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have a few. First, I'd like to start by thanking Mr. King for mentioning that letter. It was something that stuck out to me. I thought it was a good bit of outside criticism for someone visiting our city, maybe something that gets overlooked . But it was a good bit of construc tive criticism . To start off, I'm waiting on some answers from questions I posed last week. I did raise a lot of question s. So I'm waiting to hear some of the answers on those. Mr. Voldenberg , if we could -- since it was brought up in chamber s tonight , if we could just follow up on the street signs whether we're going to -- general update whether we're going to apply for more grants, if there's a plan moving forward and get an update on what was completed already and then where we're moving towards, so just a followup on last week's -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 MR. VOLDENBERG : I did, Mr. Schuster . Mr. West advised that they're in between . The operation is slowed. They're in between grants and that he would advise me this week. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you very much. Also, Nay Aug Pool, we were suppose d to have a meeting prior to our break to discuss Nay Aug Pool. That got sidetracked when we discussed the master plan. I again, agree with Mr. King's comment s tonight . A master plan would be -- I would like to see us go in that direction . But I do think we need to have a discussion about Nay Aug Pool. So if we could also reach out and see if we could get a discussion about Nay Aug Pool and the master plan, what's a timeline look for a pool project presentation and what's a master plan look like. So if we can reach out to the administration on that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Some of the things also following up on last week. I asked about outside groups that work with our City. I'm still waiting on an answer for what we do to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 vet outside groups that our City is working with. I'm also waiting to hear on, you know, what the administration sees as our relationship with neighborhood groups. Mr. King mentioned Robinson Park and the East Mountain Neighborhood Group. I know the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association met last night and just what is our relationship and how the administration views that relationship with these neighborhood groups, how they work together . I did get an answer from Mr. Coyne's question about administrative leave and the answer I received was three police officers , one person from the Fire Department and one DPW member that is suspended without pay. That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a couple here. First off, there was a complaint regarding a tree on the 1600 block of East Gibson Street where a branch had fallen on a nice day that wasn't windy at all and it was quite a large branch and over the years that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 branches have fallen from this tree and it was considered a hazard and previously marked to be torn down and hadn't been. So I just wanted to thank DPW for their quick response in taking that tree down. I think they finished the work on that yesterday . So I know the neighbor s were really appreciative of that. I wanted -- I had another complaint regarding a property that we brought up quite a while ago I think back in March. It was condemned due to being a nuisance property . That's at 510-512 Taylor Avenue. I received a complaint now that it's being rented out again. And they were suppose d to go through the process of being register ed as a rental and inspect ed. I'm just trying to find out if that's happened, if it's gone through that process if it's allowed to be rented out at this point, if the condemnation was lifted or not. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would be able to look into that property for me. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And regarding the use of Chick Feldman Field I would like to request additional updates on the utilization of that field by Lackawanna College . I believe they're working on an agreement in order to -- for Lackawanna College to use that. But I would like to see that agreement if it's completed or once it is. And I don't think that there is anything wrong with us as a city partnering with our -- with the local colleges . I see it as a positive that we have so many colleges here within the City. And, you know, we should see that as advantageous . But we also need to make sure that our property is taken care of and well maintained . So I certainly want to ensure that. And I received another complaint about 417-419 Harrison Avenue that they are continuing to leave their garbage out throughout the week and not bringing it back. So if that could be address ed. And I did receive a response there's a property on that 600 block of Prescott Avenue that I had asked if that was on the demo list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 and I was informed that it is on the next upcoming demo list. So I was happy to hear that. And I think that's everything that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I received two complaints about blight. I checked our Council report to see if they were either active or closed. So these are new ones. So one is 213 Prospect Avenue, serious blight. There's a pool falling over. There's downed trees. There's a porch off the back of the house falling down. I guess the neighbor hood groups have been talking about this. They reached out to the City and haven't had any luck. So please send correspondence to the proper authority for that one. And second one is the rear of 928 Capouse Avenue and Roche Court. The potholes created by the gas company need to be filled. The caller states that all the other streets in the surrounding area have been paved after the gas company dug them up. But they did not take care of Roche Court, which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 between Ash and Phelps and between Capouse and Wyoming . So, I mean, this is a common thing. We keep -- people keep coming to me and we keep bringing it up. There was something introduced in Third Order because the utility companies they claim that they pave curb to curb or they claim that they're going to pave wherever they make their repairs. It's not happening . So once again, please remind the proper department s to take a look at these two and, of course, the one that was -- we put in Third Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : So recess is over. So before recess we were promised a couple things. We were promised another meeting about the pool. And I could sympathize with Mr. King. He said he's here nine months and he's heard a bunch of, you know, different plans or the change of a plan or a master plan. I'm here 3 and a half years. I've seen the original plan, the plan, and then the changing of the plan and then now a master plan. So there's an old saying that I live by. If you fail to plan, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 you plan to fail. So the master plan I don't want to entertain it until we have a pool. We don't need a Dorney Park. We need a pool. We all agreed upon it three years ago when these meetings initially started . And then all of a sudden, there's a splash pad. And at this point I just want a pool, a multi-generation al pool and then maybe a baby pool because , guess what, we have a splash pad that's barely open half the time. I got more complaints about the beautiful splash pad at Novembrino that it's not consistently open. And also McDade Park, that pool's closing . And it's in great proximity of the City residents to utilize because there's going to be suppose dly a splash pad there. So please let's see where we're at with the plan. I mean, summer is over. We've exhausted another summer without any pool in sight. So I'm piggybacking with these two guys. Send correspondence . They got to come back and tell us what's going on. And also, we were promised someone from Rubicon to come in. All right? I know that two checks were just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 cut to pay them. We were told there is some data collection happening. But I need that confirmed to me because last year when this was presented to us I voted no for it because we were told it was going to -- million dollars in savings with redirection of the routes and these old cameras that were suppose d to collect data. I don't believe much data was collect ed. And we were told before recess they were going to come in. They did not. Then we were told after recess they were going to come in. MR. DONAHUE : I asked again for a date today just so you know. MR. MCANDREW : Well, I don't know. I know we keep asking. But they need to come in. We spent a lot of money and sometimes spending money doesn't save us money. They need to prove that, you know, checks -- the two checks we just cut for them are at least justified. And, oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Voldenberg , Pine Street. We've been talking about this all summer you and I. You've been doing a great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 job. And the issue of Pike Street there is multiple potholes . And they're dangerous . And they've been promise d to be paved for years -- I'm sorry, patched . The street has been promised to be paved for years. And I know you were in contact with OECD and DPW. And it's been confirmed , correct , that it's going to be on the paving schedule for next year. But these potholes need to be taken care of. They're very dangerous . And I know we're waiting for a tentative date. But it's been a couple months. So I think they should be able to have a date for us soon. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll firm up a date, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Please remind them. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just to touch on what Miss Jeffries brought up about the Lackawanna Avenue wall, the last time she brought this up I believe in July we sent correspondence . So a grant was awarded through the county Office of Economic and Community Development . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 So we sent correspondence -- Frank sent an e-mail to that department and we got a response back that the project was awarded in the amount of $351,000 in 2019. The delay in this project is that it's not nearly enough funding to accomplish the entirety of multimodal project presented which included movement of the bus stop from the dangerous curb, install ation of lighting and cross walk, installation of sidewalks where there are current ly none and demolition and repair of the retaining wall to include a setback that will allow the sidewalk s to be installed . At that time the estimates provided for costs of over $750,000 for the whole project . Lackawanna -- and it goes onto say Lackawanna County is willing to and wishes to initiate a transfer of this awarded contract to the City of Scranton for you to apply for the additional needed funding as we had written and submitted these application s as a courtesy in the spirit of working together . So once we got this response , Mr. Voldenberg forwarded this along to Larry West and also the OECD Department . I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 believe we've gotten a response yet, have we? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, sir. MR. DONAHUE : So would we be able to follow up on that tomorrow and see where they're at in terms of applying for funding the rest of that project ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did receive an acknowledge ment, not a timeframe . I'll follow up. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. I mean, that was over six weeks ago. So we could see where they're at yet. Miss Schumacher , I want to get clarification on the answer and then the institute for public policy on where you're seeing that. I just want to be able to reference something when I try to get an answer. And then on 8-A why is this taking so long, so from my understanding in the past before this was even -- before a new zoning law ordinance was even sent to Council , there would be public hearing s, public meeting s involving the planning board, so on and so forth. That did not happen. So the first time anyone saw this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 including us was when we got it. So this Council -- we've been trying to be open to have discussion s with different neighborhood groups and different organization s that might have some interest there. And we're trying to find middle ground. So that's why it's taking so long. In the past, I guess, from what I was told when it was done 30 years ago that they took over a year to taking in public comment and trying to work out these things. That's what we're trying to do. We're not just going to jam it down anyone's throat. I mean, these are going to have long-term implication s on a lot of these neighborhoods . So we're trying to find middle ground. That doesn't mean we're going to jam anything through . We're trying to have a conversation and see if, you know, there could be something figured out where everyone might not be happy but they might be acceptable to it. And I think that's the goal here is to try to see if -- because this is going to affect us all. So we want everyone to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 involved in it. And that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

So when the time comes we'll have that conversation . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I'll just echo those sentiments as well. It was mentioned I believe last week.
