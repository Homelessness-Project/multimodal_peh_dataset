MR.

KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I don't have an announce ment. It was something that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 mentioned the other week. But starting this week September 28th through October 7th will be the Scranton Fringe Festival . And so that's our annual performing arts festival . It's something really unique to our area. And it's a great thing that we have here. So if you are interested in going to any of the shows or checking out what they have to offer during that time you could go to the Scranton fringe.org and they'll have more information there and a schedule of shows. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : In addition to the moment of silence we just had for Inspector Joseph Hoban, my thought s and prayers go out to the family. Joe was well known not only in the fire service but equally in the EMS service . He's was appointed to the fire department on May 26, 1989, promote d to Chauffeur in 1993, promoted to Lieutenant in 1996 and spent much of his time as Lieutenant at Rescue Company 1, C-shift. He was promoted to the rank of Fire Inspector in 10 of '21. Joe was one of the only handful of firefighters in recent history 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 to be awarded the Medal of Honor as a result of his actions during a fire at 821 West Locust Street on 12/30/2000. He found a victim and was able to remove him to the front porch. Once the victim was out of the structure , Joe immediately began emergency medical care. Rest in peace, Inspector Hoban. And that is all I have. Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you for that, Mr. McAndrew . May he rest in peace and thank him for his many years of service to our city. A week this Sunday, October 8th will be the 26th running of the Steamtown Marathon which will begin at Forest City High School at 8:00 a.m. and finish right in front of Lackawanna County Courthouse here on North Washington Avenue. We have close to 1,000 runners coming in from 35 states, 5 countries -- I've been the race director for the past 26 years but never could have been able to achieve that without the cooperation and the expertise of our huge number of volunteers from the 14 different communities , two different counties , including fire, police, medical assistance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 along the route. And we're thrilled to have these runners come into our city and really have a great weekend and see everything that Northeastern Pennsylvania has to offer. They will be doing a lot of running along the rails and trails. I would just ask if people could be a little patient on Sunday morning , October 8th as the runners are travelling , you know, through all 14 communities and finishing in downtown Scranton . We do have lots of volunteers helping to feed vehicles across the course as there's gaps. And we're proud to say that we've raised 2.3 million dollars so far for the children and young adults at St. Joseph's Center. And we're hoping to raise a little bit more again this year for St. Joe's. So that's all I have at this time. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have actually one or two things to add. I also wanted to give my condolences to Inspector Hoban's family and we appreciate all that he did for the fire department for so many years and for the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 And I also want to say may he rest in peace. But I had one other thing that I'd also wanted to add which is going to be taking place at Nay Aug Park this weekend . And that's going to be the Honey Bee and Harvest Festival that the Greenhouse Project runs. It's really cute. They do, like, a bee parade for the children so kids can dress up. And that all starts off at 12 and runs for a few hours during the day, so just another event going on this weekend that I wanted to mention . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . December 16th this year will mark the 7th anniversary of the sale of the sewer system. And when that happened , the city became responsible for stormwater management. Over the years I've seen a lot of publicity about other initiatives , the pool at Nay Aug, the walkability study, the Serrenti Center, on and on. But it seems that the Sewer Authority and the stormwater management were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 kind of we'll have a study but it's not really a high priority . And I wonder what would have happened this month if we had stormwater management seven years ago. It was the city's responsibility . It would be nice to see members of the administration at Sewer Authority meetings . You remember the Sewer Authority , you know, it's the authority that would not die. They're still out there trying to get their easements completed . They are also the holdup on the 2022 audit I'm told. They don't care. I mean, they don't answer to anybody . They don't answer to the Mayor. And they don't answer to you. And they don't answer to the voters. Having said that, let's raise stormwater management to a very high priority because the rains aren't going to stop this year. It's going to keep raining . And those people that are trying to recover from all of that damage, they're going to have a wonderful time. And for all we know, these storms 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 are going to get more frequent and more severe as time goes on. With that in mind I would like to make a suggestion . I raised it last week. I raise it again. In '63 my parents lost their home to a mine cave. It was condemned on the spot. The only home of five condemned that way. And so we were homeless for the next seven months. And but for -- it took five years before we were bought out. And for five years we had to pay property taxes, okay, for a property that we couldn't even enter. Now, you know, that's water over the dam so-to-speak. I would hope that you as a taxing authority , the city, Scranton School District and the county would offer a break to these people whose homes are going to be condemned , who are going to have to wait on a buyout. They should not have to have insult added to injury by having to pay property taxes on property that is of no use to them. Even those people who are going to try to repair their homes, they're going to take a severe financial hit. And if you think the insurance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 companies are not going to try to evade their responsibility to pay claims, well, you got another thought coming because they will. So please help these families out. Give them a break because it's the right thing to do. On the 4 million dollar general obligation note, will you please in Third Order next week publish this new financial data because the current backup -- background you put last week is out of date. It's not 4.65 percent interest rate. It's 4.85 percent . It's not an eight-year note. And it's not a 40-year note. It's a nine-year note and amortization schedule is now available so you could publish that. 5-B, the comprehensive evaluation of operation s, that's a very interesting thing. They talk about all kinds of things like space utilization . Is that a code word for buying the Fidelity Bank next door? I think it is. I think, you know, this is not a completely exhaust ive list that captures the spirit of the project . I'd say that, you know, most of the terminology in the backup is deliberate ly vague 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 because I think that is one of the things that is trying to go forward with this $110,000 is to justify expansion next door. So you take a hard look at that. And I would like love to see the firefighter s' contract on the website . It's been 175 days since that was done. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is I would like to make a comment about the first speaker and just add something to what she said because I think it's important for the resident s of Scranton to understand why they had flooding in the city or what may have contributed to it. The State of Pennsylvania has been removing small dams that were used to control water flow. And so in their unwilling ness to repair these dams or replace them, they've removed them which helps to let the water come to lower points much quicker causing flooding and a lot of other problems . So I really think that a lack of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 participation by people and a lack of being informed on what's being taking place in your government has caused grave harm to people and it will continue to do that as long as you don't vote and you don't pay attention . And to be honest with you, you only have yourself to blame, okay. There was even a loss of life in the last episode and our government just isn't function ing on any level whatsoever . And sooner or later the public is going to realize that they're just the guys paying all the bills. And the people you elect could care less about anything that has to do with you. We can just go back to the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority where a Council president who didn't agree with the sale put it on the agenda and then how the reserve fund was looted. And to be honest with you, we don't need another authority in the City of Scranton . And we don't need to combine with a group to create an authority . We need to start electing people to government that could to do their job and actually run a city whether it's DPW, you know, whatever it is. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 The stormwater system needs to go right back to where the Scranton Sewer Authority was going to take it. The city now needs to build a plant to process the stormwater and build retention ponds. And the city needs to do that on its own. We need to stop creating authorities because they don't answer to anybody . They just enslave everyone and stick us with a ton of debt. And as you could see in the last week's agenda, I noticed we've lost another court case, just money, just like heaving it out the window. You know, I just feel sorry for the resident s that we have been so poorly represented in my whole lifetime . And, you know, we could hold caucuses here. We could pretend this government is function ing for us but it's really not. I mean, just take a look at our federal government. Every taxpayer owes $260,000 for the national debt. And we've got people crossing our borders that aren't citizen s that are gobbling up tons of money. And it doesn't help the average citizen . And the president is violating all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 the laws and the oath he took as president to secure the border and a host of other things. And people just don't care. And it's not just a Democrat ic issue because the Republicans haven't tried to remove him for not living up to his Oath of Office. Our country is a complete mess and a complete free fall. You know, I'm really discussed that the American people don't care. And we look at our area hospitals . Who stepped in to do something about that? You know, they suspended the surgeon at the hospital I was talking about because they lost another patient . Our healthcare system is collapsed . And the last thing I have to say here is, Mr. King, I asked you a long time ago how the board was appoint ed at ECTV. And I hope at the next meeting you will share how that board was appointed and how they got their position s on that board and what role the city played because probably by next week I'll be at the federal courthouse filing my -- whatever you want to call it, my brief, whatever you want to call it with the federal court because I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 going to take ECTV there. And I'm going take a lot more people there and -- if I can. And I just hope that whoever their attorney is, they're ready for what's going to happen. And I may lose but at least I'm going to be there. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Once again rumors are swirling around the Hotel Sheridan on Meadow Avenue, specifically it's being used as a location to house migrants . As of early Friday, the rumor includes both the hotel and Wittier No. 2 school being used. You're aware -- the question has been asked several times with regard to the hotel issue. The hotel was recently and had a name change ANZ, which they probably advertised with political style yard signs decorating the curb line. ANZ is not a hotel. They run globally as a hostile providing long-term stay accommodations . Do our current zoning laws address hostel and long-term accommodations ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Does changing the identity to a long-term accommodation circumvent hotel rules, whereas a hotel has certain restricts regarding by, who, and how they can be inspect ed and regulated opposed to a hostel which is a long-term stay. Does a long-term stay allow for illegal immigrant s to be housed there since it's not a hotel? Has our city ordinance been revised to protect our city from being inundated with illegal immigrants so that they may not circumvent the rules we have on the books? I would ask that this body investigate and take the appropriate action so that the Mayor and her administration must adhere to the laws that we have on our books. On June 27th, a resident asked are we a sanctuary city. I will ask for clarification for the record, are we a sanctuary city? Secondly , I asked about the vetting process for the homeless using Weston Field. Did we receive clarification for that issue yet? In addition , who's monitoring their use and who respond s when there is an issue? Where are we at with the water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 testing study? Again, my neighborhood , water has been brown on two separate occasions this week. With a properly function ing water filtration system, this should not be occurring . This is a health issue. It should be standard monthly or at the very least quarterly testing citywide. Can we please have an update on the Serrenti Center? When can the public tour the facility and will the homeless people also be given vouchers to use this particular facility ? Can I present some pictures ? The first one is a stop work order. You could barely read the writing and you'll see several misspelled words. And, you know, when you go to court, a lot of times when you misspell and you put something wrong, you lose a case. I mean, if you are in that -- the workers -- if you're in code enforcement , you should know how to spell demolition and demolish and certain things. Another one is a fire ravaged home in the 1500 of West Gibson, another one is 614 North Lincoln, fire ravaged . It's been sitting that way for months. Another one is -- I believe it's 634 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 North Sumner Avenue. There's a house behind all of that. The other one is Weston Field, the pool complex . If that was on any one of our properties , you know what would happen. So why is the city any different ? Thank you for your time. Have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you Mr. Argenta . Mr. Voldenberg , after Council takes a look at some of these picture s, I would ask that if -- I'm going to ask you to forward these down to code enforcement and ask them to visit these properties and take the appropriate action. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. Len Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Len Srebro, Keyser Valley flood victim. I guess nobody listened to me last week when I suggest ed that, you know, be reasonable about the time with the caucus. You know, and I was told that at that time that you guys have jobs that you, you know, you have to finish work. What about our time? You know, a lost of us, like I said, are elderly and to be out this late. Another thing, you know, if you are going to have these long caucuses , well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 then how about having them on another day? Give us a break, you know. So the flooding , you know, talking to people about what they heard the reason for the flooding was once again the pump house wasn't working . I understand people were told that it was a belt that something happened to the belt. Jeez, I'm a mechanic , you know, and go get another belt. What's the big deal? But I also talked to somebody from flood control that morning and I was told that it blew a seal. You know, so we still don't have a working pump house, you know, to get the water out. They had to bring in portable pumps. And right now the pump house, you know, if it rains like it's suppose d to Friday, you know, it's unbelievable that all the residents -- now you just hear the possibility of any kind of rain and you start freaking out automatically . You know, how about getting this pump house ready for the next flood which is inevitable . You know, and I don't understand , they put a new pump in after the flood on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 19th. Was that a new pump or a used pump? I'd like to know that. And being a mechanic I want to know what kind of warranty you got on it that they installed that pump and it didn't work for this past flood. You know, I want to know these things. Another thing too when I learned that we were going to get another storm, I called DPW. I left a message . I spoke to so many people with flood control around the area. And I asked for five to seven sandbags that I know the flood waters that, jeez, if I put them on the corner where the water eventually comes over the curb I could redirect the flood waters to the middle of the street instead of, you know, going onto people's property next to mine and washing out their basement . Nobody -- four different people I talked to from flood control and DPW, nobody would bring sandbags. And sure enough the most recent flood came and they got their basement washed out again. I think there should be some kind of an emergency number for DPW. It seems like these floods only come on the weekend s. But they only have regular business hours. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 You know, how about if it's so much problems with the caucus and the residents saying what they need to say, you know, why can't you guys come to us? Why can't we have a meeting about the flood only situation at the Keyser Valley Community Center? You know, why can't you guys come to us for a change, you know, and we could discuss this, you know, like the residents want to say. And, you know, I have to get in the habit anymore when people ask me how much water did you get, Len? And I say I didn't get any. I got mud. You know, that's the worst part of the cleanup afterward s. And I know living there 12 years I know where all of this problem is coming from. I still don't understand why, you know, I'd love to talk to engineers how they come up with their study. You know, why don't you have an engineer here at the caucus or else at the meeting s to speak to the residents here? You know, I'd love to talk to an engineer . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. MR. SREBRO: You know, I always do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 it in five minutes . Can't you give me one more minute? MR. KING: I did give you extra -- I did give you extra time, Mr. Srebro. You were well beyond your five minutes . MR. SREBRO: We see how you are. MR. KING: I'm just trying to be fair. Ron Ellman, please. MR. ELLMAN: All right, Council , I'm going to try to stay by this and not get carried away. You all might remember that I complained about my brother in Memphis losing his insurance and being -- this was March 26th immediately being thrown out of the hospital that day. He had kidney failure and one leg was giving him all kinds of trouble with a blood clot and so forth. His social worker tried to get his insurance back but that -- that must take forever , you know. He was so sick he went back dozen of times to four or five different hospitals in Memphis and Mississippi . Memphis got part of Mississippi and Arkansas if you know where it is in the corner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 there. He went to the hospitals in that section . One time he was so sick the landlady put him in an ambulance and sent him. He was there for three hours. They didn't see him. They put him in a cab and sent him home. That's what's happened in America , people. Here's a man that worked -- when he was 12, 13 he cut grass in our neighborhood . He's worked and worked and worked all of his life until last January when he got sick. And they take away his insurance . The Biden administration needs it for all of this trash that is coming in. You see it in the paper every day, millions . You are going to wonder where the Medicare and Social Security went. That's where it's going. Last year when my brother was -- when my son was sick and he died at Geisinger , I was there in the waiting room on and off for about two weeks talking to different people. I met one of them -- now, listen, you people need to get in your car if somebody don't believe me, go down to Moosic and turn left on 502. You go out where the river is. There is railroad tracks just a little tiny 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 ways off the intersection -- the businesses . You'll see about 100 maybe more illegals camped there. I've been there. I've talked to them. I talked to them in the hospital . I talked to them at the convenient store where they go. They got money from something . They are very unhappy down there now that it's getting cold. I haven't been there since summertime . But when I was at the hospital talking they -- this one jokingly said what a nice neighborhood . They enjoy the big houses there. They'll make that neighborhood look like Capouse Avenue in no time. And they have nowhere to go except Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. It's a shame. It's a shame. These people have brought every disease known to man into America . There's polio at New York State. There's VD all over this country that nobody wants to talk about unless you talk to someone in the medical field. As far as I'm concerned , Biden's policies murdered my brother just as plain as if they put a gun to his head taking away his insurance and having no care whatsoever . This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 was needless . I talked to his wife this afternoon at 3:00. She's in a nursing home with MS. She'll never leave there. She has nobody but me and Rosie to converse with. No husband . That's the America that Biden turned this into. And I thank you for letting me be up here. And Paige needs to think about that garbage down at Moosic because they are going to move someplace and you sure don't want them for neighbors . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident taxpayer . Okay, first of all, on the pension loss still; and I'd just love to hear about a caucus on that. And if necessary , how we can reform it that we stop losing massive amounts of money when there isn't a large stock market disruption in a year. That's unconscionable . And it should be well before we set next year's budget because if something doesn't change and it probably won't, the minimum monthly obligation will go up. Now, I spoken about water. And the bill is unGodly. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 gone up again. My basic water bill is up to 120 bucks a month for two people, no family there, no watering plants. Nothing . Well, I looked at my electric bill, and it's up about 30 percent from last year. And even worse yet I use 30 percent less electricity than I did in August of last year. I have been cutting back on my air conditioning . I use it in one room about two hours. And these bills just keep going up with our lack of regulation . I mean, it's really -- it's putting the squeeze on things. And it's almost infuriating . Well, it is infuriating . I was on the phone with a rant to PPL. It's just ridiculous . We have to stop -- it has to stop. It has to stop somewhere . I don't really consider the PUC as a very good regulatory agency anymore. And those situations have to be regulated . By the way, if you ever did lose your power or your water because of inability to pay, your house is immediately condemnable . So it's something to think about. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 I never bought into that fixed income. I worked for seven years for a company that even stole money out of my 401k on my last job -- my 201K. They didn't pay into it themselves . They just didn't turn the money over. Talk about -- and once again, I would like to reiterate 501 C3s and C4s which that ties in with our water, please stay out of political policies , Scranton . You're a guest. And you're not paying the bill. You're not paying the taxes that it takes to run the city and you may think you're intelligent and you are very well educated , but, you know, a car mechanic doesn't make a good English teacher and an English teacher doesn't make a good car mechanic . That's all there is to it. Swim pool repairs, repairs first not plans to rebuild everything from the ground up. Grout was mentioned by someone else here. And it's a very effective way of repairing a great big crack. And it's just we don't have the kind of money with all of these other things facing us. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 As far as domestic threats and harassment , people be advised you could call somebody on the phone and make a threat. But if you are found out, the government in all areas municipal are getting tired of it and somebody is going to wind up -- somebody 's going to wind up -- people are going to start getting arrested and then they're crying about it. Poor me, I was just drinking some beer. Walkability quickly , I will mention once again Mattis Avenue was designated as a bike path. And it's a parking area for General Dynamics . They were down here years ago over meters being put there that only took two hours a coin. Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Good evening , Council . There's a problem with Scranton Housing Authority . It's supposed to be a HUD landlord following the rules of HUD which are notarized in the law of the lease from CFR 24966. All the rules there are broken. They aren't keeping records of the 25 correspondences I sent to them. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 they're -- it's being run by criminal prosecutors . I mean, that is exactly what Karl Lynott was for 14 years and his henchman that he hired David Coyne who evicted me twice in the magistrate court. There's no records of the magistrate court. There's just no records . I've been over there 20 times. I've talked to everybody . There's no record that Scranton Authority took me to the magistrate court. There's records of the people that appealed it, you know, who avoided eviction but nothing with the magistrate court. I went to the Sunshine Act meeting . I have been trying to go to Scranton Housing Authority meetings for years. Every time I go there the door is locked. Last time I went it happened to be open. And I go in there and they're having a vote on the new executive director to replace (inaudible ) I believe his name is -- and it's Karl Lynott. I've written so many letters to Karl Lynott. I've had meetings with Karl Lynott. They confiscated my stuff for over three years now and there's no resolution of it. You know, sometimes they unlock the door, sometimes they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 don't, you know. Originally -- because they have so many tenant people in the building that cover up what they're doing. I mean, they were piling sheetrock in front of my storage area and then they broke the lock on my storage area. I called the police. And the police are just laughing with the guy in the maintenance , the same guy that let the Lackawanna County Sheriff in because I was -- I haven't seen my kid since she was eight. And these people are directly responsibile for that. And there is something really wrong here with their legal thing because now their legal counsel is, you know, Shannon blah, blah, blah, Doherty . The same law firm that handles the school board. And they're telling me in the right to know -- they're accusing me of harassment just for asking who works there. And they never did give me an answer through the right to know. And I went to the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of Common Pleas says, well, you already got your answer. Well, I don't have my answer. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 for years I lived there. There was a fire there once or twice a week. It seems to me the City of Scranton should look -- and it stopped suddenly when I started , like, complaining about it. But, you know, they have this vote. And there is suppose dly a tenant guy. I've been asking for years. There is no tenant person and all of a sudden I'm at this Sunshine meeting which they cancelled out the legal part of it. We're doing the legal part in the executive session because I think because I was there. And Karl Lynott, you know, made more false accusations against me. I'm just trying to live. And it's totally improper to have all of these prosecutors just evicting people when they are controlling all the police and everything . And there has to be a right to know that comes from this body and to who works there, who works there, you know, because they have this vote with the tenant guy. And the tenant guy doesn't even live there. You know, I looked that up. I know I'm out of time. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. That exhausts the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard by Council ? MS. O'HARA: Hi. Lori O'Hara, how are you doing? I had a couple things that I wanted to talk about tonight . But I was listening to -- I'm going to call him Mr. Mulfehan . And I did speak with him out in the hallway . And in listening to him I kind of understand what he's talking about because I'm also concerned about a lot of the prevention aspects of things, especially where homeless is concerned . I did go to a meeting a while ago because it was listed in the paper on August 9th. And it was about the funding for all kinds of programs including public assistance services . And then it said if you have any questions or anything to offer to show up. It didn't make much sense to me. They were just talking about regular numbers . So, first of all, safety, first, second and always, I taught gymnastic s and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 every summer camp we would play that film safety first, second, and always. And what it is, what it is an awareness of catastrophic results if rules are not applied . So some of the rules of safety are developed through foundation al development of basic skills to support a transit ion to a larger and higher risk skills. And the reason I bring this up is, I believe if we can have a foundation on the ground with the homeless encampment s that it would provide a better transition to living as a productive and contributing member of society . So if as resident s who pay taxes and live by rules, why should the homeless be exempt from rules and laws? I believe that when the subject of who is responsible and who has jurisdiction and whose land is it and this one is going to call that one and then none of that helps with the homeless and the residents are keeping the city safe. So in light of the nature to care about people and seeing so much online with hardships within the city and paying more attention now to Council meetings , etc., you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 know, it's very hard to see the deterioration of my once wonderful city. You know, I went to high school here. My brothers went to high school here. My parents , we all graduated from Central . And just walking around it's not the same. It's hard. And I have an idea. And it's visionary and it's long term and it's developing and it's inclusive and it's community across the board. It's an initiative that could possibly be an answer in part and bring collective agencies truly together for the common good all of people regardless of beliefs . It's a development of community between the homeless community and the residential community . I have a daughter that I lost to fentanyl on these streets in 2018. And none of that has let up since. I have another daughter that's still living within the city and I have absolute real fear for her every time she's outside at a certain time of night. I've asked people if I'm not around to keep an eye on her. I mean, like, it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 scarey. It's so different than when we were able to walk the streets . So what I would like to do is to -- so how do we get there? There is video program s being utilize d to help homeless in similar areas. And it's basically out of California . And my interpretation would be something like a rehabilitation homeless camp. The first thing you would have to do since they are where they are that you would need to meet them on the ground. And then you could do something like run it like a campground where you have rules and you have structure . And you get agreements from landowners, you know, so you don't have it's his land. It's my land. It's the other land, and then incorporate campground rehab type style rules. And there has to be rules and structure because he was speaking about structure . And that's all preventative . And you can't have drugs or alcohol . Your campsite has to be clean and tidy for inspections , etc., because if it's not their land, then they could go unless they want to play by rules. And if you make your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 homeless encampment more of a rehabilitative type encampment , then that word is going to get out because right now it's a free-for-all in Scranton . Every drug dealer is here. And they're having a good time at the expense of lives. Again, I have a dead daughter . I have mothers that I know that are friends that have two children that are dead. I have another mother that will never hear the word mom again. So it's serious . And we need to, like, really get into this stuff. If you want to have these program s and do all of this stuff, then let's do it. Get on the ground, set up camps, get permissions . Do whatever you have to do. Find the funding . You'll be funding for receptacles . You'll be funding for porta potties. You'll need funding for security , lighting , designated areas, applications . And they can't live for free. They get to volunteer their services because somebody has to (inaudible ) somewhere . And if you have an application form, you could pinpoint like he was saying what it is they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 need, where it is you could start, how they could help, establish a three strike rule. I was in rehab. You screw up, they pack your bag. They take you to the bus station . You're done. You don't get to have a free-for-all. And that's what's happening around here. There's too much just going crazy. And you can't move one from here and then one from there and expect something to get done. And if it's private land, get the permissions . MR. KING: Thank you, Miss O'Hara. MS. O'HARA: Okay. MR. KING: Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , we should feel blessed that a once in a lifetime water event happened again. It must be a miracle as no one could have foretold that we did not have a 100 years to fix this. Last week Mr. King was asked how many letters did you send out to people who should be donating -- the Mayor sent out that should be donating to the pilot program . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Mr. King directed to Mr. Voldenberg to get right on asking that question . It reminded me that well before this body went onto a break in August, I had the same thing. I asked how many letters had been sent out, to whom and how many were responded to. What happened to that prior request of well over a month or two months ago? It wasn't responded to or followed up on. Can you explain why City Council on its request for information when it puts forward is being told to go back to the citizen and tell them to put a right to know in or a 311? As far as I know, you put in the request . You are not required by law to do either of those processes . When a citizen asks it's one thing. But when Council asks on behalf of a citizen , Council is asking for that information . Why is Council allowing this pushback? I heard explained in the room that the head of Council went to the Mayor and conspired -- oh, let me change that because it might be a bit harsh, asked the Mayor if they could please stop forcing Council to appoint 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 directors and waivers retrospectively . The Mayor after obvious concern in how she was putting forth and the violations through decided to stack the deck and Mr. King returned and said she would at that point put in an interim appointment to avoid conflict . Only Mr. McAndrew paused to say that concept seems wrong. I don't know if anyone asked the solicitor as it was a legal question , but that may be an opinion that some people don't want to hear. The Mayor does have the authority to appoint an interim director level position . They could hold the office for 45 days. But nowhere in the body does it allow the appointment to be retrospective by backdating or even an interim being appoint ed without Council 's approval . The interim appointment is now being used as a direct attempt to circumvent the charter and separation of powers. Mr. King brought forth a statement from the administration . If I can't just appoint it, then I'll put it forward as an interim . The intent is clear. As for interim 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 appointments made prior and all those emergencies , maybe we can get a list from HR of when a new director or emergency position is filled. Was there a letter of resignation or notice given and provide those dates to Council so they know when that employee actually left. But I doubt you'll get that. Sometimes I feel like coming to Council and speaking for change in government is like a one-arm bandit. You step up to it, put your money in, pull the handle and you watch the dial spin, click, click, click. I lost. Then I come back here to next Council session . I put in another coin. I pull that level, click, click, click. We lost. And people coming to this body are tired because when we come up here to speak we keep feeding that one-arm bandit over and over again. And we keep getting the same result of not getting heard of getting pushed off and ignored in a lot of the situations . I think prospective laws are a danger to the way this body works. There's a separation of power for a reason. And there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 a reason why the Mayor and appointments has to come to this body before appointments . An interim in the verbiage of it does not exclude anywhere that City Council does not have authority over interim appointments . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? VICTORIA : Hi, Victoria (inaudible ), Scranton resident . So there's an issue that I've noticed . I commute around the city for work. And I keep coming across the one intersection at Hickory Street and South Washington Avenue. The road's been paved over a year ago. And there is no lines drawn on the road, nor is there signs designating who is going which way in which lane. So there used to be like a left turning lane I believe and a straight and right turning lane. Now, I've gone straight myself in both lanes. I'm getting honked at on both sides. So I was just wondering if we could get some lines painted and some signs put up. And that's all I got. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , can you contact DPW and see if that could be addressed ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll send it in the morning . MR. KING: Thank you very much. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton city taxpayer . I know it's getting late so I'll try to be brief. Last week one of my friends was biking home from work. She can't afford a car so she bikes to work every day to and from. It's not just healthy but it's a good way commute . And she was ran over by a car thrown head first onto the pavement and is now disabled . She's been disfigured. Her arms are broken. She can't work anymore for the time being. And this leaves her wife and child living off her disability check. Now, this just highlight s that while accidents happen, they can be mitigated . The fact that everyone here is relying on cars as their only form of transportation and it's considered to be the only legitimate form of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 transportation and is by far and away the only safe form of transportation really puts an undue burden on our community and our citizens . And taking measures to improve public safety such as the walkability initiative you guys moved through two weeks ago which I believe includes bike lanes is really, really important for our city going forward for our residents to stay safe, to stay healthy and to stay happy. It's also very important because a lot of senior citizens are reluctant to give up their driver's license because then they lose their independence . And in an area with a very large geriatric population , being able to give people the opportunity to not rely on their car for independence once they reach an age where driving might not be safe anymore or for people who it never was, people who have physical conditions including blindness or even seizures , people who can't drive. So alternative modes of transportation , biking, walking and, of course, the train will give people a safe way to travel consistently and not just in their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 neighborhood s but also without . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Delmar. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few tonight . First, I'd like to start off by expressing condolences to Mr. Hoban's family, to his friends and to the rest of the Scranton Fire Department . A couple things from last week, one of the questions I had asked Mr. Voldenberg was about the University of Scranton rental properties and if the city is pursuing this through our rental ordinance . I didn't see that on the list of answers that we got back but if we can pursue that again. MR. VOLDENBERG : We're awaiting those answers , sir. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Also, someone came up at public comment and asked about the vouchers over at Weston Field and that was another inquiry that I had. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 can we look into whether the city is providing voucher s for the homeless to use Weston Field facilities ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. A commenter brought it up tonight about employees and when they leave. In Third Order tonight in going through some of those pension meeting minutes , it does seem we lost five employee s that Council was unaware of until I read through those minutes. But five employees have now left the city -- city employment . I did get back some answers to some questions . I could read through some of them, but I don't think I'll do all of them. But so a question I had on the pump house last week, so Council man Schuster asked questions regarding the pump house in Keyser Valley. Was the pump house on Merrifield Avenue turned on at the time of rain event? Did the pump house perform as expected during the flood event? Further , does the DPW maintain 24/7 callout crew for such emergencies ? Council is interested in clarifying the performance and process of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 pump during our flood event. The answer that I received was, it is believed and therefore averred that these question s were answered during the caucus approximately 10 days ago and can be address ed again at another caucus, if necessary . So my recollection of that event was that Miss Cipriani and the Mayor were not aware of the pump house and they were going to look into and get back to us. So I don't believe those questions were answered during the caucus. We've had rain in the last days. And one thing I'll say is the rain that we had wasn't extraordinary . It was a regular rain event. And Merrifield Avenue then again flooded up to a level that I've never seen in regular rain. So we got some more answers tonight than we had in the past. They said it was a belt. I heard during public comment it might have been a seal. I'm not sure what it was, but I didn't get a straight answer on the workings of the pump house in Keyser Valley which does protect I'd say 30 to -- well, 20 to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 30 homes in that area. Another answer I got I asked for probably three to four weeks in a row this Bread Basket PA. Again, I said they probably do great things. They receive d a grant that is coming through our community center funds. I disagree with the fact that it is a grant as it was a line item in the budget. But the answer I got was that the bread basket works out of one of our community centers . I got a copy and paste answer two weeks in a row of the same thing. And then today I did get a more substantial answer. And it was a list of the seven places where this group works out of. None of them were community centers. But the answer I was given was, attached please find a list of location s for Bread Basket of NEPA. We don't know how else to answer these questions and do not want to offend Councilman Schuster by copying and pasting prior answers . None of these locations were community centers in the city. So I do not know why they are receiving community center funds. I'll stop at that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I had concern I wanted to bring forward from someone I spoke with earlier who said that there is some drug activity going on at the Martz station . And I wanted to forward that along to the Scranton Police as well as the Colts for them to investigate the concern . And I could get more detailed information to send along with it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And on the subject of Colts, I also wanted to go back to something that I brought up I think it was a couple months ago. And we had received a response from them. There were a couple things that they were looking -- that the person I spoke to was looking for including , like, the addition of a stop on Lackawanna Avenue so that it's closer to some of the medical facilities within the marketplace . And the concern -- the response we gotten back was that they hadn't discussed that yet. And that was something that they -- that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 they would bring forward and look into further , but we never had any followup . So if we could talk to them about a followup and see if there is anything that resulted from those questions . I think they also wanted to see if we could put any sort of signage along Lackawanna Avenue outside of the Martz station to make it safer for them to make a left turn out of there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. DR. ROTHCHILD : Great. Thank you. That's all that I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I'm going to respond to the question s that I got answers for from last week. So last week I brought up the concern that's been brought to me about contractors working on the weekend s without permits . All right. It's not fair. We all get it and it might not be safe either. So the answer we received is, administration has heard Councilman McAndrew 's allegation s, concern s about contracting practices and is looking into the same. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 that's the only response I got about that. So new stuff, you know, for the past few weeks the Mayor and the city's administration have been actively trying to replace a Housing Authority board member, Magistrate Terry Gallagher that has one year left on his appointment . Last week we pulled the replacement employment legislation to then receive a letter from the city's legal department that we have 30 days to reintroduce. So this week we decided to introduce it again. And at the end of business yesterday , we were authorized like we need their authorization from the city's legal department to pull this appointment from the agenda along with some type of legal jujutsu stating that they still could send replacement legislation at any time. It's easy math here. Magistrate Gallagher 's first five-year appointment was in 1984. His current appointment ends in 2024. Five times eight equals forty. Mr. Voldenberg , would you please send correspondence to the Mayor and the city's legal department asking one simple question , are they going to honor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Magistrate Gallagher 's remaining year of his appointment ? Also, maybe we could have Rubicon , they're our numbers experts since they stated last week they really don't have anything going on until January with their third rollout in two years to go over there to the city's legal department and give them a math lesson, five times eight equals forty. Next, so during last week's meeting it was made mention of vouchers being issued to Scranton 's homeless populations for the Weston Field shower areas. I believe it was stated by someone here that the homeless people utilizing these voucher s were being vetted. I receive d a call right after the meeting from one of the lovely ladies that is a member of Weston Field. These ladies were not made aware of any of this and have grave concern s. They are between the ages of 55 and 89 and utilize this facility in a therapeutic rehabilitative way along with a social aspect. These ladies have been getting the runaround for over a year with inconsistent swim times and days along with no set schedule 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 in the absence of lifeguard s and broken promises . I could verify it because I have been -- they've been bringing it up for a year. Do they sympathize with the homeless and their struggles ? Yes. I sympathize too with the homeless and their struggles . But I sympathize right now more with these ladies that have, you know, they've worked their whole lives. They call me all the time. They pay their taxes and pay their membership fees. And to not even be told that they would be sharing locker and shower areas with no notice to them as paying members is not good policy. And it's providing them zero courtesy . So they have valid questions , Mr. Voldenberg , how and if they are really being vetted. Number two, with the uptick of Covid, are they all fully vaccinated ? Is that part of the vetting process ? Who is checking them in and tending to them while they're there? Why can't there be a schedule for this after the swim schedule ? So is there a way to schedule it where, you know, they have -- they pay their membership in, they do their swim time and their therapeutic and their exercise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 piece and then, you know, rotate that with the homeless that are using the facilities . And a final question , how long are these vouchers good for, a day, a week, a month? So if you could please forward them question s I would greatly appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : All right. Number three, a few resident s came to me -- so to piggyback on that, residents ask Council to advise on what vetting process is used for the homeless population that are allowed to stay and use the Weston Field facility . The answer we got back because this was posed last week is, please stay tuned for an answer to this question . I don't know what that means. That's usually like a news break or something . All right. So we'll stayed tuned because we need these answers and these poor ladies do to. The third question or motion I have or not actually a motion but a concern , a few residents came to me about the intersection of Price Street and Van Buren in the 2000 block.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 This is a Colts bus stop and the residents are saying that a four-way stop sign at this intersection is greatly needed. They are stating you have to actually edge yourself out before -- because of poor line-of-sight as well as, you know, people are parking illegal ly too close to the two stop signs that are there that are impairing some vision there. And also there is a great deal of drivers speeding through that intersection . So I actually took a ride up there and I could attest that this does present a safety issue. Mr. Voldenberg , would you please contact the highway department and city engineering for a traffic study with regards to the safety issue? Have them take a peek at it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll submit it tomorrow , sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. One more too, this -- and I actually took a look at this too and it is a safety issue. So off of Main Avenue down Landis Street, all right, so you go down Landis and there's a stop sign, the second stop sign in front of you is the junkyard . To the left and to -- to the left 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 you would go to Clover Field. All right, when you stop at that stop sign on your right and on your left there is a big trailer park there. And it's been there for a long time. And then there's a truck on the other side or vice versa. I'm not sure which one is the truck. But when you go to pull out, it's the same issue as this other one that I just mentioned . You can't see. And that's where all the big school buses are parked and they go back and forth from there. So I myself use that way a lot. And, you know, it's tough to pull out and take a look. I just think it's an accident waiting to happen. So if, you know, and these have been sitting there a while. A lot of them don't even have license plates on them -- or a lot of these or both of these. So if you could have the police department take a look at that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . With respect to the Mayor's attempt to appoint someone to replace Attorney Gallagher on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 Scranton Housing Authority , you know, there was some spirited conversation shall I say that went back and forth as to when Attorney Gallagher 's term ended. All I know is this that all of these authorities they are typically appointed for five year terms. Attorney Gallagher 's first term began September 27th of 1984. So it's pretty simple math, '84, '89, '94, '99, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019, 2024. After -- as I said some discussion back and forth, the Mayor sent me an e-mail indicating that they're withdrawing that resolution . I don't -- I'm hopeful that it ends there and Attorney Gallagher will continue to fulfill his final year on the Scranton Housing Authority . But I guess time will tell. But for now there is no resolution . We have nothing before this body. And I have document ation that it was withdrawn . So some followup from last week, we receive d a complaint regarding quality of life issues including accumulation of trash on the properties of 1423-1427 North Washington Avenue. Code enforcement was advised and they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 are following through on citation to the property owners. A resident advised Council of the worn turning lane road markings at the intersection s of South Washington Avenue and East Elm Street. Request was sent to DPW to update the road markings . So while they're down on East Elm they may as well go to Hickory and take care of both of them as we heard this evening . Council request code enforce ment revisit the properties at 737 Taylor Avenue regarding water flow from the basement to the street and surrounding properties . The problem was determined to be an underground aquifer disturbed by roadwork on the block. Code enforcement is determining the next steps to resolve this ongoing issue. Received complaint of vehicle s parking on the grass and sidewalk in the thousand block of Cedar Avenue. Scranton Police Department Highway Division was notified , a number of vehicles were ticketed . Joan Hodowanitz , Council awaiting a response as to why the legislation related to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 the 2.5 million dollar court award was just submitted in September when the city was notified on March 17th that the payment was required . The answer is the administration continues to draft and submit legislation at appropriate times including but not limited to the response to court deadline s and demands from others has happened in this instance . Also, under Joan, the interest on general obligation note series 2023 is actually 4.85 percent as discussed earlier for nine years as you had indicated . The total cost on the amortization schedule were actually received this evening . And the final fees and charges -- well ask -- Frank, can you -- the information that was provided to us tonight , can we place that in Third Order for next week? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Pocket park, tentative grand opening date regarding the -- Leslie Collins of Scranton Tomorrow advised that the finishing touches will be taking place. But first the turf 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 needs to become established . The plantings need to root. The fencing will need to remain at a minimum of five weeks. We'll be coordinating with our project partners to establish the timeline for public dedication and will keep you updated, involved in that process . Sean McAndrew , Council reached out to the administration per request of Sean McAndrew Scranton School Director in addition to parents and Scranton High School student s that are -- Scranton Police Department please concentrate regular patrols on Olive Street between Penn Avenue and Scranton High School due to the growing amount of homeless on the blocks in addition to code enforce ment reviewing the properties and yards along the blocks. Mr. McAndrew and parents have advised many students traverse the blocks to and from the high school. Resident s and parents have noted an increase d number of needles , used drug paraphernalia and litter in the yards along this roadway . Council would like to schedule a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 meeting with the Scranton Police Department Chief Carroll to review and seek remedies to the issues. The response was the administration was scheduling a meeting of City and Scranton School District shared Services Public Safety Committee to discuss this issue. Mayor Cognetti responded to School Director McAndrew and copied Council President King. Mr. King and Council person McAndrew are members of this committee and they did send us a number of dates out to choose from. And I filled in the dates I was available . So we'll see when that meeting happens . Mr. Dobrzyn , the current market value of the City of Scranton composite pension fund as of August 31st was $115,381,323 has remained constant through 2023. The pension fund like any investments in a 401K were affected by the economy in 2021 and 2022 and has increase d over the last year and a half. Marie Schumacher , Council sent a request to the administration for the listing of private payments to date in addition to the date -- the day correspondence was mailed to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 not for profit entities . The administration respond ed by stating that they are compiling the information and will forward this information soon to Council . Council asked for an update schedule related to the East Mountain stormwater project . The administration respond ed that East Mountain stormwater update is scheduled for October 25th at the Howard Gardner School. We sent a request to DPW management to revisit repairs to the lookout on Route 307. DPW has placed that on the work list to be addressed . Response to Virgil Argenta , sent a request to administration asking the following question s to clarify the performance and process regarding the pumps at Keyser Valley, was the pump house at Merrifield turned on at the time of the rain event, did the pump house perform as expected during the flood event, further does the city DPW maintain a 24/7 callout crew for such emergencies . The administration advised these questions were address ed at Council caucus a few weeks ago and can be address ed again in another caucus, if necessary . I think they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 were actually answered earlier this evening when Chief Judge was here. City Council reached -- asked to reach out to Pennsylvania American Water to ask the water company when the most recent water quality testing was done for Scranton and asked that there is regular schedule for testing when the next test will be done. Pennsylvania American Water Company provide d a link to review the many forms of testing done on the water quality in the city. Council review and report back with their finding s. Council followed up with the administration for a listing of all city vehicle s and city employees assigned to each. Council received today, September 26th, and has the listing under review. And that's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

SCHUSTER : On the question , just taking a look at this, this is a grant that's for 2 million dollars . It's looking at the Wyoming Avenue streetscapes. These are things that we have been talking about for a while. I do believe it's part of a walkability study. They're going to be taking out lanes on the street. They're going to be adding in bike lanes. MR. KING: I think that's the next one. I think that's 7-F. I could be wrong. MR. SCHUSTER : I jumped ahead on that one. MR. KING: It's the 65,000 telespond -- MR. SCHUSTER : I'll save that one. MR. KING: Okay.

MR. KING: What is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-F. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : All right. On the question , so this I believe is a piece of the walkability study. It's Wyoming Avenue streetscapes. I see that it's -- it's noted as complete streets at this point in time. I did ask last week if there is any plans or designs for other work available or other work that's going to be coming because we do have 18 street project s that we're going to be doing. To give you an estimate on the cost we're looking at the 2 million dollars plus the 245,000 ARPA match. But the answer to that was the administration does not have a finalized design plan to offer as the project and the application process is for grant funding . The city engineer did, however , complete a downtown master plan January of 2022 which includes suggestions and strategies for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 space including green space, bicycle lanes, paving, sidewalks and help the administration provide information for the funding application . Without knowing if the city will be awarded we are unable to move forward with a crystalized design but could share the same when we are awarded funding. So it looks like each of these streetscapes are going to be done piecemeal with grant funding . One question I do have, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could reach out is how far are we taking the complete streets project and is the administration adopting a complete streets policy in the City of Scranton .
