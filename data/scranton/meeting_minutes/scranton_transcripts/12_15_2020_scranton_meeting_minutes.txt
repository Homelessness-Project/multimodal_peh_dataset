THE CITY’S SELF-INSURED WORKERS ’ COMPENSATION PROGRAM RESERVE ANALYSIS AND LOSS FORECAST , SELF-INSURANCE RENEWAL APPLICATION RECEIVED DECEMBER 11, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I just have one comment . On the overtime report from the City Controller , I mentioned this before but I still am concerned . If you look at the report, we're over nearly 300,000 in the police department in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 overtime for a total of almost a million dollars at this point. So I'm assuming by the end of the year we'll be over a million dollars in overtime . Fire -- the Fire Department , we're over almost 330,000. And the DPW administration , there is only $250 budgeted . We spent almost $4,500. So, you know, it's amazing to me how we have trouble reining in overtime costs year after year. But we did okay last year. But this year is -- we're over quite significantly . Anyone else on comments on the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I have two of them. So tomorrow , Wednesday , December 16th, our friends at Friends of the Poor will have a drive through Christmas basket distribution . It will be at Scranton High while supplies last so no preregistration required . All right. And then secondly , the West Scranton High School senior class officers will be hosting a winter donation drive. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 They will be collecting canned foods, coats, scarves, hats, mittens and travel sized hand sanitizers . The canned foods will go to St. Ann's and St. Patrick 's food kitchen . Winter attire will benefit Keystone Mission and Northeastern Pennsylvania Youth Shelter . Drop-offs will be held at the girls gym at West Scranton High School the following days: January 6th from 12 to 3; 7th from 12 to 3; and January 8th from 12 to 3. Great job, Invaders . That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I'd just like to say I hope everyone is enjoying their Hanukkah , so Happy Hanukkah . And next with Christmas coming up too that everybody enjoys the holidays and stays safe. And then I know you mentioned earlier in our caucus about the emergency declaration for the Mayor about the impending snowstorm . So if you're able to stay inside while the snowstorm occurs and just try to keep yourselves safe and healthy . And use good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 volume mechanics when you're shovelling so you don't have to see a physical therapist because I get a lot of injuries from shovelling during snowstorms . So be careful . MR. GAUGHAN : Good point. Thank you. Anyone else? I have one. There's an event called Coats from Carol. It is going to be held at 1739 Bundy Street which is St. Stephen 's Booster Club. The location of this event changed from last year and previously years. It was at the Marketplace at Steamtown . It's now at the St. Stephen 's Booster Club, 1739 Bundy Street. They're hosting a coat drive in honor of Carol Oleski who many of us knew. She was a member of the Scranton School Board and a friend of a lot of people in the City. So they are holding the coat drive in honor of her for the children of the Scranton Community . All ages are welcome . December 19th -- it will be held December 19th starting at 1 p.m. Children will receive a free coat while supplies last. CDC guidelines will be followed . Masks are required . And it's being run by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Katrina Oleski, which is Carol's daughter . And if you have any questions you can call her at 570-780-2446. And I want to personally thank Katrina . Her father is the Director of Licensing , Inspections and Permits in the City, Tom. And this is a wonderful , wonderful thing that they're doing and have done for the people in the City of Scranton . It's amazing in talking to -- I talked to Tom earlier today. It's amazing how many children need winter coats in the City that don't have winter coats, don't have the resources to get them. So this event really, really helps a lot of people in the City. So God bless them for putting this on and taking the time to do something like this. And that's the type of person that Carol was. Carol helped people throughout her life. So this is just an extension of that in her memory. So thank you. Mrs. Reed, Fourth Order. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus? MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, will you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Marie Schumacher . O Why is the Public Hearing on the 2021 Budget not shown on the CIty's website ? O Where are the answers to the questions raised at the Public Hearing on the 2021 Budget? O It appears tonight 's Meeting reveals a large flaw in keeping the Public out of your Meetings ; that is, assuming the 2021 Operating Budget will be taken from the Table and placed in Seventh Order and the Public will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 have no means to comment on any revisions or amendments . O An RFP was advertised in today's Paper for a Nay Aug Pool Complex feasibility Study. When we are soon expecting to receive a Comprehensive Parks Study why is this RFP being pulled out for separate action? O The Agenda for tonight 's Meeting was not posted on Council 's website as of 8am this morning . Why? Also, what is the Status of the 2019 Audit and what steps are being taken to ensure the 2020 Budget will arrive on time? O Regarding Delinquent Trash Fees I have two questions I would like answered this evening : (1) The 2020 Budget called for these deliquencies to be bid out; why did this not happen and (2) why has this City allowed property owners to go years and years without paying. It is painful that you can't figure out how to do your job but are willing to make fools out of those who do pay on time allowing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 them to pick up the slack the City let slide year after year. O I will conclude with an appeal that you pay attention to what you are teaching the next generation of potential property owners. I took the time to take a ten year old to the Courtright Hearing and sentencing to teach him a lesson on what happens when you break the rules. The Judge was not only lenient he extolled that virtue of how thoughtful the former Mayor had been by not forcing a jury trial. Then came the former Mayor's arrival at his detention center and was greeted with a reduced sentence for good behavior before he'd even served a day. Of one thing I am confident , that young man is smart and learned something but I shudder to think what that may be. So, if you have to play Santa to all those delinquent property owners please consider the message you are sending . MS. REED: The second submission is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 from Fay Franus as follows : Council , Why are we left in the dark on December 15 2020 in regards to the budget that may be passed tonight --who knows. I have no idea if you will be amending this budget or just letting it go through as is. I definitely want answers . We have a right to know what is actually happening with this budget. If by chance you do change, alter. Or amend this budget how can you do that legally WITHOUT public input? You have no agenda on your website so are we to guess what you are doing? Suppose you do move items to 7th order do you really feel you can just get away with that like everything else you do? Where are our answers to our questions on the public hearing of the budget? I seriously want answers tonight -- in detail as to what is going on with this budget. I am surely hoping you will speak 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 about giving ECTV $120,000 which they rightfully deserve . Is this in the budget? I never saw a budget like this ever. Last week you still had no idea what was going to be in the budget and here we are on final day and we have not heard a peep out of you about does it stay as it is--does it change? When do you feel the people need to know what you are doing? Sometimes ? Never? Another question I seriously need an answer to tonight . Is council going to approve a contract for delinquent garbage fees to the Portnoff firm? Kevin Buraks from Portnoff 's firm presented excellent proposals as to their plans to go after delinquent garbage fees going back to 2002. I was very impressed with everything they explained . The people who do pay will finally get some hope that those who have not paid will finally be held accountable , which is wonderful news. Last week Mr Gaughan stated he would not approve Portnoff 's contract unless they included amnesty for the people who did not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 pay, by knocking off their fees and penalties . I wrote each of you a letter asking you to NOT go along with Mr. Gaughan . I am hoping you will all speak up tonight and not stay silent as you often do. This is too important an issue to allow Mr. Gaughan to stop this contract . Mr. Gaughan believes he can hold Portnoff hostage until they do what he wants by putting amnesty in their contract for those who did not pay. Mr Gaughan needs a rude awakening ! Mr. Guaghan and all of council should consider the people who have paid their garbage fees on time for years and how we paid for those who did not. You would be losing much money by eliminating the fees and penalties . The people who did not pay knew there would be fees and penalties when they refused to pay. They need to pay all they owe. The Portnoff firm have done this work for decades . I say give them this contract and enough talk of helping the ones who never paid for decades . Your priorities are messed up. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 know I will never vote for any council person who goes along with Mr. Gaughan . On this amnesty deal. The people who did pay their fees kept this city going. You should be thanking us. WE need a contract signed and ready to go by December 31st when that collection agency that Courtright hired will be finally gone. I will end with this. You are getting away with so much --hardly ever answering questions . You have truly taken complete advantage of the fact we can't be there to hold your feet to the fire. You must be loving this. No transparency at council meetings . (Public comment letters concluded as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: That conclude s the Citizens Participation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Well, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 think it's safe to say that I'm not going to be receiving a Christmas card from Miss Franus this year, but that's okay. So we'll start with Miss Schumacher 's questions . And I addressed this during the caucus. But I'll address it again during the meeting because I think it's important . So her question about the agenda not being posted on the City's website , the agenda was not posted on the City's website for a very specific reason. There was an issue with the IT Department . Both Mrs. Reed and I were in touch with the IT Department as soon as we realized that it wasn't posted on the agenda which was late Friday afternoon . We were in constant communication with Frank Switnicki who is the IT Director . And he wrote the following Saturday morning : He said there is an issue with the web hosting provider . I can't upload the file to the site. I've got a trouble ticket open with the provider and I'm waiting on a fix. As soon as it's fixed, the agenda will be posted. And I will text you. This is not something I can directly fix as I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 control the server. It's a service that the City pays for. And I have copy of that e-mail in front of me now. Now, obviously the agenda was not posted on the City's website. It has not been posted as of maybe an hour or two ago because we kept checking because of that reason. So there's an issue there with the server. It's not some kind of, you know, conspiracy that Council didn't want to share or the administration or the IT Department didn't want to share the agenda. There was a technical issue and those things do happen. The one thing that I can say is that the agenda is posted every week for public review not only on the City's website but also in the Treasury Office on the first floor of City Hall and in the foyer of City Hall. That -- those directions on how to access to the agenda are posted also in the advertisements in the Scranton Times on Thursday and on Sunday. Every week that is posted. So if anyone, you know, because of this technical mishap noticed that and wanted to, you know, view the agenda or view any of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the backup including the amendments , they could have gone down to the Treasurer 's Office. They could have called the Council office. We did not receive any calls of that nature. Also, I want to make this point that last week -- at last week's meeting I announced that we would be bringing the budget back. I announced that we would be bringing the other piece of legislation back as well to give the public a heads-up. So I did do that in an effort of transparency . So these are not new things. These have been done since -- mostly since the pandemic had started . And we're in this new world of doing everything over the computer . So I think hopefully that answers that question . In terms of the public questions -- MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Gaughan ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry. But can I just add something just on that point just real quick because we did put a lot of time into putting together a document that, you know, outlines the changes we made because I know we've talked about it in the past when you just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 read the amendments it's hard to follow along. So I just want to make the point that, you know, barring this technical issue we're having with the server, it was our full intent to put this up and have it fully explained when it was sent along on Friday. You know, we wouldn't have put -- once anyone has a chance to see the document , it is pretty extensive . And it's legible in terms of the entire budget line by line. So it was our full intent for that to be up. We wouldn't have put the time into, you know, putting this together if that wasn't the case. MR. GAUGHAN : Correct . Thank you. That's a good point. The answer to the questions raised at the public hearing on the 2021 budget, the Mayor and Carl Deeley, the Business Administrator came and I thought they answered the question s that were posed. The ones that were not answered Mrs. Reed is going to send again to the administration . But they did come and address ed whatever they could answer when they came I think a week or two ago. The RFP that was advertise d in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 paper for the Nay Aug pool complex feasibility study that Miss Schumacher mentions and she asked when we're expected to receive a comprehensive park study. That should coming within the next few months. I don't know and I don't have an exact date for when that study is going to be released . But I do know that the Nay Aug Pool Complex feasibility study is something that will be outside of the confines of the comprehensive park study. This is specific really to the pool. So that is -- that is separate from what I'm being told. And I already addressed the audit in the caucus. Also, regarding the delinquent trash fees, Miss Schumacher asked the 2020 budget calls for these delinquents to be bid out. I think -- I believe she's referring to the proposal that was talked about with the previous administration in entering into an agreement with a company who is a financing method to sell off some of those delinquencies and get money up front. That is something that Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Donahue and I had been pushing the administration to do. They didn't agree with it. And they didn't do it. And they had their reasons . They had their reasons why they did not think it was a good idea. And so there is nothing we can do about that. That's up to them. That's within their right as the administration . So they did not do that. Okay. As for Mrs. Franus, we'll talk about ECTV when we get to the budget and the amendments of the budget. I already addressed her issue which was the same that Miss Schumacher had with the agenda not being posted. And as to her comment with moving items to Seventh Order and do we feel like we can just get away with everything else that we do, that just is bizarre . I announced last week if everyone was paying attention what items we were going to bring up tonight . Again, there is no, you know, major conspiracy going on here that anyone is trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes. So I can't help change her thinking there. I've already explained my position on Portnoff . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I'm not -- we're not trying -- I'm not trying to hold anything up. If people would like for this Council to be like previous councils and just jam things through without any thought -- without putting any thought into what the implications would be moving forward with an agreement that by all account s will not just be for a year based on the things that we've all talked about then that's fine. But I would prefer to really analyze things and make sure that we're doing our due diligence . And that means sometimes tabling something and really taking a hard look at it and asking questions and making sure again that we're doing our due diligence . So no one is holding anything hostage here. We're making sure -- before we enter into an agreement , it's the best agreement for the City. And we can agree to disagree about the grace period and if you want to call it an amnesty period. I've explained my position on that. And I feel very, very strongly about it. And when that comes back up I'll explain that again. But I think it's a benefit to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 taxpayers . We haven't been able to collect these fees for years and years and years. We're going to continue to chase them. And now we're going to give a private company the opportunity again to do that. So I was looking for middle ground there to try to get revenue for the City next year which we desperately need. And I think that was -- that was it. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Gaughan , I'd just like to say just to follow up with you. I think taking a look at this contract , analyzing the contract and improving mistake s that occurred with the last contract is what we're attempting to do. And I think bringing some of this money in, it will be brought into the City -- directly to the City without fees and other things tacked onto it. And eventually that private company will come in. And if it does, the scope of their work will also be narrowed . MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Yeah, to me it's common sense. But I understand the other side of the argument . I really -- I do. I understand it. I just think we're doing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 same thing over and over and over again. So I think it's beneficial to offer up other ideas and other ways of looking at things. And we've done that and the administration has been receptive to it. And we're having our solicitor now continue to alter the contract . And that will go back to the administration . And we'll go through that process and eventual ly we will have someone collect the delinquent refuse fees. We're just not going to jump, you know, just because we have it in front of us. We want to make sure it's a good deal for the City. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I just want to add I feel -- I feel that we've been pretty transparent with the budget. From previous years it sounds like maybe the most transparent or we've had the most involvement from the administration that Council may have seen in recent years. We had numerous work sessions . We've talked about pretty openly I think the issues that each of us have with the budget. You know, it is a shame that those amendments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 couldn't be posted previously . And there was the issue with the server. And I'm disappointed and would have, of course, appreciated the input from our citizens . But we do need to pass a budget. And I think we've all had discussions about those amendments and will be able to talk about them further tonight . In terms of the Portnoff decision , I think that it is wise to table it. I want to collect the delinquent fees as much as anyone. You know, we need money for the City. I do not think it's fair that there have been people that have been able to just scrape by and not pay their fees for how many years and develop thousands that they owe the City when there are so many people who make every effort that they can to pay their refuse fees and to pay them on time. So, you know, I agree that we do need to go after those people who owe the City. I do think there's some -- there are circumstances to take into consideration , COVID-19 pandemic being number one of them. If there is someone who, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 owes $300 for this past year who hasn't paid because they are laid off and they're still laid off, you know, I think that's -- that's something different than the people who, you know, knowingly avoid the fees for how many years. And, you know, we do need to be careful about the contract that we're entering into with Portnoff . I appreciate that -- that we're looking into it and working with the administration to just do our due diligence and make sure that it's going to be the best deal for the City. And that's why I'm supportive of tabling it. I did explain I think last week that I was interested in seeing more of what the administration had to say with regard to Councilman Gaughan 's ideas for the grace period or amnesty period or whatever you want to call it. And I think we had talked to -- I was looking for maybe to see what other cities have done and what their successes might have been in offering such a period. But we do need a company either way to come in and to help us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 get through millions of dollars in losses that we've had over the years. So that's where I stand on it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motion or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments at this time? Sorry, Mark, you're muted. And I think you froze for a second. MR. MCANDREW : Of course, whenever I speak, right, so some hackers . Get on the IT, will ya? All right. So I want to revisit a complaint that was present ed to me back in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 November . Actually I brought it up at the November 10th meeting . It was a property on Lenahan Avenue, the 1200 block. I don't have the actual address but we have pictures . Mrs. Reed was kind enough to forward all of this correspond to the LIPS Department (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, you froze again. Give him a minute. MR. MCANDREW : -- let's try to get a followup . MR. GAUGHAN : Mark -- MR. MCANDREW : What. MR. GAUGHAN : Sorry, you froze. So we missed probably the last 20 seconds of what you said. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So you heard my piece about this property that nothing 's been done for a month, okay, you've heard that. So, Mrs. Reed, you know, provide some more correspondence of followup to see where we're at with this property . I understand there is processes and, you know, there's procedures . But this person reached out to me again and nothing has been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 done. All right. Secondly , I want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas . This is our last meeting . I'm not going to see you guys. Merry Christmas to all of you. Merry Christmas to my, you know, my colleagues , everybody out there. Happen Hanukkah , happy Kwanzaa , whatever you guys celebrate . I hope you have a ball; and most of all, a very happy and healthy new year for Christ's sake, right. So that is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, just a couple. I -- I'm sorry. Oh, I just -- I wanted to bring up over the weekend I had to stop over at the post office that's on Lackawanna Avenue at Steamtown . And we voted on an ordinance a few months ago to add signage over there in order for the trucks to not have to double park and to prevent people from parking in the spot that they need during certain periods of time when they're dropping off or picking up. And so while I stopped over there, I noticed that their truck did still have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 double park because someone parked in their spot. And the sign has been posted. I feel that's it, you know, that it's pretty specific and obvious . But people still are not adhering to it. And so I just want to remind the public to read the signs and to adhere to them and to avoid parking in that spot so that the USPS can do their job with greater ease and lesser risk because it is a safety issue for them to be double parking and exiting their truck over there on the busy Lackawanna Avenue. So that was all I wanted to say. And, yes, I agree with Councilman McAndrew . We do -- we need a happy new year. So let's pray for 2021 to be a better year for all. And that's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Oh, yeah, I just would also just like to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday season. And I'll save the rest of my comments for agenda items. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few things. Mrs. Reed, if you could send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 correspond , an e-mail, whatever to the administration . I mentioned the overtime in the beginning of the meeting . I would like an explanation in writing , a justification for why these departments are over in overtime . So the Police Department as I mentioned at the end of the year it looks like we're probably going to be over a million dollars in overtime there according to Controller Murray's report. The Fire Department , we're over $330,000. That's only going to go up until the end of the year. DPW overall , I think we were under budget. But in the administration line item, we only budgeted $250. Yet, $4,427.21 has been accumulated . So I would like a justification from the Mayor and these department heads on why we're spending money that was not budgeted and why we're over budget. MR. DONAHUE : Can I just add one thing to that too? You know, in normal years we have overtime that's reimbursable by given things. So if we can just add onto that if they're -- you know, 2020 is a different year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 in terms of that. But just to add to see if any of that overtime cost was reimbursable and if we got any of those reimbursements back. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And the second thing I would like, Mrs. Reed, again in writing an actual dollar figure from the administration on how much the City is ultimately going to owe -- how much the City owes Northeast Revenue Services at this moment. Solicitor O'Brien had stated that we might not owe them that much or the figure was changing . I can't remember exactly what he said when he was here. But I'd like to know, you know, we're going to be parting ways with them, thank God, at the end of December . And are we going to owe them any money? And if so, how much is it? So I would like an actual dollar on that. I mentioned that the -- we received an update on the audit. Again, totally unacceptable that it's December 15th and we don't have an audit for 2019. We are getting updates. We're still not there yet. The administration is still not there yet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 I mention ed also that the Mayor declared an emergency -- a City emergency from 6 a.m., Wednesday , December 16th to Friday, December 18th at 6 p.m., due to the snowstorm . We'll post that emergency declaration in Third Order. And that will be for our next regular meeting that we have. So everyone will be able to see all of the vendors that -- the vendors that the City is going to need to use. And finally , I want to -- I have to thank our City Clerk, Lori Reed and our Assistant City Clerk, Kathy Carrera for the work that they've done over the past year. No one could have ever, ever, ever envisioned or expected that we would be facing a pandemic that would alter everyone 's lives -- personal lives, number one; and number two, just absolutely completely alter the way that we conduct City business . And if you told me in 2019 that we'd be having meeting s virtually over a computer I just would have laughed . I would have never thought that that would be possible . So, you know, Lori and Kathy have gone just above and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 beyond in terms of number one, having to go down to City Hall to still do their jobs in the face of all of this craziness that's gone on and to make these meeting s run smoothly with -- really without a hitch. And I think we were one of the first cities in our region at least that jumped right into Zoom. And really I think we only missed one meeting back in March of last year. And that was really thanks to Lori and Kathy. So I just want to personally thank them for keeping this -- keeping this running very, very smoothly and all the work that they've done. I also want to thank our Solicitor Kevin Hayes again. Under these circumstances with trying to work remotely is difficult and not being able to see people in person. And he's done a really, really good job in looking at each agreement with -- in great detail and providing really sound legal advice. So I want to thank Kevin as well. And I just want to generally wish everyone a Merry Christmas and hope everyone stays safe. And I hope that we keep in mind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 all the people in Scranton and Lackawanna County and in our country that won't be celebrating Christmas because they've lost their lives to this virus and all the people that I think about that are going to suffer because they won't have their family with them. They won't have their dad or mom or grandma or grandpa , whatever it may be. And Christmas and the holidays are going to look a lot different this year. You know, I know personally not getting together with my family. Every Christmas Eve we'd be at my parent's house. We're not going to do that this year. But there is hope. I mention ed it consistently throughout the last few months. We cannot, cannot, cannot lose hope. We now have vaccines . You know, we're probably not going to get them until the spring. But they're here. And that's a miracle in it of itself. So we just have to stay vigilant . We have to watch out for each other. We have to watch out for our neighbors . And I think that's what Scranton is known for is, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 picking people up when they're down and making sure that the elderly in our community , those who are less fortunate that we watch out for them and we make sure that they're taken care of during this time. So and I have to thank the Mayor, her administration , all the nonprofits in the City, the different organizations who have really, really stepped up. It's a frightening thing when you see the people who are lining up for food, the people who will line up for coats for their children for Christmas . So but again, I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and hopefully this time next year we'll be in a much, much different position . Thank you. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I'd like to make a motion to table agenda Item 7-H. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I recommended in the caucus that we table agenda Item 7-H for the simple fact that I think the City should explore implementing or drafting design standards for these cell towers. Now, as Councilman McAndrew mention ed, when you hear the word tower you might think it's 30 or 40 feet high. It's really only 3 feet. But in my discussions or my research on this matter there are other cities throughout Pennsylvania who have implement and adopted design standards . So this is asking Council to and the City to enter into a 15-year agreement . I just think it makes sense to explore and investigate implementing design standards for these towers before we go through with this piece of legislation . Anyone else on the question ? All 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 those in favor of the motion to table agenda Item 7-H signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 106, 2020 – CEREMONIOUSLY DEDICATING “JOE BIDEN WAY” AT THE INTERSECTION OF NORTH WASHINGTON AVENUE AND FISK STREET IN HONOR OF PRESIDENT -ELECT JOE BIDEN. MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I'm honored to recommend final passage of Item 7-I. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? As I mentioned last week this -- January 20th is going to be a great day for the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Scranton , whether you're a Democrat or Republican , an Independent or just not affiliated with any political party or you don't follow politics . The fact that we are going to have a former resident , someone who grew on North Washington Avenue in the City of Scranton call Scranton home for the first 10 years of his life as the leader of the United States of America is pretty remarkable and also the fact that so many leaders in our country 's history have come from one street in the City of Scranton . So I think January 20th is going to be a great day for the City. It marks I think a new chapter in our country and a new chapter I think in the City's history as well. So I'm looking forward to it. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : I hereby declare Item 7-I legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-J. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 107, 2020 – APPOINTMENT OF JOHN JUDGE, 915 ELECTRIC STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18509, TO THE POSITION OF SCRANTON FIRE CHIEF EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 30, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to make a motion at this time to table agenda Item 7-J. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a second. On the question ? On the question , I'll just explain again why I'm making a motion to table this. First of all, I think it's reasonable to ask the Mayor and the Fire Chief or ask the Mayor to require the Fire Chief to, you know, pick one of these positions . As I stated in the caucus after my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 review of John Judge's resume, it's clear that he's qualified to be Fire Chief. I have no qualms whatsoever about his qualifications . And there's no doubt in my mind he would make a good Fire Chief. My sole disagreement with this is that he is also a police officer in -- part-time police officer in South Abington Township . As I stated earlier , the responsibilities are enormous as the Fire Chief in the City of Scranton . We have one of the largest departments , not only in the City but in the entire state. I think we might be the third or fourth largest in the State of Pennsylvania . And my concern is that if there ever was a major catastrophe in Scranton and the Fire Chief needed to be there and he was in the middle of doing his duty as a police officer in South Abington Township , we could have an issue. And I just don't think those two things jive. You know, the Mayor asked Council originally although we're going to amend it to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 have this position pay over $100,000. And, you know, if we're going to make a commitment -- if the City is going to make a commitment to someone to take on this responsibility to take on this type of position , then I think the City should ask that that be the, you know, sole employment . Again, as I stated, it's not like he's a greeter at Walmart . He's doing a side job one day a week. If that was the case I wouldn't have even mentioned it. But to me, this is a whole different ball game when you're a police officer in another town. And that comes with great responsibility as well. And I think it's very honorable that Mr. Judge is a police officer in South Abington Township . I just think if we're going to ask -- if we're going to make a commitment to him, he's got to make a commitment to us and, you know, pick one of those. I don't think it can be both. So I would ask that we table this until such time as Mr. Judge ceases his employment in South Abington Township . Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 question ? MR. DONAHUE : I'd just like -- MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, oh, I'm sorry, go ahead, Kyle. MR. DONAHUE : Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry, Billy. I understand where you're coming from. I just disagree . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. MCANDREW : First of all, there is nothing on the books or there is no policy that states that you can't have two jobs. I have three jobs. I do all three very well -- at least I think I do. I'm not going to begrudge a guy who wants to make some extra money. I understand everything you're saying, I know where you're coming from. But I think that decision lies with the individual . And it also lies with the Mayor. I mean, the Mayor actually hires these positions . We get that. Our vote is just a formality. So I don't want to -- I don't think I should make that decision if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 should have two jobs or not. I understand the responsibility is a great one. But I'm sorry but I disagree . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : I'd just like to say, you know, I understand where Councilman Gaughan is coming with from his argument . And I also understand where Councilman McAndrew is coming with his. So I'm going to vote -- I'll vote to table it. But that won't prevent me from voting for final passage . DR. ROTHCHILD : I would just add, I mean, I've given this some thought . And I can see both sides as well. And, you know, it would be my preference that the Fire Chief have his sole focus and availability to perform that job. But I also -- I'm conflicted because I don't feel that I could tell someone what they can do in their spare time or another job or position . I just don't feel right about doing that. And I agree that he is qualified . And so, I mean, I don't believe that I will be voting to table this piece tonight . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? I just want to add that, you know, some of us have second or third jobs. But we're also not, you know, this is -- Fire Chief is a 24/7 job in my opinion . And again, the concern is that the Mayor has the right to tell someone if you're going to take this position , you know, you can't -- you can't do both. She has every right to do that. And that's what I'm asking here because , you know, I could understand someone wanting to make a little bit more money. But this job -- the Mayor wants this job to pay a $100,000. I mean, to me in the City of Scranton , that's an awful lot of money. Now, we lowered it in the budget significantly . But still, it's still a very good paying job. The responsibility is great. I haven't come across a situation like this. I think we should table it and, you know, I can't approve this. And by the way, Solicitor Hayes, if Council were to, you know, vote against this what -- is this just a formality ? Can you fill us in on that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 ATTY. HAYES: No. It's not a formality . All department heads -- let me back up. Under the Administrative Code, each department head may be appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of Council . So Council -- so no one could assume the duty a of department head legally and lawfully without having been approved by Council . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, and, you know, that responsibility is important . I mean, we -- you know, it's -- to me it's not a formality . It's we're giving our okay that this person is qualified which he is qualified . There's no question , no two ways about that. Resume, it's clear. He's qualified . However , I don't think you could do both. I mean, I think you have to make a commitment to one of them. And, you know, as the Mayor in my opinion should have said either, you know, if you want to be the Fire Chief that's fine. But you can't also be a cop in South Abington Township . I mean, that to me is just nonsense . So that's where I stand on it. Anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 DR. ROTHCHILD : I just -- I'm sorry, I did want to add that, you know, recognizing that he has been serving as interim Chief for how many months now and that it hasn't seemed that we haven't heard of it being an issue at this point. I know this is to confirm the position is not temporary but as permanent which is obviously different . We did receive an explanation from him that if he felt like it was a conflict that he would then resign from that position . So we -- I just wanted to point out that we did hear from Mr. Judge regarding his employment there. MR. GAUGHAN : So the other thing and I failed to bring this up but, you know, when I was thinking about this earlier today and when I brought it up last week, you know, if I was -- if I'm looking at this whole thing and just thinking about Scranton and South Abington Township . What if there is a very -- and this could happen. What if there is an emergency in both the City and South Abington Township and Mr. Judge is on duty up there and there is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 major emergency and we need him in Scranton ? To me, you have to do one or the other. I mean, I just don't -- it does not make any sense to me. So again, there's always the possibility that there could be a major emergency in both areas. And we're paying this person, you know, a good salary. It's a 24/7 job. It's a major responsibility . I think we're the third or fourth largest department in the state. I just feel very strongly about it. I would have no problem voting for Mr. Judge at all but not if it's going to stand as it states in the letter that he'll continue to do both -- continue to be employed in both positions . Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of tabling agenda Item 7-J signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed? MR. SCHUSTER : No. DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. MCANDREW : Nay. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. The motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 table fails, three to two. Okay. Let's see, as Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I will recommend a final vote on Item 7-J. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Again on the question , not to belabor the point but I, you know, it's unfortunate that, you know, I'm going to vote against this appointment not again based on the fact that I think Mr. Judge isn't qualified because I think he is qualified . I just don't know how you marry up the fact that he's going be in both of those positions even though that position is part time. Again, I think you're putting the City at a disadvantage if there's an emergency in both South Abington Township and in Scranton and if he's in his position in South Abington Township . So and for that reason and the reasons I previously stated, I will be voting no. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS.

So the New total for Revenue comes out to $114,525,753.72. The New total for Expenditures comes out to $114,525,753.72.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second to amend Item 7-M, the 2021 operating budget. On the question ? Anyone on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : So on the question we're speaking to -- MR. GAUGHAN : We're just speaking to the amendments at this point. MR. MCANDREW : Well, I'll speak to them. I'll speak now or I'll speak on the vote. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, sure. You could do whichever. MR. MCANDREW : I'm going to speak now. So I totally understand my responsibility , the fiduciary responsibility . My biggest point of contention during this whole budget process was to -- is there need to have or nice to have, right. That was my biggest point of contention . So I dug deep in the propose d new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 position s. There was 12 of them, right? We didn't need them all, right? And I'm glad for the collaboration of all of you we, you know, we chipped away at this budget to make it more realistic , right? It is a pandemic . We all know that. We don't need to be reminded of it. But now is not the time for any of these -- a lot of these hires. Like I said, there's to need to have. There's nice to have. So I was okay with the position of the person who is going to make signs because we approved changing all the signs in the City. So we need somebody to do that. That's a needed position . That's a union position . The flood management position , right, we always have problems with flood control . I hear it all the time and we lose out. So we need that person. We need that position because we're losing out on reimbursements from FEMA and PEMA every time there's a flood or every time there's a lot of water issues, right, so this is a position we need. So and I'm also happy with, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 know, and, you know, I was against any increases . But I said if we phase them in I'd be okay with it. So you know what, they're being phased in at 5 percent instead of, you know, thousands of dollars one being close to, you know, 15, $20,000. So these amendments I realize are saving half a million dollars , right. So this is a reasonable budget. This makes sense to me. I wasn't in favor of a lot of it in the beginning . After the amendments I take a look at it. I always have to own my vote and live with my vote. So with all of these amendments , thank you to all of you as part of this process . MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, Mark, you cut out on us. Mark? Okay. We lost the last 10 seconds or 15 seconds of what you said. Did I freeze or did everyone else freeze? MR. DONAHUE : No. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Sorry. I think he froze. That's okay. I think we got most of what he said. ATTY. HAYES: He's muted. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Yeah, you're muted, Mark, if you wanted to add anything else. MR. MCANDREW : I don't know what I have to add. I hope you heard everything I had to say. MR. GAUGHAN : The last 10 seconds . So we got most of it. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Well, thank you. Thanks again, guys, for all of your hard work in this process . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? Who wants to go next? MR. DONAHUE : I'm still trying to catch my breath from reading the amendments . But I could go. I think this was a, you know, it was a good process . You know, a lot of the -- a lot of the minor amendments that came in there didn't come from us. It came from the administration . You know, and I think we were all understanding that this is also their first year of doing it. So we tried to, you know, work with them to get those numbers right. And that's why we amended it. But then, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 Council did make some changes. And I think what's important here is that we tried to do something that would build consensus where you, you know, you listen to everyone 's concerns and then try to address them. You know, everyone might not like every single line item in this budget. But I'm hopeful that it's something that really we can all agree with, we can all live with because one of the issues -- main issues I had with the original proposed budget and I had this, you know, for a couple years on Council and also, you know, with my time with the school district is that use of one-time revenues . You know, the only reason I'm in agreement to using that -- and it's really not that we have to use it. It's just that that option is there if we need it is just because of the challenges and uncertainties that, you know, arose due to the pandemic and how that's going to then affect our revenue . You know, in a normal year I wouldn't agree to put that in there. But I think this year is a special exception for that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 where we have to provide some flexibility to continue to provide , you know, the necessary services , you know, that our citizens deserve . MR. GAUGHAN : And, Tom, Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Sure. Well, I want to thank Councilman Donahue for reading through all the amendments . That was a lot. But, you know, I appreciate everyone 's teamwork and putting those together and coming together on what I feel is a compromise . I was uncomfortable with the large increases in salaries and all of the added positions . So I do feel like, you know, many of the positions , the department heads that they should have increases . But this is a difficult time and there's a lot to take into consideration right now. I think our City is fairing better than other cities and municipalities and what I've seen happen with them in their budget process . So I'm thankful that I feel we can come to an agreement on a lot of this. And I do appreciate the Mayor's vision for what our City departments should look like and what we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 would like to pay our employees and what I think we really can strive for in the future. So it's not to say that any of this might not be possible . But I do want to play on a more cautious , conservative side for this year given the revenue -- potential revenue loss from the COVID-19 pandemic and, you know, having that shortfall that we may need to make up for. So, you know, we have -- we have the balanced budget here tonight . And I'll be voting yes on this. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And, Councilman Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : So, I mean, with those amendments we covered a lot of topics there. You know, to touch on something that Kyle said using that one-time revenue sources . I was glad that we were able to get some discussion going about that and find another way to do it. With that said, you know, some of the refinancing there may be done to shore up some of the money there needed to be done and that's getting gone. Looking at those salary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 increases we discussed , you know, they were big large jumps. And I do understand what the administration wants to do with that eventually I feel. I think we made a compromise here by phasing some of that in giving a little bit but not those large jumps, especially this year. So, I mean, looking at this year I don't think there is any excuse to treat it as business as usual. And I don't think we did. I think we looked at every line item and did what needed to be done. And we got to work with the administration , you know, every business owner, every small business in the City is limping along. And I don't think it was the year for all of those positions and increases . And also go with something that PEL had said, you know, every year we see an increase in about 3 percent of our expenditures versus 1 percent in our revenue increases . So, I mean, with that, these positions , these increases added about another 1 percent I would say there. So I don't want to see our expenditures going up about 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 percent into the future while the revenues are remaining at 1 percent . I don't think it was something that we could have done. So I do think we all collaborate d on this and compromised with the administration especial ly given the year. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I -- first of all, I want to thank my fellow Council members for their work on this budget. They provided valuable input. And I believe that we were able to come to a compromise on what we all felt was best for the City of Scranton which should be the ultimate goal. I also want to thank Mayor Cognetti and Business Administrator Carl Deeley for their willingness to come to Council on several occasion s to discuss and defend the budget that they ultimately presented to Council . In years past that was not always the case. This was a welcome change in that regard. And I felt like even though we may not have agreed on everything within their budget, they did come on several occasion s and answered question s and continue d to answer questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 right up until the end of this process . So I do appreciate that. One of the things that I want to make note of if you were listening to the amendment s that Councilman Donahue read through , there was several amendments in there that were actually proposed by the administration because when we received the budget, the budget was not -- technically was not balanced . One of the things that -- two of the things that were left out which were pretty big increases were Collective Bargaining Agreement annual increases per their contract for the DPW and the Police Department . So that was somewhere in the neighborhood of I think over $200,000. So we had to add that in in order to balance the budget and then lower some revenue items and other things under expenditure s in order to balance things out. And then obviously , Councilman Donahue read through several of the other amendment s that we had made. After my review of the budget, I had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 several concerns . First, the new positions over half a million dollars . Salary increases , over $100,000, some positions receiving nearly a $20,000 increase . In my opinion these are -- these were excessive , especially within the context of the world that we currently live in which has caused so much economic uncertainty going into 2021. We were told by the administration to expect a nearly 4 and a half million dollar shortfall in revenue next year. And yet, we were present ed with a budget that added over a dozen new position s and increase salaries and in some cases really significantly . So I personally -- and I know my colleagues did not feel that that made much sense. People are losing their jobs. People are struggling . The fact of the matter is that Scranton is still distress ed. And we clearly have systemic issues that cause our expenditures to increase nearly every year while our revenues remain relatively flat. With all that in mind, I felt that it was very important to scale the Mayor's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 spending back considerably . And I believe that what this Council presented tonight is a more reasonable budget that can be viewed as a compromise . We only added where we felt it was absolutely necessary and crucial to the operations and efficiency of the City. We also made a significant change by narrowing down the various options that the Mayor presented in terms of closing the projected revenue loss of over 4 and a half million dollars . First, we were able to lower that number to under 4 million . And we are hoping that the City could use proceeds from refinancing to cover that gap, if necessary . As I've stated here over the last few weeks, I did think it was a good idea or a wise decision to take money from the excess workers ' comp reserve fund. These funds were earmarked for other postemployment benefit trust fund or an OPEB trust fund that would ultimately result in lowering the cost -- the total cost provided postemployment benefits .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 These funds should be used as an investment to pay down future costs. And it was a move several years ago that was recommended by the City's auditor . It should not be used as a one-time revenue source. We've all seen in the City's history prior administrations take a significant sum of money and dump it into the black hole that is the budget. We wanted to take that money and invest it -- invest it to pay down future costs. And I felt like using that revenue source if we didn't have to would have been shortsighted . Finally , I know that the people of Scranton are watching every penny very closely during these trying times. And we as elected official s should as well. So we made several cuts in terms of new positions . And we decreased salary significantly . And I think overall we saved well over half a million dollars compared to what we were looking at originally with the Mayor's proposed budget. So again, I want to personal ly thank the Mayor and the Business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 Administrator Carl Deeley for their openness , for their willingness to come to Council and be engaged in I think what I would consider a better process than -- and a more open process than in years past. So I am pleased with this. And I will be voting yes for the amendments and ultimately for the budget. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. There was a motion on the floor and a second to amend Item 7-M. And we went through on the question . All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend passage of 7-M as recommended . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 the question , if anyone would like a copy of the amendments that we have written out here, you can certainly send an e-mail to -- or call our office, call the City Clerk's office or e-mail Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. Again, as we -- I mentioned before, unfortunately there was a major technical glitch with the City's server. And we weren't able to post it on the City's website although it is available in the Treasurer 's Office on the first floor of City Hall. But we will get that out to anyone who would like a copy of it. It's very straight forward as Councilman Donahue read through before. And we've personally felt -- all of us felt that these changes were necessary to rein in some of the spending . And again, I think Councilman Schuster said we understand where the Mayor was going. We just did not feel this was the year to do it in the context of the economic uncertainty , people losing their jobs, financial trying times and the fact that next year we're looking down the barrel of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 potential ly a significant shortfall in revenue . So anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-M as amended legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-N. PREVIOUSLY TABLED. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS FOR ADOPTION RESOLUTION NO. 49, 2020 AUTHORIZING THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON BY KEYSTONE SANITARY LANDFILL OF A JOHN DEERE 410 L BACKHOE LOADER SN:1T0410LXVLF382297 PER COSTARS DGS CONTRACT #4400011444 FROM FIVE STAR EQUIPMENT . MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 Committee on Public Works? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-N as amended ; to incorporate the suggested revisions outlined by Council Solicitor in his December 9, 2020 memorandum to Council , which is included in Third Order, Item 3-J, on tonight 's meeting agenda. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Solicitor Hayes, can you just run through briefly the amendment s that are being proposed tonight ? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. Basically what we did is further explain the history which causes Keystone Landfill to be responsible for donating $100,000 of equipment to the City on an annual basis. We thought that that was important that everyone understand why that -- why we're receiving this backhoe . In addition , we struck certain paragraphs that were in the administration 's proposed legislation which provided summaries of the current balance of what is owed to the City pursuant to these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 agreements between Keystone Sanitary Landfill and the City just because we want -- provide d with the underlying documentation which would support those estimate s. In the defense of the public safety -- or the Public Works Director , past administrations did not keep accurate records of the exchange of these items on an annual basis. And it was difficult for him to determine what the balance was. But nevertheless , we're not going to assume anything without the supporting document ation. And that was my recommendation . So that's basically it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Yeah, thank you very much for putting that memo together . And also I would, you know, thank the administration and the DPW Director for putting this agreement before us to memorialize this type of transaction with equipment . I think it's good to be open and upfront with it. And it make sense to put this type of thing on our agenda. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Ye. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Ye. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-N as amended legally and lawfully adopted . MR. DONAHUE : I would like to make a motion to authorize the City Clerk to place a legal notice in the newspaper to cancel the two remaining meetings , December 22 and 29th of 2020. MR. MCANDREW : Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second to authorize the City Clerk to place a legal notice in the paper to cancel the two remaining regular meetings in 2020. On the question ? On the question , we are cancelling these meetings because we do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 not have any legislation coming down to us from the administration . So there would be no point in having a meeting . We'd have nothing to vote on. If we can clear up some of the things with Portnoff , there is an opportunity for us to have a special meeting if need be. So we can still meet from now until the end of the year. If something were to come up we would be able to have a special meeting . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And, Kyle, I think you have one more. MR. DONAHUE : I do. I would like to make a motion to authorize the City Clerk to place a legal notice in the newspaper to advertise City Council meetings for the year 2021 commencing Tuesday , January 5th, 2021 with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 a caucus to be held at 5:45 p.m., and the regular meeting at 630 p.m. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second for the City Clerk to advertise Council meetings for 2021. On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting is adjourned . Thanks everyone . Have a Merry Christmas . Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : You too. Merry Christmas . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
