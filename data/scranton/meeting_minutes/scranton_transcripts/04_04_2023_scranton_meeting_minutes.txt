VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED MARCH 29, 2023 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR CITY COUNCIL . 3-B. OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER DATED MARCH 29, 2023 FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY -MARCH 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a comment on Item 3-B. When looking at the overtime report, we are in the month of March. It's only the third month of the year. When looking at DPW admin overtime , we're at 145.6 percent which is over budget within the first three months of the year. Looking at DPW highway we're about 56 percent in. So we're about half of the way through that budget with only the first quarter of the year here. We just got to be -- on the administration to be watching this time. And we don't want to have another situation where we have a 729 percent over budget account like we had in -- two years ago. MR. KING: Agreed. Any other comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: I have one. DPW is off on Monday so there will be trash or refuse pickup. MR. MCANDREW : I have one. I have two actually . So first of all, I'd like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 wish everybody a blessed Happy Easter and those -- I'm sorry, what? AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible .) MR. MCANDREW : I know. I was going to mention that. Along with Passover if you give me a second here. And I hope everybody has the three F's, family, friends and food -- good food. And secondly, I want to give credit where credit is due. So I saw the article today. I was delighted to see that Mr. Basalyga bought Nativity Convent School and is going to create apartments with it and maintain the historical building as it is because every week we talk about it, the non-profits . We're at 38, 40 percent , you know, buying up properties and taking them off the tax rolls. Well, this is the reverse and it's nice to see this also happen with his commitment and investment in our city. And that is all I have. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I also wanted to wish everyone a Happy Easter and Passover. MR. KING: Anyone else? Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . With regard to the 2021 audit, is there going to be a public caucus on the findings ? MR. SCHUSTER : We had discussed Kohanski coming in with the administration . Frank, did we ever get any answer from the administration as to whether it was something they were interested in? MR. VOLDENBERG : No date has been set as of yet, Mr. Schuster . MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, when they do come in, I would -- I know that it's only Council can ask question s and not the public, but if you would ask the following question for me, why did the administration not provide a management discussion and analysis section to the audit since it's required by generally accepting accounting standards , not recommended . It's required . And I assume that Mayor Cognetti would know that because after all, she has an MBA from Harvard . And if I got my MBA and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 know about it, then she does too. And what about the 10 percent penalty clause, has she made a decision on that? MR. KING: She has not yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I have been reading this wonderful book. This is David McCullough 's biography of Truman who won the Pulitzer Prize. You remember President Truman, don't you? You know the guy that dropped two atomic bombs on Japan and ended World War II? When asked why he did it and would he have done it again do you have any regrets ? He said, "No. I saved the lives of a lot of American service men and I would do it again." The point being that, you know, no matter how difficult a question was that came to him as the president he answered it. And he had a sign on his desk. Remember that little sign? The buck stops here. Now, where is our Harry Truman in this administration ? I want to know. I'm tired of hearing that she hasn't made the decision . She's considering it. None of my questions ever get answered . She ran saying that she was going to bring back accountability 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 and full disclosure , transparency . Where is it? So if there's going to be a caucus on this audit, I would like you to ask her about the MD and A section that did not appear in the audit, a lot of other things that she needs to answer. What's going on with the other union negotiations for the labor contracts ? MR. KING: We expect to have the fire arbitration award by next Tuesday , I believe . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, good. Good. MR. KING: And the police arbitration I believe is going to begin the last week of April. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. That's a lot of cha-chinging , cha-chinging for the attorneys , isn't it? I'm sure it is. Now, the DPW contract that was signed on September 13th and is still not on the City's website , next week it will be seven months. I would question the competency of the lawyers if they are still, you know, dotting I's and crossing T's seven months down the road. What's the status of that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. KING: I spoke to her today about that as well. She's hoping that within the next week or two that will be finalize d and posted on the website . MS. HODOWANITZ : Boy, cha-ching, cha-ching. Those billable hours are piling up. Okay, well, I'm looking forward to the merry month of May when we'll get all the statement s of financial interest on the City's website . But tell me, what is the administration going to do about the 2.26 million dollars that it got last year that should have gone to the school district ? MR. KING: It's my understanding that they asked some questions . The answers they got from -- I don't know if it was from the tax office were kind of vague. They just want to make sure that everything checks off and are going to send it back to the tax office and let them distribute it wherever it goes. MS. HODOWANITZ : And what's going to be the impact on this year's budget? That's a significant amount of money. MR. SCHUSTER : I requested that last week. Frank, did we get anything as of yet? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. VOLDENBERG : Matt Domines , our Finance Director advised that he filled out an extensive recap along with a spreadsheet . And right now it's on the BA's desk to be release d to Council . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find something out in the morning . MS. HODOWANITZ : And Item 5-A, the 75,000 grant for another consultant for Nay Aug Park, how many studies and consultant s have we done for the park system? I mean, why don't we just, you know, outsource all administra tive activities and be done with it? Do we really need another consultant ? I don't think so. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I'm here tonight to talk about DPW, the overtime . Mr. Pietreface the director told Council that he is referring the overtime to the Business Administrator and to Human Resource Department . I can't even begin to understand 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 what that's all about because they have nothing to do with the overtime in the DPW. The director does. He's the one in charge. Maybe he can't handle his job. He doesn't know what else to do about it. I also want to say when they had the street sweeper out for the marathon two weeks ago, the street sweeper came up my street at 7:00 in the morning and woke everybody up. So I wrote the DPW Director and asked him how come the street sweeper was on Railroad Avenue. He said because Railroad Avenue is part of the route. No, it wasn't. There was streets over in Green Ridge that were. But the thing is this. They didn't need to have the street sweeper the whole time on a Sunday when they could have done that on a Friday at regular time. But they didn't. I also got the report from 2022 all the overtime , the reasons that Mr. Smith and Mr. Pietreface had. They gave reasons for 2022 and part of 2023. They just said the reason and the day. They didn't say how many hours. They didn't say how much they made. They didn't say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 what time they came in, what time they left. Now mister -- Steve Teaman, he said the time he came in, how many hours he worked overtime and the amount of hours but no reasons . And in February there were no reasons at all. So if this continues with no overtime records , I think the Council should take a step and put legislation to demand that they have reasons and purpose for whatever they are doing in overtime . This has to stop. Now Rubicon , Rubicon is savings, a time saving for the citizens . It's also going to prove to be a savings for taxpayers as far as our bills because Rubicon is going to take care, different routes, making everything more efficient , equality in routes. But I understand the union guys will never tolerate this. So are you going to have these people come in? I'm waiting for an answer. I've asked you this for three weeks now. Pardon me? MR. KING: We made the request . MR. MCANDREW : I wanted them too, believe me. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MS. FRANUS: Can you please speak louder, we can't hear out here. MR. KING: We made the request . MS. FRANUS: One more time. MR. KING: We made the request . MS. FRANUS: And what was the answer? MR. KING: I think we're waiting to get a -- get them to lock in a date. MS. FRANUS: Could you please get it as soon as possible because the people need to know about the routes because they need to be aware of the changes in the routes when they -- you said earlier , last week or so that they were going to have the routes ready by April. It's April. And the people have to be aware of the change in routes so they know what to do. So what are we going to do about this? Are you going to have Rubicon come in? You keep on saying they haven't saved the city any money only because they don't want to use it. As soon as they start using it -- what has to happen is this. The bottom line is every worker at DPW has to be accountable for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 eight hours of work every day just like anybody else who works for a company or a business . They have to prove that they work for the eight hours. That's is what Rubicon is there for. This has to happen. When I got the report for '22 and 2023 of the workers, not just the supervisors , not one worker had a reason why they work overtime . Do you know how many workers there are? Many. There wasn't one reason. So it has to be the reason, the hours they work, how much they got paid that day, everything has to be documented . That's what the director is there for. He doesn't seem to want to do his job. So I don't know what we're going to do. When do you think you could possibly have them come in? I keep on saying this. And I'd sort of like you to put some pressure on. Could you get back to them tomorrow and ask? It's a yes or no answer. Just look at your calendar and you could set it up. MR. KING: I didn't hear your question , Miss Franus. I'm sorry.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MS. FRANUS: About getting Rubicon -- not Rubicon , having -- getting the director and Chris Smith. MR. KING: I believe we asked Mr. Voldenberg if he would do that for us. MS. FRANUS: He already did? MR. SCHUSTER : He already did. MR. KING: He did, yes. We're waiting for an answer. We're trying to lock in a date for them to come in. MS. FRANUS: For your Council to lock a date or for them to lock the date? MR. KING: Now, we're waiting for -- we're trying to get Rubicon to come in here and speak at caucus and explain to us what's going on with this. MS. FRANUS: But I also want the director to come in and Chris Smith to explain how far they've gotten with this. This is very important . Are you going to have the director come in and Chris Smith the supervisor ? That's who I want to come in. Rubicon were already here. They already said what they were going to do. But nobody wants to implement it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 So that's who I asked to come in for three weeks now. MR. KING: I will speak to the Mayor about this in my meeting with her. MS. FRANUS: Why would you ask the Mayor? Why can't you ask the director and -- MR. KING: Because I don't run the day-to-day operation s of the city. The Mayor does. So I'll ask her. He works for the administration . MS. FRANUS: You have to ask her if the director and the supervisor could come in? MR. KING: The Mayor runs the city and day-to-day operation s. So I'm going to go up to the Mayor and I'm going to ask her this question . MS. FRANUS: When you're asking her that question , would you please ask her what is she going to do about the penalty for the audit? Will you get an answer? Will you be really forceful , Mr. King? MR. KING: I've been trying to do that. Thank you, Miss Franus. Sean Bingham . MR. BINGHAM : Good evening , gentlemen , Dr. Rothchild . My name is Sean 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Bingham . I'm a tax payer in the City of Scranton . I'm also a contractor in the City of Scranton as well. A couple months back in the License and Inspection Department a gentleman was hired who -- in 2017 he was charged with defrauding customer s and he was charged with doing shotty work on his property . Somewhere along the line he ends up getting up a job in the License and Inspections Department , okay? At that point I brought it to the attention . Since then I've been doing -- I have nothing but harassment . And I just feel like I've been targeted on a number of occasions . And I'll tell you a little bit further on. Mr. Oleski is a great man and Eileen Cipriani is a woman of her word. And I stand true to that. She's a very nice lady. I had a couple meeting s with her as well as Mr. Oleski. However , a new hiree was brought in. His name is Joe Farrell . I don't know Joe Farrell . But I'm over at Magistrate Corbett 's office the other day. I'm up on a ladder. We're ripping off this -- the facade of the building , very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 intricate job to do, a very dangerous job. I hear the guy talking to one of my workers on the ground. He looks up. And he says, "Do you got a permit for this?" He's in civilian clothing . I say to him, "Call down the city and find out if I have a permit." Which I have all the right in the world to do. I don't know if he's a neighbor . I don't know what he is. He might have pulled his car over or whatever . So he says it again. I said, "Look it, call down the city and see if I have a permit for it. I'm up on a ladder. I'm up 16 feet in the air." Well, low and behold he asks my worker. And I told my worker don't say a word to him. He points up at me so I slid down my ladder. I didn't use the rungs. I slid down the ladder. I said, "What's up? He said, "You're a real tough guy." I said, "Excuse me, I said, who are you?" He said, "I don't have to tell you who I am." He said who am I to me. Of course, I said some words that I don't want to repeat here and I would certainly not do that. But at that point he gets on the radio with City Hall. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 He's -- something to base. I yell -- I yell into the -- like the whole City Hall heard it. I could sure you that the whole City Hall heard it. (Inaudible ) first of all, I come to find out I did a little work for myself here. He should have showed up on my job with a vest on, number one. I'm a city taxpayer . I paid for that vest. Number two, he has a computer in little car they just gave him. It has a computer . If he wants to know if I have a permit for the job, all he has to do is get in his car, punch in the computer , call down. He was quick to pull that radio out and say three to the base or whatever he was. Why didn't he get on the radio before he got out of the car and wants to create an altercation and escalate the situation ? Clearly it wouldn't end up good for me. But I could assure everybody here, it was not going to end up good for anybody that day. It just simply wasn't. I'm a taxpayer . As much as I hate paying taxes, I still pay my taxes. The bottom line is this. The gentleman wasn't a gentleman that day 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 asking me if I'm a tough guy. You're a city employee . He asked me my name. I told him. And then I asked him his name. He said, "My name is the same as yours." I said, "Really, you're a city employee . You need to tell me your name." I don't have to tell you nothing , which I don't have to tell him nothing . Fact of the matter is I don't. Had the guy pulled up on the job called -- if he was so concerned about me having a permit -- I pulled 250 permits in this city since 2021. And I'll be back because I just filed a right to know for NEIC's monies for 2020, 2021, and 2022. So she just dropped -- Paige Cognetti just dropped a 50 percent fee that I've been telling people is illegally being taken from us. And I was here in 2017. Mr. Gaughan seemed to not want to do anything about it back then, but that's another story. But at the end of the day, I'll be back for that because there's a lot of money that's going to be owed to the resident s of the city. I could assure you of it. Reason being, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 she dropped the 50 percent in January . So I've been right since 2012 and I have a whole stack of papers to prove it. On another note, there's a guy driving around the City of Scranton , Victor Arnetta . If you see him on Facebook look him up. Mr. Smurl, I saw that you stopped over on Cherry Street maybe behind Dunkin Donuts. There was a blight property . You took it upon yourself to get the people there. Thank you. I appreciate that. What the code enforcement is creating is a culture . It's the enforcement against the contractor . Why? Why does that have to be? If I'm getting my permits and this guy knows for a fact I'm getting the permits -- listen, you could ask them. I could pull my -- I have a portal. Anybody else could put it out. I probably have -- from this year alone I probably have 100 permits pulled from the City of Scranton . If Mr. Farrell wants to run around the city telling people about Sean Bingham , he can't do that no more. He can't do that. That's what brought me here today 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 because what he's doing is he's telling people what I did. I didn't do nothing . You get out of the car. You walked up to a situation that probably wouldn't end up good for either one of us, as simple as that. I held my cool. I held my composure . I walked away. Mr. Oleski shows up and, you know, the guy should have had a vest on. Mr. King, all due respect , he should have had a vest on. He should have done his job. You have a vest. You have a walkie-talkie. You have a computer . You have an iPad. Taxpayer money. You want to find out if I have a permit, look in your computer . You'll find it. And you'll be on your merry ole way instead because your Mike Gordon's{sic} best buddy. You want to get out and get a confrontation . Don't poke the bear. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bingham . We'll look into that. MR. BINGHAM : Thank you. Have a good night. MR. KING: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Council , Les Spindler , city resident , taxpayer . I wasn't here last week. And I just want to say my thoughts and prayers are out to the people affected by senseless shooting in Nashville last week, just breaks my heart anybody getting killed, the three nine-year-old kids. It just breaks my heart. And the President wants to ban these military style weapons but the Republicans won't go for it. I've said this before. You just got to vote all the Republicans out of office because they don't want gun control because they're tied to the NRA. And that's a fact. They're just afraid of losing all their money from the NRA. They don't care how many children they killed. And it's senseless. We got to get these military style weapons off the streets. It has nothing to do with mental health. If somebody has a mental health problem and these guns are not on the street, they're not going to get them. Moving on, I'm bringing up again, the corner where I live we were promised about a year and a half ago it's gong to get fixed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 And I'm just wondering if there is any news on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. King, the city engineer reviewed it and he said they cannot pave it because it would create more problems . He's suggesting milling the road and then paving. So I asked DPW to put it on the list for both milling and paving. MR. SPINDLER : Well, as I said, that supervisor came up and he painted lines in each corner of our intersection . All I'm asking for is the curb to get fixed on my corner so it doesn't get flooded every time it rains. To me, it's a simple solution . But if they want to mill it and pave it again, that's up to them. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we get the list of the -- I know there's an OECD list of streets that are going to be paved this summer along with the city -- the list that the city is going to be paving so we know -- I want to see if Mr. Spindler 's road is going to be included on that for the summer. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get both, sir. MR. KING: Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. SPINDLER : My street was paved. My street was paved not that many years ago. As I said, they put, you know, like blacktop curb there. It deteriorates , like, in a year. So I don't know what else they could do. But at least for now at least they could do something temporary . Moving on, I had talked about this for years. The Family Dollar at the top of Linden Street where it meets Main Avenue, coming out of the parking lot -- well, going into the parking lot you are suppose d to turn right off Main Avenue. You're only suppose d to go in that way. Since Family Dollar took over -- when it was Brunetti 's market there was a big arrow pointing towards the back of the store one way. When Family Dollar took it over, they paved over that and now people come onto Main Avenue from Family Dollar. They shouldn 't be -- it's a one way. There's a traffic light there. But the traffic light doesn't face coming out. And when Pat Rogan was on Council , he looked into that. And I know PennDOT was contact ed and somebody else.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 All it needs, if somebody would put a sign up no exit right at the entrance because a couple weeks ago I was pulling in and somebody was pulling out. Well, I couldn't pull into the lot until they moved. And it's a safety hazard. MR. KING: So you're saying they have to exit out from the back side. MR. SPINDLER : Yes, that's the way it's been for years. MR. KING: Right. MR. SPINDLER : Since they painted over that arrow, people come out onto Main Avenue. And that's dangerous because they're just, you know, taking a chance because as I said, if you're pulling out of the lot there's the traffic -- there's no -- the traffic light doesn't face that way. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we -- and I'll talk to DPW or even the, you know, if it would be the police highway division or somebody to see if we can get that rectified ? It sounds like a safety and hazard -- a safety hazard. MR. SPINDLER : The problem is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 that's, you know, Main Avenue is PennDOT . They were involved in it the last time. As I said, Council Rogan left so I don't know. He said there was a meeting with the owner of Family Dollar and PennDOT . They told him -- the owner that he would be responsible if something happened . I think, you know, all it needs is a sign saying no exit one way or whatever . I appreciate it if you could do something . MR. KING: We'll look into that for you. MR. SPINDLER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . My first thing here is, I don't think Council needs the Mayor's permission to do an investigation . It's in the Home Rule Charter that you have the right to do investigation s. So you could bring license and inspection here and sit them at a table and ask them question s and get answers . And you could do the same thing to DPW heads. You know, we've got to stop hiding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 behind the Mayor. We've got to start being realistic . But you know my question is, I asked the Council who was on the board of ECTV. And, Mr. King, I'd like you to tell the city who they are. MR. KING: I don't think I know off the top of my head. MR. MORGAN: I think -- I asked you to find that out. You give them $130,000 a year. Do you fund people you don't know? MR. KING: I will -- let's get the list of who serves on the board of ECTV. MR. VOLDENBERG : I received that information , Mr. King. And I put it in your notes for this evening . MR. KING: Oh, okay. I'll have that in Fifth Order for tonight . So I'll have that answer. MR. MORGAN: Well, read it out loud. I'll listen. MR. KING: I was going to let you speak and then read it during Fifth Order. But you probably won't be here so I will -- DR. ROTHCHILD : I have them up. MR. KING: Go ahead.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 DR. ROTHCHILD : ECTV board members are Tom Blomain , Joseph Gilroy and Laurie Cadden. MR. MORGAN: And how were they appoint ed? DR. ROTHCHILD : I don't have that information but we can find out. MR. MORGAN: You know what, I'd like to have the answer to how they were appoint ed and how long their term is. And the other thing I have here is, when ECTV first started it had a public component . Why was the public component removed ? MR. KING: I don't know that. MR. MORGAN: Well, I'd like to know the answer to that. MR. KING: We'll see if we can get that answer for you. I don't even know if that's an accurate statement but we'll check. MR. MORGAN: Well, they closed their studio. And when you look at the agreement you -- the Council signed with Comcast , Mayor Courtright removed it with the Council . And you know the troubling thing is that a former Council President who is running for county 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 commission er voted to remove it. He's also the same person that voted to change the name on a street in downtown Scranton for Mr. Biden. And the most troubling thing of all now that's going on is another mark of the residents of the city because there was suspicion money transfers through the government . The Congress looked into them and they found 15 of them involving Biden family and 30 million dollars of Chinese money coming to the Bidens. And it's pretty troubling where we find ourselves. But, you know, I'm just trying to -- I'd like the Council to tell me, you know, why the public component went away. I'd like this Council to find out the answer to that question and why it can't be restored because we should never turn in a fascist nation. And that's what our government's done to us. They want to stifle the public. They don't want the public to have an opinion . They don't want the public to be heard. They want to rule over the residents , roughshod. And, you know, you think that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Scranton Times would step into the void and report what's taking place in these meetings . But, you know, it's so very troubling what's happened to our country . You know, last week I made a comment about the school district s and about kids using litter boxes. So when I got to work the next day and the guy says, oh, it's going on in my kid's school district too. So, you know, I'm just so thoroughly amazed at a lack of honest investigative reporting taking place just like the city is spending 30 years in distress that never should have went there, never. There was no need to ever have gone into distress . You know, and the troubling thing that I have with this podium is that we have no real Republican candidate s running for office. And the couple that were here won't step to the podium and speak their mind. I don't know why. And, you know, the other thing is, we elect people to Council itself and they never attended a meeting . And you speak and you call people and you do caucuses . And I'm just wondering is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 anybody really thinking ? Do you come here prepared for these meeting s and do research before you get here? Or do you just take the spiel that some of these, you know, running by you and take it for fact because when you look at this city as it is now, it's terrible . And somebody 's got to start thinking . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . You know, you people got a problem in the Licensing Bureau and you won't acknowledge it. You're going to have to address it sooner or later. There's no leadership in that place. I'd like to say a word or two to the Nay Augers I guess I could call -- Geisinger took advantage of the city's ignorance . Some code should have been -- years ago codes against this happening should have been in place. This -- this shouldn 't be no surprise to any of those people. It took years of planning by Geisinger , financial planning , bankers , real estate people. This wasn't a secret. Buying the property , it was known 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 for a couple years what was coming. Some of those people were made offers well before the whole neighborhood disappeared before our eyes. And worst of all, the city knew this. Right from the beginning years ago, nothing done. Look at how many houses and how much increase in taxes it's going to take to replace what Geisinger 's done. What the university of Lackawanna College and the rest of these phoney people hiding behind the Pure Charity Act have taken a third of our -- our taxable properties are gone. You know these people -- you, you want to see the future for your neighborhood , get in your car and go down Capouse to Green Ridge and go up Green Ridge to North Main and go down North Main and take a good look at the 2000 block, 2800 block full of cars on the sidewalk because there's nothing -- one after another illegal boarding houses. Nothing 's been done for years. And I don't want to hear I'm making it up. I've walked my dog. I'm telling you, I walked that neighborhood . I know these people. I've talked to them -- well, you can't talk to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 half of these people. They don't speak English . They have nothing to lose either. They're transit . That was a -- that bunch of houses I could remember well 25 years ago. Now, these big four or five bedroom houses around Nay Aug, they're going to be turned into that eventually . The first one to sell and get out of there is the only one that is going to be well off. The rest of them are going to lose. They're going to be paying insurance on 3, $400,000 house to replace if it burns that's worth a third or a quarter of that now. That neighborhood is over. And you people -- you people folded instead of fighting this years ago when it was known what it was coming. I'm no chicken little. But you could sit -- I could sit at the Taurus Club and hear things that all of a sudden it's amazing it's a discovery for people. This wasn't any secret what happened . A demise of this neighborhood could have been prevented . It could have been prevented if we had a Mayor, if we had an administration and probably if we had more interest from Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 in the city instead of downtown all the time. Like I said, you got a bad problem in that Licensing Bureau. You haven't heard the half of it like some of the stories told to me. I ought to -- I've written them all down and tell you what goes on in that place. Mr. Oleski should have been fired last year when the lawsuit happened. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: And Sunday has no business whatsoever representing the people of this city. He lied to -- MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. KING: Mary Beth -- I'm going to do my best here -- Mikolayczak . MS. MIKOLAYCZAK : Mikolayczak . MR. KING: Mikolayczak , okay. Thank you. MS. MIKOLAYCZAK : Hi. Good evening . My name is Mary Beth Mikolayczak . And I lived in Scranton all my life. I have lived in the beautiful Nay Aug Park Hill Section for over 40 years now. I'm here on behalf of the Hill neighbors . And we still have unanswered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 questions regarding the proposed zoning. The Hill neighbors want to know if any of you Council members have in hand or have seen any studies performed by Geisinger or the City in regards to air quality , noise, lighting , traffic , and stormwater runoff. Has anyone seen any of those studies ? Okay, if not, could Geisinger or the City provide this information to City Council and the neighbors by the next meeting so that the neighbors and Council have ample time to review these studies prior to the April 18th public hearing ? On air quality , there will be added cars, construction vehicle s and dirt. As for noise, we have a beeping constantly going on as cars exit the garage. How will this blend in with a residential neighborhood ? Lighting , garage lights are now currently shining in neighbor 's rooms and backyards . Calls were made to Geisinger regarding these garages . And the response was we'll look into it and another response was we don't have money to address it. As for traffic , Geisinger is going to be bringing in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 over 1600 cars per Geisinger . And this is going to create a lot of bottlenecks and also make traffic worse. According to Geisinger 's tentative plans that they showed us, it looks like they want to obtain the 300 block of Colfax which is currently an operable road. So if you take that road out of the picture , how is traffic going to be handled ? As for stormwater runoff, where's the water going to go? If you put up garages , currently when we have heavy rains, the water pours down the street and there's flooding at Linden and Harrison on that corner. There's also flooding s on Mulberry and Harrison and down at the very bottom, Prescott and Mulberry by Turkey Hill, it's like a lake. So if you are going to have garages put up and no grassy areas, where's all that water going to run to? So the neighbors want to know if -- that we are not against better healthcare . And we are not against expanding an ER, but at what cost to our neighborhood ? We're still resident s. We still pay taxes. And we want to live comfortably with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 all of the extra stuff. So we hope that Council will obtain this information . And before making this critical decision if you don't have it, can you request it before you vote? Is that something you could do? MR. KING: We can make a request to see if this project with Geisinger -- check and see if they've had any of these study done, noise, air quality , traffic studies , lighting and stormwater . MS. MIKOLAYCZAK : And air pollution also too. DR. ROTHCHILD : I've asked about air quality , the traffic and noise and lighting studies and I was told that hasn't been done yet. It seems that they want to wait to know what the zoning is prior to performing those studies but that they do anticipate performing them. I'll ask if it could include all of these issues that you mentioned . MS. MIKOLAYCZAK : Because we feel it's very important to have them done and have you seen them as Council members before you place your final vote. And we'd like to see them also, the neighbors . Thank you very much. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. KING: Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to speak? MR. SCHUSTER : Frank, I was going to mention this in Fifth Order, but while we're on this topic, if we could include in there line of sight studies , lighting studies , and day and night rendering s of the proposed project . I know we included traffic studies in there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll include them, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I understand that in looking through Geisinger documents , it's quite amusing when you look at some of the fine detail, the legalese, the deceptive presentation that makes a group or organization look good that hides behind what they're required to do anyway. What I'm referring to is they specific ally put in some of the documents that they are providing a 10 percent of their property is going to be put to green space. What is green space? Well, it's where you don't have buildings on where you put grass.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Some people actually call it in zoning a mandatory setback from the roadway . If the properties have a mandatory setback and you're not building on that mandatory setback and that mandatory setback is 10 percent of the property , saying that you're going to give 10 percent of the property to green space is saying you are going to give 10 percent that you are mandate d to do anyway. So in looking at some of the legal terms of what they're giving, well, they're not giving. What's there is what they are require d to hand out by zoning in setbacks anyway. So the gift that's thrown in there as if it is a benefit to the community is just what they're require d to do by law. But it makes them look better and sound better. Joan hopped in and hit one of my question s for today. One of my question s was, how much has this body authorized and paid for consultants since 2023? I believe we've had two or three runs at the Nay Aug Park Pool. We've had another one for parks come -- that's come up for an entire park section . We have one tonight I think for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 $100,000 for consulting . We have the AAR -- the Recovery Act co-consulting company to take public feedback , ignore it, and put forth the City's plan for what they want to do in spending with it. We have the universities group out of Wilkes-Barre of multiple universities who are overseeing the compliance by being a consultant company to consult on whether or not the consultant company is actually properly consulting . On average , we're -- the walkability study. So far we're up around $130,000 at the last time I looked for consulting on the walkability study. How much in total has been spent by this body for consulting consultants ? How much have we consulted for such as in DPW with the new routes that we paid for and been promised but we have not seen results . How much of that money when all totaled and contracts for an entire year for consulting ? I'm sure that's a pretty big chunk, maybe 25, maybe 50 percent of a Nay Aug Park pool. Moving onto another subject is I was promised which I hope you have in Fifth Order 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 for the -- it was announced there was a special session . I was promised that would you put forward the case numbers . MR. KING: I have that. MR. COYNE: Awesome . I just wanted to touch back with that. I didn't think that was going to happen. And last, the women's week is over -- the women's month is over. I want to send out a special hello to my mother out there in Philadelphia who happens to have been the first person to run for City Council in the City of Scranton . She was actually told way back when that women don't run for City Council . Women run for the school board. So that was the first woman ran even though she did not make it in that vote as a City Council member, she did run. But prior to that she was also the -- one of the women on the Governance Committee who set forth the City's official charter . And I would like to thank her and say I'm glad that you brought me up to take a look at politics and see how things are built from the ground up. Thanks, mom. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. RINALDI : Good evening , Council , Dave Rinaldi 212 Colfax. I want to start off with a couple of thank yous. First of all, I want to thank Frank. He provided me with a copy of the proclamation s that were distributed last week. So that leads me into thanking Councilman McAndrew for that ceremony for honoring all the women in this county. I thought it was wonderful , a great thing to do. Thirdly, I want to thank Dr. Rothchild for coming to the Hill Association meeting last Wednesday . I could say that she heard a lot from all of my neighbors up there. But one thing that I do remember from that, Dr. Rothchild , was one of the neighbors brought up the fact that one of the things that Geisinger had promised was neonatal care. And I wanted to read to you one sentence from Geisinger 's 2021 community health needs assessment for the northeast region. "The birth rate in northeast region is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 general ly lower than the state and declining in all counties except Luzerne ." So I think that brings home the point that she was trying to make there. That leads me to the second thing I wanted to talk about. And while I was doing some research , I found that the CEO of Geisinger made 4.6 million dollars last year. Last meeting we had a surgeon , no doubt has done very well. Geisinger has made a lot of money for a lot of people. Whether they'll do that for our community I think is an open question . But what I wanted to talk about was you have all of this money. And I wanted to talk about my neighbors on Wheeler Avenue. There's about eight or nine properties there on the even side of Wheeler . They're going to have a structure 100 feet, the structure itself. And then the topography falls off. So they'll be even lower than that. Does Council really think that anyone is going to buy those homes for single-family homes? What this expansion -- the way it is now that Geisinger is going to do is it's going to make it almost all rental properties because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 those are the people who are going to live in those houses. If you have a family and you have kids, do you really want your kids to be out in the backyard to look at something like that? So I'd like you to keep that in mind. And lastly, I wanted to ask you something . I'm a little confused by SAPA. Two weeks ago Don King was here and he explained SAPA and the regionalization of zoning. And the thing I don't understand is, is this zoning ordinance amended -- let me get this. Okay, it would be File of the Council No. 55 -- no, I'm sorry, No. 54, 2023. Is that the zoning map that's going to be in SAPA? Because if it is, then, of course, you realize that until Dunmore passes SAPA, it will not go into effect. So I'm confused here why the movement is so quick to do this now. And it appears to me anyway that what you're really amending is the current ordinance as opposed to the one -- to the one in SAPA, which I brought up the first time I was here because the map wasn't changed on the SAPA website . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 So I'm wondering if you could clarify that for me. Is it really the SAPA ordinance that we're talking about here with the zoning change or is it something in between ? This previous Council sat on SAPA for 18 months while everybody else had passed it. And I'm sure Geisinger and the administration were getting their plans together for this. So please clarify that. Are we really talking about SAPA here or are we talking about a zoning change prior to that which will not push SAPA forward because as I said, it will not take effect until Dunmore ratifies it. So thank you. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Attorney Rinaldi . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I would like to point out something that went on 50 years ago when I was in high school. Our science teachers called to our attention overpopulation . They called it the population time bomb. And, well, back in the 70s we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 the prolifers and everybody . They wanted to disseminate or distribute family planning to the third world. Well, guess what, now they're at our borders . And it's -- those countries are just bulging with people. So before you continue blaming Joe Biden for everything that he's not willing to set up machine gun nests every 150 feet at the border or whatever , those people have no choice now. Do I really want all types of people here? No, I don't. However , we missed the boat. And that's all there is to it. A cold hearted scientific fact we missed the boat on population growth now for 50 years. And people are just bulging out of their countries . There's no resources there for them. They will have no kind of life there. And what to do about it, I don't know because in a couple years there'll probably be one more space for them, I guess, not my concern anymore . I'd like to call your attention once again mining under Nay Aug Park. It was illegal mining. There may not even be a map.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 But before any plans of heavy construction up there like swimming pools, better find out if you have anything under it to support it. And once again my favorite subject , tax exempts . Now, Lackawanna County has 18 percent tax exempt property . Now, that's everything , courthouses , fire halls, you name it. However , Scranton has 66 and two-thirds percent of that. And they are one-third more of less of the population of Lackawanna County. So in other words, our tax burdened is double for tax exempt properties . And I'm not anybody -- I'm not criticizing them, but that is a fact. And, you know, I thought about this walkability a long time. I didn't like it to begin with. I don't think we should turn downtown Scranton into a theme park. But I think it would be safer if we had all way stops or four way stops and stop lights so pedestrians could get across the street. There are three people at least that I know of killed at the corner of Wyoming and Lackawanna Avenue within about the last 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 years. Some were hit by bus drivers . Now, but the thing is if you could come down here during the day and imagine all of these cars and people abiding by stop signs and what it would cost if that plan fails. If that plan fails and you would have torn out all of the stop lights and all of this other apparatus , probably cost you millions of dollars , millions and millions of dollars . And then, you know, at a stop sign there's always a debate on who caused it, always a debate. People pull out and they -- they're looking at you like -- and you're the guy that didn't stop at the stop sign, you know? So, I mean, I could argue with the policeman there later but what good does that do? He has no way of reviewing it. Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn son. You too. MS. KOLOSKI : Doris Koloski , Hill Section resident . I just wanted to clarify . I had a question on -- the question s that Mary Beth brought up about Geisinger doing all these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 studies and everything which I fully agree with here that that should be done. But my concern was how come the City isn't doing those studies before passing it -- anything because once you -- once it's passed if everything floods or the other things with the city, it's kind of too late. And then it's the City's job to spend the money to clean it all up as I'm understand ing this. Why would the studies be done after the zoning was approved ? It would seem to me that the people that are approving the zoning should be researching and studying the affects of that zoning and all that. So I may be wrong, but I don't see how. So if there is a way I'm wrong, explain to me. Now, on another subject , this is -- I had spoken about cutting down that curb for the handicapped on Olive Street and Colfax Avenue. There is also another one on Gibson Street and Colfax on the odd side of the street. But you could go up the glassy knoll there and get out on without having to worry about that curb. And that still hasn't been done. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 didn't bring it up again before because it was still cold out. But now the weather is getting nicer and I think it could be done while the weather is nicer. The other thing I just wanted to bring up is I just want to urge all of you because I'm sure you know people like down at the State House of Representative and Senate in Harrisburg . And I would like you to urge the lawmakers down there to please vote to pass the bills -- unfortunately I forgot my paperwork that the bill number is on again. But the both bills that are up for approval would be the reporting of lost and stolen firearms , safe storage firearms , and extreme risk protection orders and universal background checks. There's -- I could get the number for you next week. I just walked out of the house in a hurry and forgot the sheet of paper with the bill numbers on it. But I would like to see that addressed . I would also like to see if any Council people because they, like I said, are familiar with the Democratic parties and Republican parties could also check out. I'm going trying to find out there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 a bill laying down in Harrisburg that's been buried with the LGBTQ community to afford the protection s and hate crimes which in the State of Pennsylvania don't exist. They have to go get their protection through the federal . So there is protection afforded but why are we one of the states -- and I know that's not your job it's the state. But as members of the party and being in the thing, I was hoping you could urge your buddies and friends down there to bring that bill forward again now and work on passing it. And that's all I have to say. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Koloski . MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . A small thing first, at 842 Moosic Street, there's a house that is obviously not occupied . And in front of it there's a trash can that is filled with just twigs. And underneath that there is some timbers , big things like railroad stuff. It's been there for months and months and months. And nobody picks it up. Now I know they haven't probably since there's nobody there to pay their garbage thing, but I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 don't know. I know there are other places that get their garbage picked up that haven't paid their fee. MR. KING: Can we ask code enforcement to look into that, please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. And I'll have DPW stop by also. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then last year on the paving program , there was a -- there were two different versions with the East Mountain or Mountain Lake Road. One took the repaving from the fire department from Engine 10 to the end of Mountain Lake and then picked up on Derby Avenue. Another one had it going from the fire company to Derby Avenue. And so what happened was, it didn't -- it stopped at the end of Mountain Lake. And it did get -- and it's a short distance but it's a nasty drive. And my car would like to know if that could get paved this summer. MR. KING: Miss Schumacher , is that -- so I think where it ends at the lake there that becomes Birch Street.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. MR. KING: Birch. So if we could check and see if that section -- because there literally is probably about 150 yards, maybe 200 meters that's not paved because then Derby is paved. There's just that section . So see if we could get that on the list. I don't even know what the number of that section is there. Colleen Hartman lives on there and Bob Bolus is off to the side, the Oaks I know live -- MS. SCHUMACHER : You're using my time, okay. MR. KING: I'll give you extra time. MS. SCHUMACHER : Has there been any -- any changes in a program or anything for the pilot collecting payments in lieu of taxes? MR. KING: There is an RFP that's going to go out. Matt Domines is putting out an RFP for -- to conduct a HUP test, taking existing nonprofit s and, you know, I think I mentioned this once before that they may have qualified for nonprofit originally . And now here it might be 10, 12, 15, 20 years later so there's this thing called the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 HUP test which is done to determine whether it still qualifies as nonprofit . That's something we're looking to do. And also, we're going to try to, you know, I talked to the Mayor about this as well look to maybe start approach ing rather than just sending letters out, maybe try to set some meeting s up with some of the nonprofits that don't contribute at this time. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, yeah, I've been after the County Commissioners as well. And I think it should actually be a county job, not just a city job. But I'll settle for the city if I have to. Now, what about the rights of way for the Meadowbrook II, have we increased them at all? MR. SCHUSTER : They have not. MS. SCHUMACHER : They have not. It's going to hold up Meadowbrook II if we don't get moving if it doesn't happen. Otherwise , we wouldn't have an authority . Okay, now, I want to end with something that really bothered me. There was an article in the paper. It was the 29th of March, I believe , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 about the Court slashing money damages that were given to Mr. Young and his neighbor Kennedy for that horrible hole they had in their yard for such a long time. And it ended with one of our people, the City Solicitor Jessica Eskra saying they were are obviously very pleased with the Court's decision . Now, what it did was took a lot of money away from the both the Youngs and the Kennedys . And you guys were all out there. You know what it was like. This just didn't go back to the teens. This goes back to the beginning of at least maybe even the '95 area. That was a conduit . Everybody knew it was there. And the City did not do their job and fix it then. They waited until it got into this big thing that caused a lot of people a lot of pulled muscles and just, you know, not knowing every time it rained whether or not you were going to have water in your basement . That plays on you. And I just think it was inappropriate for a city person. I know they were part of it, the Law Department was part of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 it. But going back and having something that had been done with a jury and giving them something for what they've been put through for the last several decades I think it was probably fair. But I don't think it was fair for officials to be very happy for the City and not for the people. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Schumacher . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton City taxpayer . I'm amazed to learn that $130,000 has been spent on the walkability studies . I've been doing it for free for you guys and will gladly continue . So the budget comment s tonight about stormwater and water runoff, surface runoff at the -- with the construction parking garage and about difficulty in crossing the roads and whatnot, but I'm curious as to why there is not as much complained about the stormwater management in downtown Scranton right now given all the parking lots. I'm out there quite regular ly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 walking around and driving around. And all of those parking lots obviously they don't absorb water. It just runs off into the street. But they're also completely empty, more or less. Nobody is using those parking lots. There's so many parking spaces there. I haven't had time to count them all yet. And they are just empty all time, these huge lots. So when we're considering , you know, removing properties from these nonprofits in order to build their tax base, we should also be considering infill development to increase the tax base on properties that aren't useful, especially -- especially in downtown . When you know, it could be high density , very walkable and hosting homes and businesses to actually generate profit for the community and quality tax revenue . So we are using -- we're not using these parking lots. The public isn't using these parking lots. And they're eating up huge portion s of the potential tax base for the City of Scranton right in the downtown in our prime real estate. And there needs to be something done about that. It's -- the removal of these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 parking lots isn't just going affect stormwater management . But it's also going to increase tax base and promote walkability which increases the profitability of small businesses and housing . So people will be able to have more houses, pay more property taxes, shop more and spend more time in their community , building their community . And on that note, as they're walking around in these areas, we should consider improving our actual pedestrian infrastructure in terms of crosswalks . Right now in downtown , the sidewalk s are pretty good and the crosswalks are at about the highest standard we could expect in this country . But so many of them flood in rainy conditions or get packed with snow during snow conditions . That crosswalk right up here at the corner gets filled with water whenever it rains. And this impedes pedestrian movement and discourages people from walking and punishes people with poor mobility and thus increases our automotive reliance . A good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 crosswalk , a pedestrian first crosswalk should be at sidewalk level. There should be no stepping down off the sidewalk into the street in order to cross. It should be crossing at the grade of the sidewalk with a ramp that cars go up and over, not only does this fix problem s with traffic by enforcing slow downs in high urban and high walkability areas; but it also allows pedestrians and especially people with mobility issues to cross safely without having to worry about rolling or shuffling through snow, ice, and water. This will also help in our neighborhoods that are being filled with parking garages with stormwater management because we're not going to have all of this water washing down through and into the street level crosswalk s where they're pooling up. Adding drains we know can't help because that's a mobility inhibitor for anyone with a cane or in a stroller or a wheelchair. So the only real solution is to build quality crosswalk s at the sidewalk grade. This is being done all over the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 world in large urban areas. Pretty much any city in Europe has these high quality crosswalk s. And they're the most densest areas. And Scranton might not be as dense as Paris or Amsterdam . But we still have a high population and an elderly population and people who are -- have mobility issues. If we want to see a family grow, you know, it was mention ed earlier that maternity rates are down. If we wanted to, you know, support people who are giving birth and now are having children are going out with their strollers and small children . Stepping off the road into these basically small pools, especial ly in the winter time we all know how bad they could get is not really helpful to pedestrian experience . And it is quite against the average citizen 's way of life. And it increases car dependency . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. My first one is for you, Mr. Voldenberg . If you will ask our highway department if they will go into the 100 block of Watres Drive for an increase d police presence . There's a high rate of speed traffic and they can't pull out of their driveway s. It's very difficult . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll notify them, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. My second one was, last week I had sent up to the Law Department a request to look at our ordinance for commercial vehicles parked in the city. And this week this -- this weekend there was a tractor parked on the corner of Pittston Avenue and Genet Street. I took picture s. And I sent them to Mr. Voldenberg who had sent them up to the Law Department today. They evidently were there for over 10 hours because I left and when I came back 10 hours later they were still there. It seemed they were rebuilding the rear end of their truck there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could ask them again and send the other picture s I've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 sent you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MR. SMURL: -- what we need to fix this ordinance for commercial vehicle s and cars parked on sidewalks . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And I was informed that Railroad Avenue, the entire Railroad Avenue project is going to be paved within three or four weeks. And that's going to be -- I believe it's Leeward Construction and that should start soon and happy Passover and Happy Easter to everyone . And that's all I have. MR. KING: Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have few. Going off of what Mr. Smurl just said, Frank, can you reach out to the DPW Director to see if he could get -- when Mr. Preambo was with DPW I did request a meeting . We were looking into the ordinance for pave cuts and double utility poles that I noticed were popping up all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 over -- I should say weren't being taken down all over the city. I met with Mr. Preambo to discuss how as Council we would address how our restoration projects were insured that the utilities would complete these project s. Can you please reach out to him? I'm not in a big rush here but whenever he has time if he would like to get together with myself to have that same discussion . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll set it up, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Secondly , we talked to -- we talked about the -- some of the studies up on -- up near the Geisinger or for Geisinger . We're going to reach out directly from -- City Council is going to reach out directly to Geisinger , correct , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. Also, I brought it up in caucus about some of the amendments I had brought up in the last few weeks. So just starting that discussion as we move towards the final vote on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 our zoning ordinance , I'll speak with Solicitor Gallagher to tighten up any of the language that's needed and have that present ed for that final vote. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I did, in fact, last week go to the Hill Neighborhood Association meeting . And I thought it was really helpful to hear from residents . And I received a number of complaints but also helpful suggestions from them. And I do want to assure the resident s in the Hill that I'm forwarding those along to the appropriate departments for those complaints . There are many things that didn't have to do with Geisinger that have been problems for the neighborhood for quite a while that I'd like to get fixed. There were a number of them that I think would fall under PennDOT 's jurisdiction because they had to do with Harrison Avenue, which is a state road. And so I wanted to mention just a few of those tonight so that Mr. Voldenberg 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 could send those along to PennDOT . So there was a request for a traffic study at the intersection of Mulberry and Harrison to -- for the potential of a left turn signal because people are finding it difficult to turn onto Harrison Avenue. And also, I believe we had a traffic study completed along Harrison Avenue in the past because of the parking of vehicles on the curbs but also for pedestrian 's safety and vehicles travelling too quickly . I haven't had a chance to look back at that study. But I would like to also request from -- from PennDOT that they paint the lines of the intersection s. So going up Harrison you have Vine, Olive and then Pine. And the one at Vine and Harrison is fading very badly. And they're just two straight lines. It really doesn't look like much of a crosswalk even when they are painted. So perhaps there could be a consideration for more signage for pedestrian crossings . I know when I'm driving up there that no one stops when there's pedestrians who want to cross the road. I will make sure to stop. But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 wouldn't cross that road with my daughter much less my dogs or myself because knowing that it's dangerous and that vehicles won't stop and they're travelling at fast speeds up that road. And then there's not even any crosswalk s that were -- that were painted. I don't know how long ago they would have been, but there's none there now at Harrison and Olive. So that's on that street. And I also wanted to request that they maintain the property that's right after the bridge on Harrison Avenue. That's part of their property . I know we've had conversations with them in the past. And they said they were going to put it on their regular maintenance schedule . But as we found over, you know, the last couple of warmer seasons that they haven't consistently been keeping up with it. And I've been asking them every month or so, can you have someone come by and cut down the weeds and mow it? It shouldn 't be that hard. I'm sure they have other properties that they maintain in the city that are part of theirs. And lastly, I know that portions of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 Lackawanna Avenue are also a state road. And that road is in desperate need of paving and line repainting too. So I would like to include that in my request . That's everything that I have for PennDOT . And I also wanted to bring up with the railroad authority because one of the complaints I received last week was that along the railroad crossing s that some of them are really in poor shape and deteriorating . And I think I brought that forward in the past about at least one of them that was on South Washington Avenue that they had worked to repair. And so it's better than it was but there are a lot of them throughout the city that I think really need to get addressed . So I'd like to know, you know, which ones have them go out to all of them and determine what -- what railroad crossings need to be fixed so that vehicles aren't getting damaged by driving over them. And that's all that I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I first want to address Mr. Spindler 's public comment . I believe that I asked for this maybe last year. And I asked that the paving list for both OECD and DPW be posted on the website . To your knowledge , are they? MR. VOLDENBERG : They are not posted as of today. They are a work in progress . MR. MCANDREW : All right. I'm sorry, so the correspondence -- when you send correspondence inquiring on behalf of Mr. Spindler for that itself, can you please ask that maybe they would put these as current as they can on the website because we get a lot of question s about is my street on or is it going to be on? I think it would be great if we could direct them and they'll have access to it. And then number two, so Mrs. Mikolayczak came in and, you know, she spoke tonight and she's always here. And it's great to hear her speak. But you know what, I'm surprised that none of these studies have been done, none of them. I could see one or two or maybe we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 have to do one after, but none. One, two, three, four, five, plus maybe two that Mr. Schuster added. So I don't think this is the norm. I think this is the cart before the horse. And I think that these are important data to make an informed decision , an overall decision about zoning. So I agree to -- and please get this in writing . I know you're going to reach out. I don't want to go through the city and ask if these -- to confirm if these studies have been done or not. I agree that it should come from us. And, of course, we want something in writing . I'd love to have it at least, you know, by next week but or definitely before the public hearing . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll speak with Don King first thing in the morning . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then thirdly , I got a bunch of calls over the weekend about Battaglia field. Some refer to it as the Oxy plot, okay, and it's absolutely horrendous . There was some vandalism in February . The concerns I got that there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 needles, glass, fecal matter in the field. The power has never been restored. It was cut as part of the vandalism , which means that a lot of stuff that was stolen but they -- they can't operate the concession stand. They can't -- they can't use the scoreboard. This is something we own -- the city owns. What else, like I said, there's dog dropping s. There's garbage everywhere . There's glass everywhere . So this is a huge, huge safety issue. You know, a couple weeks ago we saw the beautiful presentation about what we're going to do with all the parks. Well, guess what, kids play little league now. They start now until July. So this is unacceptable . They'll be playing -- they'll be playing little league before they even get to the parks. And I know, Mr. Voldenberg , I sent you these concern s. And I know you reached out to administration . And this was, you know, as soon as I got them I sent them to Mr. Voldenberg and he was fantastic about it. But could you -- did we receive any -- any update? And I know I'm not the only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 one bringing this to City Hall. There's a lot of people complaining . MR. VOLDENBERG : The code enforcement manager and the inspector will be there in the morning . I'm waiting on feedback from SPD regarding the needles and other issues. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. And that all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have some responses from some of the citizens from last week. Joan Hodowanitz , the 2022 payroll preparation tax update. We received the 2022 PPT tax update from the BA's office today. And the report will be placed in third or for next week's meeting . Berkheimer is expected to mail the 2023 PPT tax returns to taxpayer s in the next few days. The first quarter for 2023 PPT payment is due on or before May 31st. The 2023 PPT return will include combined city PPT rate of 0.787 percent . And the Scranton School District PPT rate of 0.7553 percent of 1.034 percent . Berkheimer will distribute PPT receipts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 proportionally to each political subdivision . Tom Coyne had requested information about executive session , which occurred I believe two weeks ago, maybe three weeks ago. So there was discussion on litigation . The case numbers were 15 CV 6933, 19 CV 4243, 17 CV 1403, 17 CV 5338, 15 CV 3499. There were also discussion on personnel matter concerning the resignation of our parks director . Recent appoint ment for an engineer coordinator and Environmental Advisory Council were discussed in executive session . Norma Jeffries , OECD advised the grant application is under review by the Commonwealth Finance Authority CFA and will advise. A $371,000 grant was transfer red from the county to city in July of 2022. And OECD submitted the remaining grant amount. Marie Schumacher , PennDOT is reviewing the barrier at Jefferson Avenue and Biden interchange for safety update to make the structure more visible and safer for drivers entering that interchange . The City confirmed railings to lower level steps are not include d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 in the building code or ordinance . Our Council office is contacting administration for the next steps. Les Spindler , corner of Bulwer Street and North Rebecca Avenue, after reviewing I think it was mentioned earlier , city engineer , DPW advised placing curb cuts will attract water at this point. Milling and repaving must be done to accommodate the issues from the issue of paving without milling . So we did request to see if we could get information to see if that's on the list. Jessica Osborne , she requested permit parking on the 1300 block of Sanderson Avenue. This was declined per the Scranton Police Chief, Tom Carroll . He said the City Zoning Board and office advised sufficient parking is available for patrons . Once the rear lot is paved, it will be sufficient to keep cars off of Sanderson Avenue. The owner is awaiting spring opening of the asphalt plant to pave the lot. And this is by Groove Brewing on Sanderson Avenue. Chief Carroll further advised that the Scranton Police Department can readily respond to any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 illegally parked vehicle s such as driveway s and handicap parking spots. And the resident of the block -- a resident of the block had handicap parking sign. Scranton Police Department will enforce any illegally parked vehicle s. And then he also indicated granting permit parking to a bar business in a city neighborhood may set a precedent where other residents with similar conditions and situations made demand permit parking, especially those neighborhoods where the bar/tavern does not have a parking lot. Oh, then we mentioned Lee Morgan, the Board of Director for ECTV are Tom Blomain , Joe Gilroy and Laurie Cadden. Also was mentioned earlier whether we come here prepared and the answer is yes. What but we're not prepared -- it's impossible to prepare for every possible question that would be tossed at you up here. So we try to be as prepared as possible with the legislation that's present ed before us. And as you could see in Fifth Order we try to get back to our citizens with these answers as best that we can. But do we always 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 have all the answers immediately that evening , we don't. And but as you probably all heard as my fellow Council persons have indicated that as public servants and City Council members , this is just part of what we do. We are attending neighborhood meeting s. We're meeting with constituent s out, you know, throughout the community . We're serving on various boards. So there is a lot more to serving on this Council other than just two and a half to three hours that occurs here. Anyone that has ever served in an elected office probably knows that. I was stopped about Battaglia field at Gerrity 's today. It doesn't matter what store, what restaurant , anywhere I go I'm stopped . I have to write -- I always try to type it in my phone so that I remember . If I don't do that I'm going to forget. But we do try to do our best. I do want to applaud DPW with their tree cutting division . I've noticed Tony Santoli has been going around spray painting trees that desperately need to come down. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 I don't know if they're ash trees or if they are infected or if they're dying. But he goes by, inspect s them and puts a paint marking on them and then our DPW crew comes and takes them down because it's -- it creates a very dangerous situation along some of our roadway s. I would rather have DPW cut them down then have one fall down onto one of our vehicle s or someone get hit with a tree driving through the city.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 216, 2023 – ADDING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF “AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) SOLICITOR ” TO THE CITY SOLICITOR , JESSICA ESKRA, ESQUIRE ’S PORTFOLIO AND 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 ALLOCATING ARPA ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS ACCORDINGLY PURSUANT TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S ARPA SPENDING PLAN (RESOLUTION 69 OF 2022). MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I spoke about this last week, you know, 4 percent of our ARPA funds are -- can be used for administrative costs. However , even though that's the case, I don't know if we should be spending all of that 4 percent on that administrative cost. We did revamp the Law Department this year. We changed a lot of those salaries in that Law Department . So with that being said, I was under the impression that Romilda Crocamo was hired and part of her responsibilities may fall under what we're allocating here to Miss Eskra. So I'm going to be voting no for this. But with that said, I'm going to have a question for Frank. Frank, Miss Crocamo was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 hired at $45,000 last May or June. Does she still fall under that salary or has she been shuffle d with the Law Department ? And can we get a list of who is currently working in the Law Department with their title? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Also on the question , I'm also going to vote no. And I stated my reasons last week that all we do is we throw a lot of ARPA money around. And I believe that Miss Crocamo when we hired her, we hired another -- she was another -- another assistant solicitor in addition to Andrew. So and her scope of work, I went back and took a look, was going to be contract s. So the rational e and the backup to give Solicitor Eskra more money is to handle the contracts of ARPA. So I believe , you know, like I said last week, I want someone , you know, I'd rather pay and hire someone else if we're not going to utilize someone inhouse to have laser beam focus on this money, the disbursement of it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 It's a lot of money, 69 million dollars , guys. So this happens all the time. You know, everybody gets an assistant or a consultant like earlier we spoke of. I just think that we have the people in-house to handle this. And they should be doing it. And that's why I'm a no. Thanks. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS.
