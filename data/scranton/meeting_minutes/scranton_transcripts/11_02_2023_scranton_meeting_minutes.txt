This ordinance is establish permit parking on the 800 block of Olive Street. There was a public hearing held last week on this matter. It's being taken from the table and placed in Seventh Order for final vote. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this was something that I had on my list to bring up at caucus tonight . And I did forget about it. I meant to bring it up at the meeting anyway. I did get a call about there is a church on Olive Street in the 1800 block. And if they move to the permit parking , church goers on Sundays and for church events I don't think will have any parking spaces. I don't know if it's something that we want to hold off on until we get a some kind of response with parking from the church or if it's something we'd like to move on tonight anyway. MR. KING: I think that this was tabled for quite a while. And I think that there was a public hearing and we didn't have anybody come in and speak to it. So I'm prepared to vote on it tonight . On the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 question further anyone? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.

It's being taken from the table and placed in Seventh Order for final vote. On the question ? On the question , there was a question about the difference in price. I believe initially they were charging us tax and we're a nontaxable entity. So they were informed and that was adjusted. So I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that was the only question I think that had been raised. So anyone else on the question ?

November is National Veterans and Military family month. November 11th is Veterans Day. So I'd like to donate a flag to the City of Scranton . I brought it with me this evening. I gave it to Mr. Voldenberg . I'd ask you to take it down to the Mayor's office tomorrow and request consideration of them putting that up in the front of the building , naturally on the side where we hang everyone else's flag. I think our veterans should be put up above anybody else that's out there. And that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. KING: Okay. I have just two things. The city is going to continue their outreach events for residents in need of financial recovery from the September 9th flood this week. They were already held Wednesday and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 they were held today. Wednesday was Novembrino Park. Today it was held at Weston Field. And tomorrow , November 3rd from 8 until 12 noon they'll be at the Weston Fieldhouse at 982 Providence Road. Approximately 55 resident s have applied since the application opened on Monday. Also, we received an e-mail from the Mayor recently with exciting news from the Department of Defense breaking defense article includes a breakdown of new funding among U.S. Army Depots and ammo plants, including 243 million dollars for Scranton . And it's part of the FY 23 acceleration of plan, FY 24 upgrades to the industrial based funding in part through supplemental appropriations . This was covered in USA Today on October 30th. The City of Scranton has been working with our federal officials and Chris Kearney from Nossaman , LLP, to keep Scranton 's military contract and assets top of mind for Army official s and Department of Defense consider s where and how much to ramp up weapons production . And we're thrilled to see that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 this continued and growing investments in one of Scranton 's largest manufacturers . That is all I have at this time. Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Last Thursday I went to a meeting at the Sewer Authority and Attorney Shrive, he was so proud of himself . He said you know what's on the agenda? We're approving the Sewer Authority 's 2022 audit. And he said and tomorrow we will hand carry it to the BA's office and that will put that puppy to bed until Frank Voldenberg burst my balloon tonight telling me there's a problem with the Sewer Authority 's audit of financial statement s. And they're awaiting on Attorney Shrive to get back to them. And all I could say is so close, yet so far away. Hopefully it's a bump in the road and not a let's go back to the drawing board. Speaking of so far away, the firefighters ' contract is still not on the website . It's 210 days. Now, I'm going to pull the labor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 counsel 's contract for Ufberg for, you know, doing these contracts for the police and the firefighters . I want to know if there's a cap on what they are being paid to do that because every month or so you see they're down there for a payment . You know, and I'm sure it has to do with this. And what are they doing, typing one paragraph a day? It's not making any sense, you know. I mean, the arbitrator signed the document on April 4th. And I was told 120 days. And it's now 210. It's almost seven months. I don't understand , you know, you look at the personnel handbook and most of it says for, you know, union employees , you know, refer to your union contract . Do the firefighters have a contract they could refer to? It's not just the general public. I mean, that's their contract . If it's not on the website and it's not available for release , is that the way we treat our firefighters ? And then, you know, the police, theirs was signed on July 28th. Does that mean we're going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 see that sometime next year? You know, you got to go and, you know, kick down some doors. They need to explain why this is taking so long. You know, I mean, money's been allocated for pay raises and everything else. Yet, they can't show us the document . That is not full disclosure . That is not transparency . That is not accountability . Let's get some answers . Rudolph Clarke, LLC and their contract for the review of nontaxable properties . Do we have a cap on the cost for that? MR. SCHUSTER : I did receive an answer on that. So the answer that came back was the first phase of the contract is to provide the potential cost and benefits of acting on properties that are current ly not taxed but perhaps should be. Without that cost benefit analysis the city cannot -- is not in a position to place an informed cap on the cost at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. If that's what you guys want. We'll see how that goes. I'm happy to see that the city is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 continuing to pursue assistance to the victims of the September 9th flooding . I will be very interest ed to see what transpires next Thursday , November 9th when the three taxing authorities meet to discuss potential tax relief for these victims . I'm not going to let that matter drop. Speaking of letting matters drop, what ever happened to the pocket park on Linden and Wyoming ? When is that going to be dedicated ? I mean, last thing we were told was we have to give the grass a chance to grow. Well, that was like six weeks ago. So are we simply waiting for the Easter Bunny so we could have like a Easter roll egg and a dedication on the same day? MR. KING: I'll ask Frank to reach out to Leslie down at Scranton Tomorrow , Collins , to see when that is. We were told it was going to be some time in late October , early November . MS. HODOWANITZ : I went into -- I researched -- I was trying to find out how much money has been dumped into that park. As of March of 2021 according to Jim Lockwood and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Times, $1,240,000 and that was as of two and a half years ago. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Joan. Mike Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Mike Mancini , resident in the City of Scranton . Tonight I come before you on a few things. First and foremost over the last three weeks, I have brought to City Council 's attention about misgivings with the Scranton Parking and the Scranton Sewer Authorities how they were sold. And now we see Attorney Shrive, 50 attorneys later stating that there is still some easement s that have yet to have been resolved . If this board -- if this body has the ability , I would recommend you take him off of the Scranton Sewer Authority . Keep him as far away from it as possible . Direction of this is gone. It's gone beyond good taste and reason both. So I want to ask each one of you to personally send a letter to the Mayor requesting when and where you could actually see these documents . Each of you have the ability to take a look at them. And on behalf of the citizens who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 elected you into your chairs, I think it's important to them as well. We're talking about 2.5 million dollars . There is no way that 50 attorneys were involved with this. And again, there was not that many question s. So I would like Mr. Voldenberg to request the Mayor have all documents related to both sales readily available . One thing I want yous to take a look at, that's the catalyst . That's the Scranton Parking Authority , all right? I guarantee you you are not going to see billable hours for the service s that they provided because with the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority , they had to go back after the sale to request billable hours. That's a given. Scranton Times reported that. Furthermore , I think it's important that we bring this to the surface because of transparency , all right. Second thing, is a very young Mike Mancini first time that I remember going up to Nay Aug Park was July 4th, 1976, Bicentennial , all right, 250 years. Not long from now 2026, all right, that park is the crown jewel of the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Scranton . It has significant historical value, all right. We need to complement the rest of the city with that crown jewel. To change the structure and put a pickleball court on that site and to cram everything together , that's not the park that I know, all right. I would recommend that you use the existing park size, bring it back to its historical nature and move forward , okay? Because we've had nothing but gravel in there for four years. All right? Jimmy Connors ' administration for 12 years found a way to keep seven pools open, did not raise taxes for once. There is no reason for this to be happening. We have altered kids' lives over the last four years because they didn't have a place to swim and it's hard for families to get around now. So take all of this into consideration when you send your letter back to the Mayor, take a good hard look at each of you as you were a kid growing up in the city. Each of you have the ability to talk about the park -- well, most of you do. And with that, find it within yourself to take a look and say, hey, we could do better than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 this. We don't need to put two pools into half the size and say, hey, it's okay. It's not okay. Take the pickleball, move it somewhere else. While you're at it, Lee Morgan had a great idea. And it's very important too. You want to utilize that park throughout the year, right. You have the lights through Christmas . How about ice skating ? Why not? If we're going to put something into this, we're going to do it the right way. We're going to do it the right way. We're going to move on and fix our roads because right now it looks like bring your kid to work day. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Mancini . MR. SCARINCI : A pleasant good evening , Council . Well, before I want to talk about the main issue, I just want to talk about very briefly about that truck route. There was an accident today, Jefferson and Mulberry 3:45 p.m. You get this big tractor -trailers trying to make a left-hand turn. And it's a single lane. It's just an accident waiting to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 happen, Council . And it happened today. I felt sorry for that tractor -trailer driver. It was a lady. But luckily no one was injured . But it was a nice Acura and it's destroyed . Now, I want to talk to you about this noise issue -- oh, yeah, maybe you could get the city engineer to do something with that intersection so it doesn't happen again. He could do it quickly . Okay. I want to talk to you about this noise issue Council . Now I want to tell you something . I am not a trouble maker. I am the nicest man you ever want to meet. I could tell you Santa Clause stories that make you laugh so hard you'd go to the bathroom . But we got to address this noise issue, Council . So what it is, is that that gate is too close to the sidewalk . And we're not going to move that back. So the solution is really to make it a one way just like this one right off of Washington , have it go both ways in and one exit out on Linden Street. That's the way to do it. I tried that ABM on my own. I went to them. There is a toxic atmosphere over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 there, especially that guy driving that truck. I don't want to be in the same room with that man. But they said that alarm stays where it is. We're not going to touch the alarm. So this is the solution just like that, one way, no exit. The real issue is the windows . That's a 49-year old window in that place. The other day it was really cold. You could feel the cold coming through those window panes. After 49 years all the seals are cracked . You're in the government . Can't you talk to someone in the state or in the federal government to say, hey, maybe we could get a government grant to get energy efficient windows . You could do it. But you won't. You know what, Council , I'm going to tell you something . You have to rely on the generosity of strangers to get something done around here. So it's my opportunity . Bill Gates, world's richest man in the world, let us have new windows in Mulberry Tower. And I'll say a nice prayer for you. That's not going to work probably . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 So the real issue is this, make it a one way. I want to give you some constructive criticism , Council . We all benefit from constructive criticism . It makes us a better person in the long run. And the constructive criticism for you is you take a very long time to get things done. You drag your feet too long. Look at that bus station over there in front of Boscov's, the jewel of Scranton . It's been there since May when I moved in here from Las Vegas, not a single thing has been done. The same thing with that pocket park, don't you drag your feet on that. That's in front of the tabernacle . All right, Council . You forced my hand. Contrary to popular belief, my patience is not ever-ending. Hear ye, hear ye, on this halo day we call All Souls Day, 2023, you shall have 40 days from this day forward to implement my humble request I have mention ed before this Council . Failure to act shall result in the coldest snowiest winter this city has not seen in 25 years. You will acquiesce to my request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 and you will realize my God is God. That's all I have, Council . Good day. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Scarinci . Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, Keyser Valley resident . I have a map I'd like to give to you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SREBRO: I'm going to simplify what I want to say tonight by talking about one thing. The infamous 24 inch pipe at the corner of Briggs and Cameron . The pipe was modified by the current resident there. And they blocked that pipe and put in a 90 degree angle from a 24 inch pipe to an 18 inch pipe. This cannot handle the water in heavy rains. With that, there is nine storm drains in that one block of Briggs Street. Not around the block, just that one block. There is nine storm drains and three manholes that because of that pipe that was blocked the water just shoots up like geysers out of all of those storm drains and then comes down Merrifield . I can't imagine like what's stopping , you know, to fix that pipe to put it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 back together . That's going to -- we know that it's not going to cure the problem . But it's a quick easy fix before the ground gets cold. We all know that the problem starts at the turnpike up on West Mountain , makes its way down, goes through Fawnwood acres, the dry dam. And there isn't adequate drainage in that whole area. But that one 24 inch pipe is going to be a big difference , you know, really nothing getting done. I mean, we got some band aids. They raised the curbs up, did some flushing of the pipes. But you know in the meantime , if we get more heavy rains in the near future here we go again. It's going to be inundated with flood problems . Even this study on the flooding problem there in Keyser Valley, they even suggest that -- they propose that to fix that pipe in other words, you know, but that's what they stated in the -- now, that pipe -- another thing we found out is that pipe is not on the resident 's property . It's behind it which is city property . It's actually Field Court there. So I don't understand what the red tape is to stop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 or to hold up to fix that pipe problem . You know, and it's inevitable now that it's happening . People -- neighbors that by the past not getting done -- anything done they are starting to take their own, you know, their existing property including myself to try to do my own flood control . And what's happening is now other neighbors are getting upset that, oh, now you're sending more water my way. Everybody is trying to protect their own property because nothing is getting done. So there's, like, starting to be bad feelings between the neighbors , you know, blaming each other that, oh, that's going to cause more problems . So I hope somebody will come up with something about that pipe. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. Mr. Voldenberg , can you send something to the city -- I don't know if it would be the city engineer , whoever is involved with that flood project over there in West Scranton . Just ask specifically , like, are they planning to address this 24 inch pipe or what's the plan for trying to correct the major issue that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 occurring over there if we could get an update on that and a timeline . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. We have asked that question in the interim what can the city do to assist the residents regarding the Briggs pipe. They did indicate it's part of the Keyser Valley study. So I'll follow up and see what they could do. MR. KING: Thank you very much. MR. MCANDREW : We did get a very vague answer last time it was posed recently when I posed it. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did, but I'll get more specifics . MR. KING: If you could. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, Mr. Srebro, was anyone from the neighborhood invited to a meeting? I know when we met, the neighbors informed myself and Mr. McAndrew that there was going to be a meeting on October 20th to discuss the Briggs Street pipe. Was that ever expressed to the neighbors that there would be a meeting ? MR. SREBRO: Not that I'm aware of (inaudible .) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, the answer that we got was that there was not a meeting on that day to discuss that topic. And I was under the impression that there was a meeting that day. MR. KING: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Last week Lee Morgan present ed Council with an Israeli flag and the Ukrainian flag which Bob Bolus generously gave to Council . Why aren't they displayed ? MR. KING: I know that we sent them down to the city administration and it was requested that they be displayed . MR. SPINDLER : We put the Lithuanian flag up. We put the Italian flag up. We put the Irish flag up. We put a pride flag up, other flags. No Israeli flag or Ukrainian flag. That's discrimination , I think. It's unfair. I'm probably going to have to write a letter to the editor and put the Mayor on notice. I don't know whose responsibility it is. There is no reason for those flags not to be displayed. Now I see that flag will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 probably go up tomorrow . I guarantee it. And the Israeli flag and Ukraine flag aren't displayed ? That's a damn shame. Next thing, I haven't brought this subject up in a while. For years I talked about dangerous dog legislation . And last year -- last summer I witness ed a dog attack which a pitbull attacked a lady and her dog which I came here and not long after that the Mayor was here with the police chief and I spoke to them. And the Mayor agreed with me. And no pun intended but she said the legislation needs more teeth to it. And she said she was going to meet with Council . Did Council ever meet with the Mayor on this subject ? MR. KING: I don't recall ever having a conversation with the administration about this. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did not, sir. DR. ROTHCHILD : -- involve d in some discussions about it around that time but nothing else had come from that, to my knowledge . But we could certainly check in on it again.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. SPINDLER : I think something definitely has to be done. That woman was lucky she was unharmed. MR. KING: Les, were you looking for -- when you said more teeth, in terms of leashing dogs or what type of legislation were you looking for? MR. SPINDLER : Make stricter laws. I've come to this Council and told them about other cities that have strict laws. Pittsburgh if you own a dog that's deemed dangerous , you have to have a 10 foot high fence around your yard and insurance . I have a lot of stuff here. MR. KING: Frank, if you could just send something to the administration and ask them if they could review the existing ordinance and maybe even send a copy to all of the Council members so we could review it and see if there's -- maybe we could compare with some other cities that maybe have tighten ed things up a little bit, make them a little stricter to protect the citizens . I appreciate that. Thank you. MR. SPINDLER : I won't mention 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 names, but a previous solicitor said you can't be breed specific because I keep bringing up pitbulls. And that's not true because I brought it up. And in St. George's County, Maryland , pitbulls -- you can't have pitbulls in St. George's County, Maryland . I don't know if that has anything to do with a different state maybe, but they are not breed specific -- they are breed specific there. You cannot own a pitbull in St. George's County, Maryland . So I think that should be looked into too. People always say to me, oh, it's not the dog, it's the owner. And I don't believe that because the pitbull -- MR. KING: I actually have a half Pit and half Lab. And the dog stays in our house almost constant ly. But when we do bring the dog outside , it's on a metal leash, like, we never let it free. MR. SPINDLER : I brought up other instance s where -- I forget -- I think it was in Maryland where these people had a pitbull and had a young baby and the pitbull got in the crib and killed the baby. And this was years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 ago. This started about 15 years ago when my dog was attacked by two pitbulls. Thank God the owners found out that they got out of the house and they came running or my dog wouldn't have survived . Thank God she did. But pitbulls, I think it's in their blood. The name pitbull came from they were bred to fight in pits in England . The real name of the pitbull is American Staffordshire Terrier . The American Kennel Club doesn't recognize the name pitbull. But when my dog was attacked I did a lot of research on it. Nobody will convenience me it's not in their blood to fight. MR. SCHUSTER : So, Mr. Spindler , I've spoke to you about it before. I would possibly be in favor of an ordinance that did go after the owner. But the breed specific , I did address I think a couple times with you. I did own an American Staffordshire Terrier . She was a sweetheart. And I would like to stick up for her here tonight . But I would be in favor of something maybe that goes towards the owner, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 but I know the American Kennel Club, the ASPCA, a lot of those organizations , they're also against the breed specific . But, I mean, it would be something I would look into or consider . But I think would be more prone to go after the owner rather than the dog. MR. SPINDLER : You definitely have to make stricter laws. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . Since there was a mention of parks, I'd like to say that as I said I go almost every day with my puppy over to Weston Park. And it's just 100 percent different from what it was a couple years ago. They've done a tremendous job there cutting brush and exposed all of those steps that have been under for years. I don't know. I guess it's just the same from the city doing it. But I know there's some volunteers been involved in the summertime . They have done a wonderful job there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 It seems to me the pool was doing very well during the summer. It never was as busy as it could be. Evidently Kelly is attempting to back up a little bit from his words of admiration for his new found friend Sudam{phonetic }. It's apparent that the editor of this paper just gets great enjoyment printing this atrocious Hitler appreciation s this man writes week after -- letter after letter. They're terrible . Today there is another one in the paper. He -- the shameful wordage that he uses to express himself , I don't know. He's -- he just seems to be against everything good that we were taught growing up. He's a sick demented racist and he shows it with his pen. MR. KING: Ron, can you refrain from personal attacks . Those are part of the rules. MR. ELLMAN: I was told that I -- this is my opinion . He has -- whatever he says is his opinion goes. This is my opinion . He's a racist anti-Semitic . Well, he's not anti-Semitic . He's an anti-Israeli , that's for sure. He's anti-Jewish. He's just full of hate for any -- I just don't want to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 started . This man is a disgrace to humanity , I'll tell you. At least he's in the open. He's not like some people that I hear remarks from. But right now in a time when the president is trying to bring the country together with all the parades of hate going down the streets all over the place, he adds to it. He wants it. He incites this hatred. I don't know. To me, it's a shame some people were ever born. Anyway, we won't have another meeting before the election. I want everybody to remember to vote. You can't believe how many people complain about things in my two or three seconds here and there at the grocery store or at the gas station . But they don't vote. What is it, 70 percent didn't vote? That's terrible . That's why we have such a poor administration right now. It just reeks from needing help. I don't know how to end up. But as an independent , I'm going to vote probably Republican anyway. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Lee Morgan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I guess the first thing I have here today is that the Pennsylvania record dot com did an article on the suit I launched in federal court against ECTV and Scranton and Lackawanna County's government . And I'm glad that somebody covered it. And I see the Mayor's really loaded up pretty good with lawyers . So I find it comical , but I think we should all really enjoy ourselves. In regards to the Nay Aug Park Pool Project , that should be tabled today, I mean, just immediately because we keep using grant money to create more poverty in this city and more failed project s. First of all, the pool deck shouldn 't be cement. It should be covered with something else so that there's not injuries . There's just so many parts of this project that make no sense. I haven't heard one of the Council members talk about what kind of cement they're going to use to create the pool. I mean, we just have continually taken grant money over decades and just made the city more distressed . If someone was to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 and look into where all of this money, the millions and millions of dollars that have gone into this city in federal funds for project s, what happened with those project s, what the actual cost of those project s were, what the benefits to the resident s of the city were from those projects ; and then look at the city's population decline and the amount of poverty in the city. It's all been wasted. It's just -- it's like they come in and they just throw the money all over the ground and say, well, it went to who it was suppose d to go to and let's move on. And that's why the city is dying. The city is not rebounding . It's dying. You try to make the downtown into a neighborhood as you kill the neighborhoods . Okay, we've overtaxed people in this city for so long it's amazing . You know, Andy Speragula {phonetic } came here and he's passed away now, but he knew anything that had to do with finances in this city. And one day he said to me, you know, Lee, we had to put that 2.4 wage tax in so our parents could stay in their homes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Look how long ago that was and the tax still exists. Why? Doesn't the city know to how to write a budget? I mean, we have people who come here and talk about an audit. They're always late. And this -- is the audit real? Is the budget real? You know, I really look forward to the opportunity to go into federal court and put people on the stand and start asking questions . And I hope everybody really, really, really loads up with lawyers . I hope you have all the lawyers the city can afford to hire because to be honest with you, I'm thinking about going with one more shot for the Licensing and Inspections Department to federal court next. I'm waiting for a hearing in front of the district justice . But the one in South Side gave the city a continuance and then recused herself -- Corbett from the case. So I'm going somewhere else next. But I really find it amazing that the city itself didn't have enough backbone to restructure Licensing and Inspections long, long ago because it's been used as a weapon against the residents of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 this city. And when you look at vacant lots, everybody should go and look at the condemnation book and see why these houses were condemned and torn down. And then follow the federal funds and who got them. You know, maybe the only way I could get satisfaction is when the Mayor's term is up and there is another election. Maybe I have to put my name on the ballot and either run as a Democrat or Republican because I almost beat Mr. Smith with $500 one time in 2010. And I think I could beat the Mayor. And I think she could hide down in her office and lock everybody out of City Hall and you could all do your maneuvering . And let's see if the people finally had enough and they want to change direction . Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Thank you. Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I just wanted to make a quick comment on the walkability study. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 amazing that we're looking to change Center City to all stop signs. I guess since a red light did not stop the woman from being run over in front of the library up there, that a stop sign will somehow stop people from running through an intersection and running someone over. It was an accident . There was a stop light there and a woman still got run over. I think a stop sign offers less protection and we're likely to see more people get hit. Now, I just handed you a paper for tonight on 7-B, the nonprofit review legislation . On page 46 the terms say the fee is $200 an hour for lawyers and 125 an hour for paralegals . But as is noted and put forth there is a willingness as this is up for negotiation specifically in that agreement . Has anyone actually reached out to negotiate with this company that made the bid considering they've stated that they are willing to negotiate lower fees for the city? More interesting , a list was presented of 1,622 nontaxable properties . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 And I would like to see the list as it was already produced and more importantly appears to cut out the top 100 nontaxable s who make 85 percent of the total appraised properties already existing . It was in that document this is noted as provided on page 43 of the documents on tonight 's agenda. I believe 1,622 is higher than the 177 sent out for pilot requests . Mr. Smurl showed inconsistency in last week's vote. I would like him to explain why the fast tracking of the Mayor's emergency order was necessary when two weeks ago you voted no to pass the order because it lacked a response including specific information on the need. And when it was voted on in the following week when Mr. King was here, you reversed that decision though nothing had substantial ly changed . And since you voted no, can you explain why an expired retroactive order -- emergency order needed to skip the process other than to satisfy the administration 's legal department over ethic responsibility and common practices ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Again, you stated the Mayor runs the city park, Nay Aug Pool and the slides. That is contrast to an authority who is set up by charter as it's set up to run as an independent body. Seems that you want to say the body is responsible for everything but only when the Mayor says it is and especially when it's an uncomfortable issue comes up and it becomes a hot potato, then it's the Mayor's choice. Onto, Dr. Rothchild , you have yet to explain other than over a year of having no plans for Geisinger available consistent ly supporting the need over the community . And it was a sudden change of your vote to support the people who put you in office three weeks before the last election . You consistently voted and opined in favor of the Mayor and corporate interest for Geisinger in direct opposition to your community . Why should a community who elected you that you ignored until it was three weeks before your election when you had a miraculous change of heart vote to allow your representation to continue . Lastly on the legal payments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 commingled with the Mayor, it was put forth a request to table and review splitting that legislation . And it was quoted that was a legitimate question . In response you asked the Solicitor for an answer. While your own legal counsel is talking , you stated you are not a lawyer ignoring his advice because it was advice that you did not want to hear. And while he was still advising Council , you said I'm voting yes. It's time for the people of the City of Scranton if they want change to make that vote. You have to go out and you're responsible whether or not you want this to continue . Is this the body that you want spending your money and making decisions ? MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. COYNE: Get out there and vote on this election day. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Is there anyone else that would like to speak before Council ? MR. LITTLE: I'm Rick Little. Hello Council . We're coming up to a very, very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 important election with this local election is probably more important than the presidential election. What is happened around here is this, you know, on a national international schedule , they've made this Joe Biden's hometown and, you know, we got Biden Street. We got all of these things designed to attract all of this federal money coming in. And a lot of federal money is coming in but it isn't helping . It isn't helping because I see where all of this federal money comes into like Scranton Housing Authority , it's run by at least two people that are from the District Attorney 's office and they are evicting people. And it's funny they're evicting people for breaking the terms of the lease. I don't think anybody 's ever read the terms of the lease. The two times I was just evicted they didn't even bring a lease into it. I read the lease. Scranton Housing Authority is supposed to use all the city and county things like inspections . But I went to the inspection office 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 during Covid when they're doing heavy construction . All the time I couldn't breath. They stole my storage space, confiscated my stuff. It's still confiscated but no help from the city, no help from the county. And the curious thing I found out, this lease was approved by this body back on May 7th, 1996. And I'd like to talk to the elderly population which is half the population of downtown now because I did a right to know to find out how many people were evicted from Scranton Housing Authority . And so I go to the Globe building , deliver it to Tracy Hart the Deputy Chief of Staff there. And then I go to Matt Cartwright 's office to find out, oh, he can't do anything with right to know. He needs a FOIA. The next thing I go over there with a FOIA request , the same thing. I'm met at the door by the Chief of Staff guy. He goes, "You talked to my staff member for 45 minutes ." That's not even true. I talked to her for five minutes . And he leads me out of the Globe building and he goes to the Lackawanna Sheriff , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 "Don't ever let him into the sixth floor again." Well, this isn't good local government because the woman who is the judge who I believe has evicted thousands of people, many veterans , many people on SSI and basic county income. What the county's doing trying to sell their county housing and they're also trying to sell their mental health housing . That's what they got in their mind is that they are going to keep their jobs and sell you county housing which is two to three times as much as the federal housing over at HUD. And so if you don't do what they say over there, they evict you for violating the terms of the lease. And they don't even look at the lease. In fact, they don't have any witnesses . The lawyer over there is, you know, Lackawanna County prosecutor and he's also the witness . But the most curious thing I found out with the right to know is -- I found this out when I was at Matt Cartwright's office trying to get to the bottom of this thing is that Judge Alyce Farrell was -- came into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 office in 1997 and the lease was 1996 -- in May of 1996. All these -- and there's no record with the docket numbers of the parties or dates of what goes through that court. That is a kangaroo court that has to be fixed, county level, city level, this level because you are the people here that put them in charge of Scranton Housing Authority . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else that would like to speak before Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , I'll be brief tonight because most of my things have been discussed already . But I would like to know the condition of the Serrenti report. Who's responsible for that? How much revenue did we get from it this last month? Anybody know? Does anybody care? MR. KING: Wasn't the -- the Chief was asked that when he was here recently , wasn't he? I'm trying to remember . MR. MCANDREW : We did get some correspondence back about Serrenti , maybe three weeks ago, right, with similar questions that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 you posed. MR. VOLDENBERG : We got a status on the various project s but nothing so far -- MR. MCANDREW : Nothing about revenue producing . MR. VOLDENBERG : I don't believe it's revenue generated . MR. KING: Can we send something down to the Chief to ask about that aspect for Miss Schumacher and for us obviously . Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : You mean our taxpayers were lied to when we were told if we went with that we would get revenue from other people who use that facility ? Hmm, okay. Now, on the non-property tax exempt people, that's the -- you already covered that to an extent. But who is in charge of that? MR. KING: The non-profits , I think we're going to be hiring a firm. There was a firm hired to do the HUP test to go out and evaluate all the non-profits and determine whether they actually qualify for nonprofit status. And it would be the Mayor's office. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 They have sent out letters to all the non-profits in terms of pilot payments in lieu of taxes. So they have been working on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. When will -- can we get interim reports on -- MR. KING: I think we recently had a report. And I think there was an update after that, Frank. Can you ask the administration to combine what initially came in and add in the funding that came in after that so we have a total amount of funding that came in from all the non-profits ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : And I assume they were also told they didn't have to give dollars and cents. They could give -- MR. KING: In kind services , I believe so, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I'd like to certainly see how that's doing. It's been out there a long time now. MR. KING: Yeah, and I know the initial report, Mrs. Schumacher , was kind of disappointing . It improved somewhat with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 second round. But it's still nowhere near where all of us would like it to be. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. What about the status of Meadow Brook two? Do we know how many rights of way have been obtained ? MR. SCHUSTER : I do not know the number of how many have been obtained . I do know that they put that service out as well. But since that service has been contracted , I do not know how many have been -- MS. SCHUMACHER : I missed that. We contracted for getting the rights of way? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd say in the last -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Do you remember to whom that was? MR. SCHUSTER : I could take a look and see and come back in fifth. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, yeah, I would really like to know on that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's Attorney Boyd Hughes and his law firm in Dunmore . MR. SCHUSTER : Do you remember how many weeks ago that was? MR. VOLDENBERG : Approximately a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 month ago. MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry, I didn't catch the words of that last conversation . What is -- MR. SCHUSTER : So Attorney Boyd Hughes was secured to do that. And it was about a month ago. So I'm going to try to find if I could get you the exact date on when that occurred . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, that would be good because I'd hate to see that pushed off because we don't have the rights of way. MR. SCHUSTER : Prior to that service occurring , I think there was only one. That was something that we've gone back and forth about for quite some time that only one property was secured . But since that has just started , that should be beginning right now. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to speak to Council ? MR. LAFRANCE : Good evening , Council , Pat LaFrance , city resident . I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 here about two weeks ago and I showed everybody a permit denial that I received from the city that had a different address on it. Anybody know anything about that, hear anything about that? MR. MCANDREW : (Inaudible .) MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we didn't, Mr. McAndrew . I'll ask again. MR. LAFRANCE : I'd like to talk about my permits that I'm having -- the issues that I'm having with the city tonight . I believe it was some time in May I filed for my first permit of 2023. I believe it was right in the beginning of June. That permit was actually questioned by one of the Marino brothers . Could homeowner do this type of work because if -- I was building four walls out of two by fours inside the house. If you don't know what you're doing that's pretty technical work. Okay, fine. But Mr. Marino questioned Mr. Oleski is the homeowner allowed to do this type of work. That's the exact question . An hour later the permit was approved for me to do the work. So I did my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 work, finished that permit out, applied for another one. I was denied. I was told that I couldn't do the work because I have a two-house and I have to hire a contractor , okay. I applied for a third permit and in between I studied everything . And I looked at everything and that wasn't the case. That's somebody 's opinion . That's not the law. So I applied for my third permit. And I was denied by -- I have a letter right here. You guys saw it. It's got an address on it from Peckville . I don't know why. But it's a permit denial letter. It's got Tom Oleski's name on it. It's from Tom Oleski. It states on the letter the reason for the permit denial is because the home is two units. And so on Monday, 10/23, I went and I got my appeal form and I got my check. And I went to the notary and I brought it down. And I brought it in here. On Tuesday , I got a call from Tom Oleski. I happened to be in my second floor apartment with a general contractor licensed by the city looking at a problem in my bathroom that I'll save that for another day.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 There's four -- it's only three and a half. That one's four. There's four code violations in my bathroom where my bathroom should not have passed inspection but it did. So anyway, I had that general contractor there. And Tom Oleski called me. He said, "Hey, your permit's approved . I approved your permit come pick it up. Take your appeal letter and your check for 300 bucks and go do whatever you want to do with your house." No. No. And everybody I tell that, oh, that's great. He's giving you the permit. That's awesome , no. What he's doing is he's taking away my right to appeal his decision . That's what he's doing. He made a decision -- to whom it may concern , the permit application for the property listed was applied by you or your company for the above-listed address on September 27th, 2023. The permit application is denied for the following reasons . Homeowner cannot do this work. It's two units. If you have any objections to the determination of this office, you may appeal this matter by requesting a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 hearing before the Housing Appeals Review Board by filing appeals application and stating the grounds for the appeal. That tells me right there I have that right to that appeal. Don't call me up, keep your mouth shut and take your permit. I ain't that guy. The first guy should have known I don't keep my mouth shut. So then I had that phone call. And then today I looking through my e-mail and I got an e-mail from Katie Oleski from last week, yeah, my permit was ready to pick up. I said, "Yeah, Oleski denied it." Oh, Mr. Oleski never denied my permit. Katie Reuther denied my permit due to a clerical error. That's what she told me today. I said, "What was the clerical error. I want to know right now." Excuse me, comes back a couple seconds later. "I talked with the Law Department . The only thing I could tell you is it's a clerical error." And I talked with the Law Department and they had no idea what she was saying. Somebody needs to look into the zoning office. These guys -- the babysitter is out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 of the room. There is nobody babysitting that department and they're running wild. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. LaFrance . Is there anyone else that would like to speak to Council ? MR. SHAW: Good evening , Council , Darwin Shaw, Scranton city resident , candidate for a two-year term unexpired . I would like to talk about stormwater just for today. The stormwater issues and challenges that are facing the region, from what I have gathered we have five even though there is a cohesive plan put together , we have five challenges ; one would be pollution in the streams ; two tightening of DEP regulations and what our M4 permit -- our M4 -- the M4 permits stands for municipal separate sewer systems , if I'm not mistaken . I don't know off the top of my head, but I do know that due to the M4 permit which would have been implemented last year as a new permit that needs to be followed with us and 21 other municipalities surrounding Scranton , Taylor, Dunmore , Olyphant , etc. Out of those 21 we'll say -- I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 say seven have agreed to -- stop me if I'm wrong, please anybody because I am young -- agree to put forth green infrastructure plans, our best (inaudible ) practice is we need to be (inaudible ) with our M4 permits now. I would like to know to stop the flooding especially around the Scranton area and the Keyser Valley area because that can't happen again. And I would say that we're all in agreement that that can't happen again. Despite the electrical systems being raised, is there a way that the city could work with the property owner that is -- that house is basically on that 24 inch pipe that does need to get mended and fixed. And if so, if we have to tear up their yard, can they get reimbursed for the pay? As far as the park, Mr. Smurl, and I like you. I'm not even going to be Mr. Howey. I like you. He's my family but you're a gentleman so I'm going to treat you with the same respect . You were on the Recreation Authority when Mayor Paige Cognetti was our Mayor. You don't have to answer. It's not a trick question , sir.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 When it came to demolishing our pool, did you approve that or no? And if so, where did the Mayor receive the funds to demolish the pool because as the audit goes, if we don't get our audit on time, there's no way that anybody can balance out a proper budget let alone let it be surplus . So you're spit-balling . How did that pool get demolished ? MR. SMURL: The City of Scranton paid for the demolition . MR. SHAW: She did? MR. SMURL: The city did. MR. SHAW: The city did. MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. SHAW: When you were our -- your third day on Council you said that you did honestly . MR. SMURL: I didn't pay for it. MR. SHAW: No, you didn't pay for it. The Recreation Authority received -- they donated funds to the city to demolish the pool. That was just one problem . Now, number two, I would like to know what litigation has been implemented to prevent stormwater management ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Also, have you opened the contracts from DPW to make sure that DPW, our firefighters , police, receive the best bang for their buck especial ly for providing quality A service to the city and these citizens with the lack of an equipment ? MR. SMURL: Well, as far as I know we have a lack of employees . We have a lot of equipment down there that sits every day because we don't have employees to run it. MR. SHAW: Okay, that's wonderful . That's wonderful . I do understand the manpower . But if they don't have the proper equipment to implement the jobs, at least -- at least let them. I'm sorry, I wanted to get everything out. This is hard in five minutes , Mr. King, jeez. At least can we do -- all right. We'll scratch that, Mr. Smurl. We'll scratch that. Can he please implement something in DPW to protect the firefighters ' pension , police pension , DPW's pension , allow them to keep their union contracts -- let's see, let's see -- work with our nonprofit organizations and see if they could not only beautify the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 communities but also work with Parks and Recreation to do more outreach program s or even things like that happened on Halloween . In north side there was a beautiful haunted house which me and my family attended . It was wonderful . And can we fix the street signs with decal if that would be cheaper and look into another contract to get DPW more trucks, to get the firefighters a truck. Does Bedrock still control the IT around here? No? Wonderful , because they were doing bad. And how much money have we received from in extra revenue since the Mayor has been appointed . Does anybody know? Mr. Smurl, do you know? I'm sorry. MR. KING: I'm sorry, your time is up, Mr. Shaw. Thank you. I will say with respect to the contracts , DPW contract was recently settled within the last year or so. And through binding arbitration , both the police and fire contracts were settled recently as well. MR. SHAW: (Inaudible .) MR. KING: Contract negotiation s, there's negotiations between the unions and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 city administration and eventually the two of them, the police and fire both went to binding arbitration . That's how they were settled . The contract between DPW went with the leadership of the DPW union and it was settled . What's that? MR. SHAW: Firefighters , why isn't it posted? MR. KING: Why isn't it posted? Well, it's been brought up multiple times. They're still working on the language to finalize . I'm familiar with that. When I was superintendent of the Scranton School District , the Scranton Federation of Teachers and the city, a lot of times those contract s are settled at the last minute. And it's back and forth and the contracts are marked up. And apparently the police contract -- or the fire contract , they've gone all the way back to '96 and they've taken all original language . So it's taken some time to get that together . But ultimately it will be posted. Thank you. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? Mr. Little, you've already been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 heard tonight . MR. LITTLE: Well, is it okay if I identify as another name and speak about another subject ? MR. KING: No, you had your five minutes . We can't allow people to come up and speak twice. Thank you. MR. LITTLE: I was Rick Little then. I want to do it as Frederick Little which is my legal name. MR. King: Well, you stood at that podium before, correct , for over five minutes . MR. LITTLE: Under another name. I can't identify as another speaker ? MR. KING: No, you cannot. I'm sorry. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes. I went to Novembrino Pool Complex on Wednesday afternoon to see how they were doing with the funding for the damage and loss for the $5,000. I spoke with Chris Hughes market and communications 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 manager from the city. He did say there was almost 60 people that had come already . He said the most important thing when you go there if you can bring receipts or estimates from contractors . If you bring that stuff it kind of makes the process go a lot faster. And also, there is another one tomorrow down at Weston Field House from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. And you could also apply online if you want to apply online at the Scranton Area Foundation . You go to their website and you can apply online by yourself if you don't want to go to the Novembrino Complex . Also, I had a question for information on green light go traffic light replacement, the ones on Cedar Avenue and also the ones on Wyoming Avenue and Green Ridge Street. I called Eileen Cipriani and the response I received was that the plans have been signed by the city by PennDOT and by the city engineer . So it is on schedule to be complete before the deadline so we won't lose the grant money. And that was the information I got from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Eileen Cipriani and the grant writer Sherry Frable. So thank you for that information . And that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. First to answer Miss Schumacher 's question , on September 26th of 2023, Resolution No. 304 of 2023 we secured legal service s for Meadow Brook easement acquisition . So this would be for phase three. Three law firms did apply for the RFP and the city chose one of those law firms. But it was on September 26th. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : You're welcome . Let's see, in regards to the rental ordinance , Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the administration probably Eileen Cipriani . I got a call today about the rental ordinance fees. Can we reach out to see what's occurring with our current rental ordinance fee collection ? Are they cashing checks and are the properties being -- sorry, are they processing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 the payments for the rental ordinance s and keeping track of those at this point in time? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Last week I asked for a breakdown of cost for -- labor costs for the CBAs to be put on the website specifically the firefighters ' contract . I did get an answer. And the answer was that the administration has asked Ufberg and Associates for an itemized bill and said Attorney Ufberg had clarified these question s for Mr. Schuster . But I did not get any of the questions clarified as of yet. But the answer stated that I had. So I'll take a look at that to see if I received anything . We got the e-mail at 4:20 today so I'm trying to get through them. I asked about what's occurring next year for our city little league fields because I hear that there's going to be a change there. And the answer I got was please be advised that the City of Scranton is updating its use and access of little league fields so that interested leagues and groups who wish to use 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 city parks and fields can apply for licenses . The city sincerely appreciates the leagues and groups who have used the parks and fields over the years and will give priority to those groups and leagues who have tenure in usage and courtesy . The city intends to roll out a licensing system online by spring of 2024 so please see attached . Well, there's a sample correspondence here. So the licensing agreement will be securing funding due to the leagues and organizations needing to have site control to qualify for the grant monies and organization risks (inaudible ) all grant monies back after audit or not even qualifying in the first place without the site control provisions . So they are looking to getting into licensing agreement s as opposed to leasing the fields as they have done in the past. I asked by how many FEMA/PEMA project s have been completed from the 2018 storm we had at that point in time. And it says the administration is in receipt of this inquiry but please be advised that the request requires a detailed response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 and the staff responsible for that response is working in real time to attempt to achieve disaster declarations and responses from the September 9th flood. And they'll respond after their painstaking efforts to secure over 6 million dollars in disaster relief for the city. I went to the North Scranton Neighborhood Association meeting last night and a resident over there had asked -- they were trying to get power reinstate d to their home after their home had been condemned . So it's another question I'm going to ask for you, Mr. Voldenberg . Can we reach out to the administration and see if they're working with our residents to ease the condemnation process for permitting homes to come out of condemnation ? And do we know at this point in time how many homes are uninhabitable ? I was aware of just a few. I don't think I was aware of how many were still uninhabitable . So do we know that number and have we been working with these resident s to get them back into their homes? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, first we received a response today on a property I asked about I believe last week or the week prior for 621 rear Alder Street. And I receive d a response that that is going to the magistrate but we have yet to receive a date for when that hearing will take place. So that's where that property is at currently . And then we had received an e-mail from a resident about a property on Harrison Avenue and Vine Street. And that property -- they were wondering if it was getting fixed up, if there were permits for it. And there's garbage often blowing around from the property . There is a lot of junk on the porch. And I think the siding is off the side of the house as well. So they'd like an update on that. And I don't believe they included a specific address , but I'm sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 we could get which property it is. MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll get a status on that. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, thank you. And I want to take a moment to respond to two questions I received during Citizens Participation . And I'm always happy to answer those questions or to defend my votes. The first one was with regards to the zoning ordinance legislation back in the spring time and that was something that I worked with the neighbors on for well over a year. I remember I think I was probably the first one that Doris Koloski came to to ask if I had heard that Geisinger was buying up properties in the Hill Section . And that was the first that I was hearing of it. And I, you know, said I would look into it and see if there was anything like on the city's part with that and there wasn't at the time. And, you know, then found out that the zoning was going to be coming and it all started to come together . And I met with neighbors . I had various phone calls with neighbors for that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 entire year. And I felt that the process went on for much longer than I think it needed to be. And I wasn't sure what the holdup was either and I'm still not sure. But I was, you know, I feel like working on behalf of the neighbors from early on and, you know, certainly communicating with Geisinger because I wanted to get answers for the neighbors . And -- and I also wanted to get them to better communicate and coordinate with the neighbors which wasn't happening. So I think former Councilman Kyle Donahue can attest to that and, you know, I felt like, yes, we did need better emergency services within the city. I still feel that way and, you know, better medical care here. And so, you know, the need for that did make it more difficult for my decision . And they already bought up the properties . I didn't want to see those just sit empty now that they had bought up the properties and demolished them. And that's currently the state they're in. I would still like to see something happen. But I was really disappointed with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 continued lack of communication and agreement with the neighbors and the disregard for them. And that was why I ultimately voted for an amendment on -- in one of the sections , one of the zones. So just to recap how that all occurred and it was never a political decision for me. And I felt that I careful ly weighed everything for both sides. And I know that the neighbors know that as well. And I'm here to fight for the neighbors and the people of the city and not for corporations . But I do also want stronger medical care. So I don't think there is anything wrong with that. And secondly , there was a question on the settlement legislation . And that's going to be coming up tonight and I planned on speaking on the question to that. But I could also discuss that now. I believe when I had asked the solicitor about that he had said that it was damaging or I don't recall his exact words about it. But even though I wasn't involved in negotiations as I stated, I still understood how detrimental it could be to the city for us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 to deny the settlement . And I'm still confident in that because for a number of reasons , first off, with the service s that were rendered we were not giving them additional money than what services they had already provided . We were just, you know, giving them the contractually obligated money for that. If we -- and it was a court-ordered settlement as well. So if we denied that as a Council , we could get fined and we would certainly get sued. We were already told that we would get sued. And we would risk millions more of costs to the taxpayers to be in a legal battle with them for money for service s that were already owed. So I don't think that's something that would be a healthy decision for the city for our financial stability as a city and for the taxpayers to continue to spend money on legal suits when, you know, I think that we can -- we can settle it here with the settlement . So that's where I stood last week. That's still where I stand. I do appreciate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 that they've had a chance to discuss further and touch base with the administration and with the legal department on that. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, so over the weekend it was brought to my attention that last Saturday multiple workers from DPW were put out on overtime to map alleys and manually put them in the system for Rubicon and probably will have to do it next Saturday . Claiming Rubicon -- Rubicon claiming that their GPS is not working or something to that affect. I am one of two Councilmen that sit up here that voted no for this contract . We were told two years ago that Rubicon would provide one million dollars in savings for the first year. It has been rolled out only twice in two years, both times probably the hottest week of the summer and it failed. Garbage sat everywhere . We were told the next rollout is January . So this six-figure contract has not saved the taxpayer s a dime and is now costing us overtime again like it did in the summer. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 I do not blame the DPW workers that are following orders from this. But this is another example of why Rubicon should be gone. Mr. Voldenberg , can you please verify the information that I received over the weekend ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Through administration . Thank you. And that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a response here for Joan Hodowanitz . The Scranton Sewer Authority 2022 audit financial statement was approve d by the Scranton Sewer Authority Board at a special meeting Thursday , October 26th was received by the City of Scranton on Friday, October 27th.

Did we get that updated schedule yet? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not in the last report, sir. I'll follow up. MR. KING: Yeah, see if we can get that. And that's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , included with this contract the company does state that they would be on rare occasions they work with the prospective client to agree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 upon a rate that suits the client's budget. So we do have an opportunity here to reach back out to this company to see if we could get the rates of -- I would imagine $200 per hour for attorneys and $125 for paralegals . I think I'd like to make a motion to table this tonight to see if the administration can reach out to the company to see if they would be in favor of a better deal for the city. MR. KING: I'm wondering since it's written into their proposal if that that opportunity still exists even if we pass it. MR. MCANDREW : I'll second it to table. MR. KING: Okay.

MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote of Item 7-E. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. KING: On the question ? Roll call, please. MR. MCANDREW : Wait, whoa, whoa, on the question . So the reason I had this broken out is because this is -- this is bad, all right. And, you know, and how it was presented to us by the legal department is, well, you know, they're going to threaten breach of contract , okay. But this same organization was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 identified by the FBI as co-conspira tor pay to play. All right. So in essence , they breached their contract . Lawyers have two options , folks. They can fight or they could settle. I was in favor of fighting , not settling . Four years ago I ran against corruption and ran for transparency . My vision or commitment hasn't changed . If I voted yes for this, I'd be hypocritical . So with that said, you know, these people were identified . And we did have a discussion about it. And you know what, this could be fought and potentially won. And when they are identified , they still continued to do business with us for a period of time. It was disgusting . So I'm happy with my vote. I'm a definite no to pay off or reward people with criminal behavior . MR. KING: On the question , I certainly don't feel good about having to settle this lawsuit . However , I believe that if -- this was court ordered and I believe that we are paying for work that was performed here. And I believe by not passing this this evening , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 that we're opening up the city to further litigation which can more than double or triple the amount that we settled for this evening . That's why I'll be supporting this this evening . MR. SMURL: And I -- this was the item that we asked the administration to separate . And I was part of that. And they did separate it. And the Law Department did come down and spoke to us about it. We asked question s about why and how and why we were settling this one. They told us the contract was an auto renewal contract so that company continue d to work for the City of Scranton and they continued to provide us with information that we used and benefitted the City of Scranton . So the final agreement amount is substantially smaller than what they had originally requested . So I don't believe any judge would tell us not to pay them for what they had performed under a contract . So I will be supporting this to pay this off. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR.

MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote of Item 7-F. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this was actually something I asked for when Miss Cipriani was in. I wanted to see some of our ARPA dollars reallocated from areas where we may not see benefit with the new information that we had and get that -- those monies into other places. I agree with I'd say 98, 99 percent of this other than the Providence Square Streetscape Project , this is -- this here was just to reallocate that Providence Square money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 back to downtown area. So I'm going to be voting no to this tonight . I would like to see that money still in the North Scranton providence area. And I felt like we should have looked into some other monies for the downtown area and kept this money in the North Scranton area. So with that I will be voting no. MR. KING: On the question , I would love to see the money stay in North Scranton as well. However , in listening to what the administration had to say, it's going to be almost impossible to meet all the needs require d by PennDOT with all the license s and inspection s that would have to happen with every single road, every single driveway to be able to meet the deadline . But I did speak to the administration about applying for other funding that will address the needs over in North Scranton , therefore , I'll be support ing this this evening . DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree that we should continue fighting for funding for North Scranton for Providence Square. However , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 don't think that this is the time to do that because it doesn't seem reasonable that these funds are going to be able to be used towards that project . And if not, then they won't get used which I'm concerned about. So I would rather put it towards a project even if it's downtown and still look for funds for North Scranton . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So I initially had a problem with this diverting money from Providence Square to downtown . But during caucus we received information always late, always, you know, by the time this thing is read or introduced or reintroduced. So the information we were told -- and I'm going to hold administration to it is, you know what, they didn't forget about North Scranton . They're working on some funding to complete what they set out initially to complete . So I'll vote yes for this. But I'll definitely keep my eye on the promise that's being made. MR. KING: Also on the question , there was discussion with the administration . And we discussed this in caucus. There was a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 (inaudible ) board that we're going to try to set up and work with Senator Marty Flynn to try to develop a board to attract some funding that will address the needs of our North Scranton residents .

PREVIOUSLY TABLED - FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 91, 2023, ESTABLISHING PERMIT PARKING IN THE 800 BLOCK OF OLIVE STREET. MR. KING: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-G. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I do understand that we've had a hearing on this and no one from the public had showed up to it. I was -- I receive d a phone call stating that church services on this block of Olive Street will be affected when it comes to parking and that the church doesn't have enough parking for those services . I think possibly because the church operates on only certain days they were unaware of this as they weren't residents . I don't know where Council is with a possibility to table this action just to see if we could reach out to the church to see if they were aware that it might be taking place. I don't know if there's any appetite to table. MR. KING: There's been a motion to table. MR. MCANDREW : I'll second that. I mean, yeah, maybe the church wasn't aware and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 they're a permanent fixture there and maybe should have some type of input in this decision . Okay, they missed the public hearing , but, you know, maybe they didn't hear about it or their members , I should say, the congregation . MR. KING: There's been a motion and it's been seconded to table Item 7-G. On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , I also believe maybe -- maybe they did miss it.
