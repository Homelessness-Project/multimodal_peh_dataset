The Recreation Authority is holding a Butterfly Playground run, 5k run, one mile fun walk to benefit the installation of a special needs playground in Nay Aug Park. And that will be held this Sunday, May 22nd at 9 a.m. I believe it's starting at the concession stand outside the pool. You could sign up at runsignup.com\butterfly run or make a monetary donation via Venmo at Nay Aug Park or by check made out to the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Jess, did you have anything ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I just want to talk about the Scranton in Bloom Gardening competition and this is citywide . Anyone can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 participate . You could nominate someone . It's a friendly neighborhood competition to find the prettiest front garden in the City of Scranton . It's in its first year. There will be two categories , people's choice and judge's choice. So you can nominate someone 's garden or enter your own garden. And you could go to their Facebook page Scranton In Bloom or there's a website that has the nomination forms. The nomination period ends June 11th, the website is Scranton inbloom.webador .com. That's it. MR. GAUGHAN : Sorry, I was muted. We won't have that problem next week hopefully . We'll resume in-person meeting s next week May 25th. The CDC has updated the guidelines as everyone knows as well as the State of Pennsylvania . So in compliance with the Governor 's directive s, next week Council Chambers will be limited to 50 percent of its maximum occupancy . And our City Clerk is working with our Fire Chief to figure out that number so there will be an inspector who relays that information to us. We will be on Channel 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 and also we'll be live streaming on ECTV's YouTube page. So that would be another addition . Masks will be required by all people who are in Council Chambers unless you are speaking at the podium. So if you're speaking at the podium, you could take your mask down. And then, you know, when you're in the audience you'll have to wear your mask. This is obviously a fluid situation and things do seem to be changing weekly or monthly. So we have to have the ability to put procedure s in place to protect the public and the Council . But we are looking -- all of us I think I could speak for are looking forward to getting back in person to conduct -- continuing to conduct the business of the City. So next week in person if anyone is interested in coming to our meetings , there will be things posted there with directions when you come in but masking -- and there will be a limit on the occupancy . We just don't know exactly what that limit will be yet. But that will be announced before Tuesday . Mr. Volderberg . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals , Tom Coyne, Tony Spinillo , John White, Ken Kryeski , Marc Pane, Gregory Williams , Robert -- and there wasn't a last name given; Peter Bonacuse and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mr. Volderberg , would you please read the comments into the record. MR. VOLDENBERG : The first submission is from Mr. Thomas Coyne. It's in two parts and reads as follows : Greetings members Council , Today I will touch upon proposed ordinance 5.B. Setting a bottom limit based on a fixed figure based on 2015 numbers is not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 really reasonable . Most guidelines have a limit based on ability to pay and it's adjusted by the poverty rate. The Federal Poverty Guideline is $12,800 for one person and an additional $4,540 per each person on the household . Most tax programs are based on the income and number of people and even then, it's understood the numbers are so out of touch, most programs reflect 135% to 200% of the poverty rate. $ 15,600 breaks down to $1,300 a month and that's $ 16 under eligibility for food stamps, so with the above set number a single person who is getting food stamps would be taxed. I think it should be adjusted by a percentage of the federal poverty level and not a fixed number. Also note this $15,600 is applied without regards to household size, even if one out of 5 people is working and no one else. Also from review it seems this tax only applies to city residents who work in the city, as out of city workers are exempt, as are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 people who work full time elsewhere and part time in Scranton . How does one establish a primary place of employment ? Since the $15,600 is to be applied to “all income sources within the municipality ,” I assume anyone working outside Scranton who lives here is exempt as the income is “not a source within the municipality ”? How does the city assess the exceptions as it is supposed to be pro rated? If someone worked 6 months in the city is there a mechanism to adjust and refund the overpayment of $78.00? Since this fund is marked for a “sole purpose ,” How are the funds audited that they are going ONLY to the allowed Emergency Services , Police, Fire, road construction , maintenance and reduction in property tax. We are already taxed for City Services such as Police and Fire, and Emergency 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Services , and Emergency Services is overly broad in its lack of definition , but I would like part of the funds if you're amending it to offer relief to seniors /low income for application to the garbage tax, property tax or any other city fee. A basic credit applied from the fund. (In corporate terms interdepartmental transfer ) Scranton has crushed senior homeowners with tax upon tax and ever increasing burdens , it would be nice to set up some of this fund as a property tax reduction for low income and seniors . Now to 5.C The Gun Safety Alliance Gun violence is an issue and has been for decades . We look at mass shootings and are shocked and move on. We don't hear a lot about Philadelphia , Baltimore and Chicago because a daily Gun Shooting is just not news. Canada Per Capita has more guns per person and has a much lower incidence of gun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 violence . It's not just about the guns , it's about healthcare and mental health services and availability . The Majority of Gun Violence is based not on random shootings but on suicides . The numbers I believe are about 62% if the gun violence is self inflicted and this speaks to why Canada with more guns, has less of an issue. The U.S. for a long time institutionalized mental health because it was uncomfortable and embarrassing so we locked it up to be unseen, then it was decided that was cruel, so we closed down those abusive institutions and left no care as the alternative . Even with insurance the mental health issue is so limited in scope and duration that the only thing more restrictive is getting glasses and dental work. Until we focus on mental health support for our population , availability , along with assurances that the most in need have it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 available , this will continue . If you think you may self harm, the mandatory reporting mechanisms are in place, but those same mandatory rules, also prevent someone who is thinking of it, from ever talking about it. There needs to be education on getting help if you're considering suicide versus getting ready to act on it. People who may be thinking of suicide are the most important to allow reaching out without fear of being committed , and allowed to express and work through it. I have long held that all guns should be mandated to be sold with a gun trigger lock. Not a combination one but a key. Loaded or unloaded it stops little fingers and teens from pulling a trigger by mistake when playing with a new found thing. Last I talked about the 3200 block of Oak Avenue. The Storm water collection grates and pits being connected to nothing and saturating the ground, long after storms pass. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Is anyone going to look into this? Thank you for your time. Thomas Coyne. MR. VOLDENBERG : The second submission is from Mr. John White and reads as follows : City Council , Thank you for attending to our concerns on wheeler in the beautiful historic hill section . However our concerns will take more than a one and done solution . This is ongoing . And needs to be taken care of regularly The dust and debris continues to whirl abut settling on our windows and and cars and in our lungs. Again some suggestions : *Have utility crews keep streets wet while working . Already an ordinance ? *have fire department hose down our streets regularly . ( Cars would not have to be moved). *contract with U ofS or other non profit to help. *enforce speed limit for speeding denaples trucks. *Enforce quad speed and noise violators . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 *future Scranton times head line: Scranton voted one of the cleanest cities in the US. *the first step in rebuilding an infrastructure is to clean the structure ...sometimes that's all you need to do. If you wash your house, you may not have to paint it. *lets get our city pride back. *light a candle rather than curse the darkness . Please stoop You're welcome to Stop by for coffee and conversation on my porch any time. Thank you. John White. MR. VOLDENBERG : Submission number three is from Mr. Tony Spinillo regarding Resolution No. 168. Dear Sir, This resolution is a direct attack on the second amendment right established in the US Constitution and reaffirmed in the Pennsylvania Constitution . As presented it is nothing more than a virtue signaling effort that is unenforceable . It is fact that criminals never 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 abide by such laws. A quick glance at a typical weekend in Chicago easily proves this point. Please vote NO to 168. Thank You. MR. VOLDENBERG : The fourth submission is from Mr. Ken Kryeski . I would like to voice my concerns for this group and any new gun related legislation in the city of Scranton . Anything of this nature is a violation of our 2nd amendment rights and the Pennsylvania state constitution . There are already background checks in place to ensure a person is legally allowed to purchase and own a firearm . Please pass this along at the council meeting this evening . Thank you, Ken Kryeski MR. VOLDENBERG : The fifth submission is from Mr. Marc Pane. Dear Council Members , Tonight , you will vote on Resolution #168, allowing Scranton to become a member of a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 group that would tie the of every law-abiding resident in the city. Pennsylvania already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation with in depth background checks, regulations , and tough penalties for those who violate them. Still, none of this will ever stop a criminal from gaining access to illegal guns because , lets face it, criminals do not follow laws. Municipalities that have partnered with groups like this and have enacted their policies have been challenged in courts throughout the commonwealth and have lost, at great expense to those municipalities now forced to defend them because these new policies not only violate Second Amendment Rights, but the Pennsylvania Constitution as well. Pennsylvania law allows organizations like the NRA or other similar groups to sue municipalities on behalf it's residents . Our already cash strapped city does not need another costly litigation . I am urging each and every one of you to vote NO on Resolution #168. MR. VOLDENBERG : Submission number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 six comes from Mr. Gregory Williams . Honorable City Council members , My name is Gregory Williams , and I have been a resident of our great city for 29 years. As a moderate Democrat , a city tax payer, a city property owner, the recipient of a Masters Degree in Public Administration from a local university , a law enforcement officer , a locally elected official , and a citizen of the United States; I believe I am qualified to speak on behalf of my friends , family, and neighbors , that reside in the great city of Scranton , when I say that many of us are deeply troubled by Mayor Cognetti 's push, and the Council 's willingness , to join the PA Gun Safety Alliance . The gun safety alliance exists not to make Pennsylvanias safer through reform, but by reforming enough that firearms ownership becomes so overly burdensome that it is basically unattainable to the average citizen . These additional “permission to purchase ” style 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 firearms licensing schemes that the Gun safety alliance pushes are overly costly, redundant , time consuming , and a direct hinderance to the common person's ability to exercise a right guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . As the owner of firearms , I can attest to the purchasing process here in the city. In order to purchase a firearm I was required to provide my Pennsylvania issued drivers license which was photo copied, fill out a two forms (one for the Pennsylvania State Police, and the other a federal form) that asks for all of my information from my social security number and address to my phone number and who my employer is. I then had to wait for that information and my photo identification to be used to conduct a federal and state police background check. If my background check is unsuccessful , I am unable to purchase the firearm and may have violated the law in attempting to obtain it, which the Pennsylvania state police would now be aware of. If the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 system for the background checks is down or my information cannot be readily verified and needs further investigation , I may be required to wait up to 10 days to see if I will be approved of denied. If I want to carry my newly purchased firearm on the streets of Scranton , concealed on my person, I must go down in person to the Lackawanna County sheriff 's office and fill out an application for a license to carry firearms . Similarly to the process to purchase a firearm itself, I must present my Pennsylvania identification and undergo a background check after filling out all the same information from the background check to buy the firearm would again be used to be approved for the license to carry firearms . The same background check process will be used for any type of “permission to purchase ” license that the gun safety alliance is pushing for, making it redundant and useless . I am also troubled by both Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Cognetti 's and Council 's willingness to join and entangle the City of Scranton in a Philadelphia lawsuit challenging the state firearms preemption laws and the United States constitution , which would need to be defeated to enact the proposed changes the gun safety alliance is suggesting . The ability of local municipalities to enact laws counter to those in place by the Commonwealth has been challenged by several times already , such as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh . They have been defeated in court, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has sided with the Commonwealth continually on this issue when appealed . This protects residents of the commonwealth not only from having their rights infringed upon, but also protects them from being caught up in a confusing web of potential legal action that would exist if every municipality could make their own laws on the issue. Article I, section 21 of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Pennsylvania State Constitution states: “The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State shall not be questioned .” Pennsylvania state law on firearms preemption provides that: “[n]o county, municipality or township may in any manner regulate the lawful ownership , possession , transfer or transportation of firearms , ammunition or ammunition components when carried or transported for purposes not prohibited by the laws of this Commonwealth .” The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution : A well regulated Militia , being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed . So my questions for you are: Why is our city Council considering giving support to a group that seeks to supvert the the laws of the commonwealth ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Why is our city council giving a voice to a group that would seek to violate the state and US constitutions through further questioning and infringing of protected and established rights? And lastly, why is the city council lending support to a group that would further delay and hinder city residents ability to exercise their rights through redundant bureaucracy . It is with this information in mind that I respectfully demand that my locally elected officials protect and uphold the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the constitutional rights of city residents , guaranteed by both the Commonwealth and the United States, by opposing Resolution #168. Respectfully submitted , Gregory Williams , M.P.A. MR. VOLDENBERG : The seventh submission was submitted by Robert. Hello, My name is Robert I am 56 years old 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 and a lifelong resident of Scranton . I am also a United States Navy veteran and a civil servant for 33 years. I am asking for your consideration for a NO VOTE for Resolution 168. Thank you for your consideration . A concerned voter. MR. VOLDENBERG : Submission number eight was submitted by Mr. Pete Bonacuse and read as follows : Dear Council Members , Tonight you will vote on Resolution #168, allowing Scranton to become a member of a group that would tie the hands of every law abiding resident in the city. Pennsylvania already has some of the strictest gun laws in the nation with in depth background checks, regulations , and tough penalties for those who violate them. Still, none of this will ever stop a criminal from gaining access to illegal guns because , let's face it, criminals don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 follow laws. Municipalities that have partnered with groups like this, and have enacted their policies , have been challenged in courts throughout the commonwealth and have lost, at great expense to those municipalities now forced to defend them because these new policies not only violate Second Amendment Rights, but the Pennsylvania Constitution as well. Pennsylvania law allows organizations like The NRA or other groups to sue municipalities on behalf of its residents , our already cash strapped city doesn't need another costly litigation . I'm urging each and everyone of you to Vote NO on Resolution #168. Respectfully , Peter Bonacuse City Resident City Business Owner City Taxpayer MR. VOLDENBERG : Submission number nine comes from Ms. Marie Schumacher and reads as follows :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 O I am emphatically against 7C. As you undoubtedly noticed membership in this National Gun Safety Alliance requires a signed Pledge. Signing the pledge agrees to combat a PA Statute (Stand Your Ground) that I support . Further , Subchapter E, Chapter 29 of Title 53 (General Powers and Limitations of Home Rule Charter Municipalities ) prohibits Regulation of Firearms . We are a Home Rule Charter City are we not? I believe each of you should vote NO. O Quoting Business Administrator Deeley, "Regardless of what we're going to do with this building short-term, long-term, it's got to be basically weatherproofed . All we're doing right now is degrading a city asset." So, my question is why are we continuing to degrade this asset? I'm confident you included a substantial amount for this effort in the Capital budget but when will there be an RFP to actually perform the weatherproofing ? O The City has spent many, many years and substantial amounts of money performing Stormwater studies . Last week it was flooding on Froude Avenue on the East 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Mountain and one other location ...The question is when will we actually start managing stormwater ? When was the last time a City-owned retention pond was dredged ? I believe the majority of the taxpayers know they are going to be paying out more so there is no need to wait until after the Election . Time to start managing Stormwater . MR. VOLDENBERG : Submission number 10 was submitted by Jeffery B. Jones, Esquire . Regarding Resolution NO. 168. Dear Council Members : Our city has a long history of adhering to democratic principles and the rule of law, and if there is one defining characteristic behind our city's progress , it is unquestionably our elected leaders ' bi-partisan cooperation that has solved the city's problems and driven us forward . This letter is being penned because there is a grave threat at our city's doorstep that is far more dangerous than any gun will ever be. The threat I speak of is the socialist organization masquerading as the public service 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 organization "PA GUN SAFETY ALLIANCE ," which is the subject of Resolution #168 that you will soon be voting on. This organization looks harmless on its face, but one cursory glance at their mission statement and wide array of connections both big and small will reveal the existence of something much more dangerous , a powerful syndicate . The aim of this syndicate is not gun safety or educational policies , but rather to lobby elected office holders to vote a certain way on various proposals that will help advance their massive anti-gun agenda. And, this threat is being ushered into our great city not through bi-partisan efforts , but by individuals who are pretending to have our city's best interests at heart. I am telling you about the dangers of this organization because you are about to vote on Resolution #168, which will determine whether or not we will align our unique city with this dubious socialist organization . If you have not done your homework on this organization , let me tell you what their aims are as stated on the PA Safety Alliance website : "PA Safety Alliance is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 statewide coalition of diverse organizations committed to saving lives in Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania is home to a rich and diverse array of communities , each of them with their own voices and safety needs. While gun ownership is at the core of many of these communities in the form of recreation and personal protection , it also poses inherent risks. The PA Safety Alliance was founded to align these voices, providing a united perspective that informs statewide safety efforts , and implements sensible firearm policies to effectively end firearm injuries and deaths." It all sounds harmless enough, but when you consider that the first line in their statement says its about "saving lives "and the last line states they seek to "implement sensible policies to end firearms related injuries and deaths," then its real goal becomes abundantly clear: They seek to insinuate Pennsylvania has gun problems and there is a real need to legislate against the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution in Pennsylvania , an act that is anything but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 bi-partisan . And, is a road that once embarked upon, will lead us further and further down a road of which will result in a reduction in fundamental and Constitutional rights for us and will ultimately prove to be a road of no return. Because the dangers of this organization are real, I pray our council members see this organization for what it really is: A major anti-gun lobby cloaked as a non-profit with anti-gun legislation waiting in the wings. And it's not unique to Scranton , or even Pennsylvania . It's an organization that is just one small part of a much larger national syndicate that is in or is making its way into every state in the US through the financing efforts by very rich and powerful interests who do not have the general public's best interest in mind, but rather the advancement of their own. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of tenets that all humans can agree on: Ending poverty , curing cancer, global peace. We can all agree on these tenets because they are universally supported . I do not think there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 any city official that would mind if any one of these tenets were associated with our city because of their global appeal and acceptance . But, what if today's meeting was to consider joining a pro-gun organization who was connected to the NRA? I would imagine that the answer to that question would not come as easy as the answer on joining organizations dedicated to ending world poverty or curing cancer. The reason for that is because guns have become a controversial subject lately. And, the reason there is even controversy is because of organizations such as PA Gun Safety Alliance who have driven the debate to the national stage. But, if guns are a controversial subject , then so too is the opposite stance: Anti-gun. Therefore , if this council would overwhelming vote no to our city joining a pro-gun organization , then it MUST also vote no to joining PA Gun Alliance , an anti-gun organization , for the very same reasons . Because if we are willing to concede that guns are a controversial subject , then you too much concede that anti-gun is also equally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 controversial . The reason for this is obvious : Some people like guns, some people do not. And, if you are not ok with Scranton being known as a pro-gun city, then it's only fair that you likewise vote no to Scranton being known as an anti-gun city. Voting against Resolution 168's proposal does not mean you are in favor or support guns or gun rights, or that you are abandoning your party's platform . You are our elected leaders and aside from being responsible for voting the will of the people, you are also responsible for and tasked with upholding the rule of law. So, let me be clear by stating that no one disputes that guns are dangerous when not properly handled , but Pennsylvania does not have a gun problem and its elected leaders have not failed at legislating gun related policies . Besides , there are many other everyday items that are equally , if not more dangerous , such as prescription medicine and even alcohol . Yet, we are not signing up or joining organizations that are anti-prescription medicine or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 anti-alcohol organizations , so why is it necessary to then join the Pa Gun safety alliance . Council members , ask yourselves why are guns suddenly being attacked as more dangerous than prescription medicine and alcohol , when we know that is not necessarily true? And, lastly, ask yourself what is the incentive to joining this organization ? If we join this organization , will we be any better off tomorrow than we are today? The answer is no. In fact, it makes no difference . But to them it does because it sends their organization a signal that our city does have a problem , and our leaders did fail us, and that you, our current elected leaders are willing to accept what they sell and are open to the idea of being lobbied . In a democracy , the people control the government . In a socialist country , the government controls the people. If we allow the government to dictate who has the right to possess a firearm , then we might as well prepare for them to tell us what we can say in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 public and in the press, and how many children we are allowed to have, because that is where this road will lead. Be not fooled council members , this is not just about gun ownership . This is about our American identity and everything that has come before us. And, right now, it seems the gun is the only thing standing in the way of losing everything we have come to hold dear. If you vote to give up our guns, or restrict our access to guns, which is a covenant that this organization is looking to solicit from you, then you are voting to render us defenseless against a tyrant that is already lurking in the shadows and being kept in check by the one item that this organization will be expecting you all to legislate against . Council members , Pennsylvania is one of the first American colonies . We have long held traditions that stem from our initial founding that includes gun ownership . Our founding fathers fought off a tyrannical empire through the use of guns, without which, we would have a very different flag waving today. Our founding fathers knew 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 first-hand the importance of gun ownership and its integral position to warding off tyranny . This is why they found it so critical to include into the US Constitution as its 2nd Amendment . Your citizens beg of you to not throw away our long held traditions . Please do not leave us defenseless and vulnerable to the tyrants of tomorrow . For these reasons and more, I urge our council members to reject Resolution 168's proposal not only out of fairness to our citizens , but so that we do not lose our long held traditions and our unique political identity by aligning with such a one-sided organization . Respectively , Jeff Jones Resident of Scranton MR. VOLDENBERG : I have an addendum to Thomas Coyne's second part if I may read it. Scranton City Council Greetings Members of Council . Thank you for putting this small addition in as a second submission , due to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 failure to enter my timely comments last week, reading this separate submission as well today. Again on the LST issue, Mr. Gaughan had called the tripled LST “a tool that we have to use.” Though not his intent, words have two meanings and in that is some truth. Urban dictionary states a tool as "A tool is someone who lacks the capacity to realize theyre being used by someone else. A fool. This person might have low intelligence and/or self-steem." So taking it out of the intended context , Scranton 's population are tools to be used, ones who are only there to supply funds. To this part of the LST usages listed in the body include tax relief. The listed uses include emergencies , police. Fire and tax reduction only portion has been ignored . And on the Home Rule Charter , The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 original intent was not to increase powers, but to define the structure of our city government . The main question was Should we have a small elected body with all the power or a set similar to the federal checks and balances . County (or in this case) proposed City Commissioners versus a mayor and city council . The Home Rule charter was an attempt to put in a system to prevent one branch from having control without oversight . I do believe that amending the Home Rule Charter or revisiting it is not a bad idea. We learn and grow from experience . Those who want to remove the Home Rule, may be better off targeting changes and amendments to the body, rather than tossing out the baby with the bathwater . Thank you for your time. Thomas Coyne (Concludes public comment e-mails as submitted to Council .) MR. VOLDENBERG : And that ends Citizens Participation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . On the question ? I just -- MR. DONAHUE : Go ahead. MR. GAUGHAN : I was just going to say, Mr. Volderberg , if you -- I can't remember last week or the week before if we sent in Mr. Coyne's request about Oak Street. But if not, can you just send that in again to the DPW? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, I will. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Go ahead, Kyle. That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : I was just going to mention that as well to send that in because I know we had made that request last week. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mr. Volderberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : My only comment , I sent an e-mail in before last week's meeting about a property over on Philo Street in North Scranton . I'll probably send that over to Frank again tonight . I didn't really -- I haven't heard back on. And I'm happy to hear that Kyle suggested about the caucus with the representative from DPW. So that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : I just have a quick one. I got an e-mail -- I'm going to follow up on this. The e-mail was about a property in the 600 block of South Irving Avenue. It's in disarray . Although things seem to be getting better, I think it would be beneficial to have the owner contacted to ensure this continues . I don't have the exact address . So I just put this, you know, actually put this together to take a look at. I'm going to try to reach out to this gentleman and get the actual address . I think it was submitted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 before. But, Mr. Voldenberg , can you look into that, see if something was submitted recently in the 600 block of South Irving Avenue? The gentleman seems to believe he did. I just don't see it anywhere . MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, Councilman , I'll check the records. And then I'll reach out to you with the status. And then if nothing , I'll reach out the DPW on 600 South Irving. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anything else, Mark? Sorry, you cut out at the end there. Okay. All right. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do have a few. First, two weeks ago we had requested that for a traffic study on Harrison Avenue. And we did receive a response from them. They completed the study and did have some suggestions on some issues that could be contributing to the high speed of traffic along that street. And I'll ask that this be put in Third Order for next week as well. But some of their suggestions included , you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 implementing more aggressive enforcement of the existing 25 mile per hour speed limit. There is some issues with the no parking here to corner signs not really being consistent . So having those and having them at the same distance along that road and also installing possibly hash marks or pavement marking s to enhance the no parking areas and then, you know, per regulation the street should actually be wider than it is to accommodate where cars are parking along the sides on both sides of the road. And it's not. So, you know, I'm not sure if -- that is something they're suggesting we take a look at because many of the cars are parked along the sidewalks going up the whole road. And the cars are just obstructing the view at the intersection which caused a majority of the accident s that occurred along that road over the years. So, like I said, if we can put that in Third Order so everyone has a chance to take a look at it. And I could coordinate with DPW and the administration to see what we can do based on their suggestions . And I had a few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 other complaints that I received over the past two days. And I'll send those to Mr. Voldenberg . I have a list of them. But one of the things along South Washington Avenue, there's been several tractor -trailers that are parked there. And they have been for a couple of months now. They want to know why they are there or allowed to be. There's -- I think I counted. There is probably at least eight of them which is a lot and not a pretty view driving down South Washington . There is -- I also had a complaint about several junk cars that are on a lot at Myrtle and Prescott Avenue in the hill. And they were previously tagged but they were never removed . So one of the neighbors is just not sure why they haven't been removed yet so if we can reach out about that. And then I'd also see some department requests for signs or stop signs, dead end signs. I'll send that one over. And that's everything I had for Fifth Order. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, first off in my notes I said that the butterfly race was Sunday, May 22nd. It's Saturday , May 22nd. That's my fault. Saturday at 9 p.m. for the butterfly race to benefit a special needs park up at -- or a special needs playground up at Nay Aug. I believe it was two weeks ago that we sent a letter to the Chamber based off a request from Miss Schumacher regarding the LERTA's marketing . We did receive a response back from Bob Durkin. And he advised that the billboard s were drawn up by their marketing vendor. And he further advised that the billboard advertising related to the LERTAs would be removed . And we will be meeting with Bob in the future. He did put out that invitation to us to meet with him to go over some of the things that the Chamber has been working on. So we'll set that up hopefully in the coming weeks when we get back into City Hall. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Also, on some of flooding issues we brought up last week I know I did bring up an issue on Froude Avenue. Myself and Councilman Gaughan were with a gentleman on South Webster Avenue next to the Stafford Meadow Creek that runs along side McNichols . I know there's going to be some grants put in for that grant work there. But, I mean, this is why we need an overall approach because if you look at the issues at Froude Avenue, when I went up and looked at them on Wednesday just knowing the topography there, I know the water flowing off the bottom of Froude Avenue is also contributing to the increased water down in Stafford Meadow Brook. So that's something that I'm hopeful we could get moving in the next few weeks. Hopefully we get that report from HRG regarding our stormwater and also get some engineering -- more engineering work done to really correct these problems on a whole scale level and not just piecemeal . And that's all I have for this week. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few things. So first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 of all, I want to thank the Scranton Fire Department . I'm sure everyone saw the newspaper about the woman on Yard Avenue in North Scranton who had her pool flooded and her property flooded by the Leach Creek. And they went up and helped her out a lot with pumping some of that water out. So that was really good. I want to thank them for that. And right down from where that woman lives in the 500 block of Leggett Street I have been down there quite a few times now again with flood issues and really just devastation for the people that live down on the 500 block of Leggett Street. Every time there is a torrential downpour they have to hold their breath and hope that their houses don't flood, their basements get ruined, washers and dryers. It's -- I've never seen anything like that. So the Mayor and Tom Preambo , the DPW Director were down there this weekend . They're going to have a meeting with DEP. And there is going to be something done down there. There has to be something done. There is so much debris in the creek that has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 been left unchecked over the years. And it's for a number of different reasons . But it does need to be cleaned out -- or cleared out rather. And there are some other things that probably need to be done as well there with the bank. So there is a number of issues. And I was told by the Mayor and Mr. Preambo that they were going to be addressed . So when they do meet with DEP, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could just check in with Mr. Preambo for a report back on what the next steps are. And again, I want to thank them for coming out and meeting with those residents . Last week during public participation there was a gentleman named Meyer Moskovitz . He was talking about a demolition at 616 Cedar Avenue. So if we didn't forward that to OECD, Mr. Voldenberg , Eileen Cipriani , if we can just make sure that that gets over to her. That would be the appropriate person for him to speak to about those concerns . And then also, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could check with the DPW on a dangerous tree on Drinker Place and in Green Ridge right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 behind Richmond Street, a woman reached out to me again very nervous about the tree. I'm not sure if it's in the public right of way but if we can get a response on that I would appreciate it. And then there was also a quality of life issue on 1036 Richmond that I will forward over to you as well, Mr. Voldenberg . And that's all. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING A “NO PARKING ZONE” DESIGNATING THE NORTHERLY SIDE OF VINE STREET FROM THE EASTERLY CURB LINE OF COSTELLO COURT EIGHTY-FIVE (85) FEET EASTERLY ON THE NORTHERLY SIDE OF VINE STREET AND PLACEMENT OF THE FOLLOWING SIGNS: THREE (3) R8-3 NO PARKING SYMBOL SIGNS 12” x 12”, ONE (1) WITH R-301 NO PARKING LEFT ARROW PLAQUE, ONE LEFT ARROW PLAQUE, ONE (1) WITH R-301 NO PARKING ARROW PLAQUE AND ONE (1) WITH R-301 NO PARKING RIGHT ARROW PLAQUE.

This whole -- this legislation came to be because of some residents in that area who were concerned about some really dangerous conditions , cars creeping out onto Costello Court. So our city engineer -- or creeping out onto Vine Street rather. Our city engineer and Corporal Justin Butler from the police department went out and did an assessment and this is what they came up with to hopefully mitigate some of those safety issues. This will definitely work so I will be voting in favor. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to take a second to explain there is really two changes major changes -- well, not major but there is two changes . So on the first page under the title meetings , it's just giving us the authority -- the Council the authority to conduct the meeting s remotely by providing a reasonably accessible method for the public to view, participate and comment pursuant to the Sunshine Act. So we have to do that in advance which is really what we've been doing since the country shut down back in March of 2020. So that's just memorializing that within our rules. And the only other change that you'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 notice is article five. There is a new paragraph under section one. And it's just giving Council the authority to implement any policies and procedures and protocol s to ensure the health and safety of attendance at the Council meetings. There is really four major ones that are included related to the pandemic and that is requiring people to wear facial mask covering their nose and mouths, limiting the number of persons that may attend Council meeting s in order to ensure appropriate social distancing , requiring all persons who wish to attend meetings to maintain the appropriate social distancing and then requiring all persons to have their body temperature read prior to entering Council Chambers . Now, we don't have -- we're obviously not going to have to do that forever because next week or -- not next week but Memorial Day weekend the Governor of Pennsylvania has announced that they are lifting all of the mitigation efforts for the pandemic , all of the protocols except for masking . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 That's the only one we're going to keep in place when we come back on June 1st. But for next week as I mentioned at the top of the meeting during announcements , we are going to have to limit the number of people in chambers to 50 percent of our maximum capacity . So that number hasn't been determined yet. We'll have to do that to be in compliance with the governor's orders. That will be lifted when we come back then the next week on June 1st. And then, of course, we're going to require face masks moving forward . And as I mentioned at the beginning of the meeting this is a fluid situation . Hopefully a month or two months from now we don't have to do that. But we're going to do that -- at least that safety precaution moving forward . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 168, 2021 - AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE PENNSYLVANIA GUN SAFETY ALLIANCE . MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety I recommend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 final passage of Item 7-C. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , for the last couple weeks I made it a point to say that I'm against this piece of legislation due to the fact that, you know, regulation of firearms falls outside the scope of municipal government . So with that, I could add more to that but I will be voting no for this piece of legislation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , so first of all, of course, I'm in favor of gun safety. But I'm also -- respect the Second Amendment . And when I became a Councilman I swore an oath to the state Constitution . As I mentioned last week I started researching this stuff. And I reached out to law enforce ment, veterans in the area; and they pretty much all said the same thing and confirmed what I really already thought that this might be a segue or a Trojan horse for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 something else that might infringe on legal gun owners. And the biggest concern I have too is this organization , it's a nonprofit . They're lobbyist . And what they do is, if you vote for this in your, you know, local cities with aspiration s to go onto higher office, they'll fund your campaign . So I'm not looking to do that. I mean, I'm looking to do what's right from here. I don't like this. I didn't feel good about it when we introduced it. So I'm definitely a no. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , first off, I believe we have a gun problem in this country . I think to suggest that this -- voting for this specific resolution is a violation of the Second Amendment or the state Constitution is at best misleading , at worst it's just idiotic . That being said, I do -- I don't believe that there is enough information of -- I believe it's too -- the information we got is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 too vague in terms of what exactly this group is pushing for. When you go to their website the language is vague. I know personally I'm in favor of increasing background checks. I'm in favor of stronger penalties for straw purchasers . I'm in favor of increasing red flag -- strength ening red flag laws. But most of all, I think that what we need to do to really stop gun violence is lift the liability shield against gun companies and hold them liable for the destruction they cause. That's the way I think we solve this. But I think it has to be solved on a national level. I don't think we should be able to have our own, you know, gun laws here and then, you know, have something different in Dunmore , Moosic. I think that gets problematic . So because of the vagueness of exactly what this gun safety alliance is claiming to be pushing for, for that reason I'm going to be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'd also like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 to speak on the question . I am in favor of increasing gun safety and ending gun violence in our City. You know, it's something very important to me. And I know that with the gun safety alliance there were several reputable organizations , associations listed that are part of the alliance . It did seem like a lot of -- Philadelphia or Pittsburgh centered organizations . However -- and I did do my research as well. And I recently spoke with cease fire Pennsylvania who I worked with in the past that -- in order to ask them some more because they are on the steering committee for the alliance . And the information I received from them was that it was started about a year ago and they're still, you know, trying to gain statewide traction . And their focus has been on passing a permit to purchase legislation on the state level. But I also don't feel like we've been provided with enough information on the legislation that they would be advocating for. And, you know, of course, open to other future 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 pieces of legislation that would be appropriate for Council to consider or to have, you know, perhaps the Mayor could come in and explain where she's coming from on something like this. But we just haven't I think received enough about it for me to vote in favor of the legislation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a couple comment s on this. Just like my colleagues , I am supportive of gun safety. I think anybody with common sense is. But I'm not going to be voting for this for two reasons . Number one, what many of my colleagues said, vague. The website is vague. First of all, when this legislation came down from the Mayor and the administration , there was nothing -- there was no information at all. We had to ask for that. And then still it's not exactly clear, you know, who is even behind this organization . When you go on their website there is an e-mail but there is no other contact information . So that is number one. Number two, bottom line here is that there is no teeth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 to this at all. There is nothing that can be enforce d. There is nothing that ultimately will be accomplished by us passing this in the City joining this group. I personally and being on Council for eight years here don't believe that Council should be a forum for making political statements . That's not our job as legislators . I would be worried that this would become a platform for, you know, making political statements and, you know, start joining groups. You know, that's not really what we're here for. There's a piece of legislation where there was actual teeth and you could actually enforce something , I would consider it. But I don't believe that that is the case here. And I think it's a slippery slope. And I think we're here to conduct the business of the City not, you know, promote all of these different causes. Even if agree with them or disagree with them, it just takes us down a road that I don't really think we should be going down at this point. So I'll be voting no. Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 Mr. Gaughan . Kevin, just -- yes, thank you, Mr. Gaughan . Kevin, just to touch on that preemption piece, is that something that Council needs to know when moving forward with something like this if something was to ever come down again? MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, you're muted, Kev. ATTY. HAYES: There's nothing we can do to change the -- Pennsylvania has a very strong preemption law. That's the law from the Commonwealth . There is no doubt about it. There's been court challenges to it. Like you all said tonight , I don't know whether that's one of the plans of this organization 's platform is to try to reverse that preemption law. I don't know. Because like you all said, there is not much out there. You don't have proposed legislation . You don't have propose d amendments . But I did circulate the preemption law for you all to review. And that's where things stand for better or worse. It's a very strong preemption law which basically says that no municipal ity can enact any statute which would restrict the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 sale, distribution of guns, firearms within its borders , which is contrary , which is more restrictive than what the state has basically . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR.
