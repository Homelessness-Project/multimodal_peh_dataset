MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: I just have one. For a limited time PPL is doing a neighborhood recycling . They are picking refrigerators , dehumidifiers , window air conditioners , small appliances like that. But you have to call and schedule . You could either put it at the curb and they'll pick it up or you can register on their site for an in-home pickup such as a refrigerator . If you go to their website , it's PPL.com and then look for recyclable and could you get to that. And there is also a 1-877-486-9204. And then they'll schedule a pickup of your appliances . That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. So tomorrow July 7th from 5 to 9 p.m., the Scranton School District Uniform Fundraiser , it's hosted by Scranton Police Department . Ten dollar donation , all proceeds will benefit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 uniforms , winter coat drive for the children in the Scranton School District . It's at the VFW Post 25 at 2291 Rockwell Avenue. There will be live entertainment by Friend of the Gypsy and it also includes dollar drink special , pizza and 50-50 basket raffle. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have two announcements . First, this Saturday there will be the fundraiser for the NEPA Youth Shelter and that will be taking place at the post -- ice cream and event place on 625 Decon Street. And that's going to be a tie-dye fundraiser. So it's something that's kid friendly . You could just bring a T-shirt and you get to tie-dye it. But they also ask that you bring a donation and some of the items that they need that you could bring include acre face wash and pads, men's boxer underwear , lady's bras, hair gels, hair clips of any size, headbands, nail clippers and files and nail polish remover or you could make a monetary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 donation . And it will be this Saturday from one to three. And then the other announcement that I had was the passing of someone within the community Rica Shaffer . And she was a very large part of the Scranton Jewish Community Center. She was a teacher and then she was the early Childhood Development Director for many years and even after retiring, continued to be very involved there. And so she had passed I believe on Sunday and services took place on Monday. And she was Israeli -American so Shiva will be taking place in Israel this week. That's all that I have. My condolences to her family. MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? I failed to mention Louise Clark passed away. She was the former principal at I think Whittier Elementary School. I worked with her several -- 10 years ago. And I attended her funeral on Saturday . She was a great person, a great school administrator and educator . So we're sad to see her pass. Frank, Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Any idea when we might see the property tax database on the City's website ? MR. KING: I don't have an update on that at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. How about the status of the arbitration on the police union's contract ? MR. KING: Oh, Joan, I think I have it in Fifth Order. I'm sorry. I apologize . MS. HODOWANITZ : All right. MR. KING: I'm sorry. I'm going to give you some of your time back here. I apologize . I am a little off track here. You asked about -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Arbitration on the police union contract . You could give that to me in Fifth Order then. MR. KING: Sure. MS. HODOWANITZ : Watching TV the last couple weeks, it was interest ing to note that most of the weather channel and National Weather Service are talking about the fact that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 we may have more smoke hazards all through the summer because they don't expect the wildfires in Canada to be extinguished until the fall which reraises the question , what will the city do if there is another code red? What are you going to do about the homeless population ? Now, I looked at the information that Dr. Saxena put on Third Order the other week. And I looked at her page on the website . And there isn't a whole lot of information . On the website , she's listed -- website for Scranton air quality index with nothing further on that. And then information she gave for Third Order under emergent public health issues, the last sentence says recently released health alerts and guidance to keep safe from wildfire smoke. The question still stands, what are you going to do for the homeless ? You have a code blue in the winter where you allow them to come indoors when it gets so cold. Code red, the guidance that the government is giving is you stay indoors . The homeless are outdoor s 24/7. You need a plan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And she's getting paid $120,000 a year by the Moses Taylor Foundation . And I know the Mayor wants to make her position permanent . That's fine, but she should be able to give us some specifics . Those people are not throw away people just because they are homeless . And I want to know. I've asked before. When are we going to see an RFP for the HUP test? MR. KING: I believe that they put an RFP out and they didn't get a response . MS. HODOWANITZ : Right, they're going to reissue an RFP. When will that reissue come out? MR. KING: I'll check on that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. The walkability study, I saw that the City Planning Commission is reviewing it. But what is the next step? Where do we go from here? Are we going to have study groups? Are we going to have focus groups? What is the city planning to do? And I would also like to know what's the next step on the stormwater . I see that Clarks Summit gave it a tentative thumbs up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 assuming it will not cost them any money. But where do we go from here? We've been (inaudible ) stormwater issue since we sold the Sewer Authority back in 2016. So we need some kind of way forward . What is the city planning to do on both walkability and stormwater ? And finally , I just want to make a comment . I come here every week for the public caucus. But it's always very annoying to sit in that front row and not be able to catch much of what you are all saying. Maybe the solution is microphones at every chair there. Maybe you need to project your voices. But you can't call it a public caucus if someone is sitting in the front row and can't hear you. I mean, isn't that why Jeff Horvath has to sit at the table just to hear what's being said? Please come up with a solution . It was more audible when we were in the City Clerk's office. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Joan. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Yesterday my wife and attended a cookout at a friend's house. On the way home about 9:30, driving down the road. It wasn't a well-travelled road; but in the street on the side people are shooting off fireworks . They were going maybe just 10 feet in the air but they were going out into the street. I had to go to the other lane so my car wouldn't get burned by the fireworks . I mean, you guys can make all the rules you want, make it a million dollar fine. If the rules aren't enforce d, nothing is going to happen. I read the paper today. One patrol woman to do the whole city, Erica Hanes is her name. She responded to a few calls, issued citations . The way I read it, she was the only one out of the whole police department . She had to cover the whole city. I think that's just ridiculous . One person cannot cover the whole city. And I know they had probably hundreds of calls. Whoever came up with that -- I don't know. I don't think they are that smart. Anyway -- oh, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 still have more. That's right. We got home and my dog would not go out to go to the bathroom . I had to wait until 11:00 until it finally calmed down. But I went upstairs in the bathroom and one of our cats was hidden in a little space between our toilet and the wall. He never did that before. He was scared to death. I mean, it's just out of control . If the ordinance s aren't enforced , what good is it? We need more -- why don't they put code enforcement people out there, make them authorize d to give tickets out if there is not enough police officers . Something more has to be done. It's just out of control . A guy on Talkback 16 today said they should ban them and I don't disagree with him. If they want to see fireworks, goes to a professional show. And in that article today, the guy had to get his garden hose out because his lawn caught on fire. And that patrol woman Hanes was called to a house that was hit by fireworks . And she cited people there. One person cannot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 patrol the whole city. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Okay, the walkability study again. A few days in the paper a gentleman on the Subway on Washington Avenue, the pizza place that's next to it thought it was a good idea. He said it's going to make walking safer. I would love for him to explain how it's going to make walking safer. As I said last week, now if a blind person comes up to a corner the light -- something beeps and that's how they know to walk. If there's stop signs they are not going to know when to walk and cross the street, same with disabled people and wheelchairs , how anybody can explain to me that's a good idea I would love to hear an explanation . It's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard as I said last week. Does anybody up there think that is good idea to put stop signs in place of traffic lights? Well, I guess your silence tells the story. I guess you agree with me. MR. KING: We'll speak in Fifth Order.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Next, I'm watching the news tonight , here we go again, more mass shootings. Five people killed in Philadelphia and a few other states, mass shooting s. As I stated before, as long as we have a Republican s in power who bow down to the NRA, we'll never have gun control . These mass shootings will just continue . So people have to wake up and get these Republicans out of office who have the NRA in their pockets until maybe people in their family are affected , maybe they'll do something then. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . Many years ago I -- MR. KING: Please, when someone is speaking , I'd appreciate if you don't talk so we could hear. Thank you. I apologize . MR. ELLMAN: I cleaned a swimming pool for one Robert Preston. He was a World War II naval ace flyer. At that time he owned Flying Tigers Airline . That's like saying what FedEx would be now. One day I was sitting at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 the pool having a beer with him. And a friend of his came over named Joe Pine. That was a personality then. And they started talking about a property Mr. Pine had for sale. He said something along the lines he bought this house years before because it was everything he wanted except it was next to a black couple. He said, I didn't let that interfere with my buying the house one bit. But now that he got house for sale, he said nobody wants to live next to this family. And I don't know what the conclusion was. But two weeks ago I did the same thing and it backfired. I said I learned to live with the Mayor. The next day I read about this atrocious waste of our money on a walkability . You know, why didn't somebody just buy a book about it or all the people in this administration , I don't know how many that is, all the hens in this administration you couldn't come up with the same thing by just having a meeting like you all did right here tonight , $240,000 down the drain. You know, I bet Speck and his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 colleagues just laugh all the way to the bank. This was a real con job. That's not just my opinion . That's what I hear three or four times a week the last couple of days. I don't know, next maybe the Mayor will buy a bridge or two or start advertising in New York City to come to Scranton to shop. You know, downtown is -- I guess the residents are mostly transits. They're not working people and taxpaying ownership people. I don't see where they need a walkability plan. The bicycle plan, that's ridiculous too. This -- this is nothing but an abortion plan for downtown . It's absurdity . Extend sidewalks , I sat here -- I've stood here for years. I got across the street one block from me there is no sidewalks . 2800 block of North Scranton on both sides of the street, there is no sidewalks . There is hundred year old crumbled up slate sidewalks . Directly across the street from my house is a slate sidewalk that's falling apart. Now taxpayers are being asked to pay for sidewalks downtown to extend them into the street. This plan is -- I don't know. I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 thinking it just failed because it's going to be such an expense after it started . Like Dave said last week, you're talking about taking something -- these lights and so forth that cost millions to put back together like they belong. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , last week I tried to make a point and question how often the city reverifies the residency of an employee . During this I pointed out that the Scranton Police Officer Hallock was a possible person who may have lacked the residency waiver. I've always stated that words matter, especially in legal documents and words do matter. I took the stance from a WNEP article and I failed to read it properly . In the article it said he died over the weekend at a home in Kingston . I missed the "a" in that article . As I read it, at home in Kingston rather than at a home in Kingston . I would not have made a mistake had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 they put visiting a home in Kingston as that would have made it clear. Nonetheless , I missed a simple letter "A" in reading it. And it changed the entire context . Words matter. So I have to take this moment and retract my statement and correct it because that does matter as well. To not address my error would compound it and it is the right thing to do. My apologies to anyone who I may have offended with my error. Now moving onto public safety, the picnic back in Minooka at Davis Street, I took the opportunity to take a look at the officer that was crossing people across Davis Street as it's now a well travelled and heavy travelled route. I note a few things just observing him crossing people. One, was the police car where it was parked. I asked him if the headlights on the vehicle needed to be on since he had all of the emergency lights on because I identified that the vehicle was parked where it was with headlights on. The headlights were actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 blinding people from coming up the hill from the Taylor Avenue side and having parking lots and emergency lights on would have been much safer because then you would not be looking at headlights pointing directly down the street. He had a vest on, a traffic vest on as he should have. It was opened up and that was perfectly fine. But what I did notice is he lacked direction control batons like they have at parking lots for events, the flashlights with the cones on them to make it visible . He took a regular flashlight and he would flick it at traffic that was oncoming which didn't offer the visibility that it really needed at the intersection as there are really not adequate lights at that crosswalk as it usually isn't needed. I asked him about the cones. And he said they couldn't have cones. I asked him would they want them. He said, well, an officer beforehand that he saw use those cones and he got hit with a car anyway. So it really doesn't matter. You just have to pay attention . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Using that same logic, an officer with a gun gets shot. Does that mean no officer should carry guns because that doesn't matter? I am concerned about this because when you are in a crosswalk at an intersection with headlights coming up and down, the crosswalk is dark and you are there as a crossing guard, visibility is important for the police officer and the people who are actually physically crossing across the street. They had some flares on the ground to draw attention to the center, but really it was not visible especially for the young children who are crossing that street to not have flashlights with the cone batons like you see in airports or you'll see in parking lots where they direct people. For the safety of the citizens , it would be nice to see if we could get that safety equipment purchased and have police officers equipped in using them when they are running these safety patrols , not only for the officer s but for the reason they're there is to protect the people that are crossing . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Virgil Argenta . I want to start off, when I come here it's because I'm concerned and I care. I get the feeling that I just get appease d or I get ignored . I have asked over the weeks for an inventory list of all city-owned property , a list of all city vehicles , take-home cars and by who, a list and cost of porta lavs that are all over the city. I've asked about the homeless camps, the updates . I brought to attention about the propane tanks. Now there is an electric cord running down on Railroad Avenue from Seventh -- and I'll show you the picture soon running into a homeless camp with the electricity out. Two people have been burned over the last couple of weeks with the propane tanks, one person was stabbed two days ago and when the police went to the camp to find the other individual , propane tanks were exploded inside the tents before the police were able to go in or the fire department to address it. This is an issue. I don't want to be appease d. Something needs to be done. As 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Joan said, these homeless people are human beings as well. There was a stabbing that took place at 9:30 in the morning at Lackawanna and Seventh. That's a problem . It's broad daylight. Lackawanna Avenue is the gateway to West Side and it's the gateway to town. And I have an issue with that because I put you guys on notice with that. The fire bills, I had another person contact me with a fire bill for $8,700. The Scranton School District burnt an apple turnover last week at headquarters . Is the school district going to get a bill? Weston Field, I asked on the structural condition of the Weston Field bathhouse, did I get anything yet? The pool is still closed but there's Job Johnnies there. I asked about the clock on Lackawanna Avenue. That's been like that for years at 11:20. I had given the list of over 175 vacant, distressed , condemned properties all over the city. I'm no stranger . I'm Victor Arneta. I post daily on the properties and the condition of the city. Safety issues, I've reported safety 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 issues throughout this city day in and day out. There's one in the 1400 block of South Main Avenue where the woman has two children and a dog, the hole is 4 feet deep and it's been a year and a half, totally unacceptable . I asked about the Rubicon . You are in for a surprise with Rubicon , I'll tell you that much. Weston Field, the takeover of the Weston Field on the weekend s, any input? The same thing happened over the weekend. The only thing was the Director was down there trying to get a little bit of order. It was still out of control . The other day driving past Engine 9, I don't know if it was the signal or what. But truck one had a paper on the window like a -- and it said out of service . We all know what that means, the ones that know, we know. Are we headed for another brownout from previous administrations ? The Pride flag is still standing . Pride month is over. If you want to do flags and you want to have the flag parties or whatever you want to have, I need a list of the properties . Pick a lot, pick a park, put as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 many flags as you want. City Hall, the people's building should be an American flag and an American flag only, period. And if you elected official s, if you're okay with the administration ignoring you with all your questions and issues and you can't get answers and our Mayor would rather parade around the state and tell other people how to do things, I have an issue with that. We taxpayers , we're not happy to it. And we don't agree with it. So what is our recourse of action as taxpayers so we can get the answers that you can't? It's hard enough asking you guys questions and you say administration never got back to me. Well, you know what, administration better start answering to somebody because we taxpayer s are the investor s in this city that you're pissing our money away. Now, if I may approach ? MR. KING: I'd appreciate you keep the language -- thank you. MR. ARGENTA : Bad enough we have vacant and distressed properties , a property like that devalues all of our properties when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 we try to refinance and try to get loans. And what it does to our fire insurance with the distressed properties , that's sinful. Thank you guys. I appreciate your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer , taxes paid. Didn't get as much (inaudible ) the deputies going down the county building this year. Last year I felt like I know how an inmate feels on a recent arrest with the way they shook me down. So my compliments to this year. I was at the Scrantastic celebration . And there was one observation I saw. It really -- they really took the street blockades down a little too early. And there was cars speeding through there when people were trying to cross the streets to get to their cars. I think I got to my car about 20 after 10. So I really recommend that you block off the street -- Spruce Street, Biden Street, whatever you want to call it right at the top 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 of Jefferson Avenue and don't let anybody through unless they are a vendor or something like that until 10:30. Two weeks ago a train accident was mentioned . And in 2018 in the White House regulations were laxed -- relaxed on train safety and transportation safety and bank failures . And the bank that failed was the Silicon Valley, there was 8,100 accounts , not 8,100 checks not mailed on payday as a result. And that's what you get with laxed federal regulations . But it's very lucky because we have Bounty the quicker picker upper. Okay, and there was a letter in the paper. I have complain ed about this before, can't control it, nothing to do with you guys. But it was from a person from Abington telling us to build a pool already . What does he have to do with Scranton ? Abington is wealthy enough, why don't they build a pool, you know, and we could come up there sometime and start out with a quarter a day admission . Now, I have a little statement to make here. We astutely study our astute 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 studies to ensure our astute studies are properly astute to ensure properly that our astuteness of our studies . And we get these studies like this traffic thing with Scranton downtown . I personally think that, you know, towns would come back by normal means because people will get tired of travelling all the time. I was 20 minutes away from work up in Susquehanna County. My boss moves to Moosic, 500 miles a week, you know, back and forth, back and forth. All I could afford to do was get some old clunker and put it back together again and drive it until it dropped and then get another clunker . After six days a week, I got to go out on a Sunday and try to fix the old clunker . You know, it wasn't a good lifestyle after a while. And the traffic signals torn down, I mean, would they have been to be reinspect ed, recertified or out of date and they are only there because they are grandfathered in. And how many dollars for a redo? Do we really need bikes downtown ? You know, in Europe, the Netherlands are flat. I rode a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 bicycle in Jersey when I was kid on vacation , pretty pleasant . It's not pleasant in Scranton . You have to more or less plan your route so you are not on a hill forever . And then the money that's been lost, 500 Lackawanna Avenue, 30 million dollars . The Hilton defaulted on 5 million , the mall defaulted . I mean, we just keep spending money and lending money and where does it go? Not to us. I mean, it's years before you were ever here. Thank you for your tolerance . Have a good night. MR. KING: You too. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , citizen and taxpayer . Could someone tell me what has happened to the pilot, the payment in lieu taxes program ? Has a committee been formed or a strategy of how that's -- MR. KING: There was an RFP put out to have a company evaluate . It's called the HUP test. I think you've heard us mention that. So the HUP test would go in and evaluate whether they qualify for -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm talking about the people who are the people who are no longer right now not paying, not whether they are entitled to that. But even if they have been given that right, it is their responsibility to do something for the city in lieu of paying those taxes. MR. KING: I know the administration has been reaching out to quite a number of nonprofits to try to encourage them to, you know, since they are nonprofit they are not required to. So it takes some convincing to try to get nonprofits to realize they should be contributing in some way, shape, or form to the city. MS. SCHUMACHER : I like and I think a lot of other taxpayers would like to see how many of those are being held a week and what is happening if we are getting anything out of that or not. But they deserve -- we deserve to have something in lieu of them paying taxes. Now, I come here regularly . I've been doing it for I think a couple of decades now and nothing seems to change. And my friend here will be up here in a minute I think and we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 have been walking down around town. And it really is depressing to look at all of the empty buildings that we have. I tell him what I used to buy in an empty store when I was in high school but it doesn't bring it back. What is -- you know, what is anybody doing to turn this around? I don't know. I would like to ask each of you to tell me what difference you will see in this city five years from now that you -- that is different from what it is today. Dr. Rothchild , do you want to start? DR. ROTHCHILD : Do you want us to do that right now? I thing it that might be better in Fifth Order because I have a number of things that I would like to see changed . MS. SCHUMACHER : Or goal. What would be a good goal so that we achieve ? You achieve what you set your target on. If we don't have a target to have something different at the end of 3 years or 5 years or 10 years, then you're not going to work through it. Nobody does. Everybody is busy. Okay, anybody else have anything you see different ? MR. MCANDREW : What I want to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 different is, of course, the decrease of blight in these abandon ed and decrepit properties taken care of. And I also want to see an increase in public safety like because there is -- crime is an issue. Gangs are an issue. So I would like to see the police department in tandem with the State Police form a task force and work on them issues. They are the two biggest things I would like to see happen in five years. I would like to see it happen next year, but you know. MS. SCHUMACHER : Mr. King. MR. KING: I'll answer in Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So I get frustrated as well. I know that we do have, you know, 10 new code enforcement vehicles . Blight has been the thing that -- I get addresses every week. These addresses go on a list. We get a little bit of feedback of what's going on. But I'm not really seeing any movement on them. It just -- the addresses keep building up. With those vehicle s, with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the extra staff that they have I would like to see the blight addressed . Right now I'm not seeing it done. I would like to -- we have a park study that's been completed . I would like to see some of the work get done with the parks to maintain the parks and then from the maintenance , improve the parks. I think we have 68 million dollars here that I hope when it's spent and over with, the city will look different than it looks today because there's a real opportunity . It's a one-time opportunity that we have. And I think Nay Aug is a good example of something that we can take some of that money and use it to better the lives of our citizens . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, Mr. Smurl, you luck out. I'm out of time. MR. SMURL: That's fine. I'll give you my idea in Fifth Order. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . ELI VERCHUK : I'm Eli Verchuk from Scranton , and I'm wondering why the Renaissance Park -- no, Monday we were there during 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 operating hours according to the sign on the gate. And well, the gate was locked and the bottom door to the elevator was locked as well. This afternoon we went back up there and the gate was this time opened but yet the bottom door was -- to the elevator was locked. The top was open but when we went in to push the button for the elevator , there was no response from the elevator , no sound, nothing . And I was wondering -- MR. KING: What was the name of that? ELI VERCHUK : Over by the clock that has the wrong time, I think the Renaissance -- MR. KING: Oh, on Lackawanna Avenue. I see what you're saying. So you're saying the elevator door was not working . It was locked. ELI VERCHUK : The elevator was locked on the bottom and the elevator was not respond ing to the button or anything . MR. KING: Okay, we'll look into that. ELI VERCHUK : Okay. Thank you. MR. DAY: Tyler Day, Scranton resident . I just wanted to talk briefly about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 the minimum wage resolution that's coming up for a vote. I read it today. It's a nice resolution . It's a pretty much toothless resolution . I would probably vote for it. I mean, the House is gone. The House is finishing the budget today. The Senate is gone. So it's a little bit late for that. And at this point, you know, unless you're 15, 16 years old or a tip worker which is a completely separate class of worker, you are probably not making minimum wage anyway. So as nice as that is though, if you really do want to raise the wages of people in the city and county in the Northeastern Pennsylvania , it's going to be through economic development . It's going to be through job growth. In talking to many business owners in the city like I have and business owners from surrounding communities who could probably be -- it would probably be cheaper for them to be in Scranton just looking at real estate costs. They do everything they can to not be in the city because the burdens that are attached to being in the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 So as nice as this is, I hope in the next months, years we look at making it easier for businesses to start in the city, make it easier for businesses to grow in the city so wages can rise because a rising tide lifts all boats. Government can't create wealth. Government can't create artificially higher wages, so thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do, a few. The first is Nay Aug Pool Complex , we had received two proposal s for the pool update construction and design. Once the city chooses one of the proposals and then we can move forward with more funding and the residents meetings to discuss what the resident s actually want to be include d in this project . I believe that we are going in the right direction by applying for all the funding that's available to us. I also believe you just don't throw a pool in without having some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 kind of an idea how we're going to pay for it and also include all the resident s in the City of Scranton to decide how we're going to do that. If we plan and organize this entire project now for future funding to include maintenance , repairs, and what we're going to do to keep up on the pools instead of having them being neglected like they have been the past 20 years, that would be the right way to go. By securing funding and stuff now, that will eliminate any reason to take a loan out for a pool or a cause tax increases for that. I understand nobody likes feasibility studies . No one likes to pay for them. I certainly don't like study after study. But there's reasons why they have to be done. And we need these designs and construction of these because we just can't just go up and decide to put a pool somewhere and spend 7 million dollars and not know what you're going to do. But I have since the day I was appointed to Council been on the pool complex at Nay Aug Park. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Every chance I get I ask the administration about a pool. This is something I've worked on from the first day and this is something I will not give up on. So that's Nay Aug Park. I hope we move forward shortly by picking the company that's going to be. The other thing what I see for Scranton in the next five years that we were just handed, walkability study. I know everyone doesn't agree with it. When I was told the study for downtown -- and I couldn't imagine how removing traffic lights and changing streets from two ways to one way would be -- make it safer for pedestrian s or even grow businesses in downtown . So I read the entire study. I went to Lackawanna College to hear the presentation . So when you see the statistics and how many people, how many accident s we have, how many pedestrian s are struck by automobile s in Scranton , how many people die from getting run over, it kind of makes you realize we need to change the way our downtown controls traffic . And it would just make it better. So I thought about one day I was driving up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Linden Street and I see three green lights ahead of me, and all I see is a one-way street with two big lanes and a line in the middle. I try to make the third light, the most unsafe thing you could do. I'm not the only one that does it because there's people passing me on my other side. So we have to figure out a way to make it safer, slow traffic down. And this isn't something that's going to be done overnight . This is going to be many years. We're looking at a five-year plan. This may be an eight or ten-year plan. But that is one way we could deal with changing our downtown . That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a two updates , a couple addresses and some other things. So Rubicon , the only update I have on Rubicon is last week we were thinking that would be in to give an update, Chris Smith and some of the people from Rubicon . It looks like at this point in time it's going to be delayed until September . So we're not going to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 that update in July as we hoped. The Weston Field structure over at Weston Field, the response that we got -- so I was looking into what are the condition s, what are we looking at for repairs. Well, the response that we got was just simply sorry for the late response . We have funding allocated for the project and have conducted structural assessments . Prior to moving forward with any plans, we just need to meet with the project engineers to discuss the plans for the pools, the building s and the space outlined in the park's plan. So that is update on Weston Field. I have three addresses , Mr. Voldenberg . One is 427 Tenth Avenue, and the other is 419 Tenth Avenue. And then I have 317 Oak Street, it's the rear address . It's one I put in in the past. But I got another call about it as well as street sweeping . I got a call about street sweeping on Wyoming Ave, over in Green Ridge. They say that they've seen the street sweepers on other streets but Wyoming Avenue hasn't seen it in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 quite some time. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look it into, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : The last thing, there is funding going into the facades on Main Avenue. And some of that ARPA money was suppose d to be dedicate d to project s along Main Avenue. I would like to see our Main Avenue from our borders in Taylor in West Side all the way over to our borders in Dickson City and in North Scranton . I would like to see Main Avenue revitalize d while we're here to look like the way it looked when I was younger or prior to me being even born because I always did love Scranton 's Main Avenue. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. I have a number of things so I will try to move through them quickly . A couple e-mails that we received , one or two of them was not forwarded to you yet, Mr. Voldenberg , so I'll send them if you haven't received them. One of them was about the 1600 block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 of Linden Street, someone requesting permit parking is interested in having that on the street because of difficulties parking , a lot of employees from the hospital parking and some other households having a lot vehicle s. I think they said one household had up to six cars and other people from other streets parking there. So that limits them. So if we could get in touch with him and explain the process to be able to get permit parking if it's appropriate there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : And I receive d a complaint about an overgrown empty lot that is on Taylor Avenue. I believe it's 429 Taylor Avenue and found that it was an absentee landlord for that property , an LLC which we have a lot of problems with. And they did receive a notice of violation . So the next step is a quality of life ticket if that is not resolved . So that seems like that will be the likely case. And we receive d a couple e-mails from someone who lives on Clearview Street. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And they have not been getting the garbage picked up there. They said 1700, 1800, and 1900 blocks of Clearview Street have not been picked up and that was as of like 4:00 this afternoon that it still hasn't been. So if we can get DPW over there to pick up the garbage . I'm not sure why it's being missed there. And I had mentioned about the -- previously about properties that had fires and that, you know, about the tracking of it and how Council could be better informed because we do receive complaint s about those properties and question s as to when they are going to be taken care of, if they are on the demo list, if they're condemned , etc. So I would appreciate it if we could get a regularly updated list sent to us and it also has to do with like Act 29 through the Treasury Department . They have a list there so if we could get the regular status update on those properties if we could request that, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yeah, I'll ask if they would expand on those lists.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And something I've been asking for for a long time has been a list of the handicap parking violations in the city. And I finally received it so I'm happy about that. And they included both 2022 and 2023. And I didn't have doubts that they were giving out violation s to those parking in those handicap spots, but I do also want to compare to once we make the signs more visible , especially downtown if that has an impact on the number of violations if people aren't violating as much and they are more aware of where they are parking . However , I didn't really notice a whole lot of streets that were located downtown that were on that list. So I assuming it's more like people who have a handicap spot in front of their house and then call that someone is in their spot and then the police officer comes and tickets them as a result. So I would like to ask for some more patrols downtown or when the downtown patrols are around that area if they could flag some of that parking , especially the one on Penn Avenue that people really seem to frequently violate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 if they could keep a closer eye on that. I didn't see that one on there at all. And anytime I'm near that spot, I see that someone is parked in it who doesn't have a handicap placard . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, Doctor. DR. ROTHCHILD : Great. Thank you. For the paving list, we had a brief conversation about this in caucus. I was disappoint ed that a number of streets were taken off of the paving list. But that was because American Water has project s planned for them within 2024 and then they will be paved. So it doesn't make sense for the city to dig them up and pave them -- or pave them now for them to be dug up by American Water which is what we typically try to avoid. But I do understand the frustration that people have because those who have been waiting for a long time, like, say Mr. Raines on Monroe Avenue, that's one of the streets that was on there. There is one in the 600 block of North Webster that we have been asked about for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 a while. Those are some of the ones that are being kicked off to the side until American Water takes care of them and people who have been waiting for years for their streets to be taken care of and they were finally on the list. So I do understand that and I wish there was a way we could avoid that. But it sounds like they will be done in 2024 with the American Water project s. But that's the time. So I think we need to continue to stay on top of American Water and the utility companies and make sure that the paving is being completed , the project s are being completed so if people do have an issue as the project s are occurring , I really would encourage them to contact us or contact the city for us to help resolve those issues as they come up. And I did have a list of a few things for Miss Schumacher who asked about what some of the priorities were for the next five years so I could tell you what my priorities would be, what things I would really love to see improve with the city over that time, but, you know, just thinking about the future so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 blight has always been my number one thing. And I think we need to get a better hold on the absentee landlords . I feel like that's a large part of the problem . And I think with the increase in rental registrations , that will help some of the issue, not all of it. But I'm really looking forward to increasing the number of rental properties within the city that are going to be register ed and we can get them to better comply with the ordinances . And also accessibility of the city, that goes hand in hand with walkability like we have been talking about these past few weeks. I would really like to see a larger scale sidewalk repair program because of sidewalks throughout the city are a mess and that's something that I am personally very interested in working on, an increase in our business es and startups. I have certainly seen some of that but that's going to take time. And I want to see more and more of it. And it also is difficult for me to walk around downtown and then see all of these empty storefronts where I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 feel like there could be -- and I think about all the different business es that could go through those places. And so I would love to see more and more of that. Also keeping the college students here after they graduate , I want to see more of them deciding to stick around in Scranton and investing in Scranton and increasing the number of pilots that we have. And it's a goal I think for us for all of us to see that number increase . And then just concerning the park improvements , getting the pool at Nay Aug, those are very important to me too. That's everything . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, thank you. So we did discuss in caucus that a couple streets are going to get bumped off the paving list and I'm glad -- you know, I'm sure they are not happy and I understand their frustration as well. But I'm glad we're doing this with some better communication we've received from American Water because in the past they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 wouldn't tell us and then we would have paved this and they would be digging it up. So with that said, that leaves open some paving, right? So I would like to know, reach out to administration . So since there are a couple coming off the list, are there other ones going on the list because they should be going -- going to do it 2024, you know, there will be separate money for that. And with that said somebody reached out to me today. So it's the 2100 of Parkhurst Place in Tripp Park. All the Court is paved from Main to Filmore , except for this one block. It's between Farr Street and Dorothy . So, you know, see if that's a possibility since you have a couple openings ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And for the past couple of weeks I've been talking about and everybody is in an uproar about, you know, God bless these people that have structural fires that they are receiving bills that, you know, no one's ever heard before. We're told it's been going on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 forever . Solicitor Gallagher sent a letter to administration asking, you know, stop this and also asking, what, for bills for how long, Mr. Gallagher? ATTY. GALLAGHER : I don't have it in front of me. MR. MCANDREW : Like for the past 10 years? ATTY. GALLAGHER : I believe it was since the -- I believe the first ordinance . MR. MCANDREW : '99? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, '99. I believe the letter went back to '99. I'll double-check for you. MR. MCANDREW : We're told this has been occurring forever and obviously it's not because no one ever heard of it. It's more prevalent now. I received a call right before I got here today from a poor guy who his property was hit by lightening on Blair Avenue a couple weeks ago, right, a couple weeks ago, lost everything . His daughter was living in this house that he bought. He lost everything . In less than six days, the only correspondence he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 got in that six days was a bill for $8,400 to his house after losing everything in that state of mind to receive this bill that supposedly there's an ordinance that says we're allowed to do it. I have yet to find it. I looked. I brought it up a couple weeks ago three ordinance s, the one that was from 2000 -- no, 1999, 2000 and then 2021, all three of them ordinance s only refer to vehicles , all right, so vehicle spill or accident . And the only thing amended in those two previous ordinance s is a fee schedule . So the prices went up. So I'm okay with that. If, you know, a vehicle comes from out of town, a truck delivery and has an accident and there's a gasoline spill, of course, you want the fire department there. Of course, they should probably charge them and it goes on their car insurance . But my problem is and my fear right now is, now that it's out there and I hear more and more about it all the time that the fire department -- I'm not blaming the firefighter s because they never heard of it. They don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 really want to do it but they are require d to do it that people when they start hearing that they might pay 2, 3, 4, 8 thousand dollars , I'm afraid they are not going to call the fire department . I'm afraid they are going to try to put out a fire themselves and endanger themselves or even God forbid, you know, lose a family member because of that. So with that said, I want to make a motion tonight that -- asking the city to stop issuing structural bills for fires. Okay, and with that said -- and then, you know, I don't think there is an ordinance we could amend because there is nothing there about structures . So, Solicitor Gallagher , you could take a look at that for us to see what actions we could take, either create a new ordinance or whatever . But for tonight , I just want to make a motion to send a message to administration , this billing that this needs to stop. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second that. MR. KING: Okay. So we're in Fifth Order right now. You'll make a motion -- MR. MCANDREW : I just made the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 motion and he seconded it and then you need to vote. MR. KING: All right. So there's been a motion and a second to send correspondence to the Mayor's office, the administration , perhaps the fire department -- it should go to the Mayor's office requesting them to cease and desist with the structural -- with the billing -- the billing for the structural fires. On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I should have announce d this in Third Order. We did have an executive session this evening to discuss pending litigation Stilp versus the City of Scranton , 3-2022-CV-01172 and as it relates to open burn litigation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Okay, I have a few items here from last week. Mrs. Schumacher , regarding the concrete barrier at the entrance to the Biden Expressway at Jefferson Avenue, PennDOT district traffic studies and safety supervisor advised that they're working with their paving parking delineation people on the solution . They are considering installing reflective delineat ors and possibly painting the leading edge depending on the condition of the concrete . Len Srebro was here last week regarding the North Dewy Avenue and Lafayette Street, the city public works director advised that DPW will place the drainage issue on their list and schedule as time and staffing permits . Mr. Argenta , sent all issues and concerns regarding the Weston Field complex to code enforce ment, LIPS and the Scranton Police Department , will advise responses and any next steps as received . It was mentioning earlier Rubicon will now be coming in in September . I have a few other things here. Oh, the pocket park on Linden and Wyoming seems to be almost at a halt I would say at this stage of the game. We're going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 reach out to Scranton Tomorrow and find out what's going on. From what I understand , the next step is just to lay down the electric , whatever needs to be put down there. And then I guess I don't know if there is gravel and dirt and landscaping , just need to finish that project . I don't know if they ran out of money or what the situation is. But we're going to reach out to Scranton Tomorrow and try to get an answer on that. The clock at Lackawanna Avenue, a group is coming on the 13th of July from Ohio to take a look at that. And I believe that the city, the administration is in conversation with Steamtown concerning the elevator issues at the raised pocket park downtown . So the Mayor did bring that up to me today when I spoke to her. In terms of the walkability study, Mrs. Schumacher indicated nothing changes . You know, I can't sit here and tell you flat out that I'm full on 100 percent for this full walkability study. I can tell you that I'm going to keep an open mind. I think something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 needs to be done. I know myself I use the city sometime s as a passthrough when I'm going over to West Side or Keyser Avenue. And it's human nature, you're trying to get that next green light and not be stuck. And, you know, is it appropriate , probably not. Is it dangerous, probably . You have a tendency to drive quicker trying to get to those lights. So, I mean, do I think that all the lights need to come out, do I think that there could be certain changes that need to be put in place, I believe so. I think there are things we can do to make this city safer. And I think that walkability study provide s a lot of good direction as to some things at least we could try. I know it's walkability study. I don't need to be funny. But we need to walk before we run. So I think there is certain aspects of that that we should seriously consider moving forward , you know, perhaps at the corners or intersection slightly raised like -- I don't want to call it -- I guess it would be kind of speed bumps. They'd be raised 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 to assist the disabled , the handicapped . And also, you know, I wouldn't want to see with the stop signs if there wasn't some mechanism to address those who are visually impaired or hearing impaired , so I'm keeping an open mind on that walkability study. I think that there's some great opportunities to make the downtown a better place for our citizens who live in the downtown area and who live, walk, and make a friendlier place. Some of the things I would like to see over the next few yeas, I would like to see more business es in the downtown . And I know we have an incubator center down on Lackawanna Avenue and there is also one up on the mountain up there in Jessup. So I would love to see new businesses come into the city. How to make that happen, not exactly sure. But, you know, I believe that there are things that we could do to attract more businesses downtown and perhaps improving the way that the downtown looks and the way that the downtown runs to make it more business friendly . I do want to -- as Dr. Rothchild 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 indicated , increase the number of pilots and work -- we've met with the school district to talk about different ways to try to attack and go after nonprofit s to try to encourage them to contribute more to the city because we certainly do provide a lot of service s for these nonprofit s and they should be helping the city out and contributing . Many of them do things that do benefit the city, there's no two ways about it. But, you know, it's a two-way street. Street signs, I would like to see the street sign project completed . That is very important for our city. Mr. McAndrew and several others mentioned blight needs to be addressed . There is no two ways about it. And Mr. Argenta is always bringing up those issues. There is no two ways about it that we need to address blight and make our city cleaner . And, you know, I applaud Mr. Smurl and his group that go around and they're trying to do their part volunteering . There used to be an old saying, you know, we all need to be part of the solution . Well, I think that, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 know, part of it is education and trying to get people to realize , hey, if each and every one of us took care of our own block, took care of our own house and, you know, making sure that you know -- littering , we need to have a cleaner city to attract more people here and to make our city look more welcoming . And but, you know, the bottom line is people need to be conscientious , you know, instead of throwing cigarettes or throwing cups and Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds and things -- people have no problem throwing it out on the street and that's -- to me, that's appalling . So, you know, we as a city need to, you know, maybe provide more trash receptacles around the city and maybe, you know, make sure we have a program with our DPW to try to get around and address some of these properties at major intersection s and corners and entrances to the city. That's important to me. I also want to see a pool at Nay Aug Park and I want to see that project completed over the next few years. Nay Aug Park I think is a gem. It's a beautiful -- one of our many beautiful parks in the city. But that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 certainly lacking. So that is something I really like to see. Our new zoning ordinance has disallowed any additional surface parking lots in downtown Scranton . I'm thrilled about that. We don't need any more surface parking lots. I would like to see building s on those open lots or parks, something that is going to attract more businesses . You know, I know that Mr. Basalyga is looking to putting a building down on the corner of I guess it would be Mulberry and Franklin , I believe . So I look forward to see things like that happen and more businesses opening , you know, within our city. Roads paved, I want to see us continually constantly trying to keep our roads paved and in the best condition as possible . And for those that, you know, the money drys up and it's hard to get that paving done to at least get out and make sure that we're on top of getting pothole s fixed so that people can drive and walk and bike safely in the city. That's a cross section of some of the things I would like to see over the next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 few years to make our city a better place.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 263, 2023 – APPOINTMENT OF SELINA ANDIAPPAN , SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , TO THE POSITION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT , EFFECTIVE JUNE 19, 2023. MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-G. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I spoke about this for the last several weeks. I would like to see individual s that come for these position s come in front of Council for Council 's advice and consent prior to their beginning working the job. I'm not sure who did the vetting on this one, but, I mean, when we were looking at the backup information , we see that a resume hasn't even been updated that doesn't even reflect the work we've done in the city so far since we've been employed here. We also work two full-time jobs it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 looks like. So are we going to be dedicating all of our time to the City of Scranton ? So when it comes to the vetting , I'm not sure if it's all been properly done. And I'm going continue my stance this week and vote no for the passage of 7-G. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MR. MCANDREW : Nope, nope, nope. So on the question , so I've been begging for a handbook for three years. We get one. In May it states that advice and consent is required before an appointment of certain positions , this being one of them. And it's also in the charter . So this is nothing personal to this young lady. But this -- you know, my vote is a vote about policy and procedure . You know, we're constantly reminded as Council members from the administration , you know, you got to follow the rules. You can't have this meeting. You can't do this. You can't do that. But they need to follow the rules. So that's why I'll be voting no. MR. KING: On the question , I did have a conversation with the Mayor with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 expressing this concern . I believe moving forward that anyone that will possibly be sent up for advice and consent to the Council will be interim until full advice and consent is voted on by Council . MR. MCANDREW : Wait a second. So I could see interim if it's an employee like this one who is already working for City Hall. So that's when people take on interim positions when they're with an organization . But to hire someone as an interim and then send it down to us, I don't like that. I could see it with, you know, a lateral move or another move within in -- but when you call something interim , that means that you are covering for until another one -- or acting, you're covering until that position is filled. Do you know what I mean? MR. KING: Right. No, I get it. It still allows Council to vote no. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster MR. SCHUSTER : No.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-G legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : Eighth Order. 8-A. FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 62, 2023. MR. KING: This ordinance is the HUD 2023 Annual Action Plan. It's been tabled for 30 days to allow for public comment . MR. VOLDENBERG : 8-B. FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 64, 2023. MR. KING: This ordinance is creating overtime reporting requirement s for all city department employees . It's been tabled until we receive additional information from the administration . MR. VOLDENBERG : 8-C. RESOLUTION NO. 254, 2023. MR. KING: This resolution is the appointment of Koni Bennett to the City Planning Commission . It has been tabled until 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 we receive resident 's address . I believe that she has not responded to the city. So I believe that next week we're going to move this back into Sixth Order and vote on it. And more than likely it will be voted down since we're not getting a response or getting the information we're asking for. So that will happen next week. If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn . MR. KING: Meeting is adjourned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
