Eventhough council hadtheauthority to writetheirownbudget.Ithinkthisyear onceagainwe'regoingtodothesamething. But,youknow,thetroubling thingisthat over30years,wehavetoask,whatdidour staterepresentatives dotosanction the cityorpunish it?Whydidn'tMr.Blakeor1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Mr.FarinaorMr.Flynncomeforward anddo something tocitygovernment toforcethem tomakethecutsnecessary before itreached thepointnowwherewe'regoingtogivethe SewerAuthority awayforfreebasically and theparking garages awayforfree.Andthey wereassets ownedbytheresidents ofthis city.Now,youcanaskyourself ,whythe residents ofthecitydon'tcomehere?And IhavetosaythatIgenerally believe that theyfeartheirgovernment honestly and truthfully .Andthat'saterrible thing, youknow,whenyouconsider exactly what's taking placeinourcountry atthistime. It'sreally quitepathetic ,tobehonest withyou.And,youknow,foracouncil not torealize thatithadanoversight obligation inthebudget.Andthen,you know,tograntsummary relief tothe residents ofthiscity.Andfollow this thing,asyouknow,asitmovesalongand lookatthepoverty levels inthecity.And youknow,Mr.Evans,youbrought upthe property youbought.Well,theScranton Timesdidacouple ofarticles onthathouse1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 andhowpeople had--ifit'stheonethat's onPittston Avenue.Thepeople thatbought it,theywerepainting it,theywerefixing it,theyweregoingtodogreatthings with thatproperty .Youknow,thetruthofthe matter isthatthecityhasbeenso mismanaged oversuchalongperiod oftime. Andthere'snotone--notevenonecouncil man thatwillstandupandspeakthetruthto theresidents ofthiscity.Because even aftertheSewerAuthority isgoneandafter theparking garages aregone,thecitystill can'tfunditself.So,we'regoingtothrow awaythelastofourassets tothewind. Andleavethecitybeingnothing morethan, youknow,taxed,justbasically outof existence because itcan'tfunditsown operation .Ithasnoanswers toanyofthe problems .They'vesoldoff,youknow,the SouthSideSportsComplex,multiple other assets thecityhas.Andwhenitreaches thepointthat,youknow,thebondholders paythatSewerAuthority overalongperiod oftime.Andthen,wehavetheAmerican Anglian dealwhenMr.Connerswasinoffice.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Andwehadonecouncil afteranother who didn'tdoonething.Except Idohaveto say--andsomepeople maydisagree --Ithink JanetEvansdidagreatthingwhenshe forced theParking Authority tofinancially collapse .Butasfarasanything else,this budget,it'salmost laughable .Andyouknow something ?We'veblamed thewrongpeople. WeusedtoblameAdrian Barrett forthepoor people inthecityandwhatwashappening in thecity.Shewasjustsomebody working withthepoor.Youhavetobehonest with yourself andseeexactly what'staking place here.Andtheotherpeople weblamed,well, weblamed theScranton Timesfortheway theyreported .Butyouknowthetruthof thematter is,we'vegottoblamethepeople withthecheapsuitsandtheblouses . Because theyhaveanobligation toprotect ourstandard ofliving andourwayoflife. Andnow?Idon'tknow.Youjustseeall theshootings taking placeandsomepeople tryingtogettheirmindaround it.But, youknow,theonethingthattroubles mein mycountry isasayoungman,Igrewup1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 during theVietnam era.AndInever remembered Americans beingsoafraid asthey arenowofISISandallthethings thatare goingoninourcountry .Butyouknow something ?Whenyougotowarwith somebody ,youkillyourenemywherever you findthem.Andyouknow,thetruthofthe matter isthatwe'vebeensending cruise missiles intotheArabcountries foralong timecreating collateral damage.Andnowwe havepeople thatmaybetrying todothe samethingtousandwedon'tlikeit.So, but,inregards tothebudget,Ijusthope somebody goesintocourtandforces ajudge orsomebody todosomething .Because it's justincompetence rightfromthetoptothe bottom andyouwonder whypeople don'tvote.

Asageneral statement ,I'mopposed tothe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 addition ofarecycle coordinator atthirty sixplusthousand dollars plusthebenefits whenwehaveaconsultant whoIunderstand isdoingthatjobfor$5,000.So,Ithink thatposition needstobeeliminated .For thefirsttime,thisyear'sbudget provides theassessed valuations onwhichthe property taxesarebased.Itappears the collection rateof88percent wasexpected thisyear.Lastyear,about8percent of thetotalrealestate receipts werereceived inthelastquarter .Ifyouapplythatto thisyear'sactual listthrough September , wewillnotmeetthebudget forthereal estate taxesthisyear.Andthecollection ratewilldroptoabout87percent ormaybe evenless.Therefore ,Iseenoreason for usingan89percent collection ratefor2016 except perhaps tokeepthetaxincrease at 5.7percent instead of6percent .I'm willingtoplaceabetwithanybody onwhat thatturnsoutnextyearifyouapprove this budget.Itappears thewasted taxrevenue for2016continues toassume atacollection rateofabout75percent .Mr.Wechsler ,a1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 yearagotomorrow youstated thatthisyear in2015,"Weweregoingtogettheaudit doneontimeorextend theduedate,if reality meanswecan'tgetitdone."SoI'd liketoknowwhat--inFifthOrder,I'dlike toknowexactly whenwewillbeexpecting the2015auditnextyear.Andalso,went ontosay,"Wealready putthings intoplace tobemoreefficient incollecting our refuse tax,keeping trackofwhopaid,who didn'tpay.Sothere'salotofthings goingonthatmayputusinbetter shape." Ibelieve we'vebeenat75percent collection ratelikeforever .AndIdon't findthat75percent ratepalatable.Now, haveanyofyoureadtheGannett Flemming longrangeplanfortheSewerAuthority ? Okay,well,noplaceinthatdocument thatI couldfinddoesitmention needing outside management foranything .So,thatisa bother.Theotherthingthat'sabother, whichI'vetalked aboutbefore,istheMayor advertising thathewouldbehappywith50 percent or50million dollars ,excuseme, fortheSewerAuthority .Backin--thatwas1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 backattheendofSeptember ,Ibelieve ,the 26th.AsIstated before,it'salready been reported inthenewspaper thatthe--a financial report fortheSewerAuthority saystheyhave120million dollars worthof assets andtheyhave,Ibelieve ,69million dollars inlongtermdebt.Andthatis already covered inthefeestructure .So clearly ,50million dollars isasteal.And ifit'snot75million dollars togetusup tothe--uptothelevelofwhereour pensions arefunding at50percent ,that should bearealconcern .Idon'tthinkthe SewerAuthority should bemonetized.I don'tthinkwe'regoingtogetthevalueout ofit.Andlookdownthefuture.Whatdo wehave?Nextyear,we'llfinally repaythe threeyearsworthofthelandfill.Butnext yearisthelastfortheEITtaxtripling beforethecommuters goesawayin2017.The MMOwiththisbudget--thereduction forthe MMOexpires withthisbudget.Sowe're goingtohavetopayfullbudget orfullMMO nextyear.It'sgoingtobelarger.

Soaswelookateachoftheseadded positions andaswelookatthemaswemove to2016,Ithinkwearegoingtohavetosee wheretherewasasignificant improvement in services orsignificant improvement in increased revenues tothecity.Andaswe lookatthesegoinginto2017,I'dliketo saythatifwedon'tseethereturn on these,thenweactually should eliminate themthenexttimearound ortwoyearsfrom now.Also,whenquestions wereaskedabout thesepositions ,thebusiness administrator , thePersonnel Department supplied uswith1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 jobcriteria anddefinitions foreachof thesenewemployees .AndIthinkforme, that'sthefirstI'veeverseenthem detailed thewaythattheyare.And actually ,theyareprepared sowell,Ithink they'realmost readytogoouttobeposted somewhere sowecanincrease thepoolof qualified candidates forthesepositions . I'mnotsureifit'ssomething thatwedoon ourwebsite orifit'ssomething thatwe actually advertise inthelocalmedia. Theseposition saregoingtobevery important tothesuccess ofthecityin delivering services andincreasing revenue aswemoveinto2016.SoIthinkweshould takeadvantageofthehardworkthat'sbeen doneinorganizing thesepositions . MR.ROGAN:Thankyou,anyone else? MR.EVANS:Onthequestion .Onthe jobs,firstofall,wedidreceive the requested jobdescriptions yesterday .Ihad requested themonNovember 12th.Ithink Councilman Gaughan requested themaswell.
