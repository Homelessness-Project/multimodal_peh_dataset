MR. MCANDREW : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , also a moment of silence to include Mr. George Lowry and family. George was a graduate of West Scranton High School. Prior to his retirement he was the animal control officer for the city and before that the Director of Nay Aug Zoo. And I'd like to also keep continued prayers for the Scranton Firefighter Captain Roger Rogalewicz who had a cardiac episode last week while fighting a fire. I got news today that he's doing better. And he's supposed to come home today. So that's great news. Thank you. So before we start tonight 's meeting we're very excited and honored to recognize the first women of Lackawanna County. I'm sorry, let me do roll call first. Sorry, roll call. Formalities , sorry. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MR. SMURL: Here. MS.

Before tonight 's meeting we are very excited to honor and recognize the first women of Lackawanna County to hold elected offices and rightfully fitting during Women's History Month. A few weeks ago an involved an caring resident by the name of Debra Niehuus reached out to me with this wonderful idea. And myself being a girl dad of three beautiful strong women, I jumped at the idea. Debra and Kathy Carrera are very -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 I refer to her as our proclamation wizard went right to work researching and putting together this monumental task in such a short time. I'm so very proud of them and appreciate their great efforts for this evening 's recognition event. They deserve the credit and a big round applause . Is Debra here? Thank you. And I would also like to thank the illustration and design class under the direction of Patrick McLane and the print production class under the direction of Miss Renella of the CTC for creating this awesome banner that's over here. My culinary kids will make food for both classes as a thank you to them.

MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION EVALUATION REPORT REVIEWED MARCH 15, 2023. 3.B. CITY OF SCRANTON 2021 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECEIVED BY CITY COUNCIL ON MARCH 21, 2023 FROM KOHANSKI COMPANY , PC. MR. MCANDREW : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one or two quick ones. The first, there will be a Good Friday Fish Fry at the Shiloh Baptist Church on 1936 Wayne Avenue from 12 to 6 p.m. on April 7th. And it's dine in or takeout for $15. And there's a couple of numbers for a contact that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 I could provide if anyone is interested . And then secondly , I just wanted to give my condolences to the Lowry family on the passing of George Lowry. I know Council man McAndrew had announce d it previously . But I was very sorry to hear of his passing . And I know that he's done a great deal for the City of Scranton in the past and for the animals within our city. And we've just, you know, we've lost someone who was I think very important to the city. And lastly, I just wanted to mention that yesterday I had the opportunity to visit down at the DPW with our Director Scott Pietreface . And it's something I've done in the past with previous directors . And I was really glad to have the opportunity to meet with him. And we met for about two hours and drove around the city and discussed the changes that have been happening within DPW for the better and also, you know, what plans they have for the future. And I was just happy to be able to do that. And that's all I have. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Anybody else? I have one announcement . So for three days Friday, Saturday , Sunday, March 31st, April 1st and 2nd from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day, there's a spring and Easter plant sale fundraiser at the Greenhouse Project . Where is it? It's on 200 Arthur Avenue, Scranton , PA across from the Blackwatch Cafe. It's the first fundraiser of the year, offers beautiful flowers and plants for your spring and Easter celebrations . We specialize in providing healthy plants grown with love. Your purchases support the public programs offered by this community greenhouse where plants grow people. Be part of the goodness growing in our community and decorate your house with joy at the same time. And that is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I have here in my formally nicotine -stained fingers the 2021 audit which you received on the 21st. And it's dated March 17th. It is on the City's website , by the way. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 It is also the latest audit in at least the last 20 years. And I would like to know if the Mayor has made a decision on implementing the penalty clause? MR. MCANDREW : We're still waiting to hear as well as you are. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Will there be a public caucus to discuss the finding s? MR. MCANDREW : I'm sure we could have one. MS. HODOWANITZ : That would be nice. I would like to see both -- I would like to see management here, Kohanski and Rainey and Rainey who were hired specifically to do audit prep work. If you look at this, most of the financial statements would make people's eyes glaze over and go into a catatonic state. But there's an interesting paragraph on page four of the introduction and I'll read it: Management has omitted a management 's discussion and analysis that accounting principals generally accepted in the United States of America require to be presented to supplement the basic financial statements . Such missing information , although 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 not a part of the basic financial statement is required by the Governmental Accounting Standard s Board who considers it to be an essential part of the financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational economic or historical context . This is where you get away from the glazed over eyes and you talk turkey. This is where you say, hey, these are the issues we had in 2021, be it Covid or any other issue. And it should be on every audit every year. I hope when we have this caucus, you will ask management why they omitted this section . What's the status of the union negotiations , arbitration ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, what I've heard also is same as last week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, second verse same as the first. MR. MCANDREW : Right. And then arbitration starts April for -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. How about the DPW contract that was signed on September 13th? Is that ever going to be disclose d to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the public by putting it on the website ? MR. MCANDREW : Frank, what did we get on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : The administration is waiting for our labor attorney to forward that document back. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, it only takes six months. Must be hard legal work after they already signed it. How about the statement s of financial interest ? When are they going to hit the website ? MR. MCANDREW : He has an answer also for that. You received a -- MR. VOLDENBERG : The deadline is May 1st. And they will be on the website the next day. MS. HODOWANITZ : So it will be on the website May 2nd, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's when we'll submit them. MS. HODOWANITZ : That's when you'll submit them, when will they hit the website ? MR. VOLDENBERG : They say 24 to 48 hours. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, well, we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 shall see. That is something that will be a good letter to the editor because , you know, you're not suppose d to -- if you're a political candidate , you're not suppose d to take your oath of office without having submitted that before you become sworn in. If you get sworn in, you got an issue. And finally you all saw in the paper about the 2.26 million dollars that should have gone -- from real estate taxes that should have gone to the school district . And, in fact, last year it went to the City of Scranton , not the City's error, not their fault. The fault of apparently a coder from Harris local government. My point is, if we have to pay that money over to the school district , are we going to try to recoup it from Harris local government ? That's a whole lot of money to be pulled out of the budget. Are we going to sue them? MR. MCANDREW : I don't know about that. We had a brief discussion in caucus related to that. So we're still waiting to get information back from administration .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MS. HODOWANITZ : That should be in management 's discussion and analysis paragraph for the 2022 audit. And I will be looking for it. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next up Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I'd like to ask Council to get some information for me, please. I'd like to know how many times that Mr. King has missed meetings in the last year, either virtually or just not at all. I'd like a number for that next week, please. I don't think it's right. He's President of Council . He should be here. If he has a job, either take the job or take this job. Pardon me? Anyway, I want to discuss what Joan said. All you Council members and Mr. King said the Mayor didn't get back to them yet as far as the penalty . What does it take for one of you -- she was here tonight . Why didn't you ask her directly are you going to apply this penalty to the audit people or not? Get an answer. I mean, are you afraid of her? I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 understand . MR. MCANDREW : I'm not, no. MS. FRANUS: Well, nobody is doing anything . This is going on for months and months that Marie -- Joan has been asking this. And nobody is giving her an answer. Now, I'm here to talk about the DPW and the overtime. Last week Mr. King and Mr. Smurl said that they thought it should be recorded , every bit of overtime . Mr. McAndrew , Mr. Schuster , and Jessica , do you feel that the overtime at DPW should be recorded as to why they work overtime , Jessica ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. FRANUS: Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Absolutely . So that information we just received at 3:30. MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. MCANDREW : We received that information we've been asking for at 3:32 today. MS. FRANUS: What did you get? What information did you get? MR. MCANDREW : We got the overtime 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 and the explanation s. MS. FRANUS: You got the reasons ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, but I didn't get to take a look at it. It's for two years. But I'm just happy to report out -- MS. FRANUS: Two years. MR. MCANDREW : '22 and '23 was -- MS. FRANUS: Well, I got the 2022 and there was no reasons from January until, like, July. MR. MCANDREW : I didn't take a deep dive. MS. FRANUS: But I'm telling you it did. MR. MCANDREW : I got it on the way here. MS. FRANUS: And then one from July to, like, December were all, like, made up, calling people back. They can't do that -- they can't do that during the day? It has to get overtime for that? So anyway, Mr. Schuster , how do you feel? Do you think it should be recorded? MR. SCHUSTER : Absolutely . MS. FRANUS: Okay. Then when are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 you people going to do something about it because if I find out that they're not recording , then you guys should pass legislation to make sure that they do because this can't be -- we taxpayers are paying for this. And Mr. Pietreface the Director now, he's the biggest abuser of overtime anyway. Last year he made $47,000, made $29,000 in overtime . Now he doesn't need to because he gets 75,000. So suppose there was an accident when they're out working overtime and they hit a car and maybe a women got hurt and she sues them. And she says what were they doing out at this hour? And they don't have any records , there's a good lawsuit. There's enough reason right there for records to be recorded . And the reason you don't want them recorded is because they don't really have a reason because they just say they work overtime when they really didn't. They don't want anything recorded because they are getting all of this money, every one of them, all the workers and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 supervisors , they're all getting money that we're paying for, thousands and thousands . Look at Scott. He got 29,000 himself . So some people made 16,000 and all the workers made a lot. So add it up. Add it up. So now about Rubicon , I asked you are you going to have them come in, the director and supervisor to come in and talk about Rubicon . Did you approach them with this? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, and they are waiting for a date. MS. FRANUS: I can't hear you. MR. SCHUSTER : They will be coming in. They did not -- they don't have any savings for this year. MS. FRANUS: You know why they don't have savings because they don't want to use it because they don't want to track the workers . They don't -- the union workers . And you, Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew , will never fight them because you need their votes. They don't want Rubicon . They don't want to initiate it. They don't want to use it. It's not Rubicon 's fault. It's the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 supervisor and the director 's fault for not implementing it. Chris Smith tells me they have it. Well, if they were to call up -- if they were to call up the truck driver and say where are you, they'd know where he was. Where are the two guys in the back of the truck? I don't know where they are. They're home. That's why you can't get them. MR. SCHUSTER : So they said they haven't instituted the routes yet. But the routes should be done by the first or second week of April -- MS. FRANUS: Well, let me -- I want to know when and if they could track every worker in DPW. I want you -- I want you to bring them in here, the director and the supervisors . They need to come in and answer questions . The public needs to know from them, not just you saying they have this and they have that. No, no, we need them. We need answers for every reason they're not using this. I know what it's like because I worked for the water company . And they knew where I was every second of the day. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 The one guy was off his route. He's gone. Twice they caught him off his route. He's fired. You work for eight hours and we pay you for eight hours. That's what -- hey, if we could get followed at the water company , they can get followed at DPW. That's what Rubicon is for. But they're not using it because they don't want to. The union guys are running the show down there. They're sabotaging Rubicon . You think the supervisor and the director are going to follow them? Are you kidding ? There'd be like a war down there. They're running the show, the union workers . And it has to stop because we're paying for it. Thank you. And get them in here as soon as possible . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Fay. Next up, Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you. Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I do have to start off tonight by giving everyone a big thank you. I come to this podium -- anything I say here it's not just for me. It's for the city and the residents of Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Anything that I've said about the stop signs or any conditions in Scranton , it's for me and the city residents . I love Scranton . Do I love it when I hit pothole s and things, no. We all have certain things that we would like to see improved. But Scranton is a great place. And I'm enjoying my years that I'm back here in Scranton . So I thank everyone for their telephone calls that I got, the e-mails that I got. I even got mail, you know, congratulating cards in the mail. So I do thank everyone that took the time to, first of all, nominate me for that section in the Scranton Times. So they did a great job and I just thought it was great. You know, I just finally read the whole thing yesterday because I was just blown away by it. So I give my thanks to everyone . The second thing I just passed out was a flyer that on Good Friday there's going to be a fish fry at Shiloh Baptist Church, 1936 Wayne Avenue from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. The menu includes fish, potato salad, stewed tomatoes , green beans and a dinner roll. Tickets can be purchased -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 they have some names down there. But anyone that knows me can contact me, send me a message or something and I will be glad to meet you somewhere to get the tickets to you, okay? This is my sister's church. And like all churches , you know, they do -- you know, they're suffering . So I do all I can to help wherever I can. So that's what I passed out to everyone if anyone could just reach out to me that would be great. The next thing that I wanted to talk about was visitors to our city. And I just kept -- couldn't help but think that when company is coming to our home we try to make our homes as best as we can when we have company . We look around and we think if something needs to be painted , the grass needs to be cut, if the bushes need to be cut. You know, we want to make our appearance as they approach our homes to be as nice as possible . So I think everyone shares that feeling that when you have company coming that you want it to be the best that you can. So we have a lot going on in August. And even in June we're having an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Electric City Flower show. It's going to be in June. And I'm sure there's other things going on. And I know in August there's a jazz festival . And I did read in the paper that there's going to be a conference that the Mayor is hosting . And it's going to be at the Radison . It's going to be based at the Radison . And they're going to be talking about different things of how they could make our cities better and things like that. I think that's what I got out of the article that I was reading . But I think it's going to be at the Radison. When I spoke about this before and I think I was told that it was $950,000 to repair that wall on Lackawanna Avenue. How many of us drive by that, you go up Lackawanna Avenue, turn there and to our right is that decaying wall. If that was your home, you would be making sure that that was fixed. You would not want your company to come to your home and the front of your wall in your home was falling down. And it looks like to me that it's getting worse and it probably because of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 rain and the weather is probably really taking its toll. The last time I spoke about it I said that there was a grant or something but it wasn't enough. So I'd just like to know what the status is. Are we just going to wait until it falls down completely ? And there is a bus stop there. And it's very liable if someone should be standing there and get hit by that wall that's decaying . And like I said, we have a lot of things coming into the city. So I just would like that. And another thing, I have seven seconds . It was great on honoring all the women tonight . But it was just disappointing that it took us all of these years in Scranton to get a female mayor. I couldn't help but hear all these names they're calling in Clarks Green, Clarks Summit, all around us and there was women mayors. So I want to thank the Mayor again for running for office and being successful . And I also just noticed that we need diversity . We need diversity in our city and our government . And I stand here and I say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 that. People say, well, you do it, Norma. If I was 20 years younger I probably would. But right now I just want to get behind those that I know are standing for diversity so that we could make Scranton really all inclusive of everyone in the city. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Norma. Next up, Mr. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . You know, it's such a tragedy to see the shooting that took place. They're making the shooter look like he's a victim, not a she, a he. He was an assassin . And he murdered three children , took their lives away, three adults and he murdered them. And they want to make him basically a hero, put his picture in the paper, question that he's a transgender and all of this nonsense . That's the issue that's going on, medications , different things that are screwing people up. But this individual who he is went and murdered these people. The real victims are those three children , the three adults and the families that this animal destroyed their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 lives. And the news media is making him out to be something different . There is no sympathy for him in any way, shape or form no matter what they want to call him, a he, a she or whatever . It was an assassin , a male that killed these people. And that's what's happening in this country . We're taking credit for all the wrong people and giving them stuff that they don't deserve . You know, one of the things we're talking about Geisinger and everybody is arguing . You're familiar with Nay Aug which I raised many issues about the parking up there on Nay Aug for Geisinger . Why don't we sell that piece of land to Geisinger to build a parking garage for 8 or 10 million dollars ? We're letting them park cars there for peanuts . Yet, you pay $2 an hour in front of the hospital . So to get rid of the controversy here, sell that whole piece of land that they're parking cars on right now. Instead , get rid of the authority up there. Put it back in the hands of the city because it's incompetent what they're doing. I'm sorry somebody didn't want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 hear it. But that's the way it was because I had brought an action there a long time ago to straighten the mess out. I delivered a trailer load of disinfectant wipes to Palestine , Ohio. It was donated on behalf of myself and President Trump. We gave it to them. But a Scranton boy went to Palestine , Ohio, which I went down to deliver the load. Yet the President came from Scranton and never bothered to go see these people. And that's the tragedy of what we're doing. We're giving honor to this individual . We name streets. And, yes, I have an action against Bill Gaughan which was dismissed only due to a technicality . It's being refiled because he's going to be held account able for violating the Rules of Council and what's done to the people in this city and took their voice away and not allowing them to speak out and they did speak out and he shut the door on them. You got signs out here, all gender on the bathrooms . How many genders are there? I thought there was only a male and a female in this world. You could tell me there's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 different gender out there, I'd really like to know what the hell it is or let's get back to where we belong a male and a female and put the pictures on the door like we're supposed to. Enough of this stupid nonsense and all of this other crap going on. Jessica , you and I have gone around and around. I could see today that you never identified your profession . I understand you could be called doctor. I deal with physical therapists . I go to them both here and in Florida . I have tremendous respect for them and you and your profession . However , I can't stand by because I have medical people in my family and see you call yourself a doctor but not say what type of a doctor you are. So I went and filed a complaint with the Department of State and the Board of Physical Therapy to find out whether or not as a public official you should be addressing your profession . And it's a profession you should be damn well proud of and I don't understand why you won't put it there because how many people around here have gone to a physical therapist 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 and came out real well and better. All doctors sign prescription s and they do that. I would still ask you to do it. I'm sorry I had to do this. But I can't rest and see something that isn't properly done and a misconception to people who watch what we're doing here thinking you're a doctor or an M.D., or somebody else even though you have the right to call yourself doctor. And I'm not objecting to that. I just wish you went and did it. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Next up is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is I just think that the shooting was a tragedy . And I hope that the police could have and acted sooner and saved the children . And I hope that the shooter whatever her circumstances , could have received some kind of counseling and just avoided the whole situation . But I guess we don't live in a perfect world but we're having discussions about weapons when we really need to have discussions about what's really broke in our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 country . And it's our government . And it's been broke for a very long time. As a matter of fact, the people that broke it were part of my generation , the baby boomers have actually taken this country to its knees. They've enacted laws and did things because they were the largest voting block in the country and used those numbers to do very, very bad things to this country . And, you know, you could talk about just a host of different issues, but, you know, to bring some of it back into focus today we talk about grants and money. And last week we were talking about playgrounds . I find the way grant money is passed around has come through my generation . It's done great harm to the country . And it just continues because when you look at playgrounds , 50 percent of women don't have any children at all. The largest generation in the history of our country is being replaced by the generation Xers which are the smallest generation . How many children do you think in the city will use a playground ? You know where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that need that grant money, they need it injected into the Scranton School District . We're the laughingstock for the world and we keep doing silly things as the baby boomers lead the political scene. The President of the United States is just an illustration of that. The politicians have learned to talk to the largest voting block which is women and convince them of the craziest things. And they've done very harmful things to themselves . They're talking about it around the world. Mental health professionals are talking about it. First they took men's clubs apart, dismantled all those things and had the men walk away from the polls. And now they're destroying women's sports and creating a gender that never existed. You know, you have to respect people whether they're homosexual or straight , whatever identity they want to have it's fine. But you can't create whole new genders . You should never force a women to compete against a biological man, ever. And we're the laughingstock of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 world and they play videos of it on YouTube . And it doesn't turn out well. And we're lying to a whole generation . And when you go to like Tunkhannock or Troy or other school districts , they've got children using liter boxes as bathrooms. This is what this president has brought this country to, okay? This is the baby boomers in control . You take a look at this Council . There is not one word about what's happened to ECTV, not one, not one. Not one word allowing the resident s of the city to put the Home Rule Charter on the ballot, not one. But we speak about abstract thoughts , creating authorities which were a follow for money. Project s that have no merit which is a follow for money. We're talking about patronage and transfer of wealth and money. But we don't talk about empowering citizens , putting grant money in the hands of people who own homes in this -- properties and homes in this city so that we could try to help them, okay? What we're doing is we're protecting our power base. And what we're doing to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 country is just terrible . We're getting ready to face our greatest enemy soon which is China. And we've increase d social spending . And we've cut military spending . And the next war, you won't have the time that you had during the second world war to change your position because the world will be over in about two weeks, maybe a couple of days. Think about it. Get rid of the political parties . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. I'm going to try to pronoun ce this. I'm not sure. Is there a Charlie Cortes here? MR. CORTES: Good evening members of Council , Charles Cortes. Myself and my family are multiple property owners of the 200 block of Wheeler Avenue. I'm here again tonight to request that you Council members support the zoning that would restrict the height of the propose d parking garage to 45 feet on the odd side of the 200 block of Colfax Avenue and restrict the traffic exiting from the parking garage to Sherwood Court. Why give Geisinger an approved zoning ordinance of 100 foot high structure at this time for them to do as they wish now or at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 anytime in the future? Any reputable engineering firm can design a building -- 45 foot structure with future expansion with a new design without destroying the existing structure . Why not let Geisinger request a variance in the future and as their expansion warrants ? After all, we are not prognosticators . We cannot foretell the future. I'm sure that the zoning board had good intention s when they carved Colfax Avenue into two separate and unique areas with the distinct permit usage. Splitting a city block down the center is like putting up a spike fence between you and your neighbors . I still cannot fathom what value there is to split a city block down the center except to give maximum advantage to Geisinger and to pit all concerned against each other and destroy the Nay Aug area community . The Mayor stated at the Scranton City Council caucus meeting on the 21st of March that if Geisinger does not meet their expansion plans they will expand elsewhere. Is the hierarchy of Geisinger that shallow that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 they will abandon their expansion plan because they can't get the 100 foot high parking garage? The Mayor also stated that of every compromise , someone will get the short end of the stick. I assume that she meant that someone will suffer the consequences of the zoning board's decision . Mayor, you are correct . We, the citizen s of Wheeler and Colfax Avenue got the short end of the stick. This is not a compromise . This is pandering to Geisinger to give them the advantage to meet their aggressive narrative . The stick should be divided equal for all concerned getting equal measure . The past and future speakers who have and will address Council and sided mostly with Geisinger know that will not have a hundred foot wall in their front or back yards. It is also understand able that employees of Geisinger whatever their capacity or position is will champion the cause of Geisinger when they speak to Council . They imply that the Nay Aug area 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 community is against hospital expansion . Ultimately it is in their best interest not to bite the hand that feeds them. I state emphatically that we are not against expansion but at what cost to the resident s of Colfax and Wheeler Avenue. Nay Aug residents had mentioned that Nay Aug Park is like a little bit of paradise within the city. There's beautiful homes that surround and complement the park with the steeple and stain glass windows which have now become (inaudible ) for the sake of a 100 foot high parking garage. The sign out the bottom of Mulberry Street near the University of Scranton reads historical hill section . Perhaps another sign next to it should be read. The (inaudible ) ruins of the historical Nay Aug section . The 200 block of Wheeler Avenue will be on a fast track blighted section of Scranton city and the Nay Aug community with a Geisinger entity in their backyard with its 100 foot walls with its distinct and existence and void of any attractive feature that blocks the sun and summer breezes for the sake of parking .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 For it's Council 's vision and commitment to Scranton to ensure the coexistence of harmony of all concerned to make Scranton a great city and a model of negotiation and compromise . Again, we are open for compromise for it is the American way to resolve our differences . I'm also sure that many of you remember a particular sign which is appropriate to this parking garage dilemma . Part of the lyrics read, that you don't know what you've got until it's gone. They paved paradise and put up a parking lot. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Cortese . Mr. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, hello, Council . People -- of all the asinine , ridiculous , rash statements and I made plenty of them, the Mayor's preposterous absurdity if we don't cave into Geisinger 's demands they might move. Right now the city has them over a barrel. They should have to pay every single taxable property on all those houses and tie it up with a class action suit and do something for the people of this city for once instead of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 worrying about all of these people. Who knows how many pieces of property that just disappear ed forever under this phony Pure Charity Act. Scranton University is taken over 150 properties . And look what Lackawanna College has done downtown . This isn't a college town. You know, this is a town that has lost a third of its property . If this -- anybody could see the writing on the wall when somebody is buying property after property after property . Nobody did a thing to stop them to comment on it. Now they have devalued one of the state's most beautiful areas. It's never going to be the same. These people are going to end up just like me. They'll be paying insurance what their property was worth five years ago and it's going to be a fraction of it. I pay over $1,000 extra on my insurance when my house was valued at 100 and some thousand . Last year they told me it's worth 75. They raised it. I think they raised it 44 then 27 or something . This is going to happen to all of you people at Nay Aug. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 They have to get it. Your houses won't be worth what your insurance is. You know what's going on here to the people that are paying for everything ? This is a dirty rotten shame. They -- we need a voice. The people need a voice. And there doesn't seem to be one. I keep talking about how bad my neighborhood has gotten. These people don't care. You know that Oleski doesn't care. The whole city, every street you go down it's not like it was a few years ago. Four houses from me somebody stole their car last week at night. Yesterday a boy on a bicycle went up my driveway to see what was in my garage. You know, that's what happened in my neighborhood . That's what's going to happen to the neighborhood around Nay Aug if you don't stop this insanity letting these people 10, 20 years from now you're going to have to go through it all over again. They're never going to be happy. What's happening you are going to appease these people and appease ment never ends. You'll be doing it forever , I guess. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 It's a dirty rotten shame, you know. I talk to two, three, four people at the grocery store or the gas station s and people are hypocrites . They tell me all of these things. But openly they won't say them. You can't imagine how many people said something when I complained about the Congolese kids in school, $10,000 a piece for six kids. Now they -- people on food stamps, they're sending their kids to school. We have to feed them. It's -- people say these things but they don't want to get up here. They don't want to be quoted. Like I said, it's just a hypocritical mess, I guess. You see my neighborhood . It's bad, isn't it, compared to how it was a few years ago when Jack Liptai took care it. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Council , first, I object to 5-E on the docket tonight . I would rather pay $50,000 to an independent counsel who is responsible both to the Mayor and Council equally than allow the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Mayor an even more concentrated control since the solicitor for the city is already burdened with a 40-plus hour work week. It is unfair and poor labor standards to impact and increase her load. We already have two oversight contractors . This third appointment is an abuse of the taxpayer . At last session I was mad at the end of the Council session . I was not sure why but for a day I could not get it out of my head and I let it roll about in my brain. A lot of issues bothered me. Let's consider neutrality and special interest s. When the Mayor asked Geisinger for talking points to use when citizens were protesting about the parking garage. We have a Mayor who when confronted by her citizens reached out to an entity to request PR to combat the public opinion . The Mayor chooses to defend a private entity over the public who appointed her. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, Mr. Coyne, are these e-mails? MR. COYNE: Yes, they are.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MR. COYNE: We have a Mayor's office who lied in the Recovery Act's initial announcement . They quoted that they received valuable input from community members through one on one interview s and small group sessions held with more than 45 stakeholder s. But in investigating , that there was no meeting . There were no internal communications . Everything was done in private . It was a pet project and the spending was planned before the community was ever presented a facade of choice. We have been told that Nay Aug can't use funds because it's not an approved tract for funding as it is not impacted. No backup information asked to validate this opinion or any documents on this supposed new final directives . The final ruling government services were not bound and impacted by tract regulations . They were bound only by showing impact to groups. In tossing softballs , what Council failed to ask in the questioning of the park using fund was, if the funds can only be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 used in impacted tracts and disadvantage tracts, how is the city using over $300,000 on electric cars? What qualified tract are the electric cars justified at? It seems like a double standard . And last, I asked Mr. King -- is Mr. King present on the phone? MR. MCANDREW : I don't think he ever connected . Sorry. MR. COYNE: Okay. Last, I asked Mr. King at this Council session to provide information on a special session for more information after the session ended. He had said that there was a special session that related to both personal matters and litigation . I asked him to confer with Council for the -- for this body because according to Reading Eagle Company versus Council decided by the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania on June 24th, 1993, the reason must be meaningful . It must be more than some generalized term which means in reality tells the public nothing . To simply say personal ized matter or litigation tells the public nothing . My 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 question is, since we are required to have more information particularly what they give is when you call up on litigation , you need to present the case -- the case number. When you call upon personal matters , you need to disclose whether or not it's because of employee malpractice -- an incident of crime, whether it's for raises or specific criteria that need to be divulged . Just saying generalized reasons fall afoul with law. And unfortunately he's not here because I was going to ask the Chair now that he's been provide d with a court case, is he willing to comply with the regulation s of the law or is he going to willfully violate it? Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. RINALDI : Good evening , Council , Dave Rinaldi , Colfax Avenue in Scranton . First thing I would like to make a remark. I've been here the last couple meetings . And I've really not heard speakers with such hate in their heart that they have tonight . I want to apologize for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 community . No one deserves that. All right. So I have two things I wanted to talk to you about tonight . One, if you remember a week ago one of my neighbors came up to this podium and asked and begged Council to have Geisinger buy her house and the house next to her. I want to remind Council that at the time that Geisinger was running around buying properties , they had not released any plans. So these are people who wanted to stay in the neighborhood and felt that whatever the plans were, they would not impact their life in that section in the Nay Aug Park section . Now, when the plans finally came out, of course, just lately after 1/6/23 when the map changed the last time, that made these people that were my neighbor s anyway think about, well, what's it going to be like with a 100 foot structure in front of their house. Let's take Geisinger 's figures approximately 400,000 for a house on the even side of the 200 of Colfax. 100 foot garage goes up, maybe the house is worth -- maybe if you can rent it. I'm not sure that the zoning will allow for it. Maybe it's worth 100, 125. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Who is going to make up that difference ? Who is going to make up the difference to these people who put their whole lives in it? And if, in fact, that zoning goes through , then it's not going to Geisinger . It may be the city that has to make the people whole for what the zoning has done to their properties . So I want you to keep that in mind who is going to pay? Is it going to be Geisinger as a cost of doing business or will it be the city sometime later? All right. The second I wanted to talk to you about was a couple weeks ago I brought up the fact that Geisinger put all of these restrictions on the properties , the 20 properties that they bought in that area that would be Roselynn , Colfax and Wheeler . Well, actually none of them were on Wheeler. They are all on Roselynn and Colfax. Anyway, I did some calculation . And first of all, all the improvements were gone. I went to the assessor's office for the records, by the way. And it turns out that just in the reduction in the assessments by getting rid of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the improvements , the city lost a little over 25,000 a year. The school district lost 15,300 a year. Now that would be bad enough if, in fact, they were going to pay taxes. But what I discovered was, you know, they appealed all of these assessment s. And do you know in 2023 all of those properties are exempt? The city is not even getting tax revenue for 2023 for properties that aren't being used for hospital purposes . Now, I don't know what the administration did. I don't know whether they send someone over there. I know the school district does at these zoning -- at these assessment board hearings . But someone has to be paying attention . They should not be getting out of their tax bill until they actually develop the properties . So that's what you are losing now. And this is just part of it. I don't -- I haven't done the calculation s over on the 400 block or any other block. But certainly the city is losing a significant amount of money. And if you want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 some leverage, if the zoning wasn't changed they'd be paying -- assuming that it went back on the rolls like it should be, 50,000 a year forever . So thank you. That's all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Rinaldi . MS. KOLOSKI : Hi, Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . Hopefully I could remember what I came up here to say because I was not coming up here to say anything until I heard other speakers . First of all, I want to say about Mr. Bolus, whatever he said I hope nobody takes to heart. He -- the shooter didn't shoot people because he was transgender or she was transgender. It was because they were mentally unbalanced . But more importantly it was because of the access to all of these weapons . I am a carry permit gun owner. So I'm not antigun or completely gun control . But we do need to have bans on ARs. We don't need to have assault weapons . We don't need to have silencers . We don't need to have large magazine rounds. All of these things would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 sensible gun laws. We need to do background checks on people and get them into mental health. We need red flag laws. And right now in Harrisburg there are bills pending for secure storage , background checks, etc., banning assault weapons and they're laying there waiting to be voted on. So I urge everybody to contact their people and to please have -- see if you could get people to vote for sensible gun laws. This killing , it's just too much. If I had children today I don't know what I would do. I really don't. I mean, it's awful. Okay, that was that. Now Geisinger again. Everybody is laughing . Here I go with Geisinger . No, I just wanted to say that this whole idea of them threatening the city that they will pull out, are they a mafia? I mean, what is going on here? Does anybody feel they want to be held hostage ? If that's what they get, then what else are they going to do when they really own the whole city? They're really going to hold people more hostage . I mean, we have other hospitals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 here. We don't -- they want to drive them out because they want to be the one and only hospital and take away your choice. So just keep that in mind about not having choice. Think how nice is was when Bell Telephone got broke up and you had choices . People want choices . You want all the hospitals . You want Lehigh Valley. You want Mercy. You want Moses. And you want Geisinger . And we're not against an expansion . But just threatening people and to threaten the city and the city backing down to them, what's next when they have everything they want? Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Doris. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I'm really disappointed that Mr. King isn't here. He never said a word about not being here this week when he -- when I asked for him to come today prepared with something for what we're going to do about all of these nonprofits that are not paying taxes. And so it is disappointing . Now, are you people even aware that in the City of Scranton there are 1,605 parcels 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 that are not -- are exempt from paying taxes? And supposedly according to what the people in Harrisburg did when they did that, they expected that those people would bring something to the table and they call it a pilot, which isn't -- have anything to do with a plane. But it is the acronym for payment in lieu of taxes. Now, out of those 1,605 properties , there are a grand total of nine -- nine that are giving something . And I think it's time that you people get together and come up with something . I mean, at least letters , I don't know. I would put you two by two and visit them personally . It just doesn't -- is not right. You know, I am going to be down tomorrow and pay my property tax. And it doesn't make me feel very good that all of these people are not contributing to the city. Now, I'll move off that because it doesn't make me feel good. The Sunday paper noted that there were two burglars who had -- burglary suspects that faced numerous charges including violating the Officer John Wilding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 Law. Now, I don't know how many of you remember John Wilding who was a -- who back in 2015 went to chase somebody and went over a -- thought he was going over a wall and it was a stair wall -- stairwell. And he fell and he died. And just this law that the state did, somebody -- interestingly enough it was somebody from Luzerne County that got up the statute for this law. Now, but this law is chasing somebody . The body of which you are a part now back in the same time, oh, everybody was upset. And they were going to do something . They were going to put something in that if you had a wall and there wasn't ground on the other side that you would have to put a railing . Now, I've gone through the codes. And I have not found that legislation . So here we are how many years later? And I don't believe it's there. If I'm mistaken , you know, I will say it. But I don't believe there is one there. And I think there should be. And it just bothers me when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 you people go off to do good things and then they don't get done. And then the abutment that my young friend talked about, I have noticed that myself when I come down Jefferson Avenue the thing that's abutted to the divider and it goes down and Tom talked about it too. He thought something should be done. If I probably wouldn't get -- I mean, I would be happy to go buy a pail of yellow water or yellow paint and go down and paint it but I would probably get arrested for doing something with private property -- public property . So please, start looking at those. I'm serious . We need something to offset the no taxes. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Voldenberg , could you please circle around? I do remember some conversation about stairwells without railing s because of this Officer Wilding Law. So could we see where we're at with that? If not, we need some legislation , okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , Scranton . I noticed something about the speakers last week and thinking about it. If you go to hear a band, which way are the speakers pointed , towards you. And everybody back here -- now it hasn't been that bad tonight after the hall emptied out. But in reality , our speakers are pointed the wrong way and they have been for years. So I don't think we need any new equipment other than what we have, maybe bring it down and maybe put it here or over there. MR. MCANDREW : We are actually getting a new speaker . We tested one. There was one tested a couple weeks ago that everybody pretty much agreed that it was better. MR. DOBRZYN : Yeah, the way those are oriented , you people hear it better than anybody down in the audience . So let's move on it a little bit. I have a few things here. Mining under Nay Aug, now I misplaced the article . But it's something to consider before any major heavy project s go in there. And it might even be -- there might 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 even be information available at the Bureau of Mines like maps and so forth where these people were caught illegally mining under Nay Aug. It was possibly well over a hundred years ago, possibly a few years after the civil war. But it was -- they were caught under Nay Aug taking coal out. And okay, Saturday , and I don't know where that article -- I'll have to get down to see the archivist at the Times and pay them whatever fee he wants. But there was an article on tax exempt. The last figures were available in 2019. In Lackawanna County 18 percent of the property is tax exempt. And two thirds of it, 12 percent of that property resides in Scranton , Pennsylvania . So in other words, if you consider the population of Lackawanna County as opposed to us, we're about a third. We're paying double on tax exempt properties . And I won't call them the non-profits . It doesn't matter what they are doing. It's that they are producing services for whole county and possibly other major portions of the state because when some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 these hospitals can't stay afloat they close. And then the people are here. They are coming here. So why they close, gee, I don't know. But in some states that didn't accept the Affordable Care Act, they are closing at an astronomical rate. You could have to deliver a baby, drive across three or four counties . You might have an hour drive to get your wife to the hospital . And it's -- we're actually paying 100 percent more on tax exempt properties . So I'm not picking on anybody but something has to change. And I think the state should be brought to task that they should replace the money after a certain point. It would be nice to have half of our tax exempt property tax replaced by the State of Pennsylvania . And then everybody can pay instead of a handful of people. And the hospital , I had a brainstorm out. It would be interesting to find out what their financial situation is. They claim they lost 800,000 million dollars . And I'm not going to call them liars. But I strongly suspect that if they showed up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 and did a reasonable analysis , it might be because of Covid. A lot of people showing up in bad shape, there forever , and unfortunately they can't pay the bill from up there if it exists. Thank you and have a good night. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Okay, anybody else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. The first things is, on Saturday I was on Interstate 81 up by the O'Neill Highway exit. And I saw PennDOT up there with multiple street sweepers and a lot of equipment up there cleaning . So I assume they started their spring cleaning . So I drove down the Biden Expressway and I took pictures on my way down to Cedar Avenue, also over to Jefferson Avenue. And then I did the exit ramps going up to where the -- ramps going to 81 south and 81 north. I also took picture s from there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I forwarded picture s to you today of all of the spots where all the liter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 lines the both sides of the ramps. So would you contact PennDOT and ask them if they are doing spring cleanup if they would look at this area? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And the second thing I have, the request I made a few weeks ago I was speaking with Chief Carroll about commercial tractors parked in the city, cars parked over sidewalks , blocking sidewalk s where people have to go into the street. It seems it's all over the city. So I spoke to Chief Carroll about the ordinance . And he suggested we send a request to the Law Department and get an opinion on what, if anything , we could change in that ordinance so that we were able to tag these vehicles or have them removed , especially the commercial vehicles in residential areas. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would forward that to the Law Department . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And my last thing is, we are going to start -- I said when I was appointed to Council that one of my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 things besides Nay Aug Park's pool was to start cleaning up the blight in the city. So I am going to -- actually started to reform the group of volunteers we had at Nay Aug Park. And we're going to go into the city and begin cleanup in about two weeks. I have -- Eileen Cipriani was kind enough to give me all the properties that -- from the land bank and other properties that the city owns that are overgrown. And so we're going to go back out and start doing those properties . I will let anyone know when and where we're going to be so if anyone else wants to volunteer and come and meet us and help, you'll be welcome . And that is all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, two comments that I have. So one, Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the Business Administrator and possibly Matt Domines ' and see -- we did see that there was a 2.6 million dollar accounting error that occurred where money is going to be returned to the school district . Can you each out to them to get an update on how this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 affects our 2023 budget? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Secondly , we've discuss ed a while back and I know the Mayor even discuss ed it about getting a HUP test done for our nonprofit s. Can we also look at -- send correspondence to the BA's office about what is the status of that test? MR. VOLDENBERG : I confirmed today that they're working on it. But I'll get a more definite status. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. If we could possibly get a timeline of where they're at. Thank you. That's all, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. First, I just want to add some information . Miss Schumacher had asked about the pilots and if we could send letters . And I did want to let her know that the city has sent letters to exempt properties and nonprofit organizations requesting pilot money in the past. And they've done that this year and still has only gotten the nine pilots. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 obviously we need to do something different or additionally to get more pilots, which I'm fully support of and happy to look into and see what avenues we could take to encourage those organizations or property owners to donate or provide pilot money to the city. I do think that would be very important and helpful for the city and that we should be asking that even if just the letter hasn't -- hasn't done the trick. Maybe in other ways to like you said -- maybe the larger organizations that we know about meeting with them. I'm not sure that that would take -- if that would come from Council or the administration . But I'd like to make sure that that's being done as well. And secondly , I want to say that I'm really proud that we could honor so many women here tonight in chambers , women from across Lackawanna County who were the first to serve as elected officials in their townships and in the cities. And I know that these women helped pave the way for myself to be here on Council . So I'm really appreciative for those women 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 being the first. It's always incredibly important for there to be firsts because they are able to break those barriers and to make it easier for others to come afterwards . But the joy I felt from that was quickly extinguish ed by some of the public comment s that we received tonight that were in reference to people's genders . And we just finished recognizing these trailblazing women and then there are people who are wanting to condemn the transgender community . And I've said it before and I'll say it again. I just can't sit here in silence and not say anything about it. And I think it's really sad that some people their focus and their energy so much is on just spewing hate against communities that are not their own or communities that they don't understand or want to try to understand . It's just -- it's sad to me. I feel bad for people that feel the need to do that because you clearly don't have -- you're not spending time on other things that I think would be more useful. And so there are many I think misinformed and disdainful points that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 I'm not going to bring up. But I think the worst implication was that the national shooter committed those tragic acts because she was transgender . And I didn't even know that up until this point. But it doesn't matter because what she did was, like I said, horrendous and shouldn 't be happening and they are happening all too often within our country . And I think it's just meant to be hurtful to people within the transgender community . But then it's also very disrespectful to the parents and the families that lost those children and the teachers . And it's obviously emotional for me as a parent too. So there's just so much more to the issue of gun violence and mass shooting s than just mental health. And so I know that it won't be the last time that there are comment s like that within Council Chambers even though I certainly hope that it will be. But just know I'm still here and I'm happy to speak out in support of the LGBTQ community . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I don't have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 any motions or comment s at this time, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. King is on. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry. Mr. King, do you have any motions or comment s? MR. KING: I know that Marie Schumacher mention ed something about pilots. And I just want to tell her that I did meet with the Mayor this past week. And Matt Domines ' is working on that HUP test that was mentioned just earlier . And, you know, we're planning to go through that list and try to go out and identify certain nonprofit s that we could approach even personally to talk about trying to get them to start contributing a little bit. You know, even though they're nonprofit s, we would like to see some payment s in lieu of taxes paid and contribute d to our city. So we are continuing to work on that. That's all I have at this time. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING A “NO PARKING ” ZONE ALONG THE EASTERLY SIDE OF 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 THE 1700 AND 1800 BLOCKS OF BLOOM AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA TO ALLOW FOR ACCESS OF LARGE VEHICLES TO TRAVERSE THE ROADWAY . MR. MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I've been mentioning this for a little while now. We had a study completed by engineering on these streets because of a resident complaint that they were too narrow for DPW vehicles to fit through in order to pick up refuse. And so because of that, the study came back and said that it would be more appropriate for parking to occur on just one side of the street instead of both. So that's why we see this ordinance here tonight . MR. MCANDREW : All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – ADDING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF “AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) SOLICITOR ” TO THE CITY SOLICITOR , JESSICA ESKRA, ESQUIRE ’S PORTFOLIO AND ALLOCATING ARPA ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS ACCORDINGLY PURSUANT TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S ARPA SPENDING PLAN (RESOLUTION 69 OF 2022). MR. MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll be voting no for this tonight . I did have similar concerns when it came to Miss Cipriani and taking on other duties. The Law Department this year in the 2023 budget was shifted around. We do have seven lawyers in the department now from eight from the previous year. We've added a new lawyer for $77,000 a year and we've given raises across that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 department . So I'm not really in favor of adding more duties onto Solicitor Eskra's plate. MR. MCANDREW : Also on the question , I feel the same as Councilman Schuster . So we have some oversight already for ARPA, us, two contracted entities that are watchdogs. And we did shift the Law Department around. We did give them large increase s. And like I have a concern when Mrs. Cipriani became the ARPA Director . So if we're going to give $25,000 more to Attorney Eskra, how much is she going to work? How many hours is she going to work for that $25,000 towards the distribution of the ARPA funds because last time when Mrs. Cipriani got a large raise, it turned out she would be working seven hours a week and for that amount of money after the inquiring . So I feel the same about this. You know, I'm leaning towards what Mr. Coyne said. I would rather pay the extra money to have someone work on it eight hours a day, not eight minutes a day. And that's what it's going to come out to. So that is why I'm a no. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR.
