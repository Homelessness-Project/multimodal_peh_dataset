KING: There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table File -- or Council No. 91, 2023. This ordinance is to allow for permit parking on the 800 block of Olive Street. It's being taken from the table and placed in Seventh Order for a final vote. On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT DATED OCTOBER 25, 2023 RECEIVED NOVEMBER 8, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I don't have an announcement today, but I would like to follow up on an announcement I did a couple weeks ago. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 It was the food drive of the union -- DPW union at -- I'm sorry, it took place at Nay Aug Park the past two weekends . I attended , of course, and it was fantastic . I just want to say I'm very proud of them and they did a great job the past two weekends . That's all I have. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have an announcement . It's that time of year where we're seeing a lot of great food drives and thank you to the DPW for the one that they had done. But there is one that's coming up this Friday from five to seven. And that's going to be the Stuff The Caboose Community Food Drive at Steamtown National Historic Site. And you could bring nonperishable food items and help stuff the caboose for the holiday s. Also, there will be the West Scranton High School Strings Band. And they'll have, like, hot cocoa. And you'll be able to see the trains and everything . It should be a nice time and a great way to donate to the food drive. So once again, it will be this Friday, five to seven at 350 Cliff Street. Thank you. MR. KING: Any other members ? I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 would just like to read a tribute that's typically done around this time of the year. So I would like to take a few seconds to acknowledge former Scranton City Council member Bob McGoff. I knew Bob McGoff for many years as a teacher, coach, father, a runner, a local volunteer and Councilman . I always had the utmost respect for Bob based on the way he conduct ed himself and the way he treated his fellow human beings. Bob was a fearless leader in all respects and he's largely responsible for helping restore decorum back into City Council Chambers . I follow in this annual tradition established by former Council member Wayne Evans and continued by former Council Presidents Billy Gaughan and Kyle Donahue in honoring Bob McGoff on the anniversary of his passing eight years ago, November 19th, 2015. As most of you are aware Bob had cancer and suffered with this terrible disease until his ultimate passing . Bob said, "Just one thing I would like to mention is that I know all of us have been affected in some way 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 by this insidious disease . And I would just encourage anyone that knows someone who is fighting this or dealing with treatments involve d with cancer to be a friend. One of the things that happens to cancer patient s and those under treatment is depression is a very serious aspect of it. Believe it or not, simply sitting down and talking with people, going watching a television show with them, bringing down dinner or having something to eat with them goes a long way in helping cancer people deal with their illness . And I would just like to encourage anyone that knows someone going through cancer to please be a friend and be a part of the helping process ." As a friend of Bob's and recent cancer survivor myself, I truly appreciate Bob's words of encouragement , inspirational words and his legacy of strong leadership and kindness to others. And he will never be forgotten . Thank you. Also, one thing I would like to note it was brought up about -- most of us have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 received notices in the mail from the Pennsylvania American Water Company about another -- yet another rate increase . I've been reaching out to -- I reached out to the Mayor this week who is onboard with trying to -- we're going to look and try to come up with a strategy to try to fight this proposed increase again on our residents . She reached out to the Mayor of Wilkes-Barre, Mayor Brown, and he's interested in getting involved . I also spoke to State Rep Kyle Donahue . He's going to be investigat ing this further to see what we can all do. I also have a call into Senator Marty Flynn's Chief of Staff today to try to get him involved . And we're going to be reaching out to the Dunmore Borough Council as well and Mayor of Dunmore to see if collectively we can all try to rather than just write letters , see if we could actually go to a Public Utility Commission meeting and see what we could do to try to fight yet another what I would call a massive increase that we've all been realizing for over the last few years for water and sewer rates. So I'll keep everyone updated as that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 progresses . That's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Mr. King, what I gave you was a copy of a list of all the vehicles , buildings , parks, and other items of city property that Knowles Insurance insures with a contract that began in 2022 for four years. This was passed by City Council under an emergency certificate on March 29th, 2022. You were all present except for Councilman Smurl because this is when Donahue was still here. Now, last week Mr. Argenta spoke about having request ed the information and receiving a response from the Right To Know Officer that no such record exists. This is on the city's website . And it illustrates a larger point. I'm not trying to come down totally on this Right To Know Officer . He or she will only perform as well as he or she has been trained . And in many cases we've got, you know, it could have been human error, could have been lack of training . It could have been a number of things. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 But many, many times when people make a right to know request they get the answer no such records exist. And you know better. Later this week I'm going to do a right to know request for the Ufberg contract . I want to see, you know, whether there's a cap on that contract or if Mr. Ufberg is going cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, you know, because I think it's now up to $300 a billable hour. And he charges even for postage . So, you know, I mean, these are things -- these things are important . Many times you ask for information from the administration and you never get a response . We come up to the podium and many times we ask you, you ask. There's no response . The citizens have a right to know. This information does exist. You know, there's an art and a science to retrieving information . If you want to know about it, you ask that man right there Scott Thomas, CEO of Scranton Public Library . It can be done. But the administration has got to train its people to be able to perform the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 task. There's no point complaining about them if they've been left holding the bag. Enough of that. Where's my audit? MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , did we ever hear anything back from the Scranton Sewer Authority ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did not. The BA Office is following up with Attorney Shrive. MR. KING: Can we have, like, someone from the city administration contact the Sewer Authority and, like, get a definitive answer, like, what's going on so we could get this moving? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask them to. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : And with regards to the firefighter and police contracts , just so you know, the firefighter 's contract was settled 226 days ago. The police contract 109 days ago. And I understand , you know, that they kind of fudged this for decades and did not type up a new document . But I would not be surprise d if we end up coming to the end of the current contracts and they're still going cha-ching, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 cha-ching, cha-ching at taxpayer experience . Did we reach the FEMA threshold for the disaster declaration so our people could get FEMA assistance ? MR. KING: I believe we did. And I think we got -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Hallelujah . MR. KING: Does it mean we're going to get the funding , I don't know. But I did get -- I think we all received an e-mail today from the Mayor. This was at 1:07 this afternoon , very good news from Governor Shapiro and PEMA. The governor has requested that the President and FEMA declare a disaster for September 9th. Continue to push for our federal legislators and the White House to approve this declaration which would unlock over 7 million dollars in disaster relief for our public infrastructure work. So -- MS. HODOWANITZ : And how do we stand on tax relief for the citizens and businesses that were affected in Scranton ? MR. KING: Well, as I said, we had that meeting last week. Each of the -- like, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 we had the acting superintendent . It was also the Business Manager . He had to bring that back to the school board and to the solicitor of the school district and the same thing applies with the county. But as I said, everyone that was sitting there at that table seemed they're pretty much in agreement that they want to provide such tax relief. So we'll stay on that and try to get resolution for that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, I'll keep reminding you. MR. KING: Thank you. I know you will. Thank you, Joan. Laura Augustini . MS. AUGUSTINI : That would be me. Laura Augustini , Scranton . I've come before you on a couple different matters today. The first one that I've gotten three different answers from Department of Parks on is the removal of the Ginkgo tree at Pretzel Park. And while as I said in our meeting last night, it's a (inaudible ) problem . It is something that we take pride in. We do a lot of work at Pretzel Park and the parks in the Green Ridge area. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 I approached the Parks Department , the director on Wednesday night to ask what was going on because that's when I found out about it. On Thursday morning -- on Wednesday night he didn't know anything about the removal . On Thursday morning when I approached the workers who were at the park removing the tree, I was told that Tony Santoli had okayed it and that it had been -- people had been after them for weeks to get this tree down. However , the director of the parks had no idea that there was going to be any work done at Pretzel Park. He even met with people at the park as well and was told that a Bassler tree was suppose d to be taken down, not the Ginkgo tree. Then that story changed a little bit later when he met with Tony Santoli and the owner of Titan Tree and was told that two different licensed arborists from Titan had seen the tree and made an independent decision that it needed to come down. I then got another e-mail from the Parks Department that Tony -- that there had been three different arborist s including Tony 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Santoli to take that down and the Bassler tree was on the list to come down and that there was going to be another tree that needed to be trimmed . My biggest problem is the lack of communication , the fact that the Director of Parks didn't know that this 125-year-old tree that was a magnificent specimen of a tree was taken down in a park and had to go through the hoops that we had to go through never mind the various things that I've had to go through to get the information , including reading about it in the paper, which was yet another story -- a different story as to what was going on. MR. KING: Mrs. Augustini, was that tree ever marked with an X? MS. AUGUSTINI : Not that I'm aware of. When I was there on Thursday morning , there was a pink, for lack of a better word, ribbon around it. While I drive past that park on a daily basis, I can't say that I noticed anything . But the trees in that park had been reviewed in the past five years because we asked Tony Santoli to come and look at it because we had some concerns about some of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 other trees. And we were given no indication that there was any problem with that tree. I'm a lay person. I have no idea about trees. But based on what I saw of the trunk, it certainly looked to be healthy . It's done. It's over with. The tree is gone. It's going -- my understanding is the stump will be ground. And I'm hopeful that another Ginkgo tree will be planted there or at least that they will replace the tree -- replace it with another tree. Again, my biggest problem is more the lack of communication . It doesn't seem like the left hand of the city knows what the right hand of the city is doing. This is something that the Parks Department should have been aware of. And it's big deal that we aren't finding out or at least I'm not able to -- a simple phone call or a simple e-mail to say, hey, what's happening on Woodlawn ? I've gotten some phone calls about trees being taken down but we don't know why or again this thing at Pretzel Park. I think you know the Green Ridge 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Neighborhood Association takes great pride in our neighborhood and in the parks. And so we're concern ed about that. We want to make sure the parks -- they're a vital part of this entire city. It's one of the reasons why people like to live here is because we have 37 parks that are used by our citizens . So I bring that up. I do have another matter which is being addressed I believe , the crosswalks on Green Ridge Street. At the meeting last night if you guys had heard the number of complaints I had with regards of how long it's taken to get crosswalks put on Green Ridge Street, I think it's over two years that they have been requested and requested and requested . Finally the one at Penn is being put in on Thursday . But we also need crosswalk s at Wyoming and at North Washington . There's a crossing guard that assists when school is in session . But Green Ridge is one of the more walkable areas of Scranton . And there are so many kids that are crossing Green Ridge Street to go to St. Paul's for basketball , to come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 back to Robert Morris, to go down to Zumo's. They're just -- they're going all over the place. And it's really a danger because cars are going up and down. I drive it. We all drive it. And there is -- there are no signs to indicate that, "A", there's a school a block off of Green Ridge Street; and "B", that there's pedestrians crossing here. And I know that there are traffic lights, you know, etc. But they -- really believe that crosswalks need to become more of a priority for DPW and for the city to make sure that the city remains walkable and it's not -- doesn't become a safety issue. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we check with DPW, get an update as to where we're at? Now Green Ridge Street is a state road. Are we -- would the state be involved with doing the crosswalks or does the city usually take -- MR. VOLDENBERG : No, the city is able to do the crosswalks . MR. KING: Okay. So if we could get an update as to, like, where are we with this, I mean, it is -- I know both of those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 intersection s are very dangerous and, you know -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask Director Pietreface in the morning . MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. MS. AUGUSTINI : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Augustini, appreciate it. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I'd just like to illustrate something here today. This is the Mayor and Council 's response to my suit to my complaint in Federal Court by their law firm that is representing them, which is Oliver Price and Rhodes. It's the most ridiculous thing I've read and I'm only a truck driver so, you know, look, give me the opportunity to be incorrect here. But, you know, the Mayor claims that her service was inadequate and that I don't have a legal claim. Well, look it, if I have to correct my service I will. But in regards to legal claim, I think her attorneys and the Council need to realize a few very important things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 here. There's a document in this country called the Constitution and it controls this action. I think the people in the city just had an election . And, you know, people are free to vote for whoever they care to vote for. But when you have a government that has control of a television station and beams it content into people's homes -- and I'll be brief here because it's a lot more complex than that. But the Constitution says what the government can do and what the government cannot do. Now, if it's necessary for me to remediate anything in the claim which I don't think it will happen because the Mayor knows herself and the Council itself were served by me. And they've hired representation and they've answered my complaint . So I don't see how there could be a flaw in what I've done. She may be talking about a technicality . But when freedom of speech is violated by your government , the Constitution says you can't do that, okay? Denying due process and equal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 protection under the Constitution , the government can't do that either. But yet you're a government body that's done that. And, you know, I hope that the court takes a very, very dim view of the things that the Mayor, okay, ECTV and the Council have done here because it shreds the Constitution . And these people that went out and voted a couple days ago and reinstated these Council members to their seats is almost beyond ridiculous . You know, when you look at what's happened here to ECTV and you look at the reason that it was created , it was created by the United States Senate and Congress to empower people, not the government . Okay, so what this channel is used for is a propaganda channel . The government which is you fund it and control its content through your funding of that channel . It's plain and simple, the same thing the Mayor does. And then when it came down to find out how the board was put in place, that's your board. You funded them. And when you take a look at how ECTV was created and what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 federal law said in regards to that under Section 663, okay, I mean, it's just a travesty and you know what I would like to say is, why should the city and the Council , okay, want to try to throw this suit out? Come and argue the case -- I don't know -- I guess on the law and what's actually occurred . Okay, let's do discovery . Let's bring witnesses in. Let's take testimony . Let's stand it in front of a federal judge and let him make a decision instead of playing all of these silly little games because me, I'm just a tiny little humble truck driver. But I'm saying to you, the Council , I'm saying to the Mayor and I'm saying to this law firm that if I have to correct this petition I will, okay. And what I'm saying to you is, bring your argument into a courtroom . Let's argue it on the merits. Let's argue it on the case law. Let's do discover y. Let's bring witnesses in. Let's find out what's what and let's have a decision by a federal judge who is going to look at federal law and make a determination and quit hiding.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, how are you. You mentioned Bob McGoff. I went to visit him twice. And the second time was just a few days before he passed and I had to stand at the door. I guess you did the same thing. He couldn't hardly talk or anything . The nurse stood there with me so I wouldn't go in the room, very, very sad to see somebody that was so active up there, you know, so sick. I only had one big argument with him in all those times he was up there. And, of course, he won. In the paper last week or a few days ago there was multimillion dollar properties and information about them but they didn't tell what the taxes were. I know my doctor lives in Waverly , someplace out there. And my taxes are three times more than his and he has a huge -- I don't know 3-400 thousand dollar house -- property up there. One reason our property values are so far off is Mr. Tobin. He always yields. He's just a -- he doesn't put up any resistance when somebody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 wants to -- one of these developer s or nonprofits . The same with the school board, they had a meeting a few months ago and three women complained they didn't want the schools closed. You know, it's not -- it's practical to close the three schools for the savings and the buildings are old. It's just the financial reasons alone you have to close some schools . I'm not mad at anybody that I want a school closed, of course. Then in the midst of all of this, we got this Basalyga wants 10 properties -- he's just got -- I don't know, he's just a glutton ous greed. He wants all -- he brags about the profits from this complex of apartments downtown . But he says, you know, like I said last week, they already knocked 300,000 off the parking garage and now he wants more off. He has to be told no. You people have to stand up for the people of the city. Last week the three of you favored cheats and chiselers over the taxpayers . You know, I told Mr. Courtright one time he asked where I heard that -- last night I was at the Taurus club for a cocktail . And when you go in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 the bathroom , seriously in one minute you could hear things that -- the conversations , political , you know, real quick. I hear things I never -- never knew about the city in a minute from someone . And last night somebody asked me -- well, it was today. Somebody asked me where they keep the electric cars because they are not allowed to be in the building because they explode and burn. I said I don't know. I don't know the first thing about them. To me, the electric cars are junk. And if I could afford one, it wouldn't be an electric car. My friend that lives in Hollywood says when you drive down the streets in Los Angeles , the car lots are full of Teslas because people fear of a $20,000 car and then having to buy a $20,000 battery in a short time. I don't believe that between fuel being -- has made great improvements . I don't, you know, the reason -- the reason the smoke isn't just from automobiles . Thirty years ago the conservation ist said we have to stop eradicating all our forests and jungles . They 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 predicted exactly what's going on now 30 years ago. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Scott Thomas. MR. THOMAS: I think Joan gave me a pretty good introduction . I'm Scott Thomas, CEO of the Scranton Public Library . And, first of all, thank you for approving our authority appointments today that's on the agenda. But I think traffic in Green Ridge is kind of a topic today. First of all, thank you for making the blocks of Marion that intersect Wyoming Avenue one way. That helps with some of the problem s that have been talked about with the traffic there. But I want to echo our friend here from the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association that Green Ridge Street is a problem . And in 2020 the city got a grant, a Green Light Go grant from PennDOT to basically replace the traffic light, to do the crosswalks and the signalling at the corner of Wyoming and Green Ridge Street. And every time I ask about it, it's going to be in spring, in the summer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 and now it will be three years now. And I was hoping you folks could look into it and find out when that's going to be done because we really need to do something about the traffic in that neighborhood because our schools . There's a library , all kinds of business es and a church. So anything you could do to kind of help that along would be appreciated . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Once again, Frank, if could you check on that. MR. SCHUSTER : Well, it's been something that we keep getting answers that it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. We did get it on our last -- was it include d in the capital budget was the last place I -- - MR. VOLDENBERG : It was. And we did receive an update approximately two weeks ago that it is on track. And it will be completed before any of the grant funding runs out. I think Mr. Smurl was involved also in that conversation . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, it's been something since the first time Mr. Thomas came here. I think that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 night I sent out an e-mail. And since then it's been it's coming, it's coming, it's coming. It's three years later, almost four. MR. VOLDENBERG : They did confirm it a few weeks ago. But I'll get a date. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Thank you, Joan. This just proves there is no transparency and the lies and deceit from this administration . This administration 's reported to Harrisburg that a list like this doesn't exist. I asked last week regarding the National Test Network scoring issue regarding weighted scores for the police exam test. Do we have any answers ? Do you think it's important that we find out? MR. KING: Did we get an answer, Frank, on that question ? MR. ARGENTA : Can you give it to me after my five minutes are up? Whose decision was it to change the testing for the Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 patrolman exam May, 2023, from the LEAB testing which is administer ed by the Pennsylvania State Police, the city of Pittsburgh and many other Pennsylvania municipalities to the National Testing Network which is testing site from the west coast? If it was lack of test takers, that was throughout the country . Who is responsible for making these hasty decisions ? Was there a problem with the past testings that this administration and the citizens didn't know about? Did anyone have a chance to see the new test that is being administer ed for the police patrolman exam? Who voted or approved it? Was there a syllabus playbook, basic review book? Does anyone know why there's no instructions , guideline s and no way to communicate ? You understand we're in a technical era. I'm not so sure that we are so tech savvy here though. The little bleeps as questions or concern contact Captain Lukasavage . I challenge any one of you to leave a message on that answering machine . Let me know how lucky you are to get a return call. Imagine a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 potential test taker trying to get an answer. This is in no way any disrespect to the captain . We had a system that worked for years. We have two local colleges that provide Act 120 certified police recruit s. They graduate and are ready to hit the streets . These young men and women grew up here, went to school here, know the area and know the culture . I would consider that an asset and an advantage over an out-of-towner. Scranton Police Department should have 147 officers . We have 111. The 2024 budget calls for four. Do the out-of-town test takers know their chances are slim to none? This would have given the administration the chance to prove to our young and upcoming stars that you're doing all you can to keep them here. Losing the stigma that the educated young people have where they see through you politician s and look at you like you failed the young people, like you have given them no opportunity , like you have given them no way to grow and give them reason to leave the area in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 droves. Bill Gaughan and Matt McGloin said it best. There's zero opportunity for our young to stay there. How many families have an empty seat at the holiday table because their children are in other states because we did nothing . We did nothing at all to help keep them here. We must change that. No truer words were said. And when the City of Scranton has an opportunity to change that, they go and prove those young educated would be investors and taxpayers in our city correct . Their city failed them again. Back to the Civil Service Commission , they don't administer police tests that were given at the Serrenti Center any longer. The Civil Service Commission as per the May 22nt meeting minutes state, "The board is having a difficult time getting three volunteers to hold oral exams for the fire administrative captain 's oral exam." The Civil Service Commission is waiting on the letter from the Mayor so that they may administer the Scranton Fire Department Chauffeur exam due to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 a new testing company . So what exactly is the sole purpose of the Civil Service Commission anymore if we're not using the civil service tests but we're paying proctors $125 a person to proctor the test. By the way, are those proctor positions , are they posted anywhere so that the general public could have an opportunity to maybe make that extra $125? We paid Scranton Rental Center $563.92 for table and chairs. City of Scranton doesn't have folding tables or chairs now, 2023? In 2022 we used the Serrenti Center for testing . Where are the tables and chairs that we used for that testing ? Well, anyway, I've been going through the boards lately. There's 13 boards. There is one that is professionally ran and documented and it's the Scranton Housing Authority . The other 12 boards, they may want to take advice from the Scranton Housing Authority . But the only thing that's in the minutes of the meeting and it's very clear are the solicitor 's fees. There's no mistake 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 there. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : You may want to look at those boards and maybe there's a lot of expired seats on the board so that the taxpayer and we could look there and find out what's really going on in the city because that's a disservice to us. MR. KING: Thank you. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Okay here, you mentioned in the beginning Mr. King about the water. It says here that for 3,000 gallons they want to raise it to about $90 or 88.24 per month. We were billed last month $141 for about 2,300 gallons or something like that. And I think it's high time that we just find ourselves a good attorney and take them to court because this is nothing of what they promise d when they bought at sewer plant. It has nothing to do with the sewer plant and they just keep getting away with it. And, you know, when you have utilities go up 50 bucks a month and maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 electric bill goes up 30, your insurance goes up $100 a year for the house, by that time, you know, you car insurance went up -- they gave us a little break during Covid because people weren't driving . Whoop-de-do they raised mine $200 a year after that. And I have to change oil by the age of the oil in the engine. I don't change it by mileage because it's way too long, you know, it would be a couple years. It's time to just start looking to some attorneys to see if we could straighten this out because it's gone too far. One of my concerns with electric cars is are we going to have the grid to support an electric car fleet? And are people going to car plug their car in at 5:30, 6:00 and your television will go dark and your ice cream will start to melt and your electric stove will shut down. You won't even have dinner. So it's just -- like, that went up 50 percent from a year or two ago. So when you keep piling that on little chunk here, little chunk there, chunk, chunk, the next thing you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 know you could have a Social Security raise and be 2 or 300 a month behind the eight-ball. And we made our decision to sell the sewer plant but I knew -- kind of suspect ed it was too good to be true because I was at the one and only meeting . And getting back to HUP, that's another thing I would love to see some day settled in Federal Court, the Pennsylvania Constitution requiring us to just recognize any and all non-profits or tax exempts , as I call them, that want to roll into town. It's just too much, 37.5 percent . It's up four points since five or eight years ago. And it keeps growing and growing and growing . Wyoming Avenue on the corner of Joe Biden Way or Spruce Street on the north side was taken over by some type of welfare type situation and that's okay. But somewhere along the line these institutions are creating medical care and stuff. However , they are doing it for the whole county or, you know, outlier communities ; and we're paying the bill. So anyway a few weeks ago when I was in, I was mentioning crypto losses and I'll drop this off on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 way, 40 billion dollars one pop. So if a lot of baskets of stocks and investment s for pensions have crypto in it and I think it's about time that crypto's not in it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else that would like to speak before Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I'm going to bring back from when Miss Schumacher had a young guest in this body and put forward at the end of the Scranton City Expressway where it goes into Biden Street there was a request for yellow paint to be put on the middle cement barrier and/or a reflector at that intersection . It was put forward and supposedly PennDOT or someone was going to look at it. I find it very dishearten ing that a young person wants to get involved in bettering (inaudible ) bettering city life and taking an interest in it is told that it's good, it's reasonable , it should be done but we're going to just let it sit on hold. During the period of time we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 barriers up along that entire section . We're painting an entire wall logo out there. We're going to have a lovely mural before safety is taken care of by painting a 4 foot yellow line and putting up two reflectors . I don't understand the logic behind that, neither should Mr. Schumacher 's young friend. Three weeks ago this body wanted to take action on tax relief independently for the residents who were impacted by the flood. Three weeks ago they said they would take a couple of days to review that. Two weeks ago Mr. King asked the Solicitor to draw up the ordinance or documents for putting that forward to putting it forward so this body could act on it themselves . I haven't heard much of it since then other than the Mayor is working with other organizations . That's not the issue. The Mayor can work with whoever they want. This body can do for this city its action and not push it on so we could delay and wait so that the Mayor has a feather in her cap for election to say look at what I did. Maybe rather than waiting for it to -- all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 different organizations to act, this body should act for the people who were harmed before the end of the year, make a decision , put it forward for the good of the people you represent . It's absolutely wrong that you have to wait for someone else to coordinate it between a number of different organizations when these people are harmed. I don't understand the delay, especially considering you asked Council to look at that and present a document forward to this body and then suddenly it's back to, well, the Mayor is handling it so we're not going to look at that anymore. It was the emergency order that was put through , rush, one, two, three, Fifth Order, Sixth Order, Seventh Order. We were told that you were going to come back with details on what that order was for, what the money was for, what was spent for that. We would be assured that we would -- rush through but we're going to circle back and get all of that information brought before this body. I understand it's been a couple sessions since then and there's a hope that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 people would forget it. But it's not going to be forgotten . It was steamrolled through this body in one night and we were given the assurances that the information that wasn't there was going to be provided . It would be nice if that information was provided and there was a followthrough on it. Mr. Schuster had a question about the University of Scranton paying for the rental apartments for students . Now, the city looks at it and says, what do you mean? Obvious ly the city has no idea that the rental agreement has a $45 fee. Obviously that only works when you send out letters to everyone including people who don't own rental properties to say pay for rental properties . They know it then. When it comes to the different universities who are making a ton of money, suddenly they don't understand the ordinance and they need to be explained it. After all, the Law Department specific ally sent back to this body and requested that, you know, I should submit information to 311 to explain how they could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 take this money if I knew how to do it. Well, I don't understand why the legal department is asking me to give free legal aid to them pro bono for something that is underneath their auspices . Plain and simple I talked about it here that the rental is defined in PA law as anything over 30 days constant . That's part of the state documentation . So if they are in there for over 30 days which students are in their housing , it's a rental. It should fall under that and we should be making money on it. And the last thing is, we have asked -- this body sent out a notice to the state saying that we should increase wages and we should all be behind higher wages to pull our people up by the bootstraps. Yet how many people in this city other than the executives are asking for 6 to 50 percent increases in the salary, how many people currently work for the city who were hired by the -- at $12 and change from DPW, why aren't they getting that? We control that. Why aren't they eligible for the raise if you're screaming that someone else should take care of? Maybe we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 need to take care of the lower end people in this city who work for the city and not the upper end. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Mr. Voldenberg -- actually Solicitor Gallagher , is it possible for you to reach out to the city's attorneys Jessica Eskra or whoever would be involved to see if we could draw up some legislation to provide tax relief for at least those -- I think there is 13 residents who completely lost their homes and at least kind of get the ball rolling on behalf of the city. I know that there are going to be other meetings with school district and the county. But, you know, let's -- if we could get the ball rolling I would appreciate that. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, that's not a problem . Is it -- the question is, is it only people whose houses were condemned or are other people entitled -- do you want other people entitled to the relief as well? MR. KING: I believe that in the meeting that we had with the other taxing bodies, there were 13 city residents that lost -- that completely lost their homes. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 think in discussions that we had the ones that were under 50 percent , other people are still living in their homes there was still going to be some tax relief provided in terms of those $5,000 grants. But I believe everybody was on the same page, you know, for at least the 13 individuals or families that lost -- completely lost their homes to provide tax relief moving forward or at least for 2024, maybe 25. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, no problem . MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So with that being said, Mr. King, this was something that I brought up and Mr. McAndrew brought up and you brought up I think three consecutive weeks in a row. We did talk to Solicitor Gallagher to do that. Coming out of that meeting with the school district and the county, you're saying everybody was on the same page. Do they have any kind of timeline of when they were going to meet next? I think at the time we said let's get ourselves started since we are the taxing body but we don't want to rush too quick just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 to see what the county and the school district were going to say. Do they have any kind of timeline as to -- MR. KING: -- regarding a timeline , I think everybody felt like -- like I said, Mr. Laffey who is the acting superintendent , he had to go back to the school board and to the solicitor and have a discussion with them. There were -- there was one commissioner and another commission er came in later who seemed to be interested in providing this tax relief. But they -- once again, had to bring it back to the other commissioner and to whoever the solicitor is for the county. I didn't really get a timeline from them. I think everyone was in agreement that any tax relief that's provided should begin in 2024 taxing year though, okay, so I'll try to reach out to Mr. Laffey and, you know, to Brian Jeffers the Chief of Staff over at the county and see where they're at with it and see us get our ball rolling. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, and I know that Sean had looked into it as we had asked him to but I think we were just waiting to see what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the parameters were going to be for those residents in those homes. That's the question he just asked now. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, I don't think it's a big ask. MR. KING: No, I don't think it is either. Let's carry the torch and let them follow. MR. SCHUSTER : Agreed. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Mrs. Schumacher , I'm sorry. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , I have some questions and some questions on status of things that you are supposedly doing but we don't know how or when we'll get something . Do we or do we not have a vacuum truck? MR. KING: We do. MS. SCHUMACHER : Where is the information on what residents should do and where they leave their leaves and when the truck -- the vacuum truck will come in their block. MR. KING: I'm not sure, you're looking for a schedule ? I know recently at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 least up in my neighborhood I saw a lot of people had their leaves all bagged. And they were just recently picked up in the last week or so. But you're talking about the actual leaf truck that comes and, like, picks them up along the side of the road. MS. SCHUMACHER : Um hum. MR. KING: I don't know. Mr. Smurl, do you know anything ? MR. SMURL: (Inaudible .) I don't know where the truck is. We have two trucks. I'm not sure. MR. MCANDREW : Historically they do post it. Maybe we need to remind them to post it. MR. KING: Frank, can we reach out to DPW and see if there's a schedule or a list? MR. VOLDENBERG : There is. It's not posted on the city website . However , I confirmed that it follows the paper and cardboard recycling . And they do ask that you have the option of placing the leaves piled on the curb or out in the paper bags. And they'll pick up both.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, I have not seen it. And I put out paper bags filled with leaves. But I have not seen since last year and that was to one home -- the vacuum truck. MR. KING: So the leaves follow the cardboard schedule . MR. SCHUSTER : On that schedule , that printed out glossy schedule that you have, some of the weeks you'll see the horizontal line -- MS. SCHUMACHER : It says leaves, yes. But then you get bags -- and I'm letting you guys use up my time so let's switch to something else. Again, has anybody ever done a, I guess, any of the homeless that we have, do we know how many of those are veterans ? And if not, why not? We don't know. MR. KING: Do I know exactly how many of the homeless are veterans ? I guess we could probably ascertain that information from, you know, Keystone or some of the other -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, from the mission -- MR. KING: Yeah, the mission or, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 know -- MS. SCHUMACHER : I asked a guy at church that works down there and volunteers and he didn't know the answer either. And then again, it's been weeks or months that those signs that say roadwork ahead 500 feet -- Mr. Smurl said, you know, the city would find out who had the permit and we'll do all of this. They're still there today. Now, I guess maybe we could decorate them for Christmas and that would make it look a little better. But what if we get a storm? What's the plow going to do with the snow with those people -- those -- MR. KING: Are they on East Mountain road, Miss Schumacher ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Um hum. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. King, DPW Director Pietreface advised about two weeks ago that he would have them picked up. So I'll ask him again tomorrow . DPW would pick up the signs. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then again, we know there's things ongoing. Number one, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 don't know why we are having such trouble finding out -- getting that description of what's going on at Serrenti ? I mean, when -- it was in the paper all the time if they wanted to buy it and we were even told there would be revenue . But how do we know if there is any revenue from other people using that if we don't get any report on the Serrenti ? What is the problem ? MR. KING: Frank, can we reach out to the Chief of Police and find out what exactly is going on with Serrenti Center? MR. VOLDENBERG : We will. The last report we received approximately 30 days ago had no projects ongoing. So I'll ask him again for an update. MR. KING: Yeah, let's see if we can get an update as to where they are with that. All right. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. One more question if you would allow me. MR. KING: Sure. MS. SCHUMACHER : This letter we all got from Pennsylvania American Water and it tells you where to call if you are interested 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 in a public hearing . Don't even try. I was on the phone with them and back and forth. It's terrible . And but can you find out and advise us where and when that hearing is being held? MR. KING: We're going to find out. We will find out. MS. SCHUMACHER : I mean, before. MR. KING: Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. KING: Absolutely . MS. SCHUMACHER : I'll hold the rest for next week. Thank you. MR. KING: Thanks, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Not at this time. MR. KING: Okay. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : My only comment s are followup comment s. They were brought up in public comment tonight . I'm going to ask, Mr. Voldenberg , did we get any information on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 rental ordinance as it applies to the University of Scranton ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did not, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : I asked some questions about the Climate Action Plan. They're going to take a look at the city and the question that I asked was, is this Climate Action Plan going to be -- pertain to only the city and the city-owned assets, businesses , properties , vehicles or is it going to be something that they're going to implement across the whole city to residents ? Did we get an answer on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did. I asked those question s. And we received a response this afternoon . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. I was looking through that but I didn't see anything on that. So I'll take a closer look. Did we get the list of the actions that were taken under the emergency declaration up until this point in time? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did. We receive d that over a week ago. MR. SCHUSTER : So this was -- the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 initial list that we got was we had six pop-ups. We've had this. We've had that. But did we get a list that actually had we've dredged the Keyser creek and it cost this amount of money, the actual financial actions that we've taken? I know we got the initial question that was very general . But I asked for specific financial actions that were taken. Did we get that list? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. I'm not sure if we received the actual cost. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. So just the financial actions that we've taken under the emergency declaration . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. But we did receive the FEMA list. We did receive that, by the way. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. That's it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few things. First I failed to mention it earlier but I was reminded when Miss Schumacher was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 asking her question about the veteran homeless population . Keystone Mission right now is in desperate need of men's winter jackets and coats. So if you have, like, a gently used men's or women's coat that you could donate then you could drop them off at 8 West Olive Street from Monday through Friday 8 to 3 p.m. And I wanted to thank Councilman King for the update on the water rate increase . And I did want to encourage resident s even though we're going, you know, I feel very strongly about the city going forward with pursuing this and fighting the rate increase just as I did with the one this past year even though, you know, the time was past for that. It's not this time around. But you'll see at the end of the letter it does explain actions you could take such as attending a hearing which once we have information about that we'll be able to provide but sending a letter to the PUC as well. So I think the more that residents send those letters explaining how this is going to -- how this rate increase will impact them and their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 budgets, that will be additionally helpful . But I'm really glad to hear that the, you know, the administration and other elected officials are interested in partnering on this fight. And another note with regards to the reflector s or reflective paint on the Scranton Expressway , I also want to know where we're at with that. You know, I frequent ly drive that way and I know that it is -- can be dangerous at night and very -- and poorly lit around the area. So I completely agree that those should be added. But I did have another concern that was brought forward about that area as well going onto the 81 onramp. There are some water barriers and there must have been an accident there at some point because there are several of them that are broken. So if we could -- I'm assuming that would be PennDOT that would take care of replacing those water barriers if we could send in a request to them, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll send it to PennDOT tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Excellent . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 And did we -- I didn't see anything -- did we receive a response about when the blue and red recycling contain ers will become available through DPW? MR. VOLDENBERG : I did not receive that response as yet. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. I know there were several questions that I asked Thursday . And it was kind of a quick turnaround but I wanted to check on that. Okay. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. So, okay, so a concerned resident reached out to me, posed a question the other day regarding condemnation . I couldn't answer the question . So I'm going to ask Mr. Voldenberg to forward this. His question is or was, has there ever been condemned properties released back to the owner without the owner going to the appeal process ? If so, how does this happen and when does it happen? Unless someone here can answer that question , I don't -- it's a good question . So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 can you please send that over? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll ask for the specifics . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So during our work session today when -- after the police chief presented his budget, I had a question for him that has been brought to my attention . He actually asked me to bring it up in Fifth -- Fifth Order being now so the public is made aware. Like I said during the work session , it was brought to my attention that multiple vehicles have been stolen in Scranton the past two days. All right. And it turns out that they're Kias, the brand Kia. And the reason they are being stolen is I guess that they're just -- they're easy to steal. They don't have antitheft protection or there's a recall on that. So please, you know, I want to alert the resident s that if you have a Kia, you know, be careful and look into the recall process . In addition to that, there was -- there's some higher end cars being stolen. That scares me because I know I said to the Chief that, you know, my biggest fear is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 hijacking that's happening throughout the county and with horrific outcomes , terrible . So he assured me that -- I don't know if he assured me but he had said it's not here yet or he doesn't hope it to happen. But he also instruct ed me as a part of the awareness and education if you have a fob for these high end vehicle s, don't leave it in the car. And an indicator that the fob is in there is that the mirrors are closed -- no, remained open. So that's something that, of course, and I hope -- I'm not sure if Chief Carroll said that he rolled something out on social media about this. I'm not sure, but I hope he does or the police department does. But if not, you know, I'm trying to get it out there for him now and make the residents aware. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have some answers to some questions from last week, Joan Hodowanitz , we reached out to Scranton Tomorrow for an update on the timeline for the completion and dedication of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 downtown pocket park. Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow advised she will be coordinating with the city, commissioners , and Doherty family on the timing of the dedication which we hope will be prior to the end of the year. She'll be sure to keep Council informed of the timing and next steps. Council request ed an update on work being accomplished on the Keyser Valley pump house, what repairs and updates have been realized to date in addition to a timeframe for completion . The administration advised the updates known as of this writing identified for Keyser Valley pump house, remove and replace meter base, starter, disconnects , lights, receptacle s, heaters and main panel, change selector switches and existing control panel damaged by flood water, on, off, auto; change contact blocks for the motor heaters damaged by the flood water, replace motor blown out, install two new wall heaters, meeting with site specific to discuss transducer and installation of testing of transducer . Please be advised that the pump is fully operational at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 Norma Jeffries , she was not at the meeting last week but she had this question about the leaf truck is out daily primarily following paper and cardboard recycling schedule as was discussed earlier . Leaves placed out in bags are also picked up during the paper cardboard recycling schedule . Street sweeper is in use and primarily follows the trash pickup schedule . Les Spindler , Council asked city administration if we could revisit an update for dangerous dog ordinance for the city. The city Law Department advised state law has a robust dangerous dog law which requires owners to register a dog deemed dangerous and take, many specific steps to restrain the dog. It's 3 PS 459-502(a) through 459-507(a). Such dog owners must pay a $500 registration fee and are subject up to a fine of up to $5,000 for failing to follow dangerous dog law. However , the same state law also prohibits the city from prohibiting or otherwise limiting a specific breed of dog. We have incredibly hard-working animal control department with a lot of work on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 their plates. In conversation s last year with stakeholder s in the department , the city determined that the department would benefit from additional enforcement capacity . So the city added a part-time animal control position in the 2023 budget to give additional capacity to our animal control and enforce dangerous dog law and related animal codes. The administration consider s these efforts ongoing and they'll continue to discuss with stakeholder s and continue to evaluate our legislative and operational options . Marie Schumacher asked Council about the public safety about the Serrenti building . City administration responded by saying administration is in receipt of the inquiry and will respond soon. See if we can get an answer. I think we already discussed the -- Mr. Argenta 's request for those vehicles . He got the list this evening although they said -- we asked. I think we received it. Did we receive a list tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, late afternoon . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MR. KING: Yeah, late this afternoon it was listed as confidential and not to disseminate . That's what we were told. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time.
