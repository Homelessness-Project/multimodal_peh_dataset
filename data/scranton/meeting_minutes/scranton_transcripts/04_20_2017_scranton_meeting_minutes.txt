Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,thankyou.First, I'dliketowelcome BillJackowitz backto ourmeetings ,nicetohaveyouback, appreciate seeing youagain.Acouple of itemstonight .Ifirstwanttostartoffby thanking theScranton PoliceDepartment and theneighbors inmyneighborhood ofWest Scranton .Notsureifanybody sawonthe news,therewasavandalism spreeina couple blocks ofSumner Avenue.Iwokeup toapicture fromaclosefriend whohada signinhisyardthatwasvandalized .We started talking andbythetimepolice reports werefiledbymyself andmanyofthe people inthatneighborhood theperpetrator wasalready caught,soitwasagreatjobby theneighbors usingtheircameras thatthey hadontheirhouseandthepolice department totrackdownthisindividual andtherewas anumber ofhomes,cars,sidewalks ,that weretagged withspraypaintinmy neighborhood inWestSide,soI'mreally wanttogetabigshoutouttothepolice1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 department andespecially totheneighbors forlooking attheircameras andlooking out foroneanother andthat'ssomething thatis becoming moreprevalent withhaving the cameras onthehouses andthatreally helps inasituation likethistocatchsomebody before theycangooutandgoonaspree likethisagain. Secondly ,Idowanttomention I'm proudtovote"yes"fortherenaming ofthe Rockwell AvenuebridgeforGeneral Wintand eachtimewehaveachance tohonora veteran,something Ilovetodo,itwasa fighttokeeptheColonel Duffybridge named afterColonel Duffy,whichwewere successful withandwewillnamethenew Rockwell AvenueforGeneral WintsoI'llbe veryproudtocasta"yes"voteforthat legislation . Now,ontosomeitemsthataren't quiteaspositive .Therental registration , IknowCouncilman Gaughan talked aboutthis inthenewspaper andtherewasaletter sent outaswell,yes,council passed this legislation andourintent wasnevertohave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 aletter sentouttoallofthese properties .Ihadanumber ofcallsfrom residents ,andI'mveryhappythatthey called mebecause withtheexemptions that wereaddedalotofpeople didn'tunderstand andespecially somepeople theygetabill inthemailfromthecity,theydidn'tread thefineprintandI'mfearful thatalotof people justgotthatbillandwroteacheck tothecitywhentheydidn'thaveto,soI dowanttoreiterate acouple ofthe exemptions thatareinthelegislation .If youownatwo-unitproperty ,amulti-unit andyouliveinonoftheunitsasMr. Spindler doesandyoureceive thatnotice youdonothavetopayaregistration fee. Senditbacktothecity.Writethatitis owneroccupied andsenditback.Itwas nevertheintention tocharge arental registration feetoanyone fortheproperty thattheylivein. Secondly ,ifyourenttoafamily member youarealsoexempt.Thiswas something Ihavebeenfighting onforover threeyearsbecause family andfriends of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 mineonEastMountain keptgetting these billsoverandoveragainandtheyarenot evenrenting it,theyareletting their family staythereforfreeandtheyare getting thesebills,sothereisafamily exemption .Soifyouownarental property andyourentittoafamily member youare exempt. Ifyouhavearental property or property andyoudon'trentit,it's currently vacant,youarealsoexempt.My biggest fear,andIunderstand thatthe county datais50yearsold,it'sgarbage . Atthatpointintimeitwasaccurate but theamount ofproperties thathavechanged handsandchanged usethrough thoseyearsI wouldguesstosayit'sthemajority ofthe properties inthecityare50yearsprobably changed hands.Therehastobeabetter way todoit. Now,Idoseeinourmailtodaythat proposals aregoingtobeopened onMay24, theCityofScranton rental registration database compilation andmanagement program. Iguessmyquestion wouldbewhythiswasn't1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 donepriortothebillsbeingsentout. Maybeit'sthis--Icouldbewrongthis couldbemoreofanongoing management ,but mybiggest fearespecially withmanypeople whenyougetabillinthemail,ifIgeta billinthemailfromthecityyouwritea checkandyoupayit,andI'mcertain alot ofpeople aregoingtothinkthisisnewlaw orthisisanewfeeandsendinchecks soI really wanttoreiterate allofthose exemptions andifyoumeetanyofthem,you know,don'tsendthecheckjustsendanote withitthatyouareexempt forthisreason. Andifyouhaveanyquestions contact any oneofusorouroffice,wewillbegladto helpanywaywecan.Thelastthingwewant toseeissomebody paying thisfeethat isn'tsupposed to. Thewholepurpose ofrental registration wastocrackdownon out-of-townlandlords notpeople whorent outahometheyliveinorrenttoafamily member within thecity,sothelaw--the purpose ofthelawit'sstillneeded,you know,therearealotofout-of-town1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 landlords inthecitythatdonotkeepupon theirproperties andforthosepeople that's exactly whythiswasanenacted .Soanyone thatreceived aletter inerrororifyou haveaproperty that'snotarental property certainly sendthatbackstating it'snota rental anditwillbeaddressed ,butIdo wanttoreiterate allofthoseexemptions andI'mhoping thatthecitycancomeupand theadministration cancomeupwithanother waytosendoutthesenoticesinthefuture. Next,ontoanother hottopictonight thegarbage fee.Iwon'ttalkonittoo muchbecause Ithinkeverybody knowsmy position onthisissue,butIagreethe$300 garbage feeisexcessive andit's particularly unfair tosenior citizens and people wholivealoneorevenacouple.My wifeandIputoutmaybeoneortwobagsa weekatmostbecause wedoalotof recycling .Thereisanumber ofpeople who livealone,alotofwidows thatputoutnot evenafullbagofgarbage ,asmallwhite bagorevensometimes asmallbagfrom Gerrity 's,andit'scertainly notfairthat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 person ispaying thesame$300thatthe largefamily isdownthestreet sothere needstobeasystem madethat'sequitable andfair.Ifthatmeansalargefamily has topayforthat'sfair.Ifyougenerate moregarbage ,youshould bepaying moreofa fee.Heindividual wholivesalonecannot continue tobepunished underthissystem. Andthatisallfornowthankyou. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Rogan. Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.I'vegot quiteafewthings totalkabouttonight .

Thishasbeensincebeencommented onbytheScranton Timeseditorial boardand wentontosay,"Ahalfcentury after Lackawanna County'smostrecent assessment twocurrent majority commissioners resist reassessment forthefearofpolitical fallout.TheDelaware Countycase demonstrates thataCourtcouldandperhaps should takeitoutofthehandsfortheir failuretocomply withthestate constitution ." Ihavetakentheposition forover twoyearsthatifthecounty ultimately refuses todoareassessment ,thecityand maybeanyotherresponsible governing bodies,effected schooldistrict andany otherentities should jointogether toforce1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 thereassessment through theCourts,and basedonthisrecent information from Delaware Countymaybeeventheindividual property owners whounderstand an reassessment willbringequity andfairness toourproperty taxesshould jointhe effort. WhileIdon'texpect thecounty to moveaheadontheirowntodoa reassessment ,Ithinkitmaybefinally time forthemtorelease theirevaluation and thenwecandecide whowillhavethefinal word. I'dliketotalkalittle bitabout pavecuts.Werecently werenotified bythe city'spavecutinspector thattheutility workonthe500blocktothe800blocks of BirchStreetandthe200and300blocks of CrownAvenueinSouthScranton hasbeen completed .Thisiseffectively meansthat themonths andmonths ofpoorroad conditions aswellasmanyotherissues that havevirtually impacted residents willbe coming toanendandtheroadsarefinally pavedcurbtocurb,butthispoints toa1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 larger failure .Itismypersonal opinion thatthecurrent pavecutordinance has failed residents citywidebyallowing for theutility companies todictate howlong andhowtheworkisdonewheninstalling new underground facilities .Itismy understanding thatmostworkiscompleted in thefollowing manner:Utility companies firstputallofthemainlinesorpipesfor theworktobedoneoneffective streets and theycontinue tomovearound thecity completing theirmainsfirst.Whenallof thatworkisdoneandtheroadshavebeen dugupandamessformonths already ,they return tothesecond phaseoftheworkwhich istoputinlateral lineorpipestothe individual properties .Onlywhenthatis completed cantheroadsbethenproperly restored andpavedcurbtocurb. Theproblem Ihavewiththat scenario isitallows forstreetstobedug upformonths andmonths withnoutility workbeingdonewhilecrewsshifttoanother partofthecity.Iwouldsuggest thatthe cityrequire thatalljobsbedoneby1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 utilities couldbecomplete dallatall once.Forexample ,themainlinesand laterals inthe200and300blockofCrown couldhavebeencompleted anddoneandthe roadcanbepavedandfullyrestored and moveontothenextlocation . Sothat'sallIhaveonthat,butI hopewecansomehow weviewthepavecut ordinance again.Iknowit'srelatively new,butIthinktherearedeficiencies that weneedtoaddress thatweallknowaswe drivearound thecity. Twothings thatcameuplastweek thatcaused alittle angstincertain circles ,theywerealready talked about tonight alittle bit,thebillsforthe rental registration werefinally released . Ascanbeexpected,thephonecallsstarted shortly thereafter .Theprimary problem is thatnumerous homeowners gotbillsfortheir ownsingle family homesclearly ,togeta notification toregister theirhomeasa rental property .Dataisaninteresting thing.Theoldbusiness axiomwhichsays garbage inequals garbage outmostcertainly1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 applies .Thecityinaneffort tofinally getahandle onrental properties enlisted theinformation fromtheLackawanna County Assessor 'sOffice.Whattheydidn'tknow, butshould haveknownisthatmuchofthat information is47yearsoldandhasnotbeen updated sincethelastreassessment garbage in,garbage out. Ihadsuggested fornearly20years thatthedatagathering component ofthis process bedonebyathirdpartycompany who hasthetools,databasis,andknowledge to getthisinformation right.Whenthis legislation wasapproved bycallsforthat tocontinue soI'malittle baffled atthe position takenbytheLicensing and Inspection Department thatsomehowthis became citycouncil 'spart.Iamconfident thatiftheadministration hassentusan RFPforaresponsible thirdpartytohelp withidentification itwouldhavebeenmet bya5to0vetforapproval bythis council .Thishasalways beenourposition . Additionally ,areminder toall, citycouncil legislates ,theadministration1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 implements .Withthatsaid,Idonot believe itwasforlackofeffort fromthose inLIPStoperform theirduties,itis because ofalackofaccess tothedataand aknowledge ofhowtofinditandforsome reason afailure toseekoutthedataor thosewhohavetheaccess tothatdata. Another thingthatIfindtroubling iswhenthelastreassessment wasstopped in 2009,21stCentury,thecompany thatwas charged withdoingthejobhadcompleted all thefieldworkfortheCityofScranton .I havetoldcityofficials repeatedly ,this administration andthelast,thatsince2009 thatthisinformation should havebeen available fromthecounty either through the Assessment OfficeortheirITDepartment . Thisisthemostcurrent andcomprehensive dataavailable today.Evenateightyears old,itisextremely valuable ,yetsomehow itgoesunused,unaccessed andeven unrequested .That'sstopstoday.Iwould askthatwesendaformal request tothe Lackawanna County Commissioners requesting access tothatinformation .Itwasbought1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 andpaidforbyallofthetaxpayers ofthe CityofScranton andLackawanna County and finally itshould beatleastputtosome positive use. Thesecond thing,ofcourse,iswe release dtherefuse bills.Byallaccounts the10percent discount bepaidyougetif youpaytheentire amount inthefirst payment hasreceived positive feedback.I wouldexpect adramatic increase in collections overtheprevious yearsofpaid refuse billswhenthefirstreporting scomes in.Whileifthereissomelegitimately acquired information beingprovided some property owners astotheirqualification s forthediscount ,thatseemstoberesolved andcorrected tomyknowledge . And,finally ,atthecommissioners ' meeting yesterday orIthinkitwaslast weekbecause wedidn'tmeet,therewassome comments madebyacounty commissioner against aproposed bikegrant.Again, leaving myscratching myhead.Apparently wedon'ttravel inthesamecircles because thestatement thattheydon'tknowanyone1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 whoridesabikeisastounding .Forthe record,Irideabike.I'mnotsureithas anybearing ontheargument ,butIthought itwouldbeworthmentioning .
