REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Just a few quick comments tonight . First, I want to thank Richard and Bridget from the Ronald McDonald House for coming and just explaining the upgrades that they want to do to continue support for the Armed Forces parade. It's something that's very important to our community and obviously to the veterans and the armed forces in our area and around the country . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 And, also, I have known Richard quite some time, probably since the mid-90's, and his work with the Ronald McDonald house in this area has been to say the least overwhelming and extensive , the great things that he does for the families in this area. So any time his name is on board with something you can guarantee he is into it and I fully support him and for his push behind our Armed Forces parade. So thank you for that, Rich, and everybody from the Ronald McDonald House. Ms. Hodowanitz , you touched on this earlier , I just want to bring it up briefly about the sad events on Washburn Avenue. Loss of life is always very tragic, always, but you know it's times like this where -- and it's been said by me and many others that we have some of the best police, fire and DPW workers in the country and I truly believe that, and let this just be another reminder that these civil servants go out every day ready to give up their life for a stranger and that's what they do and, you know, take your time and thank them when you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 see them. They are out there for you guys whether you know it or not or whether they know you or not, they will gladly exchange them for you because that's what they do, that's how they are made. So, again, I want to thank them and commend them on just being the utmost professionals . And, finally , I wasn't going to touch on it, but I will, Mr. Bolus you brought something up about the nurses' support . No one has any more support for nurses than I do. Like you, my mother was a nurse. She started out in Carbondale at St. Joe's for a couple of years and then supported a Catholic Irish family, there was a lot of us, and she put us all through school, kept dinners on our table, kept clothes in our drawers and kept them clean and she worked any shift available depending on how old we were, whether it was first shift, second shift, she worked overnights. However that check had to come in she made sure and it didn't matter if it was a snow storm they had police or fire escort to get to the hospital s. Hospitals don't close. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Nurses don't call off. There is no bigger support of a nurse than I am. Any time any kind of support is asked of me I'm glad to give it. Although I wasn't able to make it for them, let that not deter anyone from claiming that nurses are not the backbone of the health community because they are, and anybody who doesn't believe hasn't spent the day, one day in the hospital and I believe for the most part. Unless you were born in a barn, you have at least spent a day in the hospital and the nurses are without a doubt the backbone of that whole establish ment. That's all I have to say. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I would also first like to commend the police and fire departments and the DPW on the professionalism in dealing with the tragic situation in West Scranton on Saturday . We are all extremely grateful for their service to the city. I would also like to extend my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 support and gratitude to the nurses of the Moses Taylor and Regional Hospital for standing up and demanding quality patient care in our area. I, unfortunately , had a scheduling conflict and I wasn't able to attend on Wednesday , but the issues that the nurses brought up, brought to light, especially in regards to staffing is the perfect example to show when for profit health care providers have a choice between profits and quality care, they will most likely choose profits , which is basically saying the all mighty dollar is more important than a life. Quality health care should be a right for all Americans and nurses from both hospitals deserve our gratitude for standing up for that right. And, lastly, I would also like to bring up council has received numerous complaints regarding a condemn ed building at 2004 Luzerne Street, specifically regarding trash accumulated in the yard as well as the building potentially being a fire hazard. The neighbors have been in touch with Mr. Hinton regarding their concerns .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Ms. Reed, would you be able to please send a letter to Mr. Hinton to request an update on the property and to see whether or not the building is currently on the demolition list? And that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Just a few. I may regret this, but I'm going to into the $30 dog license fee that was discussed over the last couple of weeks. The city developed a contribution policy for the Griffin Pond Animal Shelter per animal brought to the shelter by the city's animal control officer as well as Scranton residents , so at a defined rate of $85 per animal using a recent contribution in 2015 as a guide, the city donated to Griffen Pond $87,000 that year and ongoing after that. So using a four-year average of 4,000 animals brought to the shelter annually, approximately 35 to 40 percent of those are from Scranton residents or brought from the animal control 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 officer . The dog license fee for the city is $30 and it generates about $37,000 annually . That money is used to defray the cost of our contribution to the shelter as well additional funds to Street Cats and Dogs at Nay Aug Park. It would clearly appear that a substantial amount of the funding for GPAS must come out of the general budget and not from the pet or dog license fee. I'm not saying I think the fee is appropriate and should not be lower, because it should be. I'm just trying to give context to the reason for the fee in the first place why it was at that rate at the current time, but I will say donating our fair share to the shelter is the right thing to do. To my knowledge , not one -- there is only other one municipality in Lackawanna County that contributes to the Griffin Pond shelter . The County does not contribute . With that said, most years less than 1,000 animals are licensed in the city, far less than I think currently exist. That tells me there is a compliance issue which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 should come at no surprise to anybody that has listened to my comments when it comes to fees within the city. We continually have asked less to pay more, but by creating a system that drives more compliance we should be able to have more license s registered and we would all be able to pay less than we are paying right now. For example , the county last year issued 8,500 dog licenses . I'm sure that their compliance rate is somewhere around 50 percent , but I don't doubt that in the City of Scranton there is probably 6,000 more dogs that were are licensing and if you had a better handle on compliance that would mean additional revenue of $180,000 a year. With that level, the fee could easily be cut in half and still maintain the current level of funding to the Griffin Pond Animal Shelter as well at Street Dogs and Cats. It's also noted the county fee is only $5, but the reality is the fee is actually $8.50 per dog. $6.50 if your dog is spayed or neutered . It's my understanding though that that amount is set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 by the state, by the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture Bureau of Dog License Enforcement . The county is basically a pass through for this program and receives a nominal fee of $1 per license . It would appear that there should be a state remedy to this as well possibly creating a fund though licenses that can support local animal shelters . In the mean time, it's not unreasonable for the county and other municipalities to support Griffin Pond Animal Shelter. This could help the city reduce our contribution and again call out for lowering license fees for city residents . There is also a city employee who is an animal control officer . A very valuable position in our community . All of the other boroughs and towns in the country have their enforcement done by the state through a state dog worker. Scranton also seems to take the rap quite a bit when it comes to issues like this, but just like the state police, which covers rural areas throughout Pennsylvania , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Scranton taxpayers are paying for a service provided by the state to others that they have no benefit from. So there you go. That's everything you wanted to know about dog licensing and were afraid to ask, but it's certainly a lot more complicated than most thought but that does not mean we can't do better. Most communities need to step up and contribute to the local shelter and the city has to do a much, much better job of insuring compliance and then we can reduce the fee to a more reasonable amount. It's still pretty simple in my eyes, when more pay we all pay less. On another subject that was mentioned earlier tonight , there were no shortage of tragedies in our city this past. A young girl was murdered in North Scranton far too young at the hands of the lowest of low lifes. A multiple tragedy in West Side over the weekend . While we are still sorting that out it, we see another trouble d person destroying lives around them. Then we have the seemingly constant fires in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 South Side, which appear to be the work of an arsonist . My thoughts and prayers go out to all of the innocent victims of the tragedies in the past week. Through all of this though we have one constant and that is the consistent reminder that we have a truly professional police and fire department in the City of Scranton . So to them thanks again for all they do for us each and every day. And one final note on positive note I'm going to try to end, in a recent survey conducted by the National Association of Realtors , six out of ten people said they would spend more time living in the -- or spend more money to live in a community where they can walk to parks, shops and restaurants . 80 percentile said that was important in deciding where they live. 86 percent thought it was important to have sidewalks and places to take walks, and 74 percent thought it was important to have a short commute to work. 54 percent even though it was important to have bike lanes and paths nearby.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 All of this information , if you pay attention to it, can lead to Scranton 's future growth. All the data, all of the demographic information points to us in that direct and that's where we are trending so either embrace it or we fall back. I just happen to embrace it and will do everything I can to foster, nourish and promote our current and future opportunities . So that's just more food for thought , so that's all I have tonight . Thanks. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, just a few. First of all, I think Mrs. Schumacher made a good point tonight about having the caucus with the Pennsylvania Economy League and Henry Amoroso about the city's financial condition , and more important ly, our exit plan. I asked a few months ago for an update from the administration on the different items in the exit plan. I haven't received a response yet, but I do think that council really should make it a habit of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 inviting PEL to a caucus to get an update every year because in I think 2020 or 2021 we are either exiting from Act 47 or we are not so there is a deadline there. So next week I'll discuss it with my colleagues , but I'd like to make a motion that we officially invite them to a caucus before we take a recess for August. I also have asked for an update on the property on Wyoming Avenue for Mr. Young and, you know, I know he is extremely anxious about it and, quite frankly , I would be, too, if there was a hole in my backyard that was swallowing it up and creeping closer to my house, and I would like that update in writing because we have waited now, as somebody pointed out, for three years and that's too long. I see stories all the time on the news about some subsidences opening up and they are fixed immediately . This, I've said it once I'll say it again, this is an emergency . And if it's an emergency for one person it's an emergency for everybody because if it was in your backyard you would want it filled as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 well. So, again, I would like an update on that and I hope that the city administration and the mayor's office is moving as quickly as possible because time is of the essence . It's as been brought up in the last few weeks about the mine void under Lackawanna College, one of the buildings in downtown Scranton , so I did have the opportunity to reach out to John Pocius, our city engineer , just to get more information on that and whether an analysis would be a good idea to determine the extent to which the mine void project s have been be successful and if the city indeed needs an analysis , so I'm looking for more information from there and I'm supposed to touch base with them this Friday, so I'll update everybody on that. Last July, 2017, council passed legislation to enter a contract with Jamie Moran for the rental registration database program . I asked for an update from then business administrator Bulzoni on November 1, 2017, on that. He did give me a memo with some updates . I do have additional 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 questions being it's been a few months now, so I am going to send something to the Licensing and Inspections Department to get an update specifically on whether or not a sticker program has been implemented . Also, when Mr. Moran was here last year he talked about a tipline concept so I would like to know if those things are being put in place. I had the opportunity to attend a Plot neighborhood meeting week and there was several concerns that neighbors had so I'm just going to check through those very quickly . One of the most important ones, at the intersection of Depot Street and Riverside Drive there used to be a stop sign, a one-way sign and a do not enter sign there, but for some reason they were removed . This is an extremely dangerous area, especially with the amount of children that ride their bikes there. It's extremely narrow and it's not meant to be for two cars but in the last few months there have been two cars that have been driving by, a lot of near misses t here, so if we could please send letter or we'll get in contact with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 DPW to get these signs back up immediately . This is supposed to be a one-way and the neighbors are extremely concerned about that. Also, catch basins need to be cleaned throughout the Plot and I'm assuming also throughout the city. I get complaints were residents on East Mountain . This is a major or concern of residents in the Plot due to flooding issues. Residents would like to know what the plan is for cleaning the basins this year so if we could also ask DPW that question . Another concern , inlets are blocked at the floodgate . Residents would like to know what preventative maintenance is being done or has been done this year on the flood levies. The streetlights at the Gray Street playground are now upgraded to LED's so there is a question on the status there. Also, a house that's in disrepair in the corner of Depot and Shawnee Avenue. Also, a lot of concern about dumping in the river, different materials being dumped in the river, so once suggest ion was if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 police department could possibly put a camera on or near the levy that feeds into headquarters , there is also issues with graffiti that's on the wall there is well so that was one of the recommendation s from the neighbors . Also, if it's possible to put a sign up "This area is under surveillance ." That seemed to work in other parts of the and in the past. And then last item here, everybody 's favorite , pave cuts. A gentleman that is part of the neighborhood association sent me detailed list of some of the pave cuts throughout the Plot with pictures . Some of them are egregious ones. Amelia Avenue between East Parker Street and Finn Street. The repair was poor, resulted in more bumps, and it created a whole new issue out there. Also, Shawnee Avenue and Salem Place, this was due to a water pipe replacement , but the repairs are being conducted with little to no regard of quality or longevity, as has been discussed here quite often. This repair in particular shows the un-neatness of the larger patch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 and completely untouched at the top of the smaller patch. Also, residents in the neighborhood are compiling a list of faded street signs and stop signs that they would like replaced due to safety concerns so when I get that I will forward that to the DPW. On the issue of the nurses, as has been reported , the nurses went on strike April 25, Wednesday , and in front of the emergency room entrance at Moses Taylor Hospital and they also held a candlelight vigil at courthouse square, and there was a gentlemen here last that's was representing the nurses who spoke to city council . Unfortunately , I wasn't able to make that because of a previous engagement but I stand with the nurses in this city who in my view are being bullied by a major for profit company who is more interested in their bottom line than the safety and health of their employees and their patients . I am really concerned that Community Health Systems, which a Tennessee based parent company for the hospital is profit and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 business driven rather than patient and service driven. Money hungry corporate machines that pervert the medical profession by putting the bottom before patient care is all too prevalent through the United States and in my opinion definitely in this case. They say that money and greed is root of all each and I think in this case that is abundantly , clear. I want to read a letter from a doctor, who wants to remain anonymous for obvious reasons . Actually , it was not a letter it was a message that I received and this ties into this whole issue of the nurses' strike. Back this December of 2017, Commonwealth Health ended the teaching relationship with the Geisinger Medical School so basically all of the students in the medical school had been doing residencies and rotations at Moses Taylor and Regional Hospital . Commonwealth Health put an end to that, they ended the relationship , so the medical students can no longer step foot in their medical facilities for educational purposes , and I would like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 to take a second just to read what this doctor had sent to me. He said, "By denying medical students from the Geisinger Medical School the opportunity of rotating and learning within their facilities from willing faculty members and physicians , CHS leadership let the local future of medicine down in the only way that they possibly could. Disheartening is one word, irresponsible is another . Denying invaluable educational experiences from the members of this community who at some point may very well be taking care of these leaders , could be considered short-sided at the very best. It is a paradox which acutely hurt those who are actively trying to learn as much as possible for the sake of their future patients . That said, all is not lost in this decision to deny education . Our local leaders provided a very real and tangible lesson, at a certain point cash is always king and this principal holds true even in the context of medical education . It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 unfortunate that this lesson was introduced so abruptly . This community deserves so much better." And I would agree with that. You know, usually city council doesn't insert itself into a dispute between a company and it's employees , but in this case I think it's important because it's for the well-being and the health of all of the residents in Scranton and in Lackawanna County. I have been in touch with represent atives from the nurses' union and they are sending me a draft letter that they would like signed by city council members so I'll be introducing that next week hopefully to voice our displeasure for what is going on here. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . Just a couple of brief items, first Mr. Ellman brought up last week about possible raw sewage behind the Parker Street bridge going into the river and he did give me a picture before the meeting , so if we could send that along to the DPW just to check to see if it actually is raw sewage or if it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 storm water runoff so that's a big distinction , so we will have to check into that for you. Mr. Bolus also brought up an issue that I will discuss with Attorney Minora regarding Pods becoming structures . That's something I think we need to look into because they are throughout the city and many businesses are using these type of Pods or trailers for storage so it's something that we need to look at and what needs to applied equally on that. And, finally , I think most of my colleagues mentioned it and I mentioned this as well, a couple of weeks ago my wife and I actually moved from over on West Side to Keyser Valley, Merrifield Avenue, a couple of blocks away from Luzerne Street. I work up Saturday morning , dirty water, didn't think anything of it. I assumed there was a water man break in the neighborhood . Sure enough to find out it was because of the incident on Washburn Street with the fire department that was out there. I just want to commend our police, fire, our DPW for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 putting their lives on the line. It was a very dangerous situation . I know many of them were shot at. They did an amazing job, all of our public safety personnel , and I know I say it a lot but really do have the best police and fire protection in the city, and I know sometimes people criticize myself or others for being pro-police and fire, but they really the most important departments in our city. I'd also like to thank the directors from the Public Safety Department . I did see Chief Graziano , Chief DeSarno , Denny Gallagher and, of course, our mayor and I did talk to Mayor Courtright twice on Saturday I know he was on scene for about eight hours, so I want to thank all of them for their leadership during this terrible , terrible crisis. And that's is all. MS. REED: 5-B.

MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? If my colleagues agree, we are going to pass this through on two readings because we actually are already -- next week will already be past May 1 just so that gets pushed through and so lots of people can take advantage of that discount . MR. EVANS: I would concur with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 that, and I think people really need to know all this ordinance is doing is extending the discount period from May 1 to May 31 because the bills haven't gone out yet. My understanding is they are going out tomorrow . I've been told that over, over and over again, but I think this is the one time it's actually going to happen so that's all this legislation is doing, it does not have anything to do with the ordinance in place dealing with the fee. MR. GAUGHAN : And does anybody know why they haven't gone out on time? MR. ROGAN: I know that when we met with the administration there were a number of issues with PNC, you know, this time so that's something when that contract is up that needs to be looked at. MR. EVANS: I agree. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME.
