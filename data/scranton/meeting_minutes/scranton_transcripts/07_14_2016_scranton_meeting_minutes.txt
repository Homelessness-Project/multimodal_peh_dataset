MS.HODOWANITZ :Oh,well,that doesn'tcount.Thatwasbefore Christ wasa corporal . Ms.FRANUS:Yes.Iwouldliketo correct somethings thatwerestated at previous council meetings .IntheJuly2, 2016edition oftheScranton Times Mr.Lockwood wrote:"Onthewayoutthe doorin2013former MayorChrisDoherty and acouncil leadbyJanetEvansimplement eda 56.7percent taxincrease forthe20141 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 budget andanincrease inthetrashfeefrom $178to$300." Iwanttoexplain thetruthandI'm goingtoquoteMrs.Evansfromthatcouncil meeting December 16,2013."MRS.EVANS:I wishtomakeitclearthatIdonotsupport themayor'sproposed 2014budget nordoI support theamendment tothebudget.Inthe faceofthemostdrastic citytaxhikeand feeincrease indecades ,Iwillnotsupport theseamendments .Thesalary increases and thejobcreations theyinclude andthe gamesmanship theypresent .Inaddition ,I propose themayor'sbudget thatasacity council president Irefusetoaffixmy signature tothe2014operating budget legislation .Thepeople deserve much better." So,asyoucansee,Mrs.Evansnever wanted thatpassed.Mr.Evans,yousaidall ofthecity'sfinancial problems werea result oftheeventofdefault inJune2012. Thatwasn'tcorrect .In2011theDoherty administration wenttoCourtforofficial approval ofunfunded debtborrowing forthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 fiscal year2011because ithadnomoneyto payit's2011bills.Inaddition ,in January of2012theDoherty administration couldonlygetoneTANandFidelity Bank required thatourrealestate taxeswere confiscated eachmonthatthetaxoffice and placed inalockbox.Theinterest rateon theTANwas5.5percent .Theseareonlytwo events outofmanymorethatproves thatthe city'sdirefinancial conditions longbefore theeventofdefault ofJune2012.Ifyou haveanyquestions ,takealookatthe minutes ofJanuary 30,2012. Mr.Rogan,inthepaperitwas quoted onJuly1,cityresident ,Cara Seitzinger wasn'tsureifcouncil been-- hadbetter options aftermembers ofaprior council ,withtheexception ofthe Councilman PatRogan,allowed theParking authority todefault in2012leading tothe operating --goingintoreceivership .

Another bitofgoodnewswiththe passage ofthestate'sbudget lastweekit givesScranton anopportunity tobeinvolved inaCRIZzone.IknowCouncilman Evanshas spokenatlength aboutthisprogram,and council aboutayearagodidsendaletter toourstaterepresentatives andstate senators asking themtopushforustobe allowed togetintothisdevelopment zone. Thesezoneshavebeenverysuccessful in otherpartsofthecity--orotherpartsof thestate,andalthough wenowhave eligibility tohaveaCRIZzoneit'snota guarantee .Frommyresearch,eachyear therearetwo--uptotwomunicipalities canbeaddedtothislistandthe legislation andthebudget actually opened itforScranton ,Hazelton andalsofor Harrisburg .Sothiswasgoodinformation , itwasactually relayed tomethrough Marty Flynn'soffice whenIwasovertheretoday,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 soI'dliketothankourstaterepsand statesenators forpushing ontheinitial leveltogiveustheeligibility andIknow thereisalotmoreworktodotomakesure thatScranton isabletotakepartinthis program ifwedoreceive theapprove ,so thosewereacouple bitsofgoodnews. AndIdohaveareply,therewasan article intheScranton Times,thiswas published July9,andtheheadline was "Lackawanna Commissioner Questions Land Bank.FearsmoreSherman Hills." AndIdojustwantto--Iknow therewassomewhatofaretraction by Commissioner Cummings ofsomeofthese comments thatweremade,butIhadalotof people inquiring aboutthisissue.That headlinemention edSherman Hillssurely grabsalotofattention .Weseeallofthe crimeinWilkes-Barre,particularly inthat housing development . Despite Commissioner Cummings allegations inthisarticle ,thelandbank hasabsolutely nothing todowithlowincome developments suchastheSherman Hills1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 development .Anytypeofdevelopment of thatnature thatwouldwantbeapproved within thecityorthecounty wouldhavego through thelocalzoning boards,soif something likethatweretoproposed,which it'snotbeingproposed ,Scranton --inthe citylimits --Scranton Zoning Boardwould haveasayonwhether that'sapproved or not. Youknow,Ithought manyofthe itemsthatwerelisted inherewere completely offbase,youknow.Idoagree thatwedon'twantSherman Hillstype development within thecity,Ithink everyone certainly agrees tothat,butthe landbankisnotamechanism forthesetype ofdevelopments .It'samechanism toreduce blight andwehavetalked atlength,allof usoncouncil ,aboutthelandbankandthe county commissioners aswell.SoI'djust liketoclearthatup.

Therearesections ofthiscity,andIhave seenitformyself,thatlooklikeThird Worldcountries .It'smybelief thata saturation oftheneighbor hoodsinwhichall inspectors andmembers ofthepolice department goalongdifferent sections of eachneighborhood wouldbesuccessful and it'sbeendoneinthepast.Idon'tseeat thispointastrategic vision fromMayor Courtright oratleastastrategic method of attack totakecareofsomeofthesemajor issues throughout orneighborhood s.Ido thinkthatwedoneedtorampupthese efforts.Itwouldhavemorepowerful impact thansimply having oneinspector tryto coverawholesection ofthecityandfrom attending theseneighborhood meetings residents arebecoming increasingly frustrated thattheytakecareoftheir property andhavetolivenextto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 disgraceful conditions . Whileattending theneighborhood meeting ,theissuearoseagainabout leachaterunning through Greenridge ,andwe didreceive thememofromoursolicitor regarding that.However ,Idothinkthatno matter whatanybody saysthisissuehasto goinfrontofajudgeandhastobedecided onceandforall.Letanimpartial judge decide whether ornotthe1997agreement has beenviolated byKeystone Landfill andthe SewerAuthority .Thehealth,safety,and welfare ofthepeople ofthiscityistoo important forthisissuetogounchecked . Unfortunately ,nolegalopinion ,no judgeorjury,canmakeMayorCourtright taketheleadonthisissueandanswer the people ofGreenridge andthepeople of Scranton .Wehaveastrong mayorformof government without thestrong mayor,and that's50percent oftheproblem inmy opinion . Ialsowanted totouchoncomments thatweremadebyoneofourLackawanna County Commissioners ,Laureen Cummings ,ata1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 landbankmeeting recently .Youknow,it seemstobeafadnowingovernment tosay whatever comestoyourmindwithout researching anykindoffactsorexercising anykindofthought .Commissioner Cummings expressed heroutrageous ,ignorant fears aboutthenewlyformed landbank.Shesaid itwillbringabunchofSherman Hillsto thecounty andpeople willlosetheirhomes, andlikeMr.RoganIreceived callsabout this.I,ayearortwoago,wasonthe forefrontoftheeffort tomakesurethat thislandbankwasupandrunning .The comment thatshemadeissimply untrue, unfounded ,outrageous ,andquitefrankly ,I can'tevenbelieve itcamefromanelected official . Thelandbankisacooperative effort,between thecounty andcityandthe school district tofightblight and stabilize communities through thethroughout thecounties ,including Scranton ,whoare burdened byalargenumber ofvacant, abandoned orforeclosed properties .Iwould direct Ms.Cummings tolookathundreds of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 casestudies thathavebeencompleted across thecountry ofthissuccess oflandbanksin fighting blight andreturning vacant landto productive reuse. Herignorance onthatspecific issue isn'tevenreally whatsurprised me.Ms. Cummings madeastatement aboutlowto moderate income people intheareaby saying,andIquote,"Whydoeseverything havetobeforthem?" Thisstatement allows metoinfer thatMs.Cummings hasnoclueofthe demographics oftheCityofScranton . Almost 50percent ofthecityislowto moderate income according torecent census information .MywifeandI,manyofour friends ,wouldbeconsidered lowtomoderate income.Itakegreatoffense atthis statement andIbelieve thatCommissioner Cummings should resign andletsomeone who willworkforallofthepeople takethat seat.Shedoesn'tdeserve itaftermaking thatcomment andseveral otheroutrageous comments .
