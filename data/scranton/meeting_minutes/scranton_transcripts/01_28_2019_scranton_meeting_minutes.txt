As far as the meetings on Monday, to tell the truth, meetings are my favorite part of the week. This is the longest I get to sit down at one stretch of time ever so I have no problem with meetings . I'll actually fall on the sword a little bit, one of the reasons why we moved meetings to Monday was for my work schedule . As you know, at the time I was working in West Hazelton and the meetings were on Thursday s and it was difficult for me to get here and they asked me my day off, my one day off a week is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Monday, so that was one of the reasons why we kind of shifted them. But as far as rescheduling a meeting that falls on an off day, yeah, I never have an issue with that as long as I'm free to show up at the meeting . If it's a night I'm working , the meeting can go on I just might not be able to be there, but, you know, I'm definitely not a man that's afraid of work and, like I said, meetings are -- you know, they are one of my favorites parts of the week. Mrs. Reed, we did talk a little bit about the property on 641 Pittston Avenue. I have been dealing with the property over there for some weeks now about a damaged drain pipe and we did get a response from DPW, I forwarded that response to the property owner, and I guess where we are at right now is the property owner we are just like on-site visit with a representative from DPW who determined the cause of the problem I guess is the best way to put it and we just want to see damage, the cause of the problem , who is responsible for it, how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 it's going to be get fixed and a timeline. I'm more interested in a timeline since it is on a city street that abuts his sidewalk and what's happening now when we are having the cold and warm weather go back and forth, the drainage bleeds out into the street, runs onto Pittston Avenue and then freezes and we have that extra definitely unneeded layer of ice on the bottom of that hill crest there and it's going to definitely be an issue sooner rather than later. So if we could forward a copy of that to the DPW for a request of a representative and then if we could also send that same letter to the property owner on Pittston Avenue at the address of 2641 Pittston and that way they are both in the loop and we can definitely get them together . I have no problem being the liaison for them and getting these guys together to fix this issue, but it just can't be one of those issues this goes on. I want to get this taken care. That's really the only two things I have for you today, Mr. Rogan.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just a respond to Fay, I would be more than happy to reschedule meetings at any time. I mean, at some point, you know, in the beginning of the year it's a little different but absolutely at the end of the year when you get a Columbus Day, you know, a Veteran's Day when we have budget going on I think it's more important to schedule those so I'd be in favor of rescheduling them any time. And then in response to Joan, I'd being in favor of releasing the storm water study as soon as we receive it, and in terms of your question for PEL, I also have the same concerns , I meant to bring those up today but our meeting with PEL was cancelled today, so I will reach out to them this week. I would just like to start off by saying how extremely frustrated and fed up I am with government at all levels. We have a federal government that could be best described as dysfunctional . On the state 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 level we have a legislature that is too bloated and ineffective to get anything of substance actually done. Our county government is not only under investigation regarding the county prison, but it also lacks the quality of leadership that is desperately needed at this moment. We have a school district under investigation with a school board majority that just can't seem to get out of it's own way, and now we have a city who has a mayor who has a mayor who is apparently under FBI investigation at a time when he have much work to be done on issues such as storm water, quality of life, garbage infrastructure , economic development , just to name a few. I truly believe that the decisions we make over the next 18 to 24 months concerning those issues, and many more, will have implication s for decades to come. Now is not the time to be distract ed. A mayor cannot lead from a foxhole. The residents of this city deserve better leadership than that. So I will again call on the mayor to publically address this issue himself , not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 through his attorney . If he did not nothing wrong, he should make a statement to that effect and get to work addressing the issues that the city faces. If he did do wrong, he needs to resign before he takes this city and its residents down along with him. That's all I have tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: A couple of comments , on the Arcadis study, the plan at this point the plan at this point to have -- once the study is finished and we have a copy, obviously we want to make that copy available to the public, and then we will have probably a public caucus or a work session to really flesh out what's in the study and we could have a better conversation of what's going to happen in the future. As far as the snow removal is concerned , there is an ordinance that requires sidewalks to be cleared within 24 hours so I would like to send a letter to LIPS asking how many warnings or citations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 or tickets were issued following the last storm, if we can. I think that's important because same thing, I walk all over the city, of course, and I walk especially downtown and some of the sidewalks were atrocious , especially the ones associated with business . There is no excuse for that. It's a travesty and it should be dealt with and correct ed as best we can. This past Wednesday the county commissioners approved $160,000 contract to an environmental planning and design LLC to update the zoning code for nine municipalities that are part of the SAPA, the Scranton -Abington Planning Association , so I was a very early supporter of the SAPA concept and I continue to offer my support whenever I can and, in fact, my involvement dates back to the very beginning in 2006, so this grant will allow nine municipalities to begin the planning for nine separate zoning codes while simultaneously keeping in mind what is happening in their neighboring communities while keeping the cost well below what they would have been otherwise , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 so I would like to thank Commissioner Notarianni and Commissioner O'Malley for their "yes" votes on this contract , clearly they understand this initiatives to the SAPA municipalities and on how important is update their zoning codes. As far as the county commissioner that voted in the negative , not so much. So now this clears the way for a new zoning code in Scranton that is long overdue and extremely important in maintaining a proper safety net for our neighbor hoods as well. If done correctly , it will create an environment for growth and development within our city and we expect that to happen soon, the consultant is now hired, the money has been appropriate d and we would expect that to happen within the next few months that process getting started so I'm looking forward to it. And I would encourage once this process starts, it should be here at city council chambers at that table. I would neighborhood groups, citizens , the business community to be engaged in this process . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And that's all I have for now. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. The first thing I'd like to say is how sorry I was to hear about the passing of a police officer in the city, 16-year veteran Dan Schaufler . I didn't know police officer Schaufler , but everything that I have read about him online and I have heard about him over the last few days, he was a terrific police officer and a terrific family man, so my thoughts and my prayers go out to him and his family at this difficult time. In the caucus I brought up a few things that I'd like an update on. Number one, I'd ask that we send a letter to the mayor and to the superintendent on a shared services update. The way that we left it in the last two months we met with the mayor and the superintendent and the ball was really in their court in both administrations on whether or not to proceed with the number of initiatives that we gave them and the report that we presented to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 them so I'd like an update on where we are there. Also, I asked again for an update on the -- and I think Mrs. Hodowanitz asked as well, for an update on the Serrenti Center, how much money we have spent there, and also whether or not the city intends at this point to build a pole barn for the police department . It did mention that in the budget narrative and I'm confused as to why because as we had discussed in caucus I was under the assumption , and I think my colleagues were as well that when this council voted to acquire that piece of property up in the Hill Section it was under the guise that we were going to do that in lieu of having to build a pole barn for extra storage , so if something has changed I think we should be updated on that. Also, Mrs. Reed, I received a complaint about West Mountain Road, dangerous conditions up there, so I'll give you more details after the meeting , I have an e-mail from a gentleman . Also, East Mountain Road apparently is a mess after the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 storm still and after some flooding . We also received an issue about the Neil Armstrong school issues in the morning and after school with parking so we did forward that to Chief Graziano . As it relates to Scranton Tomorrow , Mrs. Schumacher brought that up, I do believe that Mrs. Collins was supposed to come in to give us an update on the progress of Scranton Tomorrow and I think -- yeah, we did have to reschedule her, so we could should see that within the next few weeks. Just to echo what Mr. Donahue had said about the mayor, you know, first of all let me say this again, I don't think it's right for anyone in this city to speculate on anything . I don't think it's fair to the mayor, I don't think it's fair to anybody , and I do think that we have to let the investigation run its course and the facts eventually will come out and as frustrating as it is to my colleagues and probably all of you in the city, the FBI is going to do their investigation and we will eventually know the facts and, you know, that's what I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 think I have prided myself on so far in five years on council is making a determination once you have seen all of the facts. Again, I only think that that is fair to the mayor, to his family. If the mayor didn't do anything wrong, great. If he did do something wrong, then it will be dealt with in the appropriate fashion . I do think though that we need to hear from the mayor, not just through his attorney but from him because I don't think, as Mr. Donahue alluded to, I don't think we can sit up here and pretend that this whole thing isn't effecting the operation of the city. We can't just sit up here for I don't know how long this is going to go on for, but we can't just pretend it's not effecting business . Somebody brought up PEL and whether it affects the credit rating, so I do think that if the mayor didn't do anything wrong then he should address the public and should address council and just be upfront about the whole situation . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 couple of items, last week a resident spoke regarding a handicapped sign on East Mountain and I just want to thank Chief Graziano for sending a very lengthy reply. If we can forward that to the resident that came, there is pictures included as well and very important to hear both sides of the story. You know, we can tell by the pictures provided here why this handicapped sign was denied, so I want to thank Chief Graziano for his lengthy explanation of that situation and we'll forward that reply along to the resident as well. Sticking to signage issues, I was contacted by a new business that's moving into the city regarding a 15-minute parking spot for in front of their business . I will send that address along to our city clerk, but they asked a question and I don't think anyone has ever given an answer on this where some of the signs in front of businesses will say "15 minute bank parking only" or "15 minute parking for this business ." They wanted to know what the requirements were to have a busines s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 specific 15 minute parking sign or just a general 15 minute parking sign and I think that's something , especially that we see a lot of growth in particularly smaller businesses in our downtown , it's a request that we are going to hear more and more over the coming months. And, finally , just one quick comment , not something I typically bring up at council meetings , but I have been on council for nine years and part of being a council member whether you like it or not is dealing with the media, and I just wanted to give a thank you out to Eric Deabill who is moving on from WYOU. He has covered city council I think since I was first elected . I have done a number of interviews with him and he has always been nothing but fair. Gave great coverage to what was going on in our meeting , as is all the TV media in our area, but I just want to give him a thank you for all his great work and a congratulations and we wish him well in his new position . That's all. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING A “NO PARKING ” ZONE ALONG THE SOUTHERLY SIDE OF LACKAWANNA AND JEFFERSON AVENUE (S.R.3018) FROM SEGMENT 0010 OFFSET 0300 (KRESSLER COURT INTERSECTION ) EXTENDING NORTH TO A DRIVEWAY , AT SEGMENT 0010 OFFSET 0630. MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. EVANS: On the question , this request to create a 300 foot no parking zone in downtown Scranton because of a driveway adjustment for a project that, quite frankly , should have been never been approved boy the zoning board in the first place is concerning at the very least. This PennDOT regulation driven approved design which seems to be another case of applying highway design standards on our local streets , is another example , in my opinion , of wrong headed public policy. We should not be eliminating on-street parking in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 downtown. We should be adding on-street parking at every opportunity . Time and again additional on-street parking have proven to make our streets more walkable , increase commerce and are simply safer. So I'll vote to move this forward tonight but I'm requesting that we send a letter to the engineering firm responsible for this design and PennDOT to come before city council prior to the final vote to explain the rationale of this proposal prior to adoption , and while they are here maybe they could be prepared to discuss real solutions for the intersection of Pittston Avenue and Orchard Street, a request made by Councilman Donahue that has gone unanswered to date. It's time that we don't continually rubber stamp these type of ordinances , and we look at different type of designs and have a different kind of dialogue with PennDOT on a going forward basis. I understand it's a state highway , but it's also a city street and it's also our downtown . Some of these rules are absolutely ludicrous , so hopefully we can begin this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 dialogue and start to come to some common sense approaches to these type of projects in the downtown and in our neighbor hoods for that matter, so that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. PERRY: Yeah, I'll just follow-up Mr. Evans' sentiments on that, I know we ran into an issue a couple of years ago, I think it was about a driveway installation and it was happened to end out on the PennDOT road and it's, unfortunately , one of those PennDOT rules that it's a blanket rule. It doesn't matter where it is or who owns it, if a driveway extends into a state street it's a 300-feet buffer no parking zone, and I really think, like Mr. Evans point, it needs to be looked at on a site by site basis. I know the reasoning we got last time was for liability reasons . If they had to make an adjustment to it and they moved into 100 feet or 200 feet and someone got hit pulling out of that driveway and was obstructed by parked cars, the state was not going to be liable for putting a variance to that 300-foot no parking zone, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 but I do think it should be on a case by case study because it is downtown and there is parking that we are going to lose for which if you don't have the parking you don't have the people, if you don't have the people you don't have the revenue , so I agree wholeheartedly with your statement , Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ?

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AMENDING RESOLUTION NO. 86, 2018 ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BY AND BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND LOCAL UNION NO. 60 OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE FIGHTERS , AFL-CIO”; TO INCLUDE ONLY THE IME PANEL OF PHYSICIANS FOR DISABILITY PENSIONS . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I brought this up in caucus, I think we will need clarification on this piece of legislation for a number of different reasons : First, it says, "Whereas the modified duties, sick time reimbursement , E MT/EMR paramedic nurse certification as contained in the memorandum of understanding attached to Resolution No. 86, 2018, which we voted on I believe in December of 2018, was not approved by the bargaining union members . So the way that I'm reading that is what we had originally voted on in 2018, the modified duty, sick time reimbursement , paramedic nurse certification , the fire union did not end up voting on that so it's not part of the deal, so I'd like to know why they didn't vote on that and get clarification from the administration . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor Signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR.

PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , all of those amendments that Mr. Evans just made were basically to clean up some of the language , nothing major was changed at all. I'd like to thank the city solicitor for her help. When the administration had reviewed the legislation our solicitor , Mr. Minora, Mrs. Eskra and the council for the police union got together to change some of the language so that's it. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor of the motion to amend 7-A signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A as amended . MR. EVANS: Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I won't, you know, dwell too much on this because I think I talked about it the last three or four weeks, but it's my belief that every city should have a strong code of ethics and an Ethics Board that is relevant and active, which I don't believe this board was over the last few years and I don't know believe that that was the case. I do think that this is a step in the right direction . I think we have received every indication from the administration that they are on board with this and they are going to implement it. I know that once this is passed, we've -- council has discussed soliciting applications for the two appointments that we will get to the Board of Ethics and then it would be my recommendation to interviews those applicants and then make a decision and I would hope the same would be done by the mayor and the city control ler who would also get one appointment because I do think these appointments are extremely important . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 This is meant basically as a guide for city employees and public officials . You know, I have heard a lot of talk over the last few weeks that, you know, this Code of Ethics is -- you know, it's something -- people don't understand it. They think that council is going to be implementing this. This legislation that we are passing is just updating the Code of Ethics and making the board relevant again, so when this is passed it will be the prerogative and up to the administration to implement this and then when the Board of Ethics takes -- when they take their seats then it will be on them to implement and follow this code and follow the legislation so I hope everyone understand s that. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: On the question just briefly , it should be noted that this legislation is not a reaction to the recent events in any way. It was actually a proactive initiative by this city council before any of the recent events took place, and I think that's important for people to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 know that. This was in the pipeline long before these events unfolded so I think that's important . MR. GAUGHAN : The other thing I do want to mention , too, on top of that, you know, one of the things within this code that I think is important is the ability for a city employee or a public official to get an advisory opinion , so if someone thinks that there may be the appearance of impropriety they have the ability to go to the Board of Ethics and get an opinion from the board and if they get an opinion that's favorable they can move forward. If it's not favorable , they can't, and that's what I would recommend . If you think just the appearance of impropriety take the extra step, use this board and get an advisory opinion and that's one of the main reasons that we have needed to update this. Update the language and make sure that the board is relevant . As I mentioned two or three weeks ago, I had asked the administration why the appointments had expired and I don't know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the last time that the board had met. This new code makes it mandatory that they meet at least once a year to reorganize , vote on a chairperson and a vice-chairperson. So is it perfect ? Probably not, but I think it's a good start. Thank you. MR. PERRY: And on the question , I just want to -- I mean, obviously I'm whole-heartedly for it, it's a great code, it's a much needed update, I think personally , I'm sure some of you guys are getting this, too, I'm getting a lot of people interested in the board and the process for getting on the board. I know we even had a speaker here a couple of weeks ago interested in it, and I believe , I don't think I'm speaking out of school, but the council gets two picks for this board and we will be going through a full application process with interviews and that will be how we select our two. We don't have anything definitive yet, but I think what we have been talking about and it's fair to say that will be the process of how this council will choose our two board appointees . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR.

PERRY: As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. PERRY: Yes, just briefly on the question , I don't think I brought this up while we with in -- while this legislation was in Fifth Order but just to give a little explanation on this, this comes from obviously a contract between us and the Turnpike Commission , and I'll just read two quick paragraphs here that kind of sum up what this is about. The commission desires for us to provide fire protection and rescue services for customers using the Pennsylvania Turnpike system and their commissioner buildings and other property from mile post 1-124.3 to mile post A-120.6 southbound , from mile post A-124 1/2 to A-130.6 northbound and that is, again, on 476. There is going to be I believe it's $250 per occurrence and there is also going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 to be a $1,000 yearly fee paid to the city and this contract will be re-upped every year, as needed. Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES – FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 93, 2019 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BY AND BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND LODGE NO. 2 OF THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE WHEREBY THE POLICE CHIEF, IN HIS DISCRETION , MAY OFFER TERI ASSIGNMENTS TO OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED OR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 SUFFER FROM A TERMINAL HEALTH CONDITION . MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I think Mrs. Schumacher had a question about this. I just want to read from the MOU really quick. It says, "Police officers sometimes encounter terminal health conditions including but not limited to cancer that impact their ability to perform all the tasks of their job, and although these police officers are not totally incapacitated they are nevertheless compelled to exhaust sick leave because of the lack of suitable duties for them to perform and this additional stress creates and undue hardship for police officers who are already dealing with significant health issues." So the way that I'm reading this is they will create like a modified duty position for a police officer who may have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 terminal illness , and quite frankly , I think this is a good thing. We should be trying to do everything we can. You know, if any city employee gets a terminal illness we should be trying to help them, and I think the police department is trying to do this with this piece of legislation so I'm in favor of it. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Just to add to that, not only is it the right thing to do for a police officer that may have a health condition but also it makes more sense for the city. Instead of an officer being on a disability pension they will be working and doing a light duty capacity so it does work out for both parties as well. MR. GAUGHAN : I do want to add terminal health condition is defined in the legislation as a general ly active and progressive illness for which there is no cure and the prognosis is fatal. Further , an irreversible illness that without life sustaining procedures will result in death in the near future or a state of permanent unconsciousness from which the recover is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 unlikely and it gives some examples , advanced cancer, types of head injuries , multiple organ failure syndrome .
