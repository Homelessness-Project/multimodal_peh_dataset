MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially our Solicitor Kevin Hayes's aunt, Ann Corbett who tragically passed away this past weekend . Ann was a resident of Minooka , a veteran of the United States Air Force Nurse Corps who served her country honorably in Vietnam . She had a 45-year career in nursing . She was a friend to all who knew her and she will be deeply missed. Let us also take a moment of silence for all of the people in our community , our country and world who have passed away from the coronavirus . This pandemic has turned our world upsidedown . But we must remain hopeful and strong.

FUEL CARD ANALYSIS RECEIVED FROM OFFICE OF THE CITY CONTROLLER FOR THE PERIOD NOVEMBER 24 THROUGH DECEMBER 23, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few. First, I wanted to, you know, mention that it is Black History Month. And so there's a lot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 of celebrations going on. And it's a great time to just become more educated and learn more about black history . And one of our local organizations the Black Scranton Project is going to be hosting a flag raising ceremony this Saturday . It's going to be outside on the steps of City Hall. It's going to be the Pan-African flag that they are raising . And that's going to take place at 12:00 so if anyone is interested in going to that. Social distancing and masks will be a definite there. And they also have other events going on online and virtual events for the course of Black History Month. So if you check it out their Facebook page or their website for the Black Scranton Project , you'll find some of those if you're interested in any of them. And then the other event that's coming up this weekend I wanted to mention is the Scranton Ice Festival . And I brought that up just probably like a week or two ago when they had announced it. And that's going to take place from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 February 5th through the 7th. So that's Friday through Sunday. And there's going to be ice sculptures throughout downtown . And I think it will just be a good chance for people to be outside and walk through downtown and, you know, maybe go to some of the businesses in downtown while they're out there. So we have those two things coming up that I wanted to make sure the public was aware of. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have -- MR. DONAHUE : I just have -- I just have one just because of the snowstorm , garbage will be a day behind this week for the remainder of the week. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? All right. Mrs. Reed, Citizens Participation . MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Brian Grassi, Fay Franus, and Norma Jeffries .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Brian Grassi as follows : I have e-mailed city council and they have not received any response . Can you please get answers on following concerns . 1. New Jersey central building . Who owns it and are taxes current ? City few years ago gave I believe $25000.00 for roof and building was to be developed . Roof went on and nothing ever developed . Building is historical and can be put to a lot of good use. It can be used as grocery store and apartments . This building is the gateway into down town Scranton . Needs to be developed . 2. Building in the 500 block of Lackawanna Ave next to Bouna pizza. They I believe were given money for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 sidewalks and was suppose to develop building . It has never been developed even though they received sidewalks Who owns it and are taxes up to date. 3. Vine street station . A few years ago the building was damaged and gas station closed. Has the gas been removed from tanks and are tanks still in ground? Who owns it and are taxes being paid. 4. Gas station next to Chicks dinner. Been closed for years. Is there gas in ground there? Are tanks in ground . Who owns it and are taxes being paid. 5. House on the corner of Pine street and Wheeler Ave. House was on fire a few years ago. Who owns house and are taxes being paid? House needs to be fixed or taken down. 6. House on the corner of Wheeler and olive street. House has been vacant for years. House is boarded up and is beginning to deteriorate . You can see chimney needs repair and roof needs repair. Who owns house and are taxes up to date. Please make these part of city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 council minutes and e-mail me responses . MS. REED: The second submission is from Fay Franus as follows : Council , In 1995 while many of you were young teens I was 51 years old and I fought hard to get an ordinance /law passed banning trucks over ten ton in all of Bellevue because it is a mine cave area. Subsequent to the passing of this ordinance every street coming into Bellevue was posted ; "Trucks Over Ten Ton Gross Weight Prohibited " You have seen the photos of the sign. On the South Elm Street entrance to Bellevue the sign going over the bridge was changed from 10 ton to allow 18 ton weight . I have asked numerous times via council via the police chief --no one can tell me who authorized that sign to be changed to allow DeNaples trucks to carry more weight than allowed by law. I am 76 now and to this day--- 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 years later maybe 3 trucks were stopped . Essentially no action by the city. Mayor Cognetti has the maps of Bellevue --- the petitions and the ordinance from 1995. Bill Gaughan met at my home with my neighbors to address this issue. I want to refresh your memory please. My garage caved in. The department of mining had to fill it in with concrete . The house that was behind me on 5th Avenue is gone--caved in--now just grass. The house 2 doors down from me- the front sidewalk caved in-- also 5 doors down their kitchen caved in. Please listen closely to what I am about to say. There is a business run by Louis DeNaples on South Elm Street. At this time of year it is primarily salt to treat roads that is being delivered to customers with 3 axle trucks --probably weighing 20 ton----- 11 tons overweight . The South Elm Street bridge entering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Bellevue has been closed to trucks. Overweight trucks undoubtedly contributed to this restriction . This bridge may not be repaired for up to four years. So what do they do------ these 3 axle trucks go over 3rd Avenue, over 100 trucks a day causing the residents to be upset and make an appeal to the city for relief. The city using the argument to the resident of 3rd Avenue that there was no sign posted on 3rd avenue prohibiting trucks over ten ton. However all streets taking you to 3rd Avenue entering Bellevue are posted so there is no need to have a sign on 3rd Avenue because the trucks have already broken the law by taking a street that is posted coming into Bellevue thus they would never be near 3rd Avenue if they obeyed the law. Not only are there hundred and more trucks going down 3rd Avenue they are then turning right and going over the bridge on Broadway which is posted " Trucks over Ton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 gross weight Prohibited " Allowing over weight vehicles to use this bridge will shorten the life of the bridge. Remember this we the people of Bellevue obey the laws. Every truck that goes down 3rd Aveue ---South Elm Street ---Broadway and Railroad Avenue are breaking the law. Failure to enforce this law could increase the number of mine cave ins and the resident 's safety. Perhaps a solution would be for the city engineer to go to the back of Walmart on South Main Avenue in Taylor and look down to see how far DeNaples business operation goes. IT runs past Walmart towards Taylor Why can't DeNaples build a road to the railroad Tracks then continue the road on the other side of the tracks to get out to South Main Avenue. That is his problem not the people in Bellevue 's problem . It is DeNaples responsibility to obey the laws especially if he is endangering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 the lives of the people of Bellevue and possibly burdening the taxpayers with unnecessary capital cost. This also goes for the Tractor trailers going down Railroad Avenue. Three cars were totaled in less than 2 years on my block alone, mine included . This street is way to narrow for cars let alone trucks. BELLEVUE is a cave area-- NO TRUCKS OVER TEN TON. Clarks Summit got thousands of dollars from citations for overweight trucks on State Street. I do believe we are owed some help in enforcing this law that was passed 25 years ago. I also believe we have a pretty clear cut case for a lawsuit if this continues . (Photo was attached .) MS. REED: The third and final submission is from Miss Norma Jeffries as follows : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 First to Councilman Gaughan , I count it such a pleasure to have gotten to know you since my return to Scranton . Your concern for the city was above and beyond. Each e-mail or telephone call was addressed and was very much appreciated . I am sure our paths will cross again someplace along the way. Thank You Councilman Gaughan for a job well done! My concerns tonight are two fold: 1) Street Signs. Over the past 3 years, the Scranton Street signs has been a concern . Not only for me, but also city residence . As I previously stated, returning to Scranton , after 37 years resulted in getting lost trying to maneuver myself through Scranton . As a result, it was good to hear that KS Engineers was paid $270,000 to provide a database of the missing or poor condition of the street signs. Also, beginning in January ,2020, $2,600 is being billed for the maintenance of the database . Since most of the city hall employees were working at home during 2020, is the city still billed for that maintenance fee. I know that there is only 1.5 staff to oversee 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 and work in this department , therefore , is the database being of much use to the city. Is the data base being reviewed and are some of the neglected signs being replaced ? At a recent Town Hall meeting , the Mayor mentioned the condition of our street signs. So along with the painting of the crosswalks , can the replacement of old or damaged street signs be accomplished at the same time. Maybe it is a different department , but hopefully an update can be provided to let us know the status. With all the attention that our city is receiving since President Biden is our President , let's help him along by getting our street signs in a better condition for visitors coming to town. 2) Walkability Study: Can a report be given of the status of this study. With the Pandemic , walking and getting fresh air is a priority . I began to wonder what happened to that study. I know that previously , this study was a priority and everyone seemed so enthusiastic about how the city would benefit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 from this study. Can someone address these two projects for me and the citizens of Scranton . (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that concludes the Citizens Participation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? On the question , I'll start with Mr. Grassi's questions . So we did submit and Mr. Grassi did reach out to me previous to this. And I did submit his questions to the administration because I honestly don't know who owns that New Jersey Central building or that -- the building in the 500 block of Lackawanna Ave., next in Buona Pizza. And there's other questions here. We did submit these again. And we will check back next week. And we'll make sure that these questions are answered for him. The second thing, Mrs. Franus's comment s about Third Avenue, I did exchange a message with the Mayor about the issues on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Third Avenue. And we are scheduled -- are going to be scheduled to speak about that letter. That's on our agenda tonight . I'll keep everybody updated on that. And finally , Miss Jeffries ' questions about the street signs and the walkability study. With the street signs, Council a few months ago voted to approve a grant application I believe for the replacement of all of the street signs in the City that are damaged or faded and need to be replaced. I can't remember the exact amount of street signs. But it was a sizeable amount. It was a significant amount. So we will double-check on where the City is at with that grant. I'm not sure if it was awarded. We haven't been notified about that yet. The second thing Mrs. Jeffries mentioned in her comments was the -- about the maintenance fee for the database . The software that the City has now that tracks all of the signs that are replaced which Council asked a few years ago. As far as I know, in fact, I'm almost positive that the DPW staff, the DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 workers did not work from home. You know, they can't work from home just the nature of their position . And we did -- the City did -- I don't know if they hired the person yet. But they did put in an extra traffic sign person in the 2021 budget. Se we'll double-check if that position has been filled yet. MR. DONAHUE : I think there was two positions there, Bill, wasn't there? MR. GAUGHAN : I'm not -- I thought it was one but I could be wrong. I'll double-check on that. But the database I know is reviewed. We could ask Director Preambo for an update on that. I just think it's -- it made the -- made the City more efficient in regards to replacing the street signs. I think the administration is taking the right path here and the DPW in terms of applying for that grant to replace all the street signs that are damaged or faded. And there's a lot of them, especially up in the Hill sections . I know that Mrs. Jeffries has been really kind of leading the charge here for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 last few years and coming to Council and making that a point. So I appreciate that. So we'll get an update for Mrs. Jeffries on that. And the second thing about the walkability study, we will ask for an update on that. I thought that that was kind of put on the back burner from what I remember . And the reason that the Mayor and OECD gave at that time was because of the pandemic . But we just can double-check and refresh our memories on that. And also, I want to thank Mrs. Jeffries for her kind words in the beginning of her comment s. Hopefully we will cross paths again. You know, this is the last place that any of us want to be looking on a computer screen and not being in Council Chambers . And, you know, being on Council for seven -- almost eight years now we get to know the people who come regularly to the Council meeting s. And many of them are friends because we see them every week. And I personally appreciate the fact that those concerned residents like Mrs. Jeffries show up almost weekly with their concerns .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 They pay attention to the agenda. They pay attention to what's going on in the City. And just as Council 's a check on the Mayor and her administration , Mrs. Jeffries and others who come to the meetings are a check on the Council . And that's a good thing. And they keep us on our toes and they do a really wonderful job. So I want to thank her for that. And hopefully , you know, I think we're all praying that we can get back in Council Chambers as quickly as possible and see each other in the flesh again. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. SCHUSTER : You know, while the Meadowbrook Project is fresh on our minds, can we have Lori send correspondence over to the administration about when they are going to release the contractor to take a look at those four properties there along Wyoming Avenue? I know they have -- it's been filled in with gravel and that. But I think there's some repaving and regrading that needs to be done to those properties . MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do have some comment s or an update, I should say. I'm happy to report an update on the Hometown Heros Banner Program initiative I brought forth a few months ago in Council . Through collaboration with Todd Pousley from NeighborW orks of Northeastern Pennsylvania and Leadership Lackawanna , which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 has decided to take this as -- on as one of their core projects for the year. So with regards to that, they accepted or approved this as a project . They will do a lot of groundwork for us. They do a great job. They do fund-raising . I know my daughter was involved in a project last year with a park. So they'll have people dedicated to this which will be great. Also, we're starting to get this project off the ground. Todd Pousley will be the liaison between Leadership Lackawanna and then our committee . Our committee meaning to include myself, Council -- Chris Smith being our City Hall point person. Robert DeLuca who is a West Scranton High School principal and a veteran along with Jim Kuchwara and his team from the American Legion Post 25. I also see this committee expanding and this project expanding and being embraced by everyone in the City. So once we have some meeting s are set up, of course, I'll get -- you know, I'll provide updates . Also Mary Ellen McDonough reached out to me from the Minooka 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 part -- section of town. And they're very interested over there. So this will be another group that will jump in on this. So it's just in the beginning stages. We'll start having meeting s. Like I said, I'll update everybody and I'll see this project through . Thank you. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . It's a great project and thanks for taking the lead on it. Very good. MR. MCANDREW : Sure. MR. GAUGHAN : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No motions or comments tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : The only thing I have tonight is something I brought up in caucus before. But Miss Reed was going to send a request for an update on 2208 Prospect Avenue. There's been some complaints from neighbors . And I know it was sort of working through the process with Licensing and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Inspections . We sent a request out a couple weeks ago. I haven't received anything back. So I know she resent that already actually . Also, Mrs. Reed, would we be able to get an update or would you be able to request an update from the administration on where they're at in terms of hiring a zoning officer ? I know Don King the City Planner sort of been doing double-duty there for well over a year now. So just see where they're at there. I know that's an important position and it becomes even more important as we move into spring. That's all I have tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Just a few comment s. And most of these I covered in the caucus. But I'm going to ask for the following updates , number one, I would like an update from the Mayor and the administration on the conversion from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to the Payroll Preparation Tax. It's been a few weeks since we've heard any sort of update on that. And every day that goes by is a day that we're losing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 because this has to be done before the City exits Act 47. So I'd like to know what the plan is moving forward , you know. This is something that was approved by the voters of the City of Scranton overwhelmingly . The Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax is despised amongst the business community . It hurts our businesses . It's a very regressive tax. And it's clear, you know, where the people want the City to move. It's just taking much longer I think than anyone expected . So I'd like an update on that. Also an update from the Mayor -- MR. MCANDREW : Can I just jump in on that too also? I mean, the reason for the extension of Act 47 was to implement this. So, I'm sorry, I just wanted to throw that out there -- one the main reasons . MR. GAUGHAN : Also I'd like to ask for an update on the recycling . We had received a memo. It was in Third Order a few weeks ago about the recycling -- recycling in the City. An RFP was issued. And both of the -- I think both of the bidders were denied. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 So I'd like an update on that, also an update on the delinquent refuse RFP that was out. They chose Portnoff . We went back and forth with the administration on that and gave our thoughts and changes to the legislation . And we have not really heard anything on that yet. So I'd like an update on that. And also, two weeks ago I had submitted questions regarding an update on the Act 47 recommendations . So I'd like to just to see where we are with that. Also in the caucus, I brought up the fact that we do have an acting Police Chief. The Police Chief was -- we passed legislation in September to hire Leonard Namiotka as the acting Police Chief or interim Police Chief as they called it. So I'd like an update on when we're actually going to get legislation for a Police Chief that doesn't have that title because there's issues I think with the administrative code as Solicitor Hayes pointed out a few weeks ago. We also talked about the Ethics Board appointment . So Council does have one appointment left. And we did receive one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 resume and letter of interest from Dave Falchek . We did not receive any others so we are going to draft legislation to appoint Mr. Falchek . And that should be on the agenda within the next week or two. Also, just to end with some good news, there was an article today in the newspaper and a study was done on Realtor dot com nationally and Scranton received recognition as the third best place in the country to work remotely . And I thought that was some really good positive news for the City. So I think it's something that in spite of all of the negative things that are going and different things with the pandemic , it's something I think the City can hang their hat on moving forward . And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I should have brought this up when Director Donahue -- Councilman Donahue brought up the DPW garbage collection . Do we know if all of the new 2021 schedules have gone out to the residents ? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know. MR. SCHUSTER : I know I received 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 mine. But I did get a few calls asking if the schedule s went out that some resident s didn't receive them. So if that's something else maybe we could look into or have Lori look into. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? Okay. Thank you. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON CREATING AN AD HOC COMMITTEE TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY OF RENAMING WYOMING AVENUE OR ANOTHER PROMINENT ROADWAY IN HONOR OF UNITED STATES PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , as I mentioned last week, we're going to form this committee and look at what the process is for renaming a street in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 City of Scranton . It's, you know, doesn't come along often that you have a President of the United States who was born in your City. And I think that's something that we should all take a lot of pride in. And I think the vast majority of Scrantonians do take a lot of pride in that the fact that we have someone who was born here and raised here for the first 10 years of his life and who always came back here and never forgot the City of Scranton . And as I mentioned last week, the eyes of not only the country but the whole entire world had been on Scranton because of Joe Biden. And it's been really tremendously positive for us. So whether you're a Democrat , Republican , Independent , party affiliation doesn't matter here. It's about honoring the fact that this person made it all the way to the highest office in the land. And it's an extremely , extremely positive thing for the City. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR.

And it's just been really difficult 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 on people. And the $300 garbage fee as all of us know is a significant amount.

MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Roll call, please. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry, I have something on the question . I'm sorry. Of course, I understand all -- we talked about this in caucus last week. I understand the legal ramifications of this. But, you know, if a yes vote doesn't feel good to me then it's a no vote. This is a personal thing. But, you know, this resolution is based on the ordinance that we're changing the language because of language . But we could still implement this ordinance based on other language . And it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 clear that the language is the "F" word. Since last meeting I spoke to a couple of Hispanic people. And they said that's it. So I didn't have to Google it. They said that's what it refers to. And I'll give you an example , say if I retire tomorrow and moved over to Hungry and the word cookie over in Hungry means male pieces -- or genital ia. I'm not going to open a bakery and call it Mark's Cookies over there just out of courtesy . So, you know, I know there's freedom of speech and self expression and I'm all for that. I just want to know where we're going with this moving forward that we're taking stuff out of our ordinance s and now we'll pick and choose what's offensive . And there will be an argument all the time. So like I said, I own my own vote. This is my personal thing. So I'll be voting no. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? I'm going to be voting yes for this settlement agreement for the simple fact that based on the opinion that was presented by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 Solicitor O'Brien and then the concurrence from Solicitor Hayes, if we don't accept the settlement agreement if Council does not accept it, then we are most likely going to lose the case against the ACLU which would cost the City a significant amount of money. And the example that was given by Solicitor O'Brien was the case -- somewhat similar case between Colts and the ACLU and they ended up having to shell out close to $400,000. So to me this comes down to dollars and cents. Based on everything that I've read, the City ends up losing the case, the only people that make out in the end are attorneys from the ACLU. So I'm going to be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS.
