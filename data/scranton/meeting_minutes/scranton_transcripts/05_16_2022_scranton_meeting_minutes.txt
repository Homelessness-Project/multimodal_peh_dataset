MURRAY. 3-D. CORRESPONDENCE FROM OECD RECEIVED MAY 12, 2022 REGARDING CUMULATIVE LICENSES /PERMITS REPORT. 3-E. CITY COUNCIL REQUEST LOG UPDATED MAY 13, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I just want to say, well, last week I announce d the Touch a Truck event at Nay Aug Park that was hosted by the Junior League of Scranton . I just want to report -- I'd like to report out that it was a success . It was a great turnout at the park. My grandson Kilian had blast, especially with the fire trucks. So well done, Junior League of Scranton . That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : My daughter Maggie also had a blast. Any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. KING: Just kudos to our DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 members that were up there. They assisted with that along with the Rec Authority for the continued work they do up at the Nay Aug Park. I know that Bob Gattens and his group of volunteers set up the stage at Nay Aug and they began with the concert on Sunday. I think they had the Luongo Brothers playing up there. So it's nice to get some music back in the park and nice that we're having events like Touch a Truck. And we're getting more people out to our city parks. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have announcements ? MR. KING: Are you going to announce this? MR. DONAHUE : You can announce it. Go ahead. MR. KING: Okay, if I can announce it, get your booster . COVID vaccine clinic is going to be held May 24th between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., at 1801 Pine Street, Scranton . It's the old Army Reserve Center. So that's now authorized the second booster for 50 and over and first booster for 5 and over. And it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 available all doses of Pfizer and Moderna . And walk-ins are welcome . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Any other Council members have announcements ? I just have a couple. Again, the Scranton /Dunmore Fraternal Order of Police will be holding Heros Helping Heros golf tournament on Monday, June 6th at Mount Airy Lodge and Resort. All proceeds benefit the Gino Merli Veteran 's Center Resident Welfare Fund. The Resident Welfare Fund is used solely for the residents of the Gino Merli Veteran 's Center. If anyone has any questions or needs further information about the golf tournament , contact Gino Merli Volunteer Services Resource Coordinator , Janus McAllister at 570-961-4380. And also, we got an e-mail late this afternoon from the Mayor since the Lackawanna County is back in a high transmission classification by the CDC, masks will be required in City Hall beginning Wednesday . So we will also follow that directive for next week and also require masks at our Council meeting s while the CDC has Lackawanna County in a high transmission classification . That's all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Well, what's the status of the union contract negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they're still under negotiation . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I didn't see any information in Third Order on the number of meeting s that have taken place. So what I've done last week, I sent in my own Right-To-Know request . We'll see which once of us gets the information first. You may think it's silly that I keep ask asking about it. But I'm hear to tell you I Googled the Clerical Union's contract because the current one is not on the City's website even though it was signed in March of 2021, hint, hint. And they got a three-year contract and a 2 percent pay raise each year. But you got to be smoking dope if you think that the police, firefighter s, and DPW are going to settle for 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 percent with the current spike of inflation . They're not. And they go to arbitration and, you know, they are going to win. So whatcha got to think about is, whatever pay raises they do get are going to be retroactive to January 1st. And then think about Gerald Cross and his words of wisdom when he recommended taking the City out of Act 47 distress status. He projected that by 2026 the City would have to raise property taxes by a minimum of 26 percent . That was without factoring in a substantial increase in salaries and wages for these unions, not that they don't deserve it. But it has to do with planning for the financial impact. You need to look at that very closely . Speaking of looking at things closely , I saw the RFQ that was in the paper on May 12th for a special labor Council . Now, the bids are due by 10 a.m. on May 31st at which time they will be opened in this chamber . But it's kind of strange because they're all going to be done totally digitally . Go to the controller and the public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 can view them on YouTube . So if I walk up here, will I be seeing a paper in City Council Chambers at 10 a.m.? MR. DONAHUE : I'll check with the Controller 's Office to see how they -- that's the new procurement software we just approved , what was it, a month and a half ago? MS. HODOWANITZ : So I'd like to know because , you know, they should be available for review by the public. And, you know, I don't go to the library and go on YouTube . But there's a lot of people that don't have the internet . So when you think about, you know, put a paper copy on the City Clerk's desk or something or a paper copy in the library . Those are things to think about. Any information -- are you working hard on the audit which is due on May 31st according to the Home Rule Charter ? Has Kohanski said anything about a projected delivery date? MR. DONAHUE : We haven't got an update. But I'll see what -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, last time they said September 30th. You know how well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 that worked out. I saw on 5-D the one month, one-time waiver of the interest and penalties for the initial Payroll Preparation Tax returns . And I said to myself, Gee, haven't we been talking about that for, like, two or three years? You can't surprised . But I said, oh, okay, so maybe, you know, maybe it's complicated paperwork and complicated return. And then I read the backup, and it said financial impact cost is negligible . So why do we even need to do it. But so be it. Hopefully it will be a one time, one-month waiver. And the only other thing I'd like to say -- well, two things. I hope everybody will go out and vote tomorrow morning . And after you vote head on over to the steam -- Marketplace at Steamtown for the Scranton Public Library book sale which is running from tomorrow through Sunday. You could get books and CDs and DVDs and all kinds of wonderful things for just one or two dollars . And on the weekend , buy a five dollar tote bag and everything you stuff in it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 is free. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening Council . You know, almost daily our leftist newspaper is printing all of these letters . They're always adverse against Trump and the Republicans . And when I write a letter it sits there for months. I phoned Mr. Harrity I think his name is. But these letters from Sandra Myers Moxley, they're just printed as soon as they hit -- the next day they'll be talking about something the day before. Instead of these people just -- they don't want to see this country come back together . It's a -- they want to incite. They want things like they are. That's why we have tragedies . It's all over. There's young people seem to make heros out of the wrong ones. Well, I made it a week without my car getting keyed. So I assumed that my opposition to free abortions for life was acceptable. Pretty soon they'll start reaping the harvest from all the two weeks that daddy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 sends his little girls down to Fort Lauderdale for two weeks' vacation . These murder bills, they're just such a terrible thing. Last week I complained about my bills were 1,800 or something more than last year. You won't believe this. Between last week and this week the gas company raised it 3 more dollars on me. The month before I paid $80 dollars . This month -- well, next month they want 123. This is extra. You're talking about a fortune . You guys are going to pay all of this extra for the utilities . Everybody listening out here, this is a gigantic difference . This is over a thousand dollars extra out of our pocket that we had last year to spend on things. I watched this commercial from Mr. Shapiro bad mouthing the Republican administration before him. And he says he's the alternative . This is what he thinks is good what's happening in this country the past year? Today I got four and a half gallons of gas for $20 at Sheetz. I used to get $20 and it wouldn't even take $20 most of the time I went a year ago. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 And I think Shapiro and Fetterman -- I like Fetterman but I'm not going to vote for him. I think they're just going to carry on the policies of Wolf's administration which is shattering the people of this state. He's destroyed so many lives of people and businesses . You know, I've dug into my savings and I could afford a lot of things. But I'm holding off. I've been thinking pretty strongly about getting another car. But I keep spending money on this one to see what's going to happen. And things keep getting worse. I want to spend some money on my house. I phoned a couple people to come over about remodeling. No one ever shows up or phones you back. I don't mean remodeling the house. I need some work. I phoned all kinds of people. I don't know if they're busy or just don't care. But this increase in utilities is -- it's going to destroy people. And it's -- somebody 's got to do something to help us for crying out loud. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. ELLMAN: While I'm here, I didn't see any of my complaints on that list that was in the paper. MR. DONAHUE : I gave an update a couple weeks ago. MR. ELLMAN: The list that was released about their accomplishments . I know what you are going to tell me, patience and fortitude. MR. DONAHUE : Let me see if I still have it here and I'll provide you with an update, Mr. Ellman. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I was debating whether to even come up here and speak tonight . There are many things on my mind these days. But I did have an observation coming in here to this building . Coming over the bridge into Center City right before the bridge at the University of Scranton , parked on the side of our Biden expressway happens to be a Bob Bolus truck. This is not the first time Mr. Bolus has broken down his truck as his truck 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 mysteriously broke down when Biden visited this city. Mr. Bolus is using the side of his truck which has a bunch of political campaign signs on it for an impromptu billboard . This should not be allowed . If he wants to buy a billboard , then buy a billboard . If he wants to put up signs, let him put up signs. If the truck is broken down there on the highway , well, maybe someone should call the authorities and have it removed from there and have it properly towed because it's been left abandoned on the side of the roadway . It shouldn 't be there for days. It should be towed and it should be gone. No citizen should be allowed to put up political signs by obstructing the roadway and creating a safety hazard. MR. DONAHUE : So, Mr. Coyne, when I was coming over the same way, I did see a police car behind the truck. So hopefully it is. MR. COYNE: It needs to be towed because as I said, this is a pattern , practice that he has done beforehand of conveniently 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 breaking down a vehicle right at the time where there is a political event going on. For the swimming and pools, I understand we have many things that are involved with Nay Aug Park. A while ago I suggested can we not buy a couple of sprinkler caps like they have in New York City that they put on the fire hydrant s, just something that could be put up there that could be blocked off. You put it on there, they open it up and it has a little sprinkler pad, a little sprinkler of spring water in the roadway . New York does it because there's a lot of population and there's really not a lot of swimming pools. And it's a cheap opportunity to put up a park or a place a metal cap on a fire hydrant controlled by the City who could turn it on to make it a little splash area for almost no cost at all. Last comment for tonight is in reviewing the IT contracts , it's funny that we have spent so much money to analyze , to look at, to improve the IT Department , to ignore and allow a cyber attack to happen, to decide that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 we need to reallocate and rebuild and unify into one specific stream a way for our government to work. And after months and months and months of that money being dumped in it, we finally figure out, oh, we can't do that. We can't combine our network and we have to look another way. What type of guidance do you have or have you had in the past in the IT Department that leads you down a blind alleyway spending money for an idea that cannot be logically done and should have been known cannot be done until the entire infrastructure is changed . I understand in IT when you take something this massive and you have a bunch of legacy products through different communities , different tax office, different operating systems , and different governmental bodies, combining those together is a monumental task to do a conversion . I've done them before. This is not something new. And it's not impossible . It just takes phasing it out. And for the longest time we have not had anyone here who is able to make a roadmap that does 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 not include throw more money it at, have someone else give us the ideas. And then when they cannot do it for us, move to someone else. Hopefully that will change because we're just throwing money away. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . I wore my lion shirt for you tonight . Do you recognize the family resemblance or what? Okay. I have been seeing some political ads on. I have a question for Mr. Donahue and he has not put me up to it. Your opponent is saying that you defunded the police or voted for defunding the police. Now, I don't ever remember you trying to defund the police. At least it would be nice if we had some Democrats that were honest too, you know, that was way over the top. I guess just because you're in charge of negotiations with the police department . MR. DONAHUE : I'm not in charge of negotiations .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. DOBRZYN : Yeah, it's the Mayor. Well, Council has to ratify stuff. But, you know, I never heard of anybody here defunding the police, not even me. I don't want a bunch of street urchins trying to kick my door in, you know? I might wind up on trial for something or another . Okay, now, a lot's been said about illegal s and asylum and immigrants. You know, 50 years ago they were trying to introduce family planning and birth control to the third world. And it got outlawed federally . The Congress and the president whoever it was at that time did not approve of it. And I'm tired of peopling looking to assign blame after it was a problem that they created because it certainly wasn't anybody to the left of the column there. I see people all over the place including Scranton , a lady yesterday protesting . And by the way, that law if you look at it enumeration of rights in the Constitution . I don't have a right in the Constitution saying I could walk out this door and walk down Washington Avenue. You know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 it's just plain and simple as that. I'll have, you know, you don't need to be enumerated rights for everything . You just need proper interpretation which going back to the 16th century England which was included in that leaked testimony -- or decision was -- I mean, what does England 16th century have to do with 21st century America . I don't know. Once again, get out and vote. And I wore my mask tonight because I was already aware that the county has declared the high contagion area for COVID. And it will keep coming around as long as people don't want to vaccinate . And that's a problem . Get out and get your vaccination . It's a little pinprick and you might wind up sitting home on a Saturday night instead of feeling like going out dancing or whatever . But at least you're protected somewhat from the serious disease . Might get some disease , but not -- not wind up in the hospital on a ventilator . It could get to the point where this is mild and could just overnight turn deadly because it's billions of viruses that invade 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 your body and start reproducing . And the chances of evolution there are great. The more it reproduces , the more there's a chance that it could turn serious . And once again get out and vote tomorrow . My vote is already cast. So that's the way it is. I don't really want to go to a poll at this time. Thank you. Have great night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , citizen . First, I'd like to start off thanking the DPW crew that is fixing the -- doing the basic work to get East Mountain -- Mountain Lake Road. They're doing it right this time. And it's very refreshing to see that two of them have already been done. And I don't know -- I don't know what they're doing. I spoke with the man who was in charge of it. And I asked him about the springs over on East Elm Street. And he said, oh, I went to a special class on that. Hopefully that will get done right this time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 too. So that will be very nice. 7-B -- 5-B, I am definitely against the testing for fentanyl . Everybody knows that the number of deaths and that they're due to fentanyl . And yet, they continue to buy things that are at risk. And I don't think we should enable them to continue doing that. I mean, why do we have to protect people who are too ignorant to put their life at risk by knowing something might be there? I just do not think we should be helping them to find out which of their high class drugs are safe for them to take, not that they're safe mind you. People get behind wheels with those drugs behind them. And I think we should be protected as well and we should not help them. They are -- could make up their own minds. 7-B, I'm definitely against this signing up on the federal government affairs services . Number one, those people are all there to represent us. I brought this up before. You people do not bring the people who are elected at the state level in Harrisburg and Washington here to tell them what we need. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Why can't you do that? Bring them here. They all have offices here. They have big staffs. You could tell them every -- every week. I don't think that we need to spend -- we're spending an awful lot of money. And as Joan said, we're probably going to have a big hole in the police and fire budgets when the contracts are completed . So I don't think we need to waste money there. If we do, perhaps the county which we also pay taxes to -- and they have a lobbyist down there I believe . We could ask them if they could do us a favor. I just can't imagine that we have that much to spend this kind of money. And then 7-A, I assume that everybody up there is in favor of keeping this building as the municipal building for at least two decades . Otherwise , I am against spending that kind of money on this building if it's not going to be the building . And let's see. I had something else here. Did anybody find out whether or not -- or how much we're going to have to compensate the company that has the parking spaces if we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 start putting in bicycle lanes? MR. DONAHUE : I believe that will be covered under the walkability connect ivity study that just got started . MS. SCHUMACHER : Just got started ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. We just approved an amendment to the contract . And the contract was just signed. That was put on the back burner because of COVID. I think it should have been done two years ago too but this is where we're at. MS. SCHUMACHER : This is crazy. I mean, the one with the parks, have you made a decision ? Has anybody made a decision on what's going to happen at Nay Aug Park poolwise? No. I mean, what are you doing to us? We're not going to have swimming there this year. We didn't have it last year. You have all of these studies that we paid for already . Why cannot a decision be made? Can somebody tell me? Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a couple quick comments . I am in favor of restoring this building and maintaining this building for many, many years to come. So I am in support of that. As far as the fentanyl strips, the reason I'm going to support that is unfortunately -- the hope is that no one would be addicted to drugs. But unfortunate ly they are. I know a lot of people that have gotten off of drugs. And fortunately they are able to turn their lives around. But I'm concerned about people dying. So that's why I'm going to support that one. And as far as the pool is concerned , I brought that up in our caucus earlier . I do want to see some movement . It hasn't been really discussed a whole lot since I've been on Council . And I think we need to get moving on it because the children of this City deserve to have a pool complex and a place to go and enjoy themselves 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 in the summer. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, just a few. In caucus we did discus the pool for a little bit. And, Frank, you did send out some correspondence a week or so ago for an update on the pool, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Correct . We received the monies that are pending . And we asked that they explore some more creative funding to expedite the program . MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so right now I'm just going to encourage the Mayor and the administration sit down and maybe give us an update on where we're at, where we're going with the pool so we could start to look at what decisions are to be made. I'd just like to report out about I'd say about three or four weeks ago I asked for the billing for our legal counsel -- or our labor counsel . Today we did -- well, we've been back and forth with the administration about the billing logs. They've been sitting in counsel offices for a couple weeks.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 But we haven't been allowed to take them. Today we did get a phone call or an e-mail from City Solicitor saying that they don't have any updates for us this week. But by next week we should have something on the billing. So right now we're just talking about whether any items are going to be redacted from those documents or not. And we hope to have them by next week. I'm disappointed in this but hope to have them by next week. I would like to thank Frank for reaching out on 1107 Woodlawn Street. And also during caucus we discussed about a meeting with PA American Water about our Birch Street project s and Broadway . So maybe we'll be getting that coming up in the next two weeks. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple. So regarding the pool, I brought it up last week and Mr. King brought it up this week. We're all in favor. Let's get moving on this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 I've been hearing plans and different excuses why we're not doing it for the past two and a half years. So, yes, let's send some correspondence . Let's get them in here and give us an update. Second, so this kind of piggybacks on the pool. Mr. Coyne brought up a great point. So we're not going to have a pool any time soon. We know that, right? So can you, Mr. Voldenberg , send correspondence to the Fire Department and explore the device that Mr. Coyne spoke of like putting something on a fire hydrant with a pad and see if it's feasible , if it's doable. At least let's explore this option. I would be in favor of that. And then thirdly , I got an e-mail -- all right. So this is a concern because this is a meeting that's going to be Saturday . So this gentleman sent me an e-mail. And he said as much as I'm a teacher in the SSD, I'm also the commander of the Sons of the Union Veterans Campaign , which holds our meetings in the basement of City Hall. We're having issues accessing the building because our key cards do not get in -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 the key cards to get in do not work. We have heard nothing back from IT to get the cards updated. We have a very important meeting on this Saturday for our departed brothers ceremony and our Memorial Day presentation at Dunmore cemetery on the 30th. Can you please help us? So please, you know, urgent correspondence because they need to have access for these very important meetings this Saturday so if you could contact the IT Department . And during caucus when I read this, I forwarded this e-mail to you, Mr. Voldenberg . So if you didn't get it, let me know. We need to act quickly on this. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I just have a couple -- a few things. I stated multiple times that I'm in favor of renovating this building and keeping this building , City Hall. And I've made multiple statements regarding Nay Aug pool that I'm willing to -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I'm in favor of going big with that. So we're going to reach out to the administration on that and come up with some funding solutions to actually get that project moving. Mr. Voldenberg , just to some of Miss Hodowanitz 's comment s, can we reach out to IT regarding the updated clerical contract on the City website , also the City Controller to see if there will be a paper copy on file for any bids that come in with the new procurement software ? And can we reach out to Kohanski regarding an update on the 2021 audit and how far along they've come there? I believe a couple weeks ago Miss Schumacher asked for information regarding the number of properties that have -- property owners that have paid taxes. We did get an update from the Tax Collector Cathy Weschler today. So that's 67 and a half percent of all properties have paid in full; 24.6 percent have paid zero, no payment s received to date; and then 7.9 percent have paid at least one installment , just a reminder that the end of the face value period 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 is June 30th, which is also the due date for the second quarterly payment . So Miss Weschler did indicate that she will also send us an update on this information in July once they process those payments . We also got an e-mail this week regarding -- and I know this has been a problem property with 601-603 Wheeler Avenue. We got this -- we got the e-mail on Wednesday of last week. But I drove by on Saturday with the Touch a Truck. They were at least cutting the grass. But, Mr. Voldenberg , can we just circle back with code enforce ment to see where they are in terms of the structure on that property ? And I also got a couple complaint s this week, one of them regarding Froude Avenue and East Elm, cars constantly running the stop sign at that corner. So can we send correspondence to the police department to ask them to increase patrols , especially during the times of 7:30 to about 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.? That seems to be the high traffic areas up there. I know Miss Schumacher brought up the issue on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Cherry Street I believe with -- that there's some sort of natural spring under there. Myself and Mr. King were actually on the gentleman 's porch last week talking to him about how that needs to be fixed. So we are looking into that too. And then a couple other complaints I got, one was on -- it's basically at the edge of the corner of the property of 16 Arnold Avenue, the drainage ditch that's there that catches the water is pretty wide. And the neighbor had concerns that one of the children in the neighborhood could possibly fall in because it was that big. So can we send that along to both PA American Water and DPW? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : And also, there's the PA American Water did a pave cut in front of 728 Fig Street. And it's basically caving in. I was out there on Sunday. And when I actually got close to it, I actually think I made the problem a little worse because it started caving in again. But could you send that -- also send that to PA American Water and the pave cut 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 inspector to get out there and see if they could fix that issue? It is a recent pave cut there. And that's all I have for this evening . Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. MCANDREW : As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 DEVELOPMENT – FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 71, 2022 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR, OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OFFICIALS , AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH NOSSAMAN LLP TO PROVIDE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SERVICES . MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. MCANDREW : As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final vote of Item 7-B. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. KING: Based on our conversation I think during caucus, I recommend that we consider tabling this until we get some changes or amendment s to the existing contract that was present ed to just make it more clear. MR. DONAHUE : I'll second that. Anyone on the question to table Item 7-B? MR. MCANDREW : Well, yeah, I was prepare d to vote tonight for this resolution . And I was going to vote no. And I'm going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 tell you why because after a week since introduction and time to think about it, I see no need to contract with a lobbyist . I was voting no tonight on this. Lobbying the federal government for funding is the job of the Mayor and the OECD Director . This is what the taxpayer s of Scranton pay them to do. We could save the 4,000 a month the Mayor plans to pay a former colleague and retired former legislator . By having the Mayor pick up the phone and call our U.S. Senator Bob Casey who just happens to live in Scranton and our U.S. Congressman Matt Cartwright who happens to be on the Appropriations Committee , this money could be better spent on things that affect our residents and neighborhoods , such as, filling potholes , cleaning out storm drains, etc. This administration needs to do their job and stop farming out the responsibilitie s of this administration to private contractor s. So I urge my colleague s to vote no on this proposal tonight . It's a waste of taxpayer money. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 question on the motion to table Item 7-B? All those in favor of tabling 7-B signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. DONAHUE : So we're deadlocked again. So the motion to table fails. Anyone else on the question regarding -- on the question regarding the legislation 7-B. MS. SCHUSTER : So with 7-B -- go ahead, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : Well, I just pretty much stated my reasons for voting no. I don't need to repeat it. MS. SCHUSTER : Well, last week I stated that I felt like it was death by a thousand cuts. We've been talking about the CBAs that haven't been settled. We have had propose d increases this year. We've had consultant s added. And this $48,000 here is an increase to the current budget. I'm not really in favor of adding to our current budget that's already been decided 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 upon. So I'll be voting no tonight as well. MR. DONAHUE : Hey, I wish that we didn't have to pay for lobbyist . I wish lobbyist didn't have to exist. But unfortunately that's not the way the world currently works. That's not the way the U.S. Congress currently works. The U.S. Congress doesn't get anything done because they don't compromise . So I think having a representative down there that's in Washington every day fighting for our interest is in the best interest of City residents . Do I wish it wasn't necessary ? Yes, I do. But unfortunately , it is. Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I'm probably going to be voting no on this as well based on some questions that I had about the contract too. So that's where I stand. And it is unfortunate that lobbyist s need to, you know, serve in this capacity when we do have a U.S. Senator who lives in the City and a U.S. Congress man who lives in this area. And we have a Mayor who really has a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 direct contact with all those individuals . So that's kind of where I stand on that one. MR. DONAHUE : Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MS. SCHUSTER : No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Donahue . MR.
