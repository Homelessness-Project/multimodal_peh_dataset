REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Rogan, any comments or motions ? MR. ROGAN: Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. As Chairperson of Public Safety, I'd like to compliment the efforts of Detective Fueshk and fellow officer Scott Stelmak and Lenny Nemica{sic} for putting on a crime scene investigation and canine unit demonstration at police headquarters yesterday for an area boy scout troop. I'm a big fan of this kind of community engagement . Also last week Mr. Coyne, he posed a question about our city's readiness or if there's a plan to deal with the potential threat of the coronavirus. So acting fire chief, Al Lucas responded that at this time the Pennsylvania Department of Health is only recommend ing that we treat coronavirus prevention the same way as we do for the flu. But also Acting Chief Lucas did provide us with information sheets from the CDC. Okay, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 so I believe these would be great tools of education and awareness if the City administration would post these on the City's website -- and I'm requesting , Mrs. Reed, to reach out and see if they can do that. It's very informative sheets of what, where, how, why about awareness . So I hope that they get on the website for you guys. Also, I'm also very happy that our city's administration has taken legal action against the delinquent landlord Ken Bond. I hope this is the first of many and efforts to recoup delinquent garbage fees continues . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few comments . First off, I know we had a moment of silence at the time beginning of the meeting. But I just would like to provide my condolences to the families and the people that were affected by the fire that was on Putnam Street this week. I previously lived on the same block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 just a few doors down. So that really came close to home for me. We had rented a property down there shortly before we bought our home a few years ago. So I am very sorry to hear of their loss. A few other points, last week we had a resident come in here who explained that she had some concerns regarding the Penn Ridge Capouse Ave., pool. And I have been delving into that further . And I contacted OECD. And I'm setting up a meeting with our Parks and Recs Department and our grant writer to see what possible grants might be appropriate to use for that space to turn that into something else. That's a project that I'm very interested and invested in. And in addition to that, I previously spoken to this but working with the University of Scranton , their students . I just spoke at a marketing research class tonight at the University of Scranton . And they are going to work on developing a pilot study for starting internally and hopefully something that we can use later on with the other colleges and universities in our region.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 But the study is going to work on surveying students and alumni to figure out why students may not stay in Scranton after graduation and what factors could motivate them to make that decision . So that is my update on that. And then one other thing I want to bring up -- and I know it's been brought up to Council before. But I really think that this is necessary for the City of Scranton , the SeeClickFix Program or using a similar program like that to track complaints and issues throughout the City. I think that is something that we need to bring to light again. We would really benefit from having that program to help us organize those complaints . And I'm hoping that the Mayor's administration is willing to work together with us on that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly a couple DPW updates . I talked to Director Gallagher this morning . First off, there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 red bins available now down at DPW for anyone that needs new red bins. I know we got a couple questions about a month ago. And the City was out. We had received a new order in. So they are available down at DPW on Popular Street. Also on the paper recycling , there should be a calendar released by the end of the week outlining a new procedure for collecting paper and cardboard . It's more than likely going to be, you know, commingled one week paper, commingle and then cardboard . That's the way it's looking now. But that's going to be announced probably in the next week. And more than likely it will take effect the week of March 2nd. So for next week for the paper and cardboard , you could put them both out together for this one last week. We also got a couple complaints about the 17 and 1800 blocks of Clearview Street. They were paved last year. And now Pennsylvania American Water is going in and replacing storm drains. So the reasoning for -- that they were allowed to do that is the storm drains are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 connected to the combined system. And there are -- there is some sewage backflow into a couple of the homes in that area. So it's considered an emergency . But Pennsylvania American Water has agreed to pave those two blocks curb to curb once the new storm drains are installed . That should happen in the spring then because I think they should be -- I think they should be starting -- I think they were starting today on that project and then working over the next few weeks. And then once the blacktop factory is open, they'll get those paved. And I believe that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Thanks for coming tonight everyone . I just have a few things to mention . The first, Miss Hodowanitz asked about the MS4 permit. It's really just the same update that I had last week, Miss Hodowanitz . Nothing really has changed . We haven't received anything new, but just kind of to recap, the new permit would be would good for five years once it's issued. Mr. King who is the City Planner who is kind of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 running the show here with the MS4 permit, he needs to speak with the Mayor to provide her and her -- the administration an update. Once he has done that, he's going to coordinate with Mrs. Reed about coming to a caucus to provide us further update and information . The City did apply as you know in May of 2019. And in August, the City was in contact with the DEP in regards to finishing up some items from the Pollution Reduction Plan. He, at that point has not received an official report yet from DEP regarding the inspection in October . But they do have 80 to 90 other communities that are going through the exact same process . So our permit does stay valid until a new one is issued. So that's the update on that. In terms of reimbursable overtime from the police department for 2019 that Miss Schumacher had asked about, we came in at $289,994.39 for last year. So that's money that was reimbursed back to the City for police overtime . I'd also like at this time to make a motion that City Council send a letter to John 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Basalyga from the Marketplace at Steamtown asking him for a detailed update on plans for the improvement of the Electric City Garage. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a second. On the question ? On the question , I had asked last week that Solicitor Hayes draft a letter, which he did. This was circulated to the other Council members . It will be placed on our agenda next week in Third Order so everyone can take a look at it. Basically what we're looking for is the construction schedule with respect to the Electric City Garage. We're asking for that within 30 days of this -- when the correspondence is being sent out. We would like an explanation of the work which has already been completed since the company acquired the Electric City Garage along with a projected timeline for completing the repair and renovation work on that facility . As I had mention ed a few weeks ago -- have been concerned now for last really two years that it doesn't seem like we're moving the ball in terms of repairing that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 garage. And as some of you may remember , the Parking Authority basically gave a grant in terms of 2.85 million dollars towards renovations of the Electric City Garage. And it was sold for a dollar. So to me at that time when we were voting on the deal, you know, the garage was in shambles according to everyone that had talked before Council . So why it's taking this long to repair when there's money available , I still don't understand . So hopefully we can get an answer on that. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. The ayes have it and so moved. The second thing I wanted to mention -- and I know Councilman Donahue is the Chairperson for Public Works has been in contact with Mr. Srebro, and I believe is meeting with him this week. I had said to Mr. Srebro that it was my belief that there was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 an effort by the previous administration under Mayor Evans to look at the flooding in Keyser Valley. And Mrs. Reed was in contact with the grant manager for the City of Scranton , Maggie Perry. She did reply that there was a meeting last November with the previous business administrator , Mr. Gallagher, our DPW Director , the City Engineer Mr. Pocius discuss ing all the flooding issues in Keyser Valley. And they at that time are going to put together a proposal for grant funding for flood control and mitigation . But before they could do that, there had to be an engineering study. There was a meeting schedule d within the last week to discuss this project and a number of other project s related to DPW. It was cancelled . And it had to be rescheduled . But Mrs. Perry is going to inform us regarding what the plan is at least in terms of the grant funding when that becomes available . The other thing -- and I did e-mail this to Mr. Srebro was in regards to something that is already in the works in terms of grant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 money. The City put in for a grant in the amount of $418,774 to be used to install new and more efficient inlets and larger pipes to adequately convey runoff on Briggs Street to Keyser creek, its original outlet point. This is a project that will probably take quite some time. But that is something that we're hopeful that the City receives the grant money and they are able to complete that project . So that is an update on that. The third thing that I had in terms of a question that came up regarding the gas card analysis , I believe Miss Hodowanitz asked about the unassigned funds. Let me see if I could find it in my paperwork here. I have it someplace here. I don't know where I put it. There is an answer for that. Let's see. This is what happens when you have all this paperwork in front of you. Here it is. So the deputy controller was in contact with Mrs. Reed along with another employee , the internal auditor Mrs. Gallagher in the Controller 's Office. And the unassigned portion is a title for another grouping of gas 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 card users by name and department similar to miscellaneous . But it's titled as unassigned . These individual s were provided gas cards after the cards had already been grouped by department . It's not a literal definition according to the Controller 's Office employees . Including in the unassigned grouping are three house cards for police patrol vehicles on Moosic Street, South 7th and South Main Avenue. Attached is the individual user in the unassigned category along with the financial summary indicating the grouping by all department s. And they also wanted to mention to us that the monetary difference in totals is because Sunoco gives the City a rebate based on gas usage. They also wanted to clarify that the rebate is an adjustment for tax. So the City is actually tax exempt. We don't actually pay a tax. So hopefully that answers your question . If you need any followup , I do have the e-mail that she had sent. And I -- the only other thing I wanted to mention was we did receive the list of streets that are propose d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 to be paved through the OECD spring 2020 paving project . Bids are going to be open February 26th for this project . And we did receive a list of the streets . Most of them are in North Scranton . There is 12 of them. And then there's two alternate ones that they put in on Rockwell Avenue. So I do know I travel these streets a lot in North Scranton . And all of these streets are in pretty bad conditions . So I think it's good that the administration is focusing on this area and then obviously hopefully in the City's paving project they focus on some other areas that are also in need. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. DONAHUE : And just to add to that, I did talk to Mr. Gallagher today about the City's paving project . And those should be going out -- the bids for that should start going out in the next couple weeks. Last year we didn't get those out until September and paving didn't start until October . So we're hoping to get them out earlier this year so we're not in a crunch at the end of the year.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES – FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 16, 2020 – APPOINTMENT OF PATRICK J. SHERIDAN , CPA, 106 STONE RIDGE CIRCLE, CLARKS SUMMIT, PENNSYLVANIA 18411 TO THE POSITION OF INTERIM BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR EFFECTIVE JANUARY 6, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 of Item 7-L. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. ROGAN: Yes, on the question , just to reiterate what I mentioned last week, I have no problem with supporting a residency waiver for a -- specifically for a business administrator . It's too important of a position to just stick strictly to the residency requirements . But I do think there is a residency requirement and a waiver process for a reason. I probably would be voting yes for this appointment if a waiver had been attached . The excuse of it's a temporary appointment , residency doesn't matter doesn't fly with me. I think it opens the door for any employment in the City less than six months to be a nonresident . For those reasons I'm going to vote against the appointment . I do want to stress though it's not a vote against Mr. Sheridan . It's a vote against a process and not being followed properly . We did also -- I did also inquire with the administration if Mr. Sheridan would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 pay the City Wage Tax. We didn't hear back yet. I know Mr. Bulzoni when he was an out-of-town business administrator did pay the City Wage Tax. So I hope that Mr. Sheridan would make that same arrangement again. It sounds like it was a voluntary thing that Mr. Bulzoni did. But I do think that's something that should be followed and hopefully we'll have an answer on that shortly . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else?
