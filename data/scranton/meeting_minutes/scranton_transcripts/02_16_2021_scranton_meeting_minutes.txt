This can be accessed by calling 211. It's available to all county residents over the age of 65. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Kyle. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. So this Saturday , February between , 11 and 1, the Lackawanna County Federation of Democratic Women will be hosting their annual petition signing event. But they're also doing a food drive which is pretty cool. So this will be at Laceworks Tap and Grill. This is a drivethrough event. Like I said, they'll also be collecting non-glass and non-perishable food and also monetary donation s to benefit the United Neighborhood Center. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Anybody else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 congratulate Nay Aug Park, the Valentines Day food drive that they held last week. It sounds like it was very successful . And there are a lot of donations that they'll be able to provide to the food pantries. So thank you to them for hosting that food drive. And it sounds like they're willing to hold some more in the future. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay, great. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Fay Franus and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Fay Franus as follows :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Council I would appreciate it very much if you would find out why Scranton is still classified as a 2A city. I understand the census is not done yet but certainly even when the census is done there is no way it will include thousands and thousands more people to qualify as a 2A city. Scranton should be classified appropriately according to population . It may require work but it needs to be followed up on and completed . I do feel Scranton definitely is not a 2A city. Time to make it right. Also I would like to know why you are not allowing the public to be able to zoom into the council meetings live to ask our questions and make our comments just as though we were there in person? Please tell us what we can do to make this happen. Other government meetings have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 people zoom in live. I would like an answer on this tonight . As well as my question on Scranton being a 2A city. Thank you MS. REED: The second submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O When will the public get to see the 2019 Audit? Will 2020 Audit be on time? O As we are only four days shy of the anniversary of the final approval required to implement the 10-Year LERTA I am curious about how this program is doing on accomplishing the stated goal. It was touted as a means of sparking new economic development in the City. I request a monthly report of the total number of LERTAs as well as a breakdown by industrial , commercial and other business property . I have a question about the actual life of this Ten-Year Program ; for example , if a property owner applies on the last day of the ninth year of the Program is the property still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 100% tax exempt for ten year or two years? O The Mayor and others have invited out-of-town workers capable of working from home to come to Scranton where the cost-of-living might be lower than where they are living. Which I understand has been successful . Our wage and tripled Local Service Taxes are paid by the Employer . When the Employer is not in Scranton how do these at-home employees make their contribution or do they get a free ride. (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all the submissions for this evening . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just to touch on two of Miss Schumacher 's points, just a correction there, the LERTA doesn't make it -- doesn't make properties 100 percent tax free. That's -- it would just be on any new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 improvements . So there is still -- they're still paying taxes on the land and then also any existing , you know, existing structure s that were on the property before any improvements were made. And then on her second point regarding the wage tax, that actually brings up an interesting point. I think we should maybe send a letter or an e-mail to Berkheimer asking how they're adjusting , you know, to this new normal in terms of our collection of wage tax. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I was going to also just touch on the LTS Tax. I had a lot of residents come to me also saying, you know, I worked out of Scranton . I've been home for a year. So do I have to pay it? Should I pay it? So that's a good point maybe we should look at. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else? Okay, just to respond to Miss Franus's question and let me first say I appreciate Miss Franus and Miss Schumacher 's questions and anyone who writes in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 As for the process of the Zoom meetings , you know, we set these standards and procedures way back when the pandemic started . And, of course, I think I could speak for everyone when I say that we would all like to be back in chambers in City Council back in City Hall. And I'm very hopeful that we may be able to get back in the summer or maybe the fall depending on how the vaccination rollout goes and what the numbers look like and when it's deemed safe for the public, which is what I'm most concerned about. The way that the meeting s are set up currently allows for people to write their comments in whether it's via U.S. mail. You would send those to 340 North Washington Avenue, second floor, City Hall attention to our City Clerk, Lori Reed by 3 p.m., on Tuesday -- so the day of the meeting or you can e-mail Lori, our City Clerk at lreed@scrantonpa .gov with your comments . And those comments are read into the record. And I make it a point -- well, we all make it a point to go through these comment s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 and to answer any of the questions that are posed. And if we don't have answers to the question then we make it a point to get those questions to the appropriate department . And when we get answers we report them back at Council . You know, it doesn't always happen as quickly as we would like. But, you know, we try our best to get that done. So again, I'm hopeful that maybe by the summer or the fall we could get back to normal. And, Kyle, I don't know if you covered this, but as to Miss Schumacher 's question on the 10 year abatement if a property owner applies on the last day of the ninth year of the program is the property still 100 percent tax exempt for 10 years. It still extends out 10 years even if (inaudible ) the ninth year. So it's not -- it's not the other way around. So you do have 10 years from the day that you enter into the program . And as Councilman Donahue said, it's on the improvement. It's not on the whole property . And any of the other questions we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 will -- we will get answers to. The one on the audit, we all received a draft copy of the 2019 audit. Unfortunately , it's not ready for public consumption yet. But I'm assuming that it will be within the next week or two, two or three weeks. They have to have a meeting , an exit interview type meeting with the administration . When that happens and the audit is officially released to Council , we'll put that in Third Order as we have done in the past. And under the Evans administration I requested an exit interview or conference with the auditor , which I would like to do again this year. That was really helpful when we did it last year. So I'd like to continue that. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : And just to touch on that too in terms of the audit for next year as we have been told from now -- you know, at this point we're still on track to have it done on time. You know, they're still closing that 60 day period at the end of the year that would reconcile everything from 2020. But audit prep has started and, you know, and hopefully we get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 it earlier this upcoming year. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And now we do have Mayor Cognetti with us here tonight . So, Mayor, thank you for coming. And I know you wanted to update us on a few items and then we'll open it up to any questions from Council . Thank you, Mayor. MAYOR COGNETTI : Thanks everyone . Thanks for having me. On the audit, I did just actually check in with the Business Administrator earlier . It's possible it might be published as early as Friday. So that's not a promise. That's a hope. But it could go as early as soon as Friday. So hopefully we would get it done Friday. If not, it should be very, very soon. And then thank you, Councilman Donahue , for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 pointing out that we're committed to this being a far more scheduled process for this coming year. Sorry, about the background noise. Give me -- I'm sorry, life in COVID. Sorry about that. MR. GAUGHAN : Life on Zoom. MAYOR COGNETTI : I know. I know. Yes, so on the audit, hopefully Friday. We'll see. And then I want to talk to you guys about doing a joint letter, which we've seen this movie before to our Congressional delegation advocating for the American Rescue Plan that we did I believe twice so far in the last year as we've pushed and pushed for more funding for cities, more funding for families , more funding for small businesses . Right now this week is a great time for us to be advocating for that as the -- Biden's rescue plan is -- really is going around Congress . What's in that is again, which we -- I know we've all been advocating for, there is funding directly for cities so that we would have the opportunity not to have a trickle -down funding from the feds to the state to the county to us. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 But to have direct funding that we could together decide what to do with those funds and how to recover from COVID as a community together . So I will, Councilman Gaughan , I sent you -- sent you the substance and all work overnight . And then tomorrow I'll work on getting you guys a draft. I think it would be great for the six of us to send that to our Congressional delegation in the next 48 hours. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure, yeah, makes sense to me. MAYOR COGNETTI : Great. I'll get that draft to you. The refuse and real estate bills are hitting inboxes. We actually just got ours in the mail on my way downstairs from the office. I know there are some questions about that. Councilman Gaughan , I think you talked with Treasurer Sheridan today. We're continuing to, you know, work through some of these issues with the Single Tax Office. But any feedback that you will get is really helpful . I think it's helpful to get that to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 us and also simultaneously to the Single Tax Office. There's some process things that we'd like to see that seem to be a bit of a sticking point. So I think it would be great if in realtime you guys could be giving that feedback to both the Single Tax Office and us. That gives us the ability to really work on these issues together . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, on that point -- and I did. I sent this to Mary Jo Sheridan a few weeks ago. But this issue came up. And I knew it was going to come up because it's happened in the past in terms of the exemption s. So one of the issues that I had a call from an elderly gentleman this afternoon and I'm sure there's a lot more people out there that will be facing the same thing is that they live in a half of double and they don't have -- they don't, you know, rent out one half of it. So they get $600 tacked onto their property tax bill. In the past they were able to come at the end of the year and based on the fact that, you know, whatever , for the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 three years they were exempt, they were able to pay it -- or not pay it. They were able to show that they were -- the property was vacant or that side was vacant at the end of the year. Under this new plan, I guess they are being told they have to shell out the $300 upfront which is not, you know, feasible at all. So I just, you know, whatever we have to do to change that because like I was talking to this gentleman today. And it's hard enough to pay the $300, never mind 600. Now they told him they'll reimburse him at the end of the year, but that's not just not fair I don't think. MAYOR COGNETTI : No, we've having these conversations for many months. And we agree that it's not -- it shouldn 't be difficult to not take that -- to not demand that payment . So we've got to continue to work on it. But the feedback that you guys all get, again, I think that's really important that we be sharing that in realtime , share with us and the Single Tax Office I think at the same time because I don't think this has to be as complicated as it seems. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MR. GAUGHAN : Now, do you know -- I don't know if you know off the top of your head because I know these conversations are ongoing , but since the bills already went out, are we expecting people to -- like, what are we telling people because they're being told by the Treasurer 's Office -- or the Single Tax Office that they can't -- they have to pay it all upfront . I mean, that's the calls that I'm getting . So what are we telling people who are already getting these bills because they are stressing out that they have to shell out the 300. And they don't want to wait the year to get it back because they're not -- they don't have anybody living in these doubles . MAYOR COGNETTI : Yeah, so we're -- I need to talk to Mary Jo about what she -- what it is she wants to advise. I think that's why it's important that we're getting -- that we collect all of the -- all of the folks that are having this issue we need to make sure we have all of that on record so that we can get back to them. I don't think that they should -- if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 they could afford to pay it, great. If they can't afford to pay it we need to know who they are and work with them because I don't -- I don't think that this has to be this hard. I don't see why the Single Tax Office can't take payment on one but not the other. It just -- it's not -- this is -- I believe it's around we think it's about 3 to 400 properties . This is also not a huge amount of accounts . And so I think we can solve this. But we need to -- we need to be taking down all that information and then working through it in the coming weeks. We also want people to be able to take advantage of the discount on the, you know, the property that they do get refuse collection for. So we want to make sure we collected that information from those residents . And I think we could get to a solution but having that incoming to our office and to you all and making sure that that's all with the Treasurer 's Office and the Single Tax Office. I mean, the Treasurer 's Office can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 collect it and have all that information in one place. And that's really important . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. As long as, you know, if you could keep us up-to-date so that we know what to tell people because we're -- I'm sure the calls are going to continue to come into us. So we appreciate it. The other thing I wanted to bring up too and I saw the e-mail from Chief Namiotka about Third Avenue. So as you know, we've talked about it. The situation out there is just -- it's just not right. This street has gone from a quiet residential street now to, you know, a NASCAR type situation where trucks are barrelling up and down at all hours of the day. And I get -- this goes way back even before your administration , but the phone calls do not stop. The e-mails, the calls to our office do not stop. So I understand that it's, you know, a difficult situation . But I know you and Chief Namiotka were out there. So can you just fill us in on what the status is? MAYOR COGNETTI : Yeah, we went out there. I've gone in the summer too. But we went out again. It was good to see it during 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the winter when the salt trucks are going, right, it's a different -- it's a bit of a different feel. We went out there. And I've asked that they enforce the Jake -- is it the brake retarders to enforce that more heavily which they should have started doing in the last week or so. So we're going to enforce that better. We're also going to look at the sign -- the ordinance s and the signage and make sure -- and this isn't just for Third Avenue and Railroad Ave. We need to make sure all of our signs match up with ordinances across the City. I think we maybe have some signs up that don't have ordinances attached to them and vice versa. We might have ordinances but no signs up anymore. So we need to do a review of that, but I think starting with Third Avenue and Railroad Avenue. This is something that we're going to have to work on, right, the real solution is the new bridge which isn't going to happen overnight . And I don't know what the answer is for -- for Third Avenue. You know, it's a -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 it's something we definitely have to talk about. I know there's, you know, talk of, you know, why don't we build an egress on the other side. You know, I looked at that too. There's a ravine in between Wal-Mart and that property . So I'm not sure -- I'm not sure how easy it would be to build a road. I think it's a -- this is a process . It starts with us enforcing it more. That's the first. And I think we try to work with the resident s and the business owner and try to figure out what some -- what some relief can be and then we try to see if we can accelerate the building of that bridge in some way and can we move that up the priority list in some way. And that's something that we haven't looked at yet. But I'd like to explore how do we get that bridge to the top of the list. MR. GAUGHAN : Does anybody have any other items or questions ? MR. SCHUSTER : So first off, while we're talking about signage, we did -- I know Mr. Gaughan got an e-mail about it. And I got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 a few. Clearview Street, some of the traffic is coming through -- it's coming up Euclid Avenue to avoid the bridges on Main Avenue there at North Scranton and Tripp Park in West Side where they meet on Main Avenue. So that is something that you received ? MAYOR COGNETTI : Yes. Part of that -- part of that, right, we need to be making -- the ordinance s and the signs need to match and, you know, other things that we all need to work together to change, absolutely . But I think that will be -- that will be really helpful . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. MR. DONAHUE : And just -- just on that too, like, you know, that bridge on North Main that goes over the expressway , that gets hit like weekly. So, I mean, there has to be something we could do to, you know, stop that from happening . MAYOR COGNETTI : I know. I think we need -- we really -- we need more signs. And they need to be placed before a truck turns onto a street so they're not either trying to back up into traffic or just going anyway. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 I think there's a lot of this we can -- we can do a lot better job with the signage and the bridges. It's great to have a sign on a bridge. But if your truck is already in traffic , then what are you going to do? So, you know, we can -- I think we can do a lot better there. And so -- and I would say for you guys, things that you see or that folks that reach out to you, send all of those to Chris and he could continue to collect those and then work those so that Don King and Tom Preambo can -- and also Chief Namiotka . They're -- they work in a group to access these things and make sure that our signage makes sense. And especially with the truck traffic , I know it's not good for a host of reasons . MR. SCHUSTER : And then other than that, the last two weeks we've discussed the Police Chief. Any movement on the Police Chief? MAYOR COGNETTI : Yep. I think you guys will get something soon finalizing that. I'm not going to discuss personnel issues on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 the -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I know. We're not discussing personnel . I mean, we're past the 35 days. So I think we're all looking to see if there's going to be movement on it. MAYOR COGNETTI : You'll see an appointment very soon. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, we just want -- we've been discussing this. We just want to make sure that we're not -- the City is not violating the Administrative Code because we're way past the 35 days from the appointment . MAYOR COGNETTI : Thirty-five days is a pretty short trial period for a -- for a serious job like that. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I understand that; but that's, you know, that is the Administrative Code. So we want to make sure that we're following it. MAYOR COGNETTI : And we could work to fix the -- change that. We got some other stuff to do but -- MR. GAUGHAN : Right. Anybody else 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 have any question or concerns ? Mayor, we're suppose d to be receiving legislation on the delinquent refuse collector. Is that -- MAYOR COGNETTI : That should have gone up at noon today. You should have that on your agenda next week. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And the other thing that we've talked about is the entertainment fee whether that's a prorated basis or -- MAYOR COGNETTI : I think that we're going to do just a percentage like -- so we've been talking a lot about this because we're trying to do kind of a broader code enforcement overhaul as I think you all know. People need relief on some of these things before we get into all of that. So I'd say we're going to do with the entertainment fee -- I think also with the peddler /vendor fee. I think we're going to try to match those and do basically a percentage of them. So like call it 20, 25 percent or something like that where we'll charge just that amount. We do think we should charge 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 something in this year but just a much smaller percentage . So we'll finalize that and get that proposal up to you. I think we might have it ready next -- to go up to you guys next week or to go up to the City -- or to the clerk's office next week. But we're trying to do vendor/peddler and entertainment at the same time again reducing it down to I'd say probably 20 percent of what it usually would be. I want to -- I wanted to get away from completely not charging these fees because then I think it's very hard to ramp them back up. I think if we bring them -- bring them down I think that would be good. You know, in some ways similar to the dog license fee, right, we get that back in line -- sorry, it's a little different because we're not doing dog license changes because of COVID. But the theory is if we have a more reasonable fee we'll get more buy-in which is better for us to be able to actually , whether , you know, it's tracking dogs or, you know, being able to know where entertainment and concerts and things are happening. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I think some of our fees are onerously high. And I think this is a good start. But that should be coming very soon. We started to get questions about the peddler piece. And I thought we should do those together as a package to you. But we're working on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And, well, are you or the administration going to make some kind of announcement soon about -- to circle back on the exemption issue with the garbage bill in terms of whether people are -- who have -- who usually go for the exemption , like, just when can we expect that? MAYOR COGNETTI : I mean, this is a process with the Single Tax Office that we again have been -- we've been trying to solve this for some time now. I think we can -- we will know -- we'll work through in the next couple of days and Mary Jo Sheridan is going to come to my town hall on Friday. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MAYOR COGNETTI : So we'll address this on Friday. And we'll work on this. We'll at least have an answer for how we're advising 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 those people by Friday. And then, you know, the Single Tax Office needs more time on their operations , that's one thing. But we can -- we can finalize what our guidance is by Friday. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. All right. Perfect . We appreciate it. MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick question , Mayor. So we did talk about the garbage fees, you know, two dwellings maybe when there's only one renting there. We have to fix that. But so for the 10 percent garbage fee discount , you can't get it unless you pay your school taxes and City taxes during the discount period, right? Am I correct with that? MAYOR COGNETTI : They are attached , yeah. MR. MCANDREW : But like in order to get the discount you got to pay them all. Like, it's not just a discount for the garbage . You got to pay them all in one shot to get the 10 percent for the garbage . Okay. I just want to be clear on that. MAYOR COGNETTI : Yeah, that's -- yeah, they're -- it's all one.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. MCANDREW : No, I understand that. I just want to -- I've been asked so I'm just asking. Thank you. MAYOR COGNETTI : And I -- you know, this is -- we all knew it would not be the most fun transition . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? All right, Mayor, as always, thank you for coming and keeping us up-to-date. We really appreciate it. And we look forward to continuing to work with you and your administration . MAYOR COGNETTI : Thank you. Yeah, and I'll get you the letter tomorrow . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Have a good night. ATTY. HAYES: Good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: Thank you. FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 McAndrew , any motions or comment s at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I just want to circle back. So last week, you know, we brought up hometown heros program again. And then Jeff did a great article for us. But now here's the thing, it created a lot of excitement . So I'm getting phone calls. Everybody is getting phone calls, different offices , the City. So I just want to let everyone know because even on, you know, Facebook messages that Todd Pousley from NeighborWorks , you know, he's the liaison for the West Scranton Neighborhood Plan. I'm going to talk -- be on a phone call with him tomorrow because supposedly the applications are being crafted now and almost done. And then maybe, you know, the application -- it's definitely going to be posted on the West Side Neighborhood Plan under NeighborWorks . But maybe that application we can have the City help us out and post it on their website. So when I get more information , of course, I'll share it with all of you. That is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a couple things real quick. A couple -- a few weeks ago I had e-mailed Mrs. Reed about a property that I received a complaint on and I've received complaints on in the past. And it's been sent over to LIPS many, many times. And I can never seem to get a response regarding this property . I'm going to ask Mrs. Reed to send another correspondence over to that department . So that's with regards to 1352-1354 Sanderson Avenue. There's a number of concerns with that property . And it seems like it may be in need of inspection or might be in violation of City Code. So if I could have her do that again. And the other thing that I just wanted to bring up, regarding our agenda tonight so 5-B and 5-C, they're both resolution s adding members to boards and commissions . And, you know, I just wanted to point out that I feel like when I first started on Council and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 received minutes from the different boards and commissions for the City that -- that there was a real lack of diversity on them. Many of them were -- had all men as members on those boards and commissions . So I think over the past year it seems like the administration is trying to add more women to our boards and commissions . I think we also need more people of color on them, just more diversity because this is something that we can -- that they can control who they choose to appoint to them. I think there should be a continued effort to diversify them. And so I know like the Municipal Recreational Authority has I believe seven members and only two of those members are women. So, you know, it was just a point that I wanted to make and a process for them to continue to appoint diverse candidate s to City boards and commissions . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 have a few. First, I want to make a motion that Council send a letter to the Mayor, to the City Treasurer and to the City Tax Collector objecting to the current exemption process for garbage bills and asking that the process revert to what it was in the past. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , I appreciate that the Mayor addressing this tonight . I do want to make sure that we're on the record here with an official letter to the Mayor, to the Treasurer and to the Single Tax Office. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that our citizens , especially our elderly citizens as I stated to the Mayor and in the caucus tonight not only is it bad enough that they have to pay the $300. But if they have a half double and they don't have anyone living there and it's vacant and it's been vacant and they've been down there as the gentleman who I talked to earlier today has been down there to show the vacancy at the end of the year and now all of a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 sudden they're being told, no, shell out the extra 300 and we'll get you at the end of the year. That is just unacceptable , complete ly unacceptable . And it's got to be changed immediately . And it has to be changed as quickly as possible because there are people who pay these things at a certain time when they get their -- whether they get their income tax refund or whether they get other money or they have money saved up, we can't be at the whim of waiting around for people to figure this out. This has been something that has been talked about and discussed for months, for months. And I had alerted them a while ago about this. So to me it's unacceptable for a gentleman -- one gentleman in particular . There will be more, 80-year-old veteran who doesn't have anybody living next door to him. But now the onus is on him to pay the 300 and get it back at the end of the year. That is outrageous and unacceptable . And that's -- one call I got. I got another call before it. And I'm sure I'll get many more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 after. There's only as the Mayor stated about 300 to 400 people somewhere in that range who have this situation . Many of them are elderly. And the pandemic actually affects the situation as well because you have people who are living in half a double, elderly people who are renting it out and those people have moved or moved on, can't pay the rent now because of the pandemic . So I just want to make sure we're on the record. This isn't rocket science . It's not anything that should take more than a few days. But we've got to let people know because everyone just got their property tax bill. So now all of a sudden to turn around and say, well, jeez, let's try to figure it out; it's unacceptable , whether the problem lies with the administration or the tax office, I don't really care who it's with. But it needs to get fixed immediately because really, I don't want get another phone call from someone who has lived here their entire lives, who pays their taxes on time and then gets, you know, a curve ball 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 at the last minute that they have to shell this money out. Unacceptable . So anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : I agree. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. So if we can get that letter out as soon as possible I'd appreciate it. The only other thing I have is on Third Avenue we did speak to the Mayor about that situation . And again, I spoke to a gentleman out there. We really have to think -- and I'm glad the Mayor's committed to looking at this, you know, and trying to find another way to deal with this issue. It's not just one person that's complaining . It's not just two people that are complaining . It's literally every single person on the block. And I think I could speak 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 for everyone else as well. If I lived there and it went from a -- now, I have children like some other people do. If I lived there for my whole entire life and the block was quiet and no issues and all of a sudden I have, you know, trailers and trucks ripping down my street, it just -- it doesn't make sense. Why aren't we holding the companies ' feet to the fire? We've got to find out if we could, you know, do something about that. Unfortunately , the bridge has a weight limit on it. But there's got to be some other way to help these people out there. Again, we get phone calls. We get e-mails. And I'm really just sick and tired of telling these people that you got to wait until the bridge is open. It's not -- it's not acceptable to them. It's not acceptable to me. And, you know, we've got to find -- we've got to find another way to help them out. So hopefully I know the Mayor and the Chief of Police is hopefully working hard on getting that done. And that's all I have. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
