Dave Dobrzyn spoke on city business and matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. Motions . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, thank you. I only have one thing and it's just could wrap up a question that Ms. Jefferies had last week. We did get a speedy response back from Chief Graziano about the parking issues up in the Hill Section about they were just parking too close to intersection s and this is the chief's response . He has directed the civil parking enforcement to increase their enforcement efforts in the Hill and specifically the intersection s of Vine and Quincy, Vine and Clay, and Clay and Olive. So, hopefully , we get to remedy that and just seems like we just need some more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 enforcement in that part of the city when it comes to parking too close to the corner because it does become an issue. I know there is other sections in the city that, you know, you just have that one intersection where it just becomes a blind intersection if there is it parked car there so the Chief has committed to more enforcement in that area and we should so that problem cleared up sooner rather than later, and I'll hold everything else for our agenda items tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments . MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly , back in September Representative Flynn's Office had sent a letter to PennDOT regarding the intersection of Pittston Avenue and Orchard Sheet and the traffic signal being put in there. Over the weekend, there was another accident there on Friday, I believe it was. So, Mrs. Reed, we would be able to forward this to -- this letter we got from PennDOT with a couple of these options to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the administration and ask them to explore these options to possibly put a light at Orchard and Pittston Avenue? And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments . MR. EVANS: Yes, just briefly . So I note tonight 's business is very important , but sometimes it just doesn't seem that important when it's measured by what's happening all around us. For my very brief comments tonight I would like to take a moment to morn than the loss of another beautiful girl. She was taken last night from her family and her friends . I consider her parents among my very, very best friends and my heart is breaking for them. Another family left to deal with what has become a local and national epidemic and tragedy . When will it end? Another beautiful girl is gone. That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. As some of you may were noticed , the sidewalks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 are -- I don't know if they are closed officially yet around city hall, but we did receive correspondence from Mr. Bulzoni . They are doing an assessment of city hall to see what the deficiencies are and apparently structural engineers from the Highland Assessment regarding the large tower on top of city hall, their report is apparently going to conclude that the tower may be unsafe and they are recommending that the sidewalks being closed off until such time that the tower is repaired and made safe again. So from Mr. Bulzoni he spoke with Drew Marcinkevitch from Highland Associates . He concurred and a formal advisement is forthcoming, so I'm assuming council will get a copy of that and then the Highland assessment of city hall we should be receiving within two to three weeks. Last week we had sent a letter to the DPW about the 1500 block of Froud Avenue. There is a constant water runoff even a week after it rains and I talked about some of the issues there. I had a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 chance to talk to some more neighbors in that area and the issue is extremely dangerous . So I would like, Mrs. Reed, if you can follow-up and if you get a chance to speak to the DPW director just to see if there is anything that they can do to help those people out. Also, we received a letter from a resident of Morgan Manor Condominiums . I believe we received this complaint before, I'm not sure that there is anything that can be done, but if we can send something to the administration we have been getting a lot of complaints about the Morgan Highway up to the Morgan Manor, which is city-owned, being very dark because there is no lighting up there, so if we could submit this request and see what the administration can help out with that. Also, Councilman Donahue and I had met last week with the mayor, the superintendent of schools , Director Cognetti and Director Gilmartin from the school district regarding our shared services committee . We will have a report that we'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 present to council I believe next week and this is a something that we have been working on now for quite some time, so we met with different department heads from the city and from the school district . Some of the items, I just want to go through some of the things that we talked about, that we can possibly work with the school district on. Delinquent tax collection , the payroll tax conversion , the real estate tax discount period. We did talk about the ten-year citywide LERTA that's on our agenda for improvements in new construction so the school district apparently is going to discuss this at their next meeting , so that they'll possibly be included in that. Our IT Departments , printer copier services and maintenance , health care, the HUP test, recycling , purchasing of pool supplies , chemicals , crosswalk safety and pothole repair, grant writing services , procure ment card, complete count census committee and the Electric City Shock soccer field project . So these are all things that we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 discussed over the last few months. Like I said, we will have a report to present to council with some of these items and then, you, in our meeting in seemed like the mayor and the superintendent were really on board with trying to accomplish some of these things so, again, that was very hopeful . Also, tomorrow at 6:00 p.m. at the Theatre at North there are plans, I'm sure everyone has seen it in the newspaper , to replace the Greenridge Street bridge off of North Main Avenue so there will be a meeting tomorrow at 6 p.m. at the Theatre at North. The project engineers and PennDOT will be available , they will be discussing the project . This project is going to effect a lot of people and a lot of businesses . If you read the newspaper today there is several options that are considering so anyone in this area that may be effected or is interested in learning what the options are you should attend this meeting tomorrow morning at 6 p.m. It is open to the public. Also, I forwarded this to Mrs. Reed earlier today, but I did receive a very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 lengthy e-mail about the Keystone Rescue Mission which is on Olive Street. We have received complaints about that building and that establishment before. This gentleman had attached a video, an actual video clip to some of the things going on out there so I did forward that to Chief Graziano and waiting for a response from him on what might be able to be done. Also I received another concern from a resident in Minooka . The alley is escaping me right now but it's parallel to Birney Avenue. I have tried to help this gentleman out before to no avail. So, Mrs. Reed, I'll get you the alley and show you the information after the meeting but if we could send something to the DPW. This gentleman had sent me updated pictures and his yard is getting damaged from water runoff. Also, I had a meeting this week on something that we had discussed with the idea sessions in creating an internship opportunity between the University of Scranton and the city council office so I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 will be meeting with Julie Cohen from the University of Scranton this week to further discuss that initiative . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just one quick comment on non-agenda items. Regarding the article and I think a couple of the speakers brought it up with the police and fire overtime . I do kind of want to echo what was mention ed by one of the speakers that, you know, when you see on the front page of the newspaper somebody making a six figure salary it may cause you pause, but also remember that these individuals in our police and fire department are out there risking their lives every day to keep us safe. Not only that, when they are working overtime it is exactly that, overtime . Time that they are taking away from their families on nights and weekend or days and weekend depending on what shift they work and, obviously , if they are working extra hours they need to be compensated . Personally , I support hiring more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 officers and more firefighters as a way to cut down on overtime which provides better protection and also cuts down on the overtime costs. Now, I understand there is health care -- if you are hiring more people there is health care costs, there is pension costs so sometimes overtime can actually be less expensive than hiring additional employees . The numbers are always large. They have actually gotten better, which was highlighted in the article since the new contracts were passed and, you know, I just want to reiterate that we appreciate all of the work of our police and firefighters . I know often times they don't get the appreciation that they deserve so I just wanted to mention that. And that's all. MS. REED: 5-B.

READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 38, 2018 - AN ORDINANCE - APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2019 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2019. MR. ROGAN: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A, what is your pleasure ? MR. PERRY: I move that 6-A pass reading by title. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Last week I posed a number of questions to the administration so we did put that in writing and send it to the mayor's office and copied Mr. Bulzoni . When Mr. Bulzoni came tonight he did present us with a lengthy list of responses so I obviously need more time since I'm just seeing this to take a look and ask any follow-up questions if need be, but I do appreciate the response to what looks like each one of my questions . Just a general comment , and I mention ed this last week, but I still am concerned , and obviously there will be more light shed after I go through the answers to my questions from last week, but I do think we should invite the Pennsylvania Economy League into our caucus next week if possible , and I say that just I think it is a matter of the practice we should, since they are our recovery coordinator , but when they issued their letter to council , which they usually do, I look at the expenditures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 and we are way over from what the planned projection s were for 2019. I mention ed this last week but we are 106 percent over what the plan calls for in capital expenditures . We are $7 million over total from what the plan called for in expenditures and what the proposed budget calls for. We are also nearly $8 million over, actually nearly $9 million over what the plan called for in revenues and what the budget is proposing, but most importantly what concerns me is the expenditures . I do think that we need to have PEL in to discuss that and just their general outlook on the city's finances , so I would appreciate . In fact, I'd like to make a motion that city council invite the Pennsylvania Economy League in next week to discuss the 2019 budget. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. ROGAN: I agree with having PEL come in if we can. Obvioiusly , we are not giving them a ton of notice, but if they are able to come in I certainly would support 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 that as well. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : The other thing, I have mentioned this really since I have been on council but, you know, just as a matter of practice , just so people understand , we are voting on a budget that is well over $100 million so I think, and I talked to Mr. Bulzoni earlier today about this and he agrees as well, moving forward we really should have budget work session s leading up to the actual budget being placed on our agenda. You know, it's difficult to get the budget and then have three weeks, ask questions , get a response and then have to put your name on this budget within that time period. The school district has budget work session s, other similarly sized 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 municipalities have budget work sessions really throughout the year so I think moving forward next year this council should request that. I think it would be very beneficial for all involved in the budget process . Thank you. MR. EVANS: On that question , I have been a proponent of work session since I have been on council . I find them to be very effective so I certainly would support that and we could certainly start with the budget process . MR. ROGAN: Just one brief comment , also in the letter that Councilman Gaughan cited, I'm going to read the whole thing, I think it's about three pages, a couple of the highlights from the coordinator of PEL it states, "According to interviews , this positive change is a measure of the city's project toward a continued and sustain able financial position to the future." I know some will state concerns about rising costs, and just as when we do our budgets at home, unfortunately , costs are increasing for everyone , but the good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 news is although costs are increasing by 7 1/2 percent , revenues increase d by 9.9 percent , so our revenues are outpacing our cost increases which means one of two things. It means that we are balanced or it means we are actually collecting too much money and then you look to start to reduce taxes. Regarding the large increase for capital expenditures , I think this is long overdue after decades of neglect and it's not the fault of previous councils or previous mayors, the city just does not have the money to invest in infrastructure . The city was worried about keeping the lights on and providing basic services . Because we are in a much better position financially now, we can put that investment into infrastructure . You have seen it with the road paving program over the last number of years. The streetlight program . It's no secret city hall needs a massive overhaul . There is a number of other issues, roads and bridges are still not what they should be in the city, so as far as the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 infrastructure spending , you know, I think we need to even spend more on infrastructure . Obviously , it needs to be done in a measured approach and I think we are on the right path but there is still a lot of work to do on the infrastructure side, not only what the residents see but also what they don't see. Equipment for our police and firefighters , our DPW as well with new plows and, you know, we are starting to see the results of a number of these items so there are with any budget pluses and minuses and it's nice to see these figures laid out, but it is good that our projected revenues are outpacing projected expenditures which is a very good sign. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MS. Reed: 6-B.

EVANS: On the question . According to Mr. Bulzoni 's accounting of it, and I had this conversation with him prior to, we have actually exceeded budget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 expectations in Year 2015, 2016, 2017, and I fully expect us to meet the budget line item this year as well so I think our strategy is working , people are starting to buy houses in Scranton again. I had a report from the Greater Scranton Board of Realtors for the last 12 months so I'll just go over it briefly just to give you an idea of what I think is happening . New listing are up .050 percent that's good news because the market is tightening up. Pending sales are up 7 percent , this is for the last 12 months, closed sales are up almost 5 percent . The median sale price for a house in the Scranton area is up 20 percent and the average sale price in Scranton is up to 17 percent . Also, days on market is down by 25 percent , so we are trending in the right direction . By taking action like this I think we will continue to do that. I'm going to actually talk to Mr. Bulzoni and see if we can get some harder numbers on where we are this year because maybe we can actually even look at another modest reduction for 2019.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Public Works? MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I had questions about this last week as well. We did receive a response from our city solicitor -- or not city solicitor , city engineer , John Pocius. He said that once this resolution is passed tonight it will be sent back to PennDOT and fully executed . That's when PennDOT will start 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 the design consultant selection process . The city in essence is turning the complete control of those bridges over to PennDOT . So, as I mentioned last week, that would be West Lackawanna Avenue bridge over the railroad , Elm Street bridge over the Lackawanna River, North Main avenue bridge over Leggett 's Creek and the Parker Street bridge over the Lackawanna River. The selection of a design consultant should be completed by next summer hopefully , three or four years usually for design, hopefully construction will begin after that. Mr. Pocius said that each bridge will probably be on a different schedule so construction could start in five years. This project is extremely important . As everybody knows, our bridges are not in the best of shape so the state picking up 95 percent of the tab on this is a huge help. I did ask Mr. Bulzoni prior to the meeting tonight how the city was going to account for the 5 percent match that we are going to be required to pay which will be $1.1 million roughly and this was included 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 in our capital budget so that is accounted for.
