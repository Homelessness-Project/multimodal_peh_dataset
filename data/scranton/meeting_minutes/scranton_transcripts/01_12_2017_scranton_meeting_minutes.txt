CITIZENS' 12 PARTICIPATION. 13 MR. WECHSLER: Joan Hodowanitz. 14 MS. HODOWANITZ: Joan Hodowanitz, 15 city resident and taxpayer. If you get the 16 opportunity would you, please, plant a bug 17 in the administration's ear to get them to 18 put the 2017 budget on their webpage, it 19 would be nice. 20 With regard to 5-C, the contract for 21 our Arcadis to do the preliminary storm 22 water analysis. I couldn't find it, but if 23 you can say in Fifth Order is there is any 24 kind of deadline for them to complete this 25 6 analysis so we have a sense of when we are 1 going to get that kind of information. If 2 it's at the end of the year, it's going to 3 be after election and I would like to see 4 this information before we go to the polls. 5 With regard to the Items 5-D and 6 5-E, correct me if I'm wrong, but on 7 December 15 didn't council vote to approve 8 termination of the Scranton Sewer Authority?9 MR. WECHSLER: It was conditional 10 based upon all of the closing requirements 11 being met by the Sewer Authority of the 12 Pennsylvania American Water. 13 MS. HODOWANITZ: Have they been met? 14 MR. WECHSLER: They still have the 15 lawsuit, they still have the easement cases, 16 so there is still some outstanding bills and 17 other issues. 18 MS. HODOWANITZ: So basically we are 19 still going to have the Scranton Sewer 20 Authority board -- 21 MR. WECHSLER: Correct. 22 MS. HODOWANITZ: -- potentially 23 until 2022. 24 MR. WECHSLER: Possibly. Probably 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 7 to 10 of 89 4 of 25 sheets7 not. 1 MS. HODOWANITZ: God help us. Okay. 2 I saw in the paper that the RFQ for third 3 party administration self-insured worker's 4 comp and heart and lung claims third party 5 administration, do we have any kind of 6 status on when the RFP for the third party 7 administrator of the pension funds? 8 MR. WECHSLER: Not at this time. 9 MS. HODOWANITZ: Okay. Do we have 10 any kind of status on potential pension 11 reforms prior to any of the future of cash 12 into the pension fund from the City of Sewer 13 Authority? 14 MR. EVANS: Well, the status would 15 be that in my opinion there won't be any 16 infusion in the pensions until there are 17 further pension reforms. 18 MS. HODOWANITZ: So it will be 19 interesting. Also, with regard to the Sewer 20 Authority sale, I remember last week you 21 also all asking questions about who, what 22 and when, have you gotten any information 23 from the administration that you can share 24 with us tonight? 25 8 MR. WECHSLER: No. We actually 1 requested the information from the Sewer 2 Authority, their counsel. We submitted a 3 letter to them, I believe, on January 12, 4 and we requested them to respond to our 5 questions by the 18th. 6 MS. HODOWANITZ: All right. So 7 hopefully next week. Do we have any idea of 8 the impact on the 2017 budget with the 9 reduced sale price of the proceeds? Has 10 anybody taken a look at how that will effect 11 the budget? 12 MR. WECHSLER: I don't think it 13 will. 14 MR. EVANS: The only thing that 15 would effect the budget would be if we don't 16 pay off the high interest debt that was 17 assumed in the budget and that is absolutely 18 requirement number one, and then there is 19 certainly plenty of money to do that. 20 MS. HODOWANITZ: Okay, but we don't 21 have any specific breakdown of whatever 22 proceeds we get, what will a portion of 23 what? 24 MR. EVANS: Well, the modeling is 259 continuing, it's going to be part of the 1 revised recovery plan, but it will done 2 before that. 3 MS. HODOWANITZ: Okay, and yesterday 4 with the little ice storm that we had, I was 5 tramping over to the Cathedral at 6:00 in 6 the morning, did anybody see any salt trucks 7 anywhere in the city yesterday morning?8 MR. WECHSLER: They were on East 9 Mountain. 10 MS. HODOWANITZ: Say again? 11 MR. WECHSLER: They were on East 12 Mountain. 13 MS. HODOWANITZ: They were on East 14 Mountain. I didn't see anybody downtown, 15 was there anybody else in any other section 16 shun of the city? It was pretty 17 treacherous. All right, thank you. 18 MR. GAUGHAN: Thank you. 19 MR. WECHSLER: Les Spindler. 20 MR. SPINDLER: Good evening, 21 Council. Les Spindler, city resident, 22 homeowner and taxpayer. Well, I have been 23 coming up here for years, and years and 24 years talking about the illegal garbage fee 25 10 and I was thrilled to see that somebody has 1 finally a lawsuit against the city. It's 2 unfortunate for the city because we can't 3 afford to pay off another lawsuit, but I 4 blame this council, I blame previous 5 councils, previous mayors that have been 6 coming here for countless years saying it's 7 illegal, nobody listened and now we are 8 being sued. You people last year said you 9 were going to talk about different ways to 10 do away with it, you did nothing. The only 11 person I heard that had one idea is 12 Councilman Rogan, at least he had an idea. 13 I don't agree with his per bag fee, but at 14 least he had an idea. You people are to 15 blame for this lawsuit, you and previous 16 councils. Nobody wants to listen. It's 17 just going to cost the city money and that's 18 unfortunate. 19 Moving on, I was a little upset to 20 see that two more sores are moving out of 21 the Mall, Victoria Secret and Bath and Body 22 Works, two of the main staples in that 23 store, and it was on the news that they are 24 going to be replaced. Well, you know, I did 255 of 25 sheets Page 11 to 14 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM11 agree with Mr. Basalyga when he took over 1 the mall, I thought he was doing a good job, 2 but I disagree with what he is doing. I 3 think he is trying to make that an office 4 building instead of a mall. Instead of 5 finding replacements, why didn't he do his 6 best to keep these two businesses in the 7 mall? He should have given them incentives 8 to stay there instead of saying goodbye and 9 trying to get new businesses. I was 10 impressed in the beginning, but I'm not 11 anymore. I don't know think he is the one 12 for the job. 13 The safety issue now, I live in 14 Tripp Park I walk my dog down Dorothy Street 15 ever day by the ball fields. At the very 16 end of the ball fields, there is batting 17 cages. At the end of the fence, there is a 18 storm drain, right next to the storm drain 19 about two weeks ago a big hole opened up. 20 It's about two-feet wide, two-feet deep, and 21 it's right off the sidewalk. I think that's 22 a safety issue. When I saw it, I wasn't 23 sure if anybody called. I figured I'd 24 mention while I came here. You know, it's 25 12 right at the end of the ball field on the 1 grass, you can't miss it, just past the 2 batting cages. 3 Next thing, I think it was last 4 month, Councilman Perry, you made a motion 5 to adjust legislation about the left-turn 6 lane on Oram Street and Main Avenue, I 7 think, I know I spoke about that. There is 8 another one I also spoke about it's on 9 Jackson Street Main Avenue, we need a left 10 turn lane there going south. 11 MR. PERRY: I'm familiar with it 12 right on the intersection? 13 MR. SPINDLER: Yes. It's headed 14 south. There used to be one there then 15 after they paved it they never put one 16 there. I have brought that up before. And 17 lastly, I know in Tripp Park people put 18 their Christmas trees out, they used to have 19 them down at the end of Bulworth Street by 20 the ball fields, I don't know if they still 21 have that anymore, but I noticed the people 22 in my area they are just putting them out on 23 their lawns waiting for garbage pickup. I 24 don't think the garbage men will take them, 2513 but I'm not sure. I don't know if anybody 1 knows anything about that. For years they 2 have been put down by the ball fields. They 3 only have to go to one spot to pick them up 4 and recycle them. I don't think they should 5 be taken by the garbage, I think they should 6 be taken somewhere and recycled. 7 MR. EVANS: I agree. 8 MR. SPINDLER: If we could look into 9 that. 10 MR. ROGAN: I did see in my 11 neighborhood a couple of trees get thrown in 12 the back of the garbage truck, 13 unfortunately, and -- 14 MR. SPINDLER: That's not right. 15 MR. ROGAN: No, it's not. 16 MR. SPINDLER: They used to grind 17 them up and use it for mulch and stuff like 18 that. 19 MR. EVANS: Right. I thought I read 20 somewhere in the paper that that's what they 21 were instructing everybody to do was put 22 them out on the curb. I agree they should 23 be recycled. 24 MR. SPINDLER: For years, like I 25 14 said, where I live they have been taking 1 them down by the ball fields. 2 MR. EVANS: They should at least 3 give somebody the option of doing what 4 exactly what you are saying, take them some 5 place in a central area, if you want to, so 6 they will be recycled. 7 MR. SPINDLER: All right. If you 8 can look into that. Thank you. 9 MR. WECHSLER: Bob Bolus. 10 MR. BOLUS: Good evening, Council. 11 Bob Bolus, Scranton. You know, I was out of 12 town and I come back here and, you know, I 13 started reading some of the things that went 14 on here, I have never seen more inefficient 15 leadership than what we are seeing now. 16 Your business administrator, the guru of 17 finances, doesn't know what the heck we are 18 getting, how much it cost, doesn't 19 understand debit and credit, two plus two is 20 two, two minus two is zero, to know how much 21 money we are getting out of these sales? We 22 are totally clueless. Nobody has a 23 direction of what we are going to do, where 24 we are going to do, how we are going to pay 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 15 to 18 of 89 6 of 25 sheets15 it off. What are we going to do in the 1 future?2 And then simplicity, and the 3 absolute joke in I don't know what that is, 4 I can't even read it, "D" and "E", we have 5 two authorities, what are we doing with the 6 Sewer Authority? I thought we sold 7 everything. What incompetent individuals 8 sold the assets and then you have an 9 Authority that you are going to beg people 10 or have people on a payroll. 11 MR. WECHSLER: There is no one on 12 the payroll. It's just a board. 13 MR. BOLUS: Why do we have even have 14 the authority at all? 15 MR. WECHSLER: Because there is 16 outstanding -- outstanding litigation and 17 outstanding bills. 18 MR. BOLUS: That passes onto the 19 other end. You don't need people in the 20 Authority to sit there on outstanding bills 21 and issues. That's your business 22 administrator should know what the hell he 23 is doing. 24 You also got the same issue with 25 16 your Parking Authority, keeping the Parking 1 Authorities. What do we need all of these 2 authorities for those operations? It's 3 ludicrous. On this here, I'd like see $3.5 4 million put back into where the golf course 5 money came out, like it should have stayed 6 there perpetually and the interest only 7 perpetually to be used for park and 8 recreation. That's common sense. 9 You know, it's like asking you guys, 10 how many of you guys have millions of 11 dollars to throw around and just squander it 12 here and squander it there and then wonder 13 if you are broke tomorrow. That's what we 14 are doing here. I just get sick to my 15 stomach watching stupidity that goes on with 16 this administration downstairs. Your 17 business administration is a great guru, he 18 can save this. You don't sell assets that 19 can make you money and then squander the 20 money after you get more assets other than 21 the Taj Mahal here of higher learning, is 22 that what this is? You know, I hate to come 23 in and insult people, but I have lived in 24 this community my whole life. I have been a 2517 business here, I know what it takes to be a 1 builder, and what I see here between counsel 2 the administration you are not builders, you 3 are actually destroyers of our tax base. 4 You are destroying it. You gave $5 million 5 to the mall for parking. Who the heck cares 6 if somebody comes to Scranton and parks in 7 the mall? Put it towards your pension fund, 8 put it towards something else. Put it 9 towards tax reduction to the people. You 10 give it to the mall? You give him almost $2 11 million to pick up a parking garage to fix 12 it? That's $7 million. Would you spend 13 your 7 million bucks like that? I don't 14 think so, but this is what's wrong with 15 what's going on, so let look at it a little 16 differently. It's up to you gentlemen and 17 the mayor to reassess the mall. It's still 18 assessed at $3 million. Complete ludicrous 19 actions of what we are doing. I don't know 20 care how much Basalyga makes, all the money 21 he makes doesn't put it in your pocket, 22 doesn't give you a million dollars. Doesn't 23 give anybody out here a million bucks or 24 $1,000 or anybody to go anywhere else, but 25 18 he will buy more and more and more because 1 of our stupidity and our leadership and the 2 trust we put in people. I'm asking here and 3 now that you people push to reassess that 4 mall at what it should be. 5 When I bought the Holy Cross Church, 6 just like that they reassessed it at a half 7 a million bucks. A church they were going 8 to tear it down, a hall that I let the kids 9 play free in, yet, nobody said nothing about 10 it. I want the mall reassessed. That's our 11 right in this community and that's your job. 12 Your job is to build a tax base, not 13 decrease it, and you just can't keep doing 14 and doing what's going on here. I mean, we 15 are going bullied every day we walk into the 16 city. 17 Now, as you know, I brought the 18 Trump organization to Scranton, I brought us 19 into the limelight worldwide, not locally, 20 worldwide. I was proud to say I was from 21 Scranton, but let me tell you something, 22 what I can see now, I'm ashamed of myself to 23 say I'm from Scranton when I see the 24 incompetence of the leadership and there he 257 of 25 sheets Page 19 to 22 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM19 wants to drain the swamp. Here we need to 1 drain the mines and get action, get 2 aggressive, and do what leadership is 3 supposed to do, that's lead by example. You 4 are not doing it. 5 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. 6 MR. BOLUS: Assess the mall, let's 7 be fair for everybody in this town and 8 that's your job to do and I think the mayor 9 has got to get off his butt and start doing 10 something instead of talking. And as far as 11 Amoroso goes, I wish he went back to Newark 12 where he belongs because he's not the kind 13 of guy to build this city. You do not get 14 rid of your assets, be left with a pension 15 debt and a future debt. You guys have no 16 idea how much you are going to pay it. 17 Thank you. 18 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. 19 Ron Ellman. 20 MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council. I 21 phoned a friend of mine last night in 22 Hawaii, it was 84 degrees. I just thought 23 I'd throw that in. In the paper last week 24 was a little article from 50 years ago it 25 20 says the Scranton School Board and the 1 Council were trying to get together to 2 figure out how to recover some lost taxes. 3 Fifty years went by, still nothing is done. 4 That Pennwood Manor is full. I don't know 5 how many been through there, they owe 6 $52,000, why won't somebody just close it? 7 They are never going to pay us. Why don't 8 you close it and squeeze some money out of 9 them. That bad D & D is over 100 real 10 estate companies in developers, some of them 11 are receiving our taxpayer money in gold and 12 grants and loan forgiveness. They owe 13 hundreds of thousands of dollars, some of 14 you saw it in the paper. Why don't they do 15 something? Why can't these houses be 16 condemned until they pay us for these 17 properties. You go after somebody who was 18 in the same paper for $300 while these 19 people owe hundreds of thousands. You guys 20 need to do something to earn your keep up 21 there. I don't know. I don't know what we 22 are getting for our dollar. I'm not 23 scolding you, it just comes out. 24 Our mayor mistakenly shouts praises 2521 for the Amoroso plan. This is one of the 1 biggest causes of the whole mess financially 2 that we are in. From the rooftops the other 3 day everything was the Amoroso plan and how 4 great it is, how great the city is doing. 5 It's not. You know, all I hear you're just 6 interested in wasting more money downtown 7 and taking care of the mall. You don't take 8 of our neighborhoods. My neighbor pays $100 9 (unintelligible), he is out of Avoca. You 10 have allowed him to destroy a whole 11 neighborhood without lifting a finger. 12 Nothing, and nothing is being done about all 13 of these people and there is no doubt that 14 the people are just going to be hit terrible 15 by the new skyrocketing rates. You won't be 16 able to flush a toilet or something, it's 17 going to be -- this deal is just rushed 18 through without any thinking, without all of 19 the knowledgeable people that were involved 20 and gave advice and knew what to do. 21 This is the Amoroso plan at work, 22 6,000 people in foreclosures. Money just 23 being wasted, just like the giving away of 24 the parking garage. Our voices aren't 25 22 heard. People tell you things up here week 1 after week and they just go in one ear and 2 out the other. This administration doesn't 3 hear a thing that people say or do or 4 comment. It's like a factious regime down 5 there that just won't hear the individuals 6 no more. We put you in those seats and you 7 don't care. You don't care what everybody 8 says in here. There is all kinds of great 9 suggestions week after week after week that 10 go nowhere. They are not even mentioned in 11 the paper. This is a -- this no way to run 12 a city, I tell you. 13 I get the Memphis paper every so 14 often and they don't have problems like 15 this. They don't have the runaway, 16 out-of-control school board, there is over 17 800 teachers for over 10,000 people, pupils. 18 What's that like, a dozen pupils for every 19 teacher and all they do is whine and 20 complain they can't handle what's going on 21 and then we have to listen to this nonsense 22 about pensions. They create poverty. They 23 create these problems just like you have 24 done up there. You are not taking care of 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 23 to 26 of 89 8 of 25 sheets23 the city like it should be. Thank you. 1 MR. GAUGHAN: Thank you. 2 MR. ELLMAN: And I expected to see 3 you at the blight meeting and you weren't 4 there. It was very good and I really 5 learned a few things I didn't know nothing 6 about, you know. It was a very good meeting 7 and you need to congratulate them. It's a 8 good plan.9 MR. GAUGHAN: Thank you. 10 MR. WECHSLER: Lee Morgan. 11 MR. MORGAN: Good evening, Council. 12 You know, tonight, you know, I just hope 13 that the residents of this city would pay 14 attention to the things I'm going to say 15 tonight, not that you don't generally pay 16 attention to every speaker, but there is an 17 election year coming and it's so vitally 18 important and, look it, don't let 19 personalities come into this, you got to 20 clean house this time. The three council 21 members that are seated are going to be up 22 have to go. The mayor has to go. We just 23 can't create another authority in this city 24 and we have got to realize from the give and 25 24 take that we have had here in this chamber 1 that none of the people that were elected to 2 represent us had any idea what this deal 3 meant or how it was structured. 4 Now, I will acknowledge that, you 5 know, they probably didn't have the 6 experience necessary to understand that, but 7 they could have reached out to the people 8 and they never should have even introduced 9 this legislation and that goes to the 10 council president because I don't think a 11 council president should introduce 12 legislation he doesn't understand, and I 13 don't think that legislators should vote on 14 something they don't understand. 15 And what's happened in this city for 16 a long time is too many people in this city 17 came up with excuses why we kept following 18 this train and there was really no need for 19 it because the decline in our neighborhoods 20 was caused by the voters, and it's time 21 really, really time to stand up and vote all 22 of these people out of office and everybody 23 over the top of them. 24 Now, we just through Hillary Clinton 2525 in the water nationally, okay? She never 1 should have came out, Bernie Sanders should 2 have came out but, you know, they are 3 talking about how the Russians hacked us. 4 You know, look it, America has been playing 5 in other people's elections for decades, but 6 now we really know the stuff that's going on 7 behind the scenes. All of the pay-to-play 8 politics and all of the corruption, and I 9 have to say to the seniors and the young 10 people in this community, why do you have to 11 live like this? Why do we have all of this 12 blight in the neighborhood? Why is all of 13 the money going into the downtown? Where 14 did Mr. Amoroso come from? Why were these 15 assets sold? Why are we trying to discuss 16 where the proceeds from this sale are going 17 to go when the pension is so severely 18 underfunded? Why? I don't even understand 19 why a lot of these things even took place 20 considering that they haven't made the city 21 solvent and they haven't answered one 22 financial problem this city has, and I have 23 to ask why we are not cutting the budget. 24 And the city doesn't even have a 25 26 plan for the storm water collection system, 1 as a matter of fact, in the deal they gave 2 away the money to maintain the storm water 3 collection system because it was already in 4 the old rate, but then we have elected 5 officials here who have no concern for the 6 people who elect them, have no concern for 7 the legislation they introduced in this 8 chamber, and the damage they do to our city 9 and our neighborhoods, and they all look 10 good with their little pretty suits on, but 11 like I said here once before at this podium, 12 we sent the monkey around the earth in a 13 space suit but he wasn't an astronaut. 14 And, you know, when you listen to 15 the silliness and the questions asked here 16 week after week and no answers, why would 17 they care what the surfs say as long you do 18 what you are told? And that's exactly what 19 it's come to in our country, is that our 20 elected government thinks that we are their 21 servant. They take our pay, they tax it, 22 they waste every dime they collect and then 23 we put people in cheap suits in front of us, 24 well, probably expensive suits, but they 259 of 25 sheets Page 27 to 30 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM27 offer no meaningful legislation, and here's 1 the city that's been distressed for over 25 2 years and don't have one answer and neither 3 does our state representatives or our state 4 senators, and what did our federal senators 5 and federal congressmen have to offer us? 6 Nothing. It's very troubling, extremely 7 troubling. So do we really have an elected 8 government by the people for the people, or 9 are we just cash cows that you roll out and 10 patronize at election time and rob us the 11 rest of the time? Because we still have no 12 storm water collection plan ahead of us, and 13 the truth of the matter is the city has to 14 cut it's budget to fund that, okay? We 15 don't need another authority, we don't need 16 anybody else borrowing and borrowing and 17 piling more debt on us, look at the average 18 homeowner in this city, their properties are 19 worthless basically, and then we have a 20 council that's talks about reassessment. 21 Well, Mr. Bolus just brought that up at the 22 mall, but I guess it's who you are connected 23 to and whether things work for you or not. 24 Thank you, and I hope the people vote all of 25 28 these people out of office. 1 MR. WECHSLER: Anyone else? 2 MS. SCHUMACHER: Good evening. 3 Marie Schumacher. I, too, was confused when 4 I opened the paper and saw in the legal 5 section that the Scranton Sewer Authority's 6 meetings, they're quarterly meetings now 7 instead of monthly for the Year 2017. I 8 think you are sending mixed messages to us. 9 You terminated it, are you trying to tell us 10 that this sewer deal is going to go on 11 through 2017 or God forbid five years? 12 MR. WECHSLER: The obligation of the 13 Sewer Authority will, yes. 14 MS. SCHUMACHER: They will do what? 15 MR. WECHSLER: The obligation for 16 the Sewer Authority, I'll read an 17 explanation later on. 18 MS. SCHUMACHER: Thank you. I hope 19 you are available for questions after that. 20 The list of the questions last week you said 21 that you were going to ask the mayor whether 22 or not he knew about the shortfall before 23 the -- second before it hit the papers and 24 we found out at the closing that we were 2529 short, why was the letter sent to the 1 Scranton Sewer Authority instead of the 2 mayor? 3 MR. WECHSLER: Because the questions 4 that were generated from council were really 5 questions for the Sewer Authority because 6 they handle the negotiations. 7 MS. SCHUMACHER: Can we get a copy 8 of those questions? 9 MR. WECHSLER: If council doesn't 10 mind, yes. 11 MR. GAUGHAN: Well, it's a public 12 document, so -- 13 MR. WECHSLER: And we just give them 14 the courtesy to get the questions answered. 15 MS. SCHUMACHER: Well, I would like 16 a copy. Also, can we get a copy of the RFP 17 or at least the statement of the work for 18 the 5-C contract that you will be voting in 19 favor of next week for the storm water? I'd 20 like to know what's in that and a 21 Right-to-Know isn't going to do anything, so 22 if you have that I would like to get a copy 23 of that to review. Thank you. 24 It's been a couple of the weeks 25 30 since I reported on the home sales, or the 1 sales of property I should say. Through 2 today's paper, there have been 2,129 3 properties in the county that have been 4 sold. Of those 489 or 23 percent of them 5 have been Scranton properties and of those 6 489, 48 percent have been below the common 7 level ratio. I mean, that's been pretty 8 consistent, but what blew me away is when I 9 posted the sale of the Samter's building. 10 Now, I was happy that Mr. Jefferson got it 11 because he seems to do very good job with 12 every property that he has, but that 13 property, improvements on that property with 14 just the building itself $10,000. Now, if 15 that doesn't scream for reassessment I'd 16 like to know what does. I mean, he 17 bought -- first of all, he buys the building 18 for 5.3, an actual ratio of 5.3, not even 19 close to the 6.94 CLR and, I mean, that is 20 totally crazy. 21 Now, what I'm going to ask you 22 people to do you, as a taxing authority, 23 have the ability to go to any of those 24 meetings, you have the ability to ask for a 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 31 to 34 of 89 10 of 25 sheets31 reassessment of any property up or down, 1 would you start taking advantage of that? 2 This is crazy. I mean, I just -- I'm going 3 to go down and check the card because I 4 can't believe that posting would be real. 5 MR. EVANS: Yeah, I can't either. 6 That can't be right. 7 MS. SCHUMACHER: Do you have the 8 breakdown of the costs of the parking lease 9 transaction that were associated with that 10 and the Sewer Authority sale to date? 11 MR. EVANS: Well, some of the -- we 12 are working on those costs for the Sewer 13 Authority, but I don't have it for the 14 Parking Authority. That was one of 15 questions in our letter. 16 MR. GAUGHAN: Someone with the 17 Parking Authority, and we just got it in our 18 mail tonight, somebody sent us this. I'm 19 just looked at it briefly before the 20 meeting, but someone sent us a breakdown of 21 the legal fees for the Parking Authority. 22 Is that what you looking for? 23 MS. SCHUMACHER: Well, all of 24 incidentals, whether it was legal fees or 25 32 financially, anything that was associated, 1 what we paid for that. 2 MR. GAUGHAN: I believe this is it, 3 but I'd have to look at it for you. 4 MS. SCHUMACHER: Well, I don't know, 5 I mean, I don't know where they got that -- 6 you received it. I would prefer that you 7 validate that first with the authorities 8 before you do that. 9 Also, you approve over the course of 10 a year a lot of grant applications 11 submittals, if I may finish this, I would 12 like to request that you start tracking 13 those and let us know what happens so that 14 we can -- whether those grants are actually 15 obtained or whether they expired. I don't 16 know, does a grant applications expire? I 17 would assume there is a closure date? 18 MR. WECHSLER: It depends. It 19 depends where you're applying. 20 MS. SCHUMACHER: Well, could we 21 start tracking those and having the office 22 keep a log of those? 23 MR. ROGAN: They don't expire. They 24 are either approved or denied at the end of 2533 the grant, particularly the LSA's or the -1 MS. SCHUMACHER: Well, that's what I 2 just said. So, okay, if that's true then I 3 would ask that you would start tracking 4 those. If I approve them, we should track 5 them. Thank you. I'll be back next week 6 with the rest, good Lord willing. 7 MR. DOBRZYN: Good evening, Council. 8 Dave Dobrzyn, resident, taxpayer. First, 9 I'd like to mention tonight our Lackawanna 10 and Wyoming "T" in the road by the mall, 11 something has got to get done with that. 12 MR. EVANS: You know, I agree 100 13 percent. 14 MR. DOBRZYN: People got -- knocked 15 over a guy with-- 16 MR. EVANS: I understand that, but 17 if you're going down Wyoming Avenue, the 18 light turns green, people walking across 19 Wyoming the light is green, if you're 20 walking across Lackawanna you have the walk 21 sign. It's bizarre. I know they made some 22 changes but that -- 23 MR. DOBRZYN: I had a lady, I had 24 about three or four feet to stop in a week 25 34 or so. 1 MR. EVANS: I don't know why they 2 can't do what they did at the University of 3 Scranton and Linden Street and Jefferson, 4 just stop traffic from all points of that 5 intersection -- 6 MR. DOBRZYN: It's a must. 7 MR. EVANS: -- for people to walk. 8 MR. DOBRZYN: It's a must. It's 9 gone too far. I have a big foot and it 10 seems like the design of my car, the size 12 11 shoe fits right over both brakes and 12 accelerator and I have to watch that all of 13 the time, but that lady had about five feet 14 and I was already making the turn. It's 15 bad. 16 One of the things I caught in the 17 sewer thing was there was -- out of that 38 18 million there was 12 million allegedly done 19 in upgrades, and I don't know why, but 20 apparently the water company didn't consider 21 that work paid for, there's a little concern 22 there 12 million. 23 And with these trash lawsuits from 24 landlords, first of all, we still don't know 2511 of 25 sheets Page 35 to 38 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM35 how many units they have in many cases, so 1 I'll mention that on behalf of the city, we 2 have to find out, but landlords especially 3 have a lot -- or potentially a lot of people 4 to the school system, and it's very 5 expensive. We had two families move into a 6 four-unit that I was renting years ago and 7 that's when the consternation started, and 8 up in the country it's not the Sewer 9 Authority, it's the septic tank, so we are 10 getting really to a point where there were 11 ready to just shut us down and tell us we 12 had to move over, and when I heard between 13 the lines, because I got to know a lot of 14 people in town, I live here about 13 years, 15 lucky number, but the house caught fire in 16 13 years, it was more of an issue of a lot 17 of people moving in with children. They 18 didn't want the amount of children 19 increasing in the school district thanks to 20 a landlord, so -- which it is an expense and 21 it's not spread out very well, the whole 22 system isn't. 23 Now, just briefly, I have a little 24 thing here, I got some bad news I'm okay, 25 36 but I had to stress test because I don't 1 know what's going to be happening with 2 insurance in the future, so I thought I 3 would take advantage of it, it's been a long 4 time since I had one, but I got this little 5 form on Geisinger, "You may qualify for 6 assistance if your household income is 300 7 percent or less than current federal poverty 8 guidelines. To determine if you qualify for 9 financial assistance, here's the income 10 matrix book as a guide to determine whether 11 your income is less than -- " well, yada, 12 yada. Household size 1, 35,640 -- $36,640, 13 so the point is our Congress is messing 14 around with the insurance and plans to 15 repeal and whatever, but this is based on a 16 law that was enacted during Ronald Reagan 17 years and because people were laying out in 18 the ER room and not dying, you know, outside 19 of the ER room. I'll try and bring this 20 back next week, but the point being get 21 ready and if that be the case you might be 22 going to a third rate hospital some day even 23 though you are paying off a grand for 24 insurance. Thank you and have a good night. 2537 Don't believe everything you hear. 1 MR. SBARAGLIA: Andy Sbaraglia, 2 citizen of Scranton. Fellow Scrantonians, 3 you claim that had nothing to do with the 4 sale of the Sewer authority, didn't you, 5 every one of your members vote for the 6 recovery plan, and didn't the recovery plan 7 call for the sell of the Sewer authority?8 MR. WECHSLER: Yes, it did. 9 MR. SBARAGLIA: Selling the assets 10 and leasing the assets, so you can't wash 11 your hands of it. Your hands are in there 12 just as well as anyone else, plus you 13 concurred with the people that are put on 14 the Board that did sell the Sewer Authority. 15 And another thing is you cannot 16 dissolve the Sewer Authority unless they 17 dissolve it themselves. I was told the only 18 way an Authority can be dissolved is they 19 have to do it, and they were given $5 20 million to forget about doing it until that 21 money is gone. This is what I mean. That 22 deal was not a great deal. I just got a 23 letter, I guess every resident in Scranton 24 got one, too, saying you will not be billed 25 38 once a month for the sewer cost. Now, I 1 haven't seen the actual cost of it, but I 2 don't know, as you know, there is a fixed 3 cost associated with it. Currently we're 4 paying $5 a month for the fixed cost. I 5 don't know what the fixed cost will be under 6 the water company. Did you ever ask what 7 the fixed cost would be? No, I don't think 8 you did. You weren't interested. 9 You got to look at or the citizens a 10 lot better than you are doing. There is lot 11 of elderly in Scranton, many, many of you 12 got mothers, I don't know how you can turn 13 your back on them. You got to look at 14 everything associated with costs. I don't 15 know how bad the water costs would be for 16 the storm drains. I'm mentioned it last 17 meeting, you said there will be not costs, 18 but the thing is maybe I didn't explain it 19 properly. I was talking about the dedicated 20 lines for the water, not the sanitary, but 21 for the water and they have plans to charge 22 us for any work they do on them lines. Did 23 you not know that? I told you about it, you 24 should have looked into it a little better 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 39 to 42 of 89 12 of 25 sheets39 or pay a little more attention to it because 1 if we get costs for any of them lines that 2 has to be repaired, and we have no way of 3 repairing them at the present time because 4 we do not have the equipment. The equipment 5 was all sold off, and if you have any idea 6 what kind of equipment we are going to need 7 for that storm drain all you have to do is 8 ask what equipment we sold and we are going 9 to need some of them, maybe not as many, but 10 we are going to need the same type of 11 equipment. 12 And then you plan to come up with 13 another Authority, Scranton needs more 14 authorities, there is no question about it, 15 we don't have enough authorities. We need 16 more and more independent governments hiring 17 more people and more lawyers and bringing 18 the cost of living in this city to a sky 19 high amount. I don't know how you can do 20 that. I don't know how you can look at an 21 elderly person and say, "We are going to 22 increase the costs of you living in the city 23 so you can't live in the city." 24 I hope none of you buy any property 25 40 from the land bank when they go up for sale. 1 That was awful bad if you raised the taxes 2 real high and then got property from the 3 land bank. That wouldn't sit too right with 4 the people of Scranton. There is no more to 5 say, the damage is done. 6 I told you before, selling the 7 garages for a dollar, like Mr. Bolus pointed 8 out, is -- his church cost was $500,000 9 something or like that he said, but we sold 10 the garage that it costs million to build 11 for a dollar, and plus gave we gave another 12 $2 1/2 million to repair the garage, and 13 that gave them 4.1 million for leasing space 14 in that garage, and I told you the liability 15 we have is tremendous. If for some reason 16 that mall should close, we are responsible 17 to keep that garage open. We are 18 responsible for keeping all of the garages 19 open even if they fall apart. How are they 20 going to be in 10 years, 15 years? No one 21 knows, but we going to be stuck with the 22 costs. 23 MR. WECHSLER: Anyone else? 24 MS. GAUGHAN: Good evening. Mary 2541 Gaughan, Adams Avenue, Scranton. Since the 1 last council meeting another pedestrian has 2 been killed in the City of Scranton. If 3 that is not indicative that something needs 4 to be done, I don't know what is. We had 5 someone killed in front of the mall last 6 year, we had someone in the last two months 7 die in the hospital that was hit by a 8 vehicle at Court and Main. 9 Now, I don't know and I'm not here 10 to say who is responsible, but I think that 11 the police they have lot of on their plate 12 but they better look to see the way the 13 people drive around the city. Sometimes I 14 think we are at the Pocono 500, and it's not 15 fair to anyone and there are far too many 16 people who try to squeeze the yellow out of 17 the yellow out light to the point that they 18 going through red lights. Recently, a woman 19 hit the Trifecta down at the courthouse. 20 She breezed through a light, hit an off-duty 21 state trooper that was on his way to testify 22 at the courthouse, and then some other 23 driver, so I don't know what the answer is 24 but I think someone should seriously think 25 42 about it.1 And tonight I traveled on Cedar 2 Avenue in the vicinity of Pennswood Manor, 3 that is probably a state highway, but it was 4 like somebody bombed the street. Someone 5 suggested it was PAWC pave cuts. Whatever 6 it is, it should be addressed. 7 And, also, there are still far too 8 many streetlights out in the City of 9 Scranton. I'm not applying for the job, but 10 maybe you should have a temporary 11 streetlight inspector that goes out in the 12 evening and sees where all of the lights are 13 out because they are considerable. 14 And on a positive note, I was at the 15 mall today, I want to commend the city 16 fathers because things are definitely 17 looking up, and all of the time you receive 18 blame but in this instance I think you 19 should get kudos. Somebody is doing 20 something right. Thank you. 21 MR. GAUGHAN: Thank you. 22 MR. WECHSLER: Mary, we did submit 23 your list that you provided to me, I gave it 24 to Mrs. Reed and she submitted it to 2513 of 25 sheets Page 43 to 46 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM43 Director Hinton. 1 MS. GAUGHAN: Now, I noticed this 2 evening there were lights out in the block 3 of Wyoming Avenue, I guess it's the 300 4 where the Cathedral is. I think we ow it to 5 our pedestrians and our drivers they could 6 see at night in the winter. 7 MR. WECHSLER: Just for your own 8 information, that Wyoming Avenue section 9 there by St. Luke's Church and the 10 Cathedral, that's all being reevaluated for 11 a whole new system there. 12 MS. GAUGHAN: Well, what do you in 13 the mean time? Let people hit people with 14 their vehicles? I'm not being sarcastic. 15 MR. WECHSLER: No, that is 16 something, the light fixtures themselves are 17 broken so replacing the lights aren't an 18 option. 19 MS. GAUGHAN: Well, I'm telling you, 20 travel around the city in the evening and 21 you are going to be quite surprised. There 22 are lights out on Wyoming Avenue down by 23 that Freidman Electrical. I'm not speaking 24 of one or two lights, I'm speaking of maybe 25 44 50. 1 MR. WECHSLER: Right. 2 MS. GAUGHAN: Thank you. 3 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 4 MOTIONS.5 MR. WECHSLER: Mr. Perry? 6 MR. PERRY: Yes, thank you. A 7 couple of things to talk about from last 8 week, there was a gentleman here from Keyser 9 Valley that spoke on the ongoing flooding 10 issues that they are having, so I promised 11 him I would like into the two new pumps that 12 were installed on Merrifield Avenue and the 13 drainage pipe issue, too. I had time to 14 speak with director of the DPW, Mr. Rendell 15 -- or Mr. Gallagher, there was a "G" stuck 16 in my head somewhere, Dennis Gallagher, and 17 he did say that when they did tests on the 18 two pumps there was one pump that was 19 working at 100 percent and the other pump 20 that was only working at 15 percent, so the 21 pump that was working at 15 percent has to 22 be replaced with a brand new pump. Both 23 pumps have been tested. They are now 24 operating at 100 percent and there should be 2545 no problem moving water from that retention 1 pond into the creek close by. 2 The drainage pipe, that's the other 3 situation that we need to get to. My 4 colleagues and I in caucus discussed the 5 drainage pipe and what the best action to go 6 at right now we need to determine is it a 7 sewer line, drainage line or dual usage. It 8 is dual usage, it will fall under the 9 American Water Company responsibility to 10 maintain, fix, repair, what have you. 11 So, Ms. Reed, if you would, if we 12 can have a letter sent out to the American 13 Water Company, I believe it was Jerry Hall, 14 if I'm not mistaken, to find out if that 15 drainage pipe on Merrifield is, in fact, 16 their responsibility. If so, then we can 17 move forward with the fix on that. 18 Some new business, Doherty Street 19 was brought up with the ball field, a hole 20 opened up, and that's something that's a 21 little bit more time sensitive. If we can 22 make a call in the morning to DPW about that 23 situation just to we can get some boots on 24 the ground over there to see what the 25 46 situation is if it actually needs something 1 immediately done, I don't want that to go on 2 a couple of days or over the weekend if 3 there is an issue, especially if it's at 4 that field, and if we could maybe send 5 something out, copy Mr. Fallon at parks and 6 Rec to get him involved just so he knows 7 there is an issue there as well. 8 And as far as the turning lane on 9 Jackson Street, Jackson and Main, is that 10 the corner there where the old bank was? 11 Okay, if we can send a letter out to the 12 engineering problem and Mr. Pocius and see 13 if we can follow the same line that we did 14 to get the one by Oram Street corrected, 15 maybe we can get this one resolved in a 16 timely fashion like we did the other one. 17 A bit of good news, I have had my 18 e-mail filled up a little bit with people 19 having some issues with TV's, computers not 20 being picked up, some people have TV's on 21 the side of the road that's outside of their 22 house that's been unsightly, I sent some 23 communications to the mayor, he has gotten 24 back to me. What the Department of Public 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 47 to 50 of 89 14 of 25 sheets47 Works is going to offer in this spring they 1 are going to do it one time in the spring 2 and one time in the fall, they are going to 3 put a dumpster outside and that's going to 4 be used free of charge for Scranton 5 residents to get rid of old TV's and 6 computers and big electronic that garbage 7 men won't take and there is nothing they can 8 do with it. So, again, it's going to be set 9 up, it's going to be free of charge and 10 that's going to be -- the date hasn't been 11 set, but it's going to one for spring 12 cleaning and then right before the winter 13 hits they are going to set the dumpster up 14 again outside the DPW facility. All we need 15 to do is show our Scranton badge, Scranton 16 ID, what have you, and it's going to be free 17 of charge. That's all I have this week. 18 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Mr. 19 Rogan? 20 MR. ROGAN: Yes, thank you. A 21 couple of items. The first one is the 22 double pension issue regarding the subpoenas 23 that city council issued probably over two 24 months ago at this point. I did have a 25 48 lengthy conversation with Attorney Minora 1 about this earlier in the week, him being an 2 attorney he can explain much better than I 3 can a summary of that conversation and where 4 we can stand so I'll turn it over to 5 Attorney Minora at this point. 6 MR. MINORA: The counsel for the 7 state police filed a motion to quash the 8 subpoenas, I think I mentioned this to 9 council last week, and today we filed our 10 answer to the motion to quash. The council 11 for the state police cited what's called 12 Criminal History and Information Records Act 13 as a bar to just releasing that without a 14 Court order, so in producing the motion and 15 our answer we have brought that issue to a 16 Court, I presume we are going to have a 17 briefing schedule and perhaps an argument in 18 which case the Court will either issue an 19 order or not based on the act that I just 20 talked about, and if so then we -- the state 21 police would be obligated to either turn 22 that over to us or take an appeal. I can't 23 speak for them, so I don't know and the flip 24 side of that is if we are denied an order 2549 our choices are to either take an appeal or 1 abandon the effort. So I'll keep you 2 abreast of anything further, the answer was 3 just filed today. 4 MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much, 5 Attorney Minora. And again, this has been a 6 longstanding issue that we have been trying 7 to get answers on, I think there is maybe 8 light at the end of the tunnel following our 9 day in Court, but I'm very anxious to see 10 what is in those state police reports. I 11 know the public is, and it's something that 12 the whole double pension issue is something 13 I'll be keep pushing hard on regardless of 14 the outcome of that Court case. 15 Next, it was reported in the paper 16 this week with the Lincoln Jackson school in 17 West Scranton, and I was contacted by a 18 number of residents in that part of West 19 Side following that article. Those who 20 don't know, the Lincoln Jackson school 21 closed many years ago and it has since 22 become an eyesore in that neighborhood. The 23 school district, I believe, it was about 24 five or six years ago actually offered that 25 50 building to the city to make a park. 1 Obviously, the city being as cash strapped 2 as we are, and to boot the neighbors weren't 3 in support of having a park. They wanted 4 the building to remain and have it be 5 rehabbed. There is much sentimental value 6 in that building where a lot of people in 7 that neighborhood actually went to school 8 there and also it's, you know, a sturdy 9 building. There is nothing wrong with the 10 building as far as the structure goes. 11 The school district did have an 12 assessment done on the building, an 13 appraisal. Bids were received, but they 14 were far below what that appraisal was. The 15 building was reappraised so from talking to 16 Attorney John Minora over at the Scranton 17 School District, it seems there is a very 18 good chance that it's going to go back out 19 to bid, and I hear the neighbors are very 20 excited to have somebody purchase that 21 building and rehab it and have something in 22 there again. 23 So if my colleagues are agreeable, 24 I'd like to send a letter to the Scranton 2515 of 25 sheets Page 51 to 54 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM51 school directors at the request of the 1 neighbors in part of West Scranton asking 2 that they do pursue as quickly as possible 3 getting the Lincoln Jackson school back out 4 to bid so a buyer can be found and that 5 property can get back on the tax rolls, 6 number one, and to eliminate that blight in 7 that neighborhood. So if everyone is in 8 agreement, if we can please send that 9 letter. 10 Next, following up on something that 11 Mr. Spindler mentioned and Mr. Perry as 12 well, the Christmas tree issue I was 13 planning on addressing this. In my 14 neighborhood garbage is picked up on 15 Mondays, and as I was going to work I 16 noticed one of my neighbors had a tree out 17 and went in the back in the same garbage 18 truck that my garbage just went into. I was 19 very upset to see this, and I remember being 20 younger that there was a certain date when 21 the trees would go out and they would 22 actually go through the neighborhood and 23 mulch them and I would like to correspond 24 with the DPW director and first see what the 25 52 current DPW policy is on Christmas trees. 1 What I would like to see happen is these 2 trees can be made into mulch, and the city 3 and Parks and Recreation are spending money 4 on mulch every year in the parks, so it 5 sounds like it really could one of those 6 situations where we can save money at the 7 dump, help the environment and save the cost 8 on purchasing mulch for our parks in the 9 city, so that's something that I hope that 10 we can get to the bottom of and come up with 11 a solution whether it's, you know, certain 12 neighborhoods, dumped in certain parts, or a 13 citywide pickup. 14 And, I'm also very pleased with Mr. 15 Perry reporting about the city we are now 16 going to electronics. The garbage dump will 17 not accept old TV's, and you may notice 18 throughout a lot of the neighborhoods the 19 garbage men do not take TV's, where if you 20 put one out for -- in your garbage, and it's 21 not that they don't want to do it or they 22 can't do it because the dump won't accept 23 them. So I think this iis definitely a step 24 in the right direction to allow the city 2553 residents a couple of the times a year a 1 place to dump electronics legally and/or 2 hopefully they will get recycled, again, to 3 help the environment and to make it easier 4 for the residents to dispose of these items. 5 That is all for tonight. Thank you very 6 much. 7 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Rogan. 8 Mr. Evans? 9 MR. EVANS: Thank you. Councilman 10 Rogan and I received an e-mail from Jennifer 11 Spitler, Director of the Neighborhood 12 Development for Neighbor Works with an 13 update on the Scranton Homebuyer Assistance 14 Program. If you recall, this is the program 15 that was developed to use the proceeds from 16 the foreclosure registration fee to assist 17 new homebuyers with exterior improvements to 18 their homes in Scranton. To date, we have 19 approximately $30,000 in the account for the 20 program and the e-mail reads in part, "We 21 have four applicants in progress, two 22 applicants are approved, one for roof 23 replacements and one for siding replacement. 24 Work for both homes likely to begin by the 25 54 end of the month, but the first two 1 approvals both are first time home buyers in 2 Scranton, and both applicants explained that 3 the funds they will be awarded was a major 4 factor in their decision to purchase their 5 homes in Scranton."6 So if anybody wants more information 7 on the program, you can call Jennifer 8 Spitler at 570-558-2490. This is a great 9 program and all of us should be proud that 10 the initiative came from this city council. 11 On the arts, I don't want to comment 12 directly on the arts in today's paper, but I 13 would like to at least express my viewpoint 14 on the arts and culture. First of all, a 15 vital art and culture climate brings 16 vitality to a community. Some of the direct 17 outputs that are arts and culture bring to a 18 community are, it will improve a community's 19 competitive edge. It creates a foundation 20 for defining a sense of place. It attracts 21 new and visiting populations, also, known as 22 tourists, and that's a good thing. It can 23 also help to integrate a vision for the 24 community. The America Planning Association 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 55 to 58 of 89 16 of 25 sheets55 cites in a briefing paper on this subject 1 that "Economic development is enhanced by 2 concentrating on creativity through physical 3 density and human capital. By creating a 4 concentration in firms, artists, cultural 5 facilities together an economic multiplier 6 effect can result. The recognition of a 7 community's art and culture assets and 8 marketing of them is an important element 9 and driver of economic development." 10 So we should never take light of the 11 value and impact that comes from a strong 12 arts and culture community. In many ways, 13 that's who we are as a community today and 14 who we want to be in the future, so I'll be 15 keeping an eye on what's happening over at 16 then county courthouse, or the county 17 administration building, but, again, we'll 18 let them sort this out, but I want to 19 express my viewpoint that the arts and 20 culture in the City of Scranton are alive 21 and well and need to be fostered and 22 continue to be fostered by all of us. 23 That's all I have. 24 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Evans. 25 56 Mr. Gaughan? 1 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, thank you. Just 2 on Mr. Evans' point, I would agree with him 3 100 percent. I, too, think that art and 4 culture is so very important not only to our 5 city but to our county and to our region, 6 and I actually think that we should put even 7 more of the focus on arts and culture in 8 Scranton and Lackawanna County and, you 9 know, when you look at all of the downtown 10 events that we have and the events 11 throughout the county and we have a lot of 12 talented people in this area, and I think 13 that we should invest in them and not cut 14 any funding for arts and culture. 15 Just a couple of updates on a few 16 things. First is I received numerous 17 complaints from residents in Minooka about 18 Colliery Avenue and the condition of that 19 street, so we did hear from our pave cut 20 inspector and he reported that the 2600 21 through 3000 block of Colliery Avenue have 22 permanent restoration to the trenches that 23 were created on that street. Leeward 24 Construction was able to do that work 2557 because they have their own blacktop plant, 1 in case anyone was curious. 2 The 2800 through 3100 block of Cedar 3 Avenue has gas company work and that's going 4 to be paved in the spring, so there is a few 5 other rods in Minooka that are in pretty 6 rough shape, but we were assured that they 7 are going to be paved in the spring. 8 Second thing, last week I mentioned 9 that they there were couple of dangerous 10 trees up on Wintermantle Avenue on East 11 Mountain and our city forester did make it 12 up there and he marked 10 to 12 trees that 13 are very dangerous and will probably have to 14 come down, and I'd like to thank our city 15 forester. I know his name has been brought 16 up here before, Tony Santoli, and he 17 actually volunteers his time, he does not 18 get paid a salary, and for all of the work 19 that he does and how efficient he is and 20 responsive he is to this council and the 21 people in the neighborhoods, he is 22 invaluable to this city. 23 I did discuss back in the caucus and 24 few weeks ago a letter that we sent to 25 58 PennDOT about the dangerous conditions on 1 Birney Avenue in Minooka. It basically is a 2 two-lane speedway and I have been approached 3 numerous times by residents and businesses 4 that are located on that block. We did 5 receive a letter back from PennDOT and they 6 told us that the city would be able to put 7 crosswalks there and other measures to 8 increase public safety so we are going to 9 reach out again to the city engineer to see 10 if we can get started on that possibly in 11 the spring. 12 Councilman Wechsler and I attended a 13 Greenridge Neighborhood meeting Tuesday 14 night and, again, the issue of crosswalks 15 was brought up, especially in the area of 16 Woodlawn and Penn Avenue there is a school 17 there and there needs to be increased safety 18 measures in that area. Also, there was a 19 dangerous speeding brought up on Electric 20 Street. Chief Graziano was there and he did 21 address many of the neighborhood group's 22 concerns, so we want to thank him for that. 23 I would like to read the questions 24 that were sent January 10 to Attorney 2517 of 25 sheets Page 59 to 62 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM59 Conaboy of Buchanan, Ingersoll and Rooney. 1 The law firm that worked on the Scranton 2 Sewer Authority transactions. These are 3 some of the questions that my colleagues and 4 I had been bringing up in the last few 5 weeks. The questions that we posed, the 6 first one was an accounting of how the $12 7 million in Scranton Sewer Authority cash 8 reserves was expended since the start of the 9 Sewer Authority sale. Also, we would like a 10 breakdown of legal and consultant fees that 11 were paid out in connection with the Sewer 12 Authority sale transaction. Copies of 13 correspondence between the Scranton Sewer 14 Authority and any law firm or consultant who 15 worked in connection with the sewer sale 16 transaction. A detailed breakdown of the 17 amount expended on legal fees and consultant 18 fees in connection with the transaction. 19 Also, was a payout of approximately 20 $1,000 made to Sewer authority employees 21 prior to January 1, 2017? If so, from that 22 account did this money come from and what 23 was the total cost and reason for this 24 payment? And a list of all of the equipment 25 60 that the city received from this Scranton 1 Sewer authority as result of the sale, and 2 we asked that these questions and 3 information be furnished by January 18.4 Not included in the letter, but I 5 would like to follow up on this, if my 6 colleagues would agree, is I mentioned last 7 week, I would like to ask Mayor Courtright 8 when he knew that the sewer sale proceeds 9 would be lower than had been touted for the 10 last year. I am still concerned that this 11 council was left in the dark by Mayor 12 Courtright. If you remember, I asked for 13 the dissolution of the Authority to be put 14 on hold because the transaction had been put 15 on hold for at least a week or two, so I was 16 concerned about those issues and I did ask 17 for that to be tabled, but it failed, so 18 this notion that nobody was asking 19 questions, I have been asking questions for 20 weeks about this deal, but we have not 21 received any. 22 Also, the question about the 23 dissolution of the Authority, I'd also ask 24 that week because we did find out from the 2561 Solicitor Minora in his discussion with 1 Solicitor Shrive that there was other 2 business that the Sewer Authority would have 3 to conduct. So I did ask what other 4 business was that and what the timeline was 5 for the final dissolution. Mrs. Reed sent 6 us an e-mail, she had a discussion with 7 Attorney Shrive and confirmed that the Board 8 and Authority are not actually dissolved. 9 They may be required to stay active for 10 possibly two more years. There is a board 11 and solicitor only, there are no employees. 12 The Sewer Authority still has liabilities, 13 outstanding indebtedness, accounts 14 receivables, old uncollected bills, vendors. 15 They still have outstanding easements that 16 they have to procure and the Authority, as 17 we all know, is part of the class action 18 lawsuit by the residents of Greenridge over 19 the easements, and the city Sewer Authority 20 and the water company have recently been 21 sued by the Greenridge Neighborhood 22 Association. So those are the facts that we 23 received from Solicitor Shrive this week. 24 You know, when we are at this 25 62 neighborhood meeting on Tuesday night, the 1 sale of the Sewer Authority had come up and 2 there was some intense discussion about it 3 and various questions that were posed. I 4 have also been receiving phone calls and 5 e-mails about different things related to 6 the sale, and one of them, and I have been 7 asking this for months, but I would like to 8 know at this point since the sale is 9 complete, what controls, procedures are the 10 city DPW currently under? What do they have 11 in place to manage storm water? Many 12 residents are concerned because we have a 13 lapse in coverage, I guess you could say, 14 because the Sewer Authority was taking care 15 of most of these issues, so should we get a 16 flood the residents in Greenridge, the 17 residents down in Weston Field and other 18 places in Pinebrook are very concerned. 19 So my question is very simple, what 20 are we going to do between now and the time 21 when a Storm Water Authority or something in 22 this realm is completed? I would like to 23 get an answer by next week, if we could. 24 We did receive a letter announcing 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 63 to 66 of 89 18 of 25 sheets63 that Allied Services Geisinger and 1 Lackawanna College are funding the continued 2 retention of Henry Amoroso and HJ Strategies 3 as a financial consultant for 2017. I did 4 request, and I would like to request again, 5 to see a contract if one is in place, so 6 basically what I'd like to know is what are 7 the deliverable for this year, what is their 8 specific role, and how did they play in the 9 day-to-day operations in the city? 10 I also received a question from a 11 citizen about our exit, possible exit from 12 Act 47, and what the timeline would look 13 like. If you are remember, back when we 14 passed the last Recovery Plan in 2015 there 15 was a clock that started ticking on whether 16 or not we would exit Act 47, so I did e-mail 17 Jerry Cross from PEL and he provided the 18 following response: 19 "The 2014 amendments to Act 47 20 require that the coordinator report to the 21 secretary of DCED within 180 days from the 22 beginning of the last year of the five-year 23 period from the adoption of the last plan 24 prior to December 2014. For the City of 25 64 Scranton, that means that the coordinator 1 must report to the secretary in February of 2 this year. The Act requires the coordinator 3 to report on the City's current financial 4 condition and to recommend either 5 termination of Act 47 status, a distinct 6 corporation of the municipality," which is 7 not applicable in our case," and declaration 8 of a fiscal emergency or a three-year exit 9 plan from Act 47." 10 The coordinator has been in contact 11 with DCED officials and a determination on 12 this issue is likely to come very soon as 13 has been reported. And, I think as 14 Mr. Evans had mentioned, PEL will be 15 presenting their revised Recovery Plan to 16 council very soon so we should be seeing 17 that on our agenda. 18 Somebody mentioned land banks, I 19 attended the meeting that was held, public 20 meeting that was held at North Scranton 21 Junior High School concerning land banks and 22 I came out of that meeting also very 23 impressed. There was a number of 24 neighborhood groups, officials from the 2565 county, and other people that are interested 1 and have a stake in the City of Scranton. 2 I mentioned this before, but if even 3 furthered my understanding that this program 4 is going to make a major impact in this city 5 in the areas of blight, neighborhood 6 stabilization, affordable housing and 7 economic development. The most interesting 8 part of this presentation was the large map 9 that they had of the City of Scranton, and 10 in red you can see each property that was in 11 tax foreclosure in the repository, and 12 everybody knows that you have one property 13 on your block or your neighborhood that you 14 wonder who owns it, is anything ever going 15 to be done with it, the grass is six-feet 16 high, this program is going to address that. 17 And what I heard from George Kelly 18 who, again, I think is an invaluable asset 19 to the city and to the county, is that they 20 are going to take a strategic look at the 21 City of Scranton, so we are not dumping all 22 of the properties from the repository into a 23 land bank and picking things out like we 24 would pick numbers from a lottery. There is 25 66 going to be a strategic move here to make 1 these properties reusable and get them back 2 on the tax rolls.3 And particularly exciting to me and 4 other people that have been following this 5 land bank project is the side lot program. 6 I know in my own neighborhood in North 7 Scranton over in Minooka, West Side, all 8 throughout the city, there are lots that are 9 not big enough to build a house on at this 10 point, so the houses have been torn down, 11 the lots sit there vacant. So the side lot 12 program will work with adjoining property 13 owners to get that property back on the tax 14 rolls and to do something with them. 15 The other interesting thing that I 16 think people should know about this is that 17 there is a website for the land bank, so 18 this is all public information. You can see 19 the properties that are being put into the 20 land bank, how you bid on these properties 21 and how the procedures are being put into 22 place. I would ask if we could reach out to 23 the administration this week and see if we 24 can put a link on our website so that people 2519 of 25 sheets Page 67 to 70 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM67 can get to this land bank website and take a 1 look at it. 2 Also, something pretty interesting 3 about the streetlighting program. I will be 4 attending a meeting in the near future on an 5 initiative that I have been involved with 6 since 2014 and that is something called 7 Smart City. It was a component, if you 8 remember, of the streetlighting program, and 9 it was an optional component, but one I 10 think that we should seriously consider. 11 So what is smart city? Smart city 12 enables communities to be better connected 13 to their citizens. This platform uses 14 information kiosks to create a better 15 connected community where citizens can 16 easily discovery events, programs, deals and 17 other relevant and important information as 18 they walk down the street, and you see many 19 cities across the United States that have 20 these type of the things in their down and 21 it's been a great success. 22 The system also allows public safety 23 and Homeland Security officials to not only 24 see and assess emergency situations, but 25 68 also to broadcast alerts and provide mobile 1 updates to residents in targeted locations. 2 The most exciting part of this whole deal 3 for me is that this program can serve as a 4 significant revenue generator for the City 5 of Scranton. There is an opportunity for 6 the city to generate revenue with this 7 program. Advertisers can develop targeting 8 content and pay premium fees to broadcast 9 there individual content and this revenue 10 opportunity can net up to several hundreds 11 of thousands of dollars for the city that 12 can be used to pay for lighting, 13 infrastructure improvements, public 14 services, or it can be reinvested into the 15 smart streetlight system. So, again, I'll 16 update everyone once I have attended that 17 meeting, but, like I said, it is pretty 18 exciting and I think it's something that the 19 city should seriously consider. 20 My last point here is I would like 21 to remind everyone, as Mr. Wechsler did in 22 the beginning of the meeting, that Monday is 23 Martin Luther King Junior Day, and in a 24 light of the volatile, violent and 2569 unpredictable world that we live in, I would 1 like to read one of my favorite quotes from 2 Martin Luther King Junior, and he said that 3 we must develop and maintain the capacity to 4 forgive. He who is devoid of the power to 5 forgive is devoid of the power to love. 6 There is some good in the worst of us and 7 evil in the best of us. When we discover 8 this, we are less prone to hate our enemies. 9 Thank you. 10 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, 11 Mr. Gaughan. Most of the topics I had were 12 covered. I don't have to talk about that so 13 I like that. Also, part one of the 14 questions we did request information from 15 the Lackawanna County Tax Assessor's Office 16 to determine if the properties that have 17 transferred from the Sewer Authority perhaps 18 will become now taxable entities so we just 19 want to get confirmation on that. I'm not 20 sure, since they are a utility, if any of 21 those properties would be taxable, so we are 22 trying to determine that. 23 As Mr. Gaughan referenced, there are 24 several Martin Luther King Day events 25 70 planned for our city on Sunday. I plan on 1 participating in the Martin Luther King 2 walk, which is on Monday evening, and I 3 think everyone should show their respect for 4 our country and for Dr. King by 5 participating in some type of celebration of 6 his life on Monday. 7 Just one other issue, if my 8 colleagues agrees, I would like to write a 9 letter to the Department of Correction, not 10 about any of you guys, but concerning the 11 closure of the State Correctional Institute 12 in Waymart. There are several Scrantonians 13 who are employed at that facility, and I 14 would like to go on record supporting the -- 15 the council supporting those employees. 16 MR. ROGAN: I would agree if we can 17 actually go a step further with it, and I'm 18 glad you mentioned it. I know a few 19 employees also at the correctional institute 20 at Dallas as well that live in the city, so 21 all of these prison within the area employ a 22 number of local residents and also, you 23 know, if prisons are closing the people in 24 the prisons have to go somewhere so for a 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 71 to 74 of 89 20 of 25 sheets71 matter of public safety I think it's 1 critical that Governor Wolf reverse his 2 decision on closing these facilities.3 MR. WECHSLER: Yes. These employees 4 are highly trained professionals who do a 5 tremendous service for our community and 6 really go unnoticed until there is a 7 problem, so we would like to give our 8 support to them the best that we can. 9 That's all I have. 10 MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION - 11 AN ORDINANCE - APPROVING THE TRANSFER OF A 12 RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE CURRENTLY OWNED BY 13 ANOTHER TIME RESTAURANT, LLC T/A AV 14 RESTAURANT, MOOSIC BOROUGH, LICENSE NO. 15 R-10827 TO ANOTHER TIME RESTAURANT, LLC T/A 16 AV RESTAURANT FOR USE AT 320 PENN AVENUE, 17 SCRANTON, LACKAWANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA AS 18 REQUIRED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA LIQUOR CONTROL 19 BOARD. 20 MR. WECHSLER: At this time, I'll 21 entertain a motion that Item 5-B be 22 introduced into its proper committee. 23 MR. ROGAN: So moved. 24 MR. EVANS: Second. 25 72 MR. WECHSLER: On the question? 1 MR. ROGAN: On the question, I'd 2 just like to say for anyone who hasn't eaten 3 at the AV Restaurant to definitely put it on 4 your to-do list. It's one of the best 5 restaurants in the area I'm thrilled that 6 it's going to be moving from it's old 7 location, which isn't the most desirable 8 part Minooka near the Roadway Hotel and the 9 Trotter's Motel. 10 MR. PERRY: Just to clarify, it's 11 Moosic. 12 MR. ROGAN: Moosic. Thank you. 13 MR. PERRY: I want to make that very 14 clear. Moosic. 15 MR. EVANS: You are going to get a 16 lot of letters from people. 17 MR. WECHSLER: You just woke 18 everybody up. 19 MR. ROGAN: I apologize. It is in 20 Moosic. But, again, it's a great restaurant 21 and it's moving to a great block in the 22 downtown, so I urge everyone to try to it 23 out when it moves in the city. Wait a 24 couple of weeks. 2573 MR. EVANS: On the question, we 1 talked about this a little bit in caucus, 2 and I will concur because it's one of my 3 personal favorites restaurant, and this is a 4 big win for downtown Scranton, and it's 5 going to bring more people downtown, it's an 6 upscale restaurant, it's going to do very 7 well and we are looking forward to going.8 MR. WECHSLER: All those in favor of 9 introduction signify by saying aye. 10 MR. PERRY: Aye. 11 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 12 MR. EVANS: Aye. 13 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 14 MR. WECHSLER: Aye. Opposed? The 15 ayes have it and so moved. 16 MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION - 17 A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND 18 OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE 19 AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH ARCADIS U.S., 20 INC. TO PERFORM CITY OF SCRANTON PRELIMINARY 21 STORM WATER ANALYSIS. 22 MR. WECHSLER: At this time, I'll 23 entertain a motion that Item 5-B be 24 introduced into its proper committee. 25 74 MR. ROGAN: So moved. 1 MR. EVANS: Second. 2 MR. WECHSLER: On the question? 3 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question, 4 just a couple of things on this legislation. 5 First of all, as I have said for the past 6 few weeks, I really do believe that this 7 analysis should have preceded the sale and 8 the Authority. I think that once we find 9 out how much it is going to cost us and 10 everything that encompasses storm water 11 management it will devalue the sale of the 12 Authority, so common sense will tell you 13 that this should have taken place before the 14 sale of the Authority. 15 But with that being said, I received 16 a lot of questions from the public at 17 different neighborhood meetings about what 18 storm water management is and what this 19 analysis encompasses, so I'd like to just 20 take a minute and go over some of the things 21 that are in this legislation. 22 So just a little bit of background 23 information. The Commonwealth of 24 Pennsylvania adopted Act 68 of 2013 2521 of 25 sheets Page 75 to 78 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM75 facilitating the creation and funding of the 1 storm water authorities by local governments 2 as a viable alternative to managing the 3 NPDES regulatory requirements. So the city 4 recently sought proposals from an 5 engineering firm to undertake a detailed 6 preliminary storm water analysis. A 7 committee was created within the city and 8 those employees from the city looked at all 9 of these firms and what they were going to 10 provide and they picked Arcadis Engineering. 11 Now, the one thing that is probably 12 going to come up in all of this is that the 13 firm that was picked submitted a much higher 14 price than any other firm. The total price 15 is $124,000. Now, keep in mind, that we 16 have a $35,000 grant from -- through the Act 17 47 program, and I spoke to Mr. Bulzoni today 18 via e-mail and he is expecting we will be 19 able to get further grant money that will 20 probably take care of the rest of the bill 21 here, so we are probably going to end up 22 paying nothing for this analysis, but why 23 would we pick a firm that would ask for so 24 much more money? Well, Mr. Bulzoni details 25 76 in his letter, and I want to make this 1 point. He says that while Arcadis' fee is 2 greater, the firm provides what may be 3 considered a complete comprehensive approach 4 to the evaluation of storm water 5 optionality, including the development of 6 the utility. Therefore, while the cost may 7 be greater, the proposal offers the greatest 8 dollar to the city. The firm also provided 9 the only proposal to address each of the 10 request's criteria in detail and according 11 to the format requested by the city. 12 And I can attest to that, in looking 13 through the different proposals, this one 14 was much more detailed than the other ones 15 and they have dealt with a lot of 16 communities and helping them create a 17 utility or an authority and dealing with a 18 different storm water management issues that 19 are continuing to crop up, so I would agree 20 with that. 21 I think Mrs. Hodowanitz asked what 22 the timeline was. The proposed timeline for 23 the project completion provides a draft 24 identifying seven major project components, 2577 and it will take roughly nine months to 1 complete those components. 2 I would just like to read a little 3 bit more from this analysis. The City of 4 Scranton, like many other communities 5 throughout the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 6 and the United States, possess a storm water 7 and flood control management infrastructure 8 that is under capacity and is reached or is 9 reaching the end of it's useful life. This 10 infrastructure needs to be rehabilitated or 11 replaced and it some cases new systems must 12 be built to improve storm water conveyance 13 and maintain flood control management 14 services. 15 To develop a comprehensive program 16 for providing storm water management 17 services to address current and future water 18 quantity and quality issue, a dedicated 19 funding mechanism for storm water must be 20 developed and appropriately supports both 21 regulatory and performance requirements. 22 This funding mechanism is critical to the 23 future stability of the storm water and/or 24 flood control management program. 25 78 Recent changes to legislation in 1 Pennsylvania and the organizational 2 structure within the City of Scranton Sewer 3 Authority, have provided the city with the 4 opportunity to restructure it's storm water 5 program. Arcadis has extensive experience 6 developing storm water utility and utility 7 fee programs across the United States, 8 including integration of GI storm water and 9 billing data basis and forging an active 10 connection with storm water management 11 departments, so just a little built of 12 background. 13 Now, if we are looking at what other 14 stakeholders are going to be involved here, 15 there are subconsultants that are going to 16 be a part of this team, Penn Strategies, 17 LLC, and Lackawanna River Corridor 18 Association. As we brought up many times at 19 these meetings, the Lackawanna River 20 Corridor Association had done an evaluation, 21 an initial evaluation of these storm water 22 issues back in 2013, so this analysis will 23 use some of that information and build off 24 of it, so I thought that was important to 2501/19/2017 11:10:40 AM Page 79 to 82 of 89 22 of 25 sheets79 mention. 1 If we are looking at what's involved 2 in this analysis and what's involved in the 3 scope of work, there are seven tasks that I 4 mentioned at the beginning of my remarks. I 5 just like to run through these pretty 6 quickly. 7 The first task in the scope of the 8 work is review of current storm water 9 services and activities, and again, some of 10 this had been completed in the initial 11 report in 2013. So upon initiation of this 12 project, this group is going to meet with 13 the City of Scranton staff to determine what 14 the program looks like, what they currently 15 do, which is what I have been asking, and 16 they are also going to interview staff, look 17 at available documents, permits and budget 18 information among a number of other 19 different things. 20 The second task is to form an 21 incorporation of new storm water management 22 service provider. 23 Task number three is a storm water 24 management program development, which will 25 80 be the crux of the whole analysis, so they 1 will be looking at program priorities and 2 requirements, and a financial planner on how 3 of all of this get funded. In the financial 4 planner, basically it's going to be based on 5 all of the information that this analysis 6 requires, so they are going to prepare a 7 financial plan presenting five years of 8 available requirements for the proposed 9 storm water program including costs 10 associated with the converted storm water 11 assets, and the financial plan will include 12 the following elements: Capital 13 improvements program, debt analysis, funding 14 sources, and revenue unless. 15 Task number four is a Stakeholder 16 Advisory Committee, so they will be 17 convening all of the different stakeholders 18 across the city, and possibly outside of the 19 city, to discuss how they can work together. 20 Task number five, which has come up 21 many times here in these meetings and in the 22 newspaper, is the rate structure, so the 23 basis of billing. This company typically 24 recommends using as the basis for their 2581 storm water program fees impervious land 1 area of an equivalent residential unit, so 2 they may use that methodology or other ones 3 that are mentioned in this report. 4 Also, they are going to look at rate 5 structure alternatives, so they are go to 6 discuss when the city the option of using 7 uniform rate or tiered rates for residential 8 customers, and they are also going to talk 9 about the credit system. 10 And, finally, they are going to 11 evaluate the city park system for a green 12 infrastructure, which I know has been a 13 topic of interest for a number of people 14 that I have talked to. Now, back in 2013 15 when the Lackawanna River Corridor 16 Association created that report, they looked 17 extensively at the city park system and how 18 we can incorporate green infrastructure into 19 that, so they are going to build off of that 20 in this analysis. 21 Also, they are going to create and 22 organize and workshop to present all of 23 these findings and from the basis of billing 24 analysis reviewing of all alternative rate 25 82 structure, the development of credit 1 policies and the comparison to other storm 2 water fees across the state and across the 3 country and potential for installation of 4 green infrastructure, as I've said, in the 5 city park system, so the workshop is going 6 to look at an review the advantage and 7 disadvantage of all of these different 8 methodologies and rate structures and the 9 preferred organizational models. 10 Task number six is going to be 11 appeals process, so this company is going to 12 work with the city to develop a set of 13 guidelines for allowing ratepayers an 14 opportunity to appeal the storm water 15 utility fee if that's what the city decides 16 to go with, and so they are going to review 17 existing appeal policies for the city to 18 determine if those processes are potentially 19 applicable to the storm water fee appeals 20 process. 21 And finally, one of the optional 22 services and one of the services that I 23 think is most important in all of this, is 24 public education and outreach. You know, 2523 of 25 sheets Page 83 to 86 of 89 01/19/2017 11:10:40 AM83 when I was at the Greenridge Neighborhood 1 meeting the other night and I go to the 2 other neighborhood meetings, people need to 3 be educated on what this is and what how the 4 city is going to handle this. Community 5 acceptance of this program and whatever 6 funding concept the city chooses, is 7 essential to the program's success and to 8 gain an endorsement and ultimate adoption of 9 the storm water program and the fee, again, 10 if that's what the city chooses, so this 11 team is going to develop specific strategies 12 along with the city for communicating the 13 benefits, alternatives of the storm water 14 program to various segments of the 15 community, and I do think that the 16 Lackawanna County River Corridor Association 17 and Bernie McGurl has started this, but 18 there is much work that needs to be done. 19 So I hope I didn't bore everybody 20 with that presentation, but I know that a 21 lot of people have been asking about this 22 again. Hopefully we can put this analysis 23 -- for this legislation, rather, on the 24 City's website so people can take a look at 25 84 it. It is coming down the pike, we are 1 going to have to deal with it. Is this the 2 way that I would have liked to have done it? 3 No, but I do think that people should be 4 educated, and you should know what is coming 5 down the pike, and that is it all. 6 MR. EVANS: On the question, I think 7 all of us feel the same way. We are all 8 disappointed that this study didn't take 9 place long before this point in time but 10 with that said, I am extremely encouraged by 11 the credentials, the background, the 12 qualifications of Arcadis, and I think that, 13 you know, we will get it right the first 14 time. I think if we had a lesser consultant 15 or somebody doing this for us I think it 16 would have been a real problem, and I think 17 at the end of the day, believe it or not, 18 this may be a good thing. That's all I have 19 for now. 20 MR. WECHSLER: All those in favor of 21 introduction signify by saying aye. 22 MR. PERRY: Aye. 23 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 24 MR. EVANS: Aye. 2585 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 1 MR.
