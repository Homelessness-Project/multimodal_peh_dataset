MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? According to the PennDOT press release , the demolition of the old Harrison Avenue bridge is set for tomorrow . On Tuesday , June 5, at the approximately 11 a.m. a PennDOT contractor will use a controlled demolition to remove the last remaining span of the old Harrison Avenue bridge. Traffic on the Central Scranton Expressway will be stopped from 10:45 a.m. until shortly after 11:00 a.m. and then the all clear has been given. The new Harrison Avenue bridge will also be closed at 10:45 and will remain closed for a longer period of time through out the morning while inspector s evaluate the impact of the blast on the new bridge. From approximately 10:00 a.m. until the all clear is given. A 1,000 safety perimeter will be established around the bridge. During this time, no one will be permitted to be within the safety perimeter unless they are inside of a building . Once the bridge has been detonated , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 contractor will begin to work around the clock for five days to clear all the debris from the gorge.

REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, I do. Thank you, Mr. Rogan. Yes, lots of notes tonight . A lot of good speakers , a lot of good comments and with being no meeting last Monday there was a lot going on. First let's address some things that were talked about tonight . Mr. Piccolino on that issue with First Friday and the alley not having access for customers and his drivers . Mrs. Reed, if we could, let's see if we could put Mr. Piccolino in touch with the leadership at First Friday. I'm not sure if that's something that Mr. Welby would handle as an organizer , but I would be happy to facilitate that between and see if there is anything we can work out for those hours where First Friday takes place if there is something we can do to help his access to his building . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Also, the tree house was brought up which, again, was another excellent point that tree house. The city spends a well-documented a good money on that tree house. It is a beautiful project and it's very unfortunate that it went into disrepair . It's named after a great person, great mayor, and it's something that we do need to get back in line as soon as possible . The last I had heard was it was an engineer ing issue. I know Mr. Rogan said he got an update on it, but if we could, Mrs. Reed, can we get council to get a full update on that from Park and Rec Director Mr. Fallon and from Mayor Courtright and we can see where we are within the step of getting our tree house back to what was it, number eight? Right? Number, eight, that's fantastic . MS. JEFFERIES : Eight out of 15. MR. PERRY: I also, and I know this is something near and dear to your heart, as I was driving around some streets that I hadn't been to in awhile there were some new street signs that were put up, so I wanted a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 follow up call on where we are with the street sign program because that's been talked about quite a bit. The signs, as of right now, there have been 100 replaced and according to the administration the plan is still to get an RFQ out to get a full city replacement on all of the street signs, so I'll have more to update on that when I get it but as of right now it's 100 that have been replaced. It's identified as the most needed and then the administration still wants to get the rest of them replaced . I have gotten in recent weeks several complaints and calls on the Novembrino pool with the stagnant water issue. As you know, the Novembrino pool hasn't been operational and a splash park is on deck and in the engineer ing phase, but to neighbors in that area can we get Parks and Rec involved and maybe DPW get a copy, a "CC" on it just to get what can be done to either pump that stagnant water out so it doesn't become an issue with mosquitos and other insects throughout the summer time. And a house cleaning detail, there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 has been a big issue with our dot.gov e-mail address . I haven't gotten an e-mail through that in about a week, week and a half and I apologize if there is anybody that sent me something that I haven't responded to. Until that e-mail is up and working , feel free to contact me through our office Mrs. Reed will make sure I get any phone calls or e-mails and I'll get back to anybody who needs either a phone call or e-mail back to them. I just wanted to make everybody aware of that in case there was something hanging out there that I didn't know, but that's all I have for today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. All I have today is just un update on a request I made a few weeks ago on a status update on the property at 500 South Webster Avenue that was destroyed by fire. We did receive an emergency declaration from the mayor to immediately tear down the building and I think that has since been completed , so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, I do. First of all, last Friday I attended the 125th anniversary celebration of the Scranton Public Library. First of all, I do thank the board of trustees for the invitation to this very important event and congratulate Jack Finnerty and the entire staff, the library board and all of the volunteers at the library , including Joan Hodowanitz , for all that they do and have done for the Scranton Public Library. Particularly , I'd like to recognize the Henkelman family that have been support ers of the library for generations starting with Bill Henkelman who served on the board of trustees for 42 years beginning in 1967, and the line of service continues today through the involvement of Bill's son Jim Henkelman , who is the current president of the board of trustees , and the family honored and restored special events room has been named the Henkelman room, a well-deserved honor to this family that has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 dedicated so much of their time and energy to the Scranton Public Library. On another matter, I'm going to jump ahead a little bit and moving to an agenda item as part of my motions , the granting of a residency waiver for Dave Bulzoni , but instead of talking simply about the waiver I would like to expand the discussion to the issue of the residency requirement itself. I wonder sometimes shouldn 't the job performance of a cabinet member be more important than where he or she parks their car at night. I'm not sure this is even a policy that hasn't outlived it's useful purpose , whatever that might have been at one time. I would remember rather have a high performing city government with the very best of the best working as the department heads, I would rather have a city that people move to voluntarily because of all that we have to offer rather than the kind of a city where you have to force people to live here because of a job. We talk all of the time about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 government being adverse to change. We talk all of the time about the lack of effectiveness and efficiency in government because we don't embrace necessary change because as a mantra the status quo so aptly goes that's the way it's always been so why would we change? Is a residency requirement or cabinet members just another example of this status quo? In my mind, if there were two equal candidates for the same position with the city, one being a city resident and one outside of the city, I would always, and I mean this sincerely , I would always favor the city candidate . But if the candidates weren't equal, if the candidate from outside the city was clearly better, brighter , and more visionary why would we not choose that candidate ? Why would we shortchange our city and our taxpayers by not hiring the very best? Why would we accept average when we could employ excellence ? Quite frankly , it still doesn't make any sense to me at all on this issue. This city council has been forward 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 looking , Granicus , Smart Cities, idea sessions , See, Click, Fix, working to reduce fees, fines, and taxes and many other initiatives yet somehow here we are still conflicted over another policy of the past that simply does not allow the very best leadership we can find. The residency clause for cabinet members is not just about Dave Bulzoni , and yes, he is deserving of the waiver in my opinion , but I also have to think the residency clause is poor public policy. I think it's held the city back in my viewpoint for generations . I feel that it may be time for the requirement to be fully reviewed for all future hirings of department heads and cabinet members . But finally I'm thankful for the fact that we are having this conversation , and I fully recognize that I'm taking the popular position on this issue, but I'm not okay with that, but nonetheless , it is the position I believe would be the right thing for the City of Scranton and it's future success . That's all I have for now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, just a few, thank you. The street sweeper is scheduled to be in East Scranton from June 4 to June 8 Arthur Avenue to Taylor Avenue, and on that subject a resident brought up tonight about the street sweeper. I did speak to the mayor last week and the administration is working on additional funding through grants to purchase more street sweepers for the city, which I had with mentioned weeks ago. I also think the city needs to make an investment in the street sweeping program for a number of different reasons. One, because it makes the city look cleaner. Residents enjoy when the street sweeper comes through their city and picks up all of the dirt and grime and everything else; and number two, from a storm water management perspective it's extremely important , and I think actually in the storm water management agreement that the city will be facing, you know, in the next couple of months that's going to have to be baked in there that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 city has to sweep the streets and do a good job at it. I also think that, you know, when we get more street sweepers we can enact a policy where residents know when the street sweeper is coming and they can move their cars. I don't buy the argument , you know, that the administration has given that it can't be done. It can be done. Other cities do it smaller than us and larger than us, so I think if we put a program in place that we would be able to follow that and hopefully as we get more equipment we will be able to do that. The second thing, there is a curb on Colliery Avenue in Minooka that I received several calls about residents about so we did contact the DPW about that and we were told that that had be taken care of so appreciate that. In the caucus tonight before the regular meeting , we discussed that next week there will be a meeting with NDC about the parking garages and there was a discussion in the back on whether or not this meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 should be televised , I would want to say publically I do think that meeting should be televised in council chambers because I think it's important . The parking garages , obviously are important not only to the people downtown but to all our city residents so I do think that, you know, whether or not NDC wants to be on television that doesn't really matter to me, I think that should be a requirement to come into these chambers and let the people of the city who don't come to the council meetings know exactly what is going on, so if they don't want to be on television that's too bad for them. This is a public meeting and the people deserve to see what's going on. Also, I did send a letter April 19 to the Pennsylvania Economy League about an issue I brought up several times regarding the pensions . I have not received a response . We sent another letter May 17 and still no answers so we will send another response , I will reach out to Mr. Cross. You know, I do think in this instance it's important for the city to hear from our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 recovery coordinator on these important issues and I would hate to think they would shirk their responsibility in answering a councilman , especially on a matter as important as this. And I'll save the rest of my comments for agenda items. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just two comments . As I mentioned in the caucus, Councilman Gaughan mentioned just now the city is putting in for grants for numerous pieces of equipment , but specifically a street sweeper through a new Clean Diesel Program through the State of Pennsylvania , so this is definitely a good program that can help the city acquire it at little to no cost and it's more friendly to the environment , so I wanted to mention that as well. And also on our agenda tonight is an item to enter into a contract with Reilly Associates for engineer services for the city's 2018 roadway improvement project , and the most common question and complaint that we get from residents of Scranton is when is my street going to be paved and when is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 street in my neighborhood going to be paved? Now, this ordinance does not apply to any of the issues that have been ongoing in the South Side and the Hill specifically where roads have been cut up by utility contractors . Those will be repaved by the utility contractors at their expense . This program , which will be done in conjunction with our OECD and city program , will be paving, again, miles and miles of road throughout the City of Scranton and for the last five years the city has probably paved more roads than in the last 20, but there is still a long way to go after decades of neglect on our roadways, and also the fact is living in Northeastern Pennsylvania no matter how much money we spend we are going to have roads with lots of freezing and thawing and that is going to cause, unfortunately , problems on our roadways , but I am glad to announce that we are going to be doing quite a bit more paving this year throughout the city as well, both through city dollars and federal dollars and that's something I will continue to support as long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 as I'm on council . That is all. MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, excuse me, I have one additional think, I apologize , I failed to mention it. I brought this up in the caucus, but just for the record. Mrs. Reed, if we can ask the Business Administrator , there was a transfer of $7,500 from the Worker's Compensation fund and it says it's going to HR personnel cost adjustment and that's within the Business Administrator 's Office so I would like to know what that is exactly for and I'd like that answer By next week. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

DONAHUE : Yes, on the question , Mrs. Reed, would you be able to put a request in to the mayor to provide additional justification for Mr. Patel's qualifications ? His letter of interest and the background is a little brief. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Just to add to that, I really think moving forward for any appointment to any board or commission in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 the city that we need more than a letter of interest . We need a resume at least showing the qualifications of that individual because we are giving our vote of confidence so not just for this appointment but moving forward, and I have said this in the past, I do think that we need more than just a very short letter of interest . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: I find it interesting that these issues are only coming up on this appointment . MR. GAUGHAN : I have actually brought this up in the past. Actually , I believe I brought it up in the caucus months ago that if you look at what other cities do there is actually an application process and something that they have to fill out. This is nothing against the gentlemen here, but, you know, I at least would like to see a resume or something more than a simple letter of interest . That goes for everyone not just this gentleman here. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I have been -- since I have got here I have been asking for more justification for any proposals that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 the mayor has sent down so it's just not for this appointment , it's across the board. MR. ROGAN: And, again, Mr. Gaughan , you have been on council five years and, again, I don't recall discussing this, but if that's something you want to discuss we certainly can. We have approved a number of appointments already this year without that coming up until this specific one. MR. EVANS: On the question , again, I will say that a good compromise position could be the application that Mr. Gaughan or Councilman Gaughan because I think that might be a very good idea. It allows for a little more information in the letter and if not a resume maybe something else in-between and we could basically devise the letter ourselves, send it down to the administration to review and something we can ask for all to fill out. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-F. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO THIS OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (SWM BMP) BY AND BETWEEN RANDMAR DEVELOPMENT , INC., (HEREIN AFTER “RANDMAR ”) AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON (HEREIN AFTER THE “LANDOWNER ”). MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I think Mr. Dobrzyn asked for an explanation on this. This is a routine piece of legislation between the City of Scranton and Randmar -- Randmar Development , Incorporated , which is the owner of the land where the Sheetz is -- the new Sheetz is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 going. This basically gives all responsibilities for storm water management to Randmar , so it releases the city of any responsibility , and if you look in the backup of the legislation it just says that they are going to put a storm water inlet and different things and a new pipe related to the storm water management on that property . So, again, just a routine piece of legislation here that takes the responsibility off the of city onto Randmar . There is a paragraph in here that says if the landowner would grant permission to the city they can enter the property to take a look at the storm water conveyance and make sure that it's under best management practices , if necessary , and the city would just have to notify the landowner. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR.

MR. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 BULZONI WILL BE REPLACING REBECCA MCMULLEN WHO WAS SERVING AS ACTING BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR . MR.

DAVIDSON : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Yes. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : No. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 40 - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR DAVID BULZONI , CITY OF SCRANTON BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR . MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I am going to be voting no as I did last week because I truly believe that this is a question of fairness, and I did speak to Mr. Bulzoni , as I did four years ago when I voted against the waiver, and I let him know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that I didn't think that this was right. I disagree with Councilman Evans and my other colleagues who were going to vote for this waiver for several reasons , but Mr. Evans said it shouldn 't be important where the employee parks his car. I disagree . I think it is important where the employee parks his car, he should park it right in the City of Scranton like everybody else does. This is about, in my opinion , an investment . We are making an investment . You are making an investment in the business administrator who makes $90,000 a year and who has gotten a raise over the last four years from where that salary was four years ago. He should have to invest to the city, and that isn't just about Mr. Bulzoni , I think he is qualified . If he were to live in the city I would give them my 100 percent approval . So you can replace Mr. Bulzoni will Al Jones, Bill Smith, it doesn't matter, this is about the principle of the argument . If we are going to invest in a business administrator then he should invest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 in the City of Scranton and it's as simple as that. As I mentioned last week, I don't think it's fair that someone makes $90,000, doesn't live in the city and avoids property taxes, school property taxes, city property taxes, garbage fee and everything else. So it's a question of fairness and it's a question most importantly in my opinion of investment . And I've said this to Mr. Bulzoni . Do the right thing, move into the city and I will support him 100 percent . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Roll call, please? MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Yes. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : No. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Yes. I hereby declare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Item 7-B legally and lawfully adopted . If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. EVANS: Motion to adjourn . MR. ROGAN: Meeting adjourned .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes of testimony taken by me at the hearing of the above-captioned matter and that the foregoing is a true and correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
