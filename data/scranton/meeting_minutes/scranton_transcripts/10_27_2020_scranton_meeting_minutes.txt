Can I request a copy of that at this moment? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I think that's -- that's just going to be after the request of everything to date.

And then the East Scranton Little League, 901 Richter Avenue has been changed . So it was October 30th, but now it will be Sunday, November 1st from 3 to 5 p.m. That is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. I have a couple. Next week Council will reschedule 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 their regular meeting of Tuesday , November 3 to Monday, November 2nd at 6:30 p.m., due to Election Day.

And as we -- and as I mentioned before, Election Day is next Tuesday . I would just like to urge anyone who applied for a mail-in ballot, received their mail-in ballot that has yet to put it in the mail to please hand deliver that ballot if you want to make sure that it's counted . There is a lot of uncertainty into when ballots will be accepted . So to guarantee that your vote will be counted , I urge you to drop it off at the Lackawanna County Government Center on Wyoming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Avenue. Also if -- ATTY. HAYES: Or in one of drop boxes, right? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I believe the drop boxes are only open until Friday at 5 p.m., is that correct , where the one at the county building is Tuesday ? ATTY. HAYES: I wasn't aware of that but I'll find out for the end of the week and let you know. MR. DONAHUE : And also, you know, if you mailed in your ballot, you believe that you might have erred in how you filled it out or you sent in a naked ballot, meaning you didn't put it in the privacy envelope , if there is any doubt in your mind, you could show up at you polling place on Election Day and request a provisional ballot. Okay, FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . The following resident s have submitted public comment for tonight 's meeting , Marie Schumacher , Norma Jeffries , Fay Franus and Dave Dobrzyn . Can I have a motion to accept public comment ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 accept public comment . MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, please read the public comment . MS. REED: Thank you, Councilman Donahue . The first submission was from Marie Schumacher as follows : O The City's recycling color-coded pick-up schedule shows the comingled bin is for plastic bottles and jars; however , I believe I heard Mr. Donohue say that only plastic with the numbers one,two and four in the triangle were acceptable . If I heard correctly please advise when the City will correct the information we received . O Reading the Third Order items tells me this Body needs to start paying more attention to what they have authorized . Though the current Capital Budget is not available on line that I could find it appears Council has allowed the expense for the Novembrino Splash Park to get out of control . Of more importance is not following up on the Auditor 's report to see whether or not the Administration was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 proving the needed information . And, while I'm on that topic why are we still paying Rainey and Rainey? It was my understanding they were brought in to train BA personnel and when that had been accomplished they would be gone. O Currently 64% of the City's property owners pay for 100% of the Operating Budget. City Councils have placated the paying property owners by including addressing the 36% and growing non-profits who are exempt from paying property tax but Council has done nothing to test the eligibility for this perk. O Last week Council brought the Capital Budget back for passage stating all the questions have been answered . I know mine weren't answered and the communication you said you'd received from DPW was not in Third Order for all to see. O Taxpayers , at least this one, were told the Harrison Avenue bridge was a deterrent to increased efficiency of the Fire Department . When will a Fire Department efficiency study be performed now that the Harrison Avenue Bridge has been replaced . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 The second submission is from Mrs. Norma Jeffries as follows : Regarding NDC presentation in 10/20/2020 parking at kiosk system. It was with great anticipation that I waited for the NDC update during the recent City Council Caucus. I was hoping against all hope, that they would have discussed some of the future plans that would assist the kiosk parkers in Scranton . That they hear us when we have concerns !! Some of my friends and acquaintance relay their experiences with receiving parking tickets because the machines are malfunctioning . It then becomes a “proof it” situation for the resident . It becomes our task to contact ABM to proof that the kiosk was malfunctioning at the time I tried to use it. It seems to me that with the technology of being able to scan our License Plate for a violation , the system should be able to scan the parking meters to ensure that they are always in tip top condition . I am sure that each kiosk has a identifying number. It seems that a malfunctioning meter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 should be reported to ABM via the system rather than being reported by John Q. Public. This seems to be a great upgrade to the system and relieve so much frustration for the citizens of Scranton . As Dr. Rothchild mentioned last week, she too has experienced the malfunctioning of a kiosk. It was very noticeable to me that the presenter , David Trevasani , remarked that he would check with ABM for any malfunctioning kiosk information . However , my concerns from my letter of September 15, 2020, as far as I can see, have not been addressed . I am sure that it is not just Dr. Rothchild and me experiencing these issues. All of us who use the kiosk will eventually experience one of these situations . When I leave the house and head downtown , I leave with sufficient quarters and credit card in hand, because I never know which I will need. That is kind of sad!! I am also attaching my letter to Council , regarding my concerns with NDC/ABM. Respectfully Submitted , Norma Jeffries1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Scranton City Resident . The third submission is from Miss Fay Franus as follows : Council , I saw where the 7 judges ruled in the city's favor and now there is no cap on how high you can tax the people of Scranton on the LST tax. Gee I really thought when we, the people voted for our council members we believed they were elected to represent US, the taxpayers NOT THE Administration . I want every one of you to publicly say why you believe it is the right thing to do to tax the city residents as much as the administrations wants--so high people may lose their homes! Remember I do NOT want to hear how if you don't do this the city has no other way to recoup the 50 million THEY OVERCHARGED the taxpayers to begin with. That is THE MAYORS PROBLEM NOT YOURS! I repeat this city OVERCHARGED the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 taxpayers illegally 50 million dollars more than they were allowed to and you the city council members are not fighting to get that 50 million back to the people who this city overcharged . YOU instead are on the side of the administration who are thrilled they won this lawsuit to keep raising the city's LST tax on residents for millions more. Go ahead Councilman Gaughan McAndrew Donahue Schuster and councilwoman Rothchild . Let's hear how you feel this is fair. How the Scranton taxpayers won't be getting their money back and now you want to keep overtaxing them millions again. Then end by saying "And by the way we represent YOU!" No you do NOT! You are Liars --you take care of the Mayor and her administration NOT THE PEOPLE. We are tired of your excuses .: One being The city can't function if you didn't win this lawsuit . Too bad-- it's okay though that people don't have a clue how they will be able 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to pay these bills. There is nothing you can say that will justify abusing the residents of this city. Finally and most important I definitely believe this is illegal to continue to have no limit on the LST tax. No cap at all! Other municipalities all have a cap on how much you can charge. Where is equality here? You may have had these judges rule in your favor. That means NOTHING if this is truly illegal . You count on people not suing you to continue to do what you want. Maybe someone out there will indeed challenge the illegality of this. This city has to be stopped by having judges rule in their favor to the detriment of the people of Scranton .over and over. Fay Franus The fourth submission is from Dave Dobrzyn . Good luck trying to make ends meet on the budget for 2021. I would like to address past comments by other speakers back in March. Comments were made about the mayors and certain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 council members attendance to a planned parenthood rally. My opinion is that the USA. Should have introduced family planning globally fifty years ago to all willing to participate . Ecologically this planet cannot support more than 2 billion people on a western standard of living without serious environment degradation . Many of these same commentators express opposition to social programs and spending to sustain US. Citizens in times of need. I have always supported free choice and personal responsibility . People should not be required to put up WITH INTRUSION into their personal lives by gov at the behest of others religious fervor. These issues have no place in a constitutional democracy . Regressive legislation disenfranchisement incarceration and ethnic cleansing are often the final result. Over the years I have seen these same individuals comment on many issues that are not their legitimate concern . The 14th and 15th amendment to the bill of rights have ensured free choice in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 matters of social nature, we need not return to 1859. I have had my own issues with these people as they have on their hopeless bids for public office have portrayed me as on drugs and the fact is that I have 7 different prescriptions to keep me alive. My suggestion is they should accept the will of the voter and mind their own business . IN Colorado the state instituted broad avail of birth control and eliminated 55% of all unplanned pregnancies and 65% of abortions . Excuse me if life taught me at 66yrs. That half a loaf is better than none. It appears that some people love their imaginary reality but no good will prevail . MS. REED: And that concludes the public participation . (This concludes letters as submitted to Council for public comment .) MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 question , I just want to respond to Mrs. Jeffries ' comments regarding the parking and ABM because we did receive correspondence -- I'm assuming it's going to be included -- I would ask that that be included in Third Order next week. But it seems that they're saying there are on average three kiosks per day that are not working properly and they have a full-time technician that services them. And I believe any kiosks that they have I think that's just 1.6 percent per day that require service . I think maybe some of us have been the unlucky ones to just happen to come upon those kiosks that day. But at least we did receive some numbers and a little bit more insight on how often those repairs are being needed. I'm not sure if that is still acceptable that amount of kiosks being in disrepair . You know, I don't really have anything to compare it to. But I just wanted to provide her with that information that we received . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just to answer a couple of Miss Schumacher 's questions , when I said that, you know, only one, two and four of the plastics were acceptable , that doesn't mean that glasses and jars weren't acceptable . One, two and four are the only plastic s that are accepted along with jars and cans. And when the schedule first came out, you know, it wasn't until July that we got from the Recycling Center which plastics they would accept moving forward and that schedule was put out in February , I believe . So hopefully we could have that information go out on a schedule for next year. And then on her question about the capital budget and the DPW questions not being in Third Order, Council man -- President Gaughan read those answers into the record last week. So I would urge Miss Schumacher to read the minutes from last week to get those answers . It wasn't in Third Order, but Councilman Gaughan did read them into the record. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, there were two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 things I wanted to comment on. First off, Mr. Hayes, how do we go about testing the eligibility of nonprofits ? Do you know that offhand or can we begin to look into that? MR. DONAHUE : You're muted. ATTY. HAYES: Councilman Schuster , the nonprofits are regulated by the Pennsylvania Department of State. In order to be eligible to be designated as a -- by the Pennsylvania Department of the State as well as the IRS and the Department of Revenue . So I don't know that we as a municipality have the ability to challenge their designation as a 501(c)(3) or other designation . MR. DONAHUE : Kevin, I think what Tom and also Miss Schumacher are referring to are a HUP test. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. MR. DONAHUE : A HUP test, H-U-P. ATTY. HAYES: Oh, okay. MR. DONAHUE : Where, you know, you send out and you make the nonprofits justify their nonprofit . You know, you send out a letter making them justify their nonprofit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 status. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. I'd have to -- I'll look into, Tom. I don't know offhand the specifics how we do that. But I could look into it and report back next week on that. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, thank you very much. I know it's a conversation that I've had a couple of times. But maybe we get started on that. And the second thing is, with the audit, it was -- the correspondence was put into third order tonight . Am I to understand that as of September 3rd, the auditors have not received any information from the administration ? It's on the first page. MR. DONAHUE : With that, Tom, is that there's a meeting with the auditors scheduled for this week. So maybe we could follow up on that towards the end of the week to see if, you know, that schedule in terms of the midDecember one they gave to us has moved up or is -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so, I mean -- MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding that they're having a meeting this week with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the auditors -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, it looks like (audio interruption ) just saying things to (audio interruption ) I'm fulling understanding that correspond ence. That's -- they are giving some of those reasons for that, correct ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. And that's, you know, that's sort of the same thing we got with our, you know, questions from last -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah. MS. REED: And if I may add, Councilman Donahue and Schuster , I believe within that correspondence Kohanski did note that they would be providing weekly updates from here on out. MR. SCHUSTER : Right. Yes, I did see that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Is that it? Does anyone else have anything ? ATTY. HAYES: Councilman Donahue , Miss Schumacher had requested the total number of pending or outstanding lawsuits which the City is currently involved in or defending . I reached out to the Law Department . And we're trying to compile that information for her.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. DONAHUE : Okay. And then we'll send the rest of the questions along to the administration . All those in favor of accepting public comment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : No, none at this time. I already spoke on those. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, thank you. So, I mean, for months I've been getting bombarded with calls about illegal garage service s throughout the City, all right. One in particular I received another correspondence today. And this one -- this one I first brought forward in May, okay, so -- and it's on 324 Crown Avenue. All right, it's a garage. It's been illegal ly operating since 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 May. I know that they went through the process where, you know, the LIPS Department shows up. And I know my understand ing is they've been cited. Of course they received the original zoning violation letter that says, you know what, we're not going to correspond with you any more after 10 days, some formal action will take place. So my understanding is they receive d a few citation s. So how many is too many or what happens ? I know there was a revision of the LIPS Department that occurred , internal audit. I'd like to know, first of all, what the status of this illegal garage is if, Mrs. Reed, if you could please send a request to me. And I know I'm saying a bunch of stuff. So, Mrs. Reed, I'll e-mail the actual request tomorrow , okay? And secondly , there's another one. It's the rear of 1149 Sloan Street, right, so -- and I've been inquiring about this one. So here's another one where, okay, so the police department showed up. The LIPS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Department showed up. They also received the zoning violation letter that states, you know, after 10 days formal action will probably occur. But then part of that letter says that they have the opportunity to appeal this, the people that are running this illegal garage, which doesn't make sense. So they have until -- this other issue with the garage, they have until November 8th to appeal this -- to appeal the illegal service s that they are providing . So I'm having trouble wrapping my head around this whole process . Is this the process that's going continue to happen even after the revision of the LIPS Department . And if this is policy, I'm just not understanding it because this isn't fair to all the other garages in the City that do it legally and provide the services . So I need some type of, you know, explanation , feedback with regard to the process in general and to see, you know, if this is the old process , is this the new process or was this even looked at because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 these occurrences are happening throughout the City. I'm just naming two as of right now. But I know it's more than two. And it continues . And I know that, you know, for a while they'll stop and then a week or two later they're back at it. And the one at the rear of 1149 is causing huge safety issues with regards to parking all over the place, on the sidewalks . And this is a side street, actually Schlager where, you know, trucks can't get through . UPS delivery can't get through . I mean, there's kids that live in that neighborhood . So it's a huge safety issue. I just need a better explanation as to why that these illegal garages get all of these steps before they are shut down. And then the ones that went through that process , the one on Crown Avenue, 324 Crown Avenue, the process started in May and they are still operating illegally . I just -- I'm having a huge problem understanding this. So, you know, like I said, Mrs. Reed, I'll e-mail you my request . But I need some answers . The residents that live 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 near these illegal operation s are dying for resolve . And it just doesn't seem to be happening . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Just to expand quickly on what Councilman McAndrew brought up, you know, this is an issue all over the City. And really it's not just in garages . It's in alleys. It's on streets where, you know, a car will be up on jacks for, you know, a week on a City street. So I would just like that included too if -- trying to figure out a policy moving in -- especially once we get into next summer for how we're going to deal with those. You know, if they're actually in a garage, they could actually be doing that stuff throughout the winter. But the stuff on the street, in the alleys, that's something that we're going to have to really look at, you know, going into next -- you know, before going into next summer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 too. MR. MCANDREW : You know, thank you, Councilman Donahue . I also forgot to say that some of these cars are being painted in the middle of the street at these illegal garages which is -- I can't even understand it. So thanks for (audio interruption ) and it's rampant . MR. DONAHUE : And that's all I have for tonight too. MS. REED: 5-B.
