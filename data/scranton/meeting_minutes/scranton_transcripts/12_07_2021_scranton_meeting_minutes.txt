GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I would just like to thank Mr. Santoli and the Shade Tree Commission for the work they've done over the past year. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have. The South 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Scranton , Minooka , East Mountain Hometown Hero Banner Program is continuing this -- or they will be accepting applications this Saturday , December 11th at the Nay Aug Park Community Room. They will be accepting the applications from 9 a.m. until 12 p.m. And this will be the last day of the year to purchase a banner. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So this Saturday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., will be the sixth annual Shamrock Christmas Tree Toy Drive at Villa Maria Restaurant in West Scranton . This toy drive benefits West Scranton Elementary student s. So please bring a new unwrapped toy for a child in need between the ages of 0 and 12. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? An executive session was held on Thursday , December 2nd in City Hall immediately following the budget hearing s. During this executive session , Council met with the Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 and members of the administration and reviewed pending litigation , the status of negotiations with municipal labor unions and other personnel matters . I also want to announce -- and I'll make a motion later on in the meeting to that effect that next Tuesday , December 14th will hopefully be our last meeting for this year. We will be having an additional public hearing on the 2022 budget. That will be at 5:45 p.m. I will make a motion later on to have Mr. Voldenberg publish an advertise ment in the newspaper to that effect. The reason for the second public hearing is because Council felt it was very important to allow for additional public comment on the budget since there obviously are going to have to be in excess of 100 amendment s because of the mistakes by the Mayor and the administration . So that is next Tuesday , December 14th at 5:45 p.m. Also, we'll make a motion later on in the meeting that we will have a tentative special meeting scheduled for Wednesday , December 15th at 5:45 p.m., in the event that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 an unforeseen circumstance comes up with the 2022 budget. So in the event that we do not pass it next Tuesday , we have to pass it by the 15th per the Home Rule Charter . So we will reserve that date in case we need to have a special meeting . Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Tonight , the first speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . First off, that's terrible news about Neil McDonald . I didn't know he passed away, known Neil for over 30 years. He lived right next to door to my in-laws for all the time I've known him. So my thought s and prayers go out to the family of Neil McDonald . He was a great guy. He put a fence around my backyard for me. He did when he was still a firefighter , really nice guy. And that was very sad news. And my thoughts and prayers again to his family. Now, first thing, 5-B honoring Chris Doherty by naming a park after him. Whose idea 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 was this? MR. GAUGHAN : This was my idea and Council concurred unanimously . MR. SPINDLER : Well, I think you people have all lost your minds. Chris Doherty almost bankrupted our City. He fought the unions, the firefighter s and the police officers for years and years. And he lost every lawsuit , ended up losing a court decision to 80 million dollars which the unions cut that in half that graciously took only 40 million , which was really good on their part. And people talk about the unions how they are money hungry and this and that. Well, they did the City a big favor, saved the City 40 million dollars . Another thing, he took care of his campaign contributors . As I said in the past, he let a construction company who campaigned -- that contributed to his campaign plow our lots when we have DPW people who do that. He let a developer fix up a building downtown without having permits . And you people want to honor him with a park? You have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 to be crazy. This is ridiculous . When he left office, we were -- the City was in shambles . And no matter what you have to say about Bill Courtright , he committed a crime. He's paying his price. But after Courtright's first four years, the City was in a much better shape than when he took office. Chris Doherty, like I said, he almost bankrupt ed the City and to name a park after him would be a crime. Why don't you name it taxpayer park because all the taxpayers got shafted under Chris Doherty . We ended up paying taxes on taxes on taxes. And what do you think is paying for that park? It's taxpayer money. No matter where the money came from, it's taxpayer money. So I hope you don't introduce that legislation because it's a big mistake . Next thing, my favorite subject , the garbage tax. I come here year after year when it's budget time and nobody ever does anything . I was told for years oh, it's not a tax. It's a fee. Well, it's not a fee because now it's on our property tax bill. So it's definitely a tax. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I wish Council would do something about that to give the taxpayers a break. If not, do away with it, just put it back to $178 the way it was years ago. I guess, that's all I have right now. So I'll probably see you next week. Thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is John Hart. MR. HART: Council President , members of Council , many of you here know who I am or what I've done. For those of you who don't, my name is John Hart. I live in Scranton . And in 1984 I worked with former James McNulty in developing what became Steamtown Foundation in Scranton and later on came up with the idea to create a national park here in Scranton . Things were going swimmingly by the time the National Park Service took over in 1987. However , lately I have found that the ability of the City to sort of coordinate tourism as a weekend industry in the City has sort of fallen apart. We have a Park Service Director who does not like to talk to the Trolley Museum 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Director . We have County Commissioners writing our people in Washington trying to get this woman who served as park director of the Lincoln Memorial all of a sudden thrown out of Scranton because they don't like the way she's doing business . Myself, and my partner Mike Masucci from Dunmore just recently established a new company in Scranton called the Pennsylvania Trolley Cars, LLC, in which we plan to do historical architectural tours and tours of other attractions in the City beginning 2022, actually hopefully this year with Christmas experiences for children up in Nay Aug Park. I've been talking to Mayor Cognetti regarding the problem with tourism . And I have recommended to her that no more than in the 80s when we had a Scranton Tourism Commission under the Mayor, we were able to bring people together . We had restaurant eurs coming together for monthly meeting s. We had hoteliers coming together , all of which were working in unison all in one direction trying to bring Scranton a weekend tourism experience which would give us extra 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 cash which would give young people much added employment . And I offered to the Mayor that our company , Pennsylvania Trolley would be more than willing , more than capable and able to rejuvenate that. And we would do so without a cost to the City. We would use our staff to establish the commission meeting s and so forth, bring people together and try to get everybody working in the same direction again. I'm here tonight to beseech all of you to look kindly on this proposal should and if the Mayor proposes it. We stand ready to help in any way we can. I look at communities such as Jim Thorpe and nothing against Jim Thorpe, but when it comes to offering people a weekend of enjoyment , entertain ment, and historical perspective , we're the City that basically brought about the industrial revolution to this world and we have an awful lot to offer. All we have to do is put our good sense to work, everybody work in one direction and bring it all together . I can't believe as an Irishman I'm a minute and 31 seconds short. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. GAUGHAN : You know what, Mr. Hart, I want to say -- right up here, Mr. Hart. I want to say just that we -- and I appreciate all that you've done for the City of Scranton over the years and especially with the trains and the Trolley Museum and your contributions to the City. And knowing you personally , I know how dedicated you are to the City of Scranton . So we want to thank you. And any way that we can help with this and your project , we'd be more than happy to. So thank you very much. MR. HART: Thank you very much. You have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Darwin Shaw. MR. SHAW: Good evening Council . I'm Darwin Shaw, Scranton resident . Honestly, I would just like to say terrific job under stressful situations . You guys have rose above and beyond your call and even with the lack of material , you stand firm and you do the best that you can for the citizens . And I commemorate that, especially 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 from me being a young man looking up to you guys. I do. Mr. Kyle, I watched videos on you. You have came a long, long way. Mr. Donahue , you got around city politics around my age or probably a little younger . I look up to that. You guys are the reason why I ran for Mayor of Scranton , Pennsylvania . Now, I would like to see -- I would like you -- I'm going to speak to you because I didn't win. I would like to see you stretch your rules. There's a lot of things that were said in our chamber s -- your chambers that should not be said. They shouldn 't. They're derogatory and they're degrading , especially toward women. They are. This man is wonderful . I didn't know you're the person that made these trains. I used to ride on those trains and thank you for helping this man out. In any way, shape, or form that we can help out Miss Paige Cognetti , especially with this tax it's going to be very difficult switching especially finding a positive person to collect the money. It's an easy way to collect more money from individuals that are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 not paying to fill in that gap. But there could be a setback. What if those individuals stop paying completely and like (inaudible ) I said it would be a taxable -- on PPE tax, I think there will be. That can be very, very stressful . But it has to happen. It does. The School Board and City Council like you said, the City should be on one page. If it's not, it's not going to look good, especially that we're coming out of Act 47. We have to. You guys know we have. We're on the right track. And I would just like to see you keep pushing because I'm still going to stand for the citizens , including you guys and honestly hopefully one day finish the work that you guys start when you decide to step down. And thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a good night. Next speaker is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . And I also up until a year or two ago and COVID, almost every fall we were on trolley trips and Christmas trips and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 excursions with the trains. And I absolutely love Steamtown and hopefully some day. Okay, I mentioned about televisions not being recyclable . If working -- excuse me -- the Salvation Army sells a lot of old televisions to people with less fortunate situations and other things. When I walk the doggy I see a lot of useful items just thrown out in the trash, coolers , all kinds of things. I saw a cooler filled with water a couple years ago but obviously held water. It was a good cooler. I mean, donate it to some organization . And, okay, as far as 6-F is concerned , I would try to be a little easier with people if they are willing to clean up. Maybe there shouldn 't be initial fines and such because they get written up as a strict law and then never get enforced. You're almost afraid that you're going to make more trouble than what it's worth for a neighbor or something . And you just don't even use it. On 5-B, I like Mayor Doherty . I voted for him twice and the third time wasn't a charm. He has some good ideas and some not so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 good at times. As far as the unions, if you don't have a union everybody should have one as far as I'm concerned because otherwise you're at will. And that means that if I don't like your aftershave and I'm the boss, I could tell you there's the door with no consideration as to what -- I would have to pay you unemployment but that's all no matter what you have into the business . And so as far as the American public employment hasn't been the greatest for about 40 years. Thirty-six percenters I call them -- and I'm not against any tax exempt that truly do service to the community like hospitals , colleges , and universities and a whole array of things. But sometimes they are entirely question able. Like I mentioned up in West Side at the top of Linden Street, you could see a field filled with old cinderblocks and stuff. And I would bet that there is no taxes on that property . Hand it back to the City if you don't want it. On the budget, I think it's time we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 have a sit-down with the Mayor and every year and start this a long time before. And I don't know how anybody forms a budget without the tally sheets from the previous year, the audit. I don't know how anybody could do that and be accurate . Once again, one of my pet peeves there's now we're up to about 400 and Pennsylvania included on voting 400 derogatory bills making people jump through hoops to vote, actually giving legislatures the right to overturn the vote from the opposing party especially . So keep on your Congressmen and don't let up. I have to start making calls. I did quite a bit. On COVID, once again I kind of goofed up. I forgot that little map that I seen in the newspaper . And it was people contracting COVID who were antivaxers and Trump voters two to one. And last night I heard in some areas it's six to one and 2 percent of those will probably die. So that's a lot of people and it's still over 100,000 a day. Thank you. Have a good day. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MR. GAUGHAN : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . In listening to the topic that you brought up, I guess it was PEL who was here earlier . I understand the trepidation looking at numbers collected from previous -- from the previous year for taxes. Assuming that there's going to be a continued windfall of multiple years of back taxes being collected is smoke and mirrors . If I collect from you in this year all of your back bills, there's not going to be back bills for me to collect next year. So if we're looking at collecting two years' worth of back bills current plus two years and we've done that, that is two-thirds of the revenue that we are not going to get on the next year because that backlog is not there. I think putting those numbers that is -- it's a shell game. It looks at numbers that of back -- back finances that have been collected that cannot be collected again because they are not due. I would have loved to have seen a breakdown of what was collected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 from the last year and what was collected in back dues separate so you actually had real numbers of what was being collected for a year and what was the back year so you could look at them and go a lot of this has been paid, maybe half of what was the back collected we may recoup in the following years for those people who are still lagging behind. As for the trash, I received information on the trash. And I have always been concerned about the spending of the trash fund and the balancing . I asked almost two years ago for how much money did it cost for DPW to not only dispose of all of trash but how much it cost for them in worker's hours for the collection for the equipment , whatever they wanted to put on a yearly budget. I was told that information was not available . It seems that it never is available even after two years, just put out exactly how much in a yearly revenue that the garbage actually cost to collect . A few weeks ago I asked whether or not the garbage tax was separated as the law codifies needs to be done into a separate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 account . And I've been informed even after the legal challenges in 2017 made every one aware that it was suppose d to be separated , it is still not separated . It's taken in by the Treasurer and put into the general fund who accounts for it. Well, accounting for it outside the law is not accounting for it. That is the same process that got the previous administration jailed for having things done under the table, under color of darkness and saying don't look here. We're trustworthy. Everything is fine. Who -- again, who gets to decide what part of the law the government has to follow and what doesn't? If it's said there's a process in the law, we shouldn 't be going, well, we could trust them for handling it and putting it where they want to just because they're good with numbers . No, that's not it. It needs to be put into a separate fund as per the law. And for a number of years and not doing that has been negligent and knowingly defrauding the people of Scranton because that law is there to protect those funds and to protect 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 accountability . Last is the -- I asked about date of retention of records , specifically e-mails. I asked if there was a policy in place. And it was responded back with the information that there is none. They are thinking about doing a policy for data retention in 2022. Obviously since they are thinking about it in 2022, they are ignoring the requirement s of federal and all the laws that say there has to be a three year retention rate. If there is no policy in place and that's mandated by the government under FOIA regulations , why is the City not doing it and why do they have to look now to decide what they should be following ? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments this evening ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. Mr. Voldenberg , can you do me a favor? It was reported to me that there is an abandoned vehicle in the 900 block of Quincy Avenue. It's parked in front of 912 Quincy Avenue. And it's been there for at least 10 months to a year. And according to the person that brought this to my attention , the car has been out of inspection since July. I guess the police department was there over the summer and the residents that live there said, oh, okay we'll take care of it. But now the resident s have moved. So this car is truly abandoned . So if you could please follow up with that I would appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 evening? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, none at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have two things. First, I want to say that I was very pleased to hear about the announcement that the City received 2 million dollars in state grant funding for the Nay Aug Pool complex . I would like to say though I was concerned about what I read in the paper regarding the Mayor's proposal . We haven't received anything official on exactly what the Mayor would like to do with the pool complex at Nay Aug Park. We know that there's going to be some kind of investment made, but we haven't been apprised of exactly what that's going to look like. Back in the summer, Council received a proposal from a firm laying out quite a few options on what the pool complex 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 could look like. And I think we were almost unanimous in the fact that we wanted to see the City go big with this project because we only have one chance make an impact up at this park. And I'm concerned that the Mayor is not -- I don't think we're going far enough with her plan. I haven't seen the plan. I read about the plan in the newspaper . But Nay Aug Park as I said here before is a jewel of the City of Scranton . It is one of the biggest attraction s that we have. I go through that park all the time. I was just there the other night with my children with the lights at Nay Aug. It is literally one of the biggest and best assets that the City of Scranton has. So just like when Mayor Walsh made an investment years ago in the pool complex , we need to make that same investment . But we cannot cut corners. If we have to look towards a capital borrowing , if we have to look towards other ways of getting this funding , we should do that. But I'm afraid that we don't have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 concrete plan in place. And if we don't get one soon, it's going to be two, three years before this project is completed . So again, I would just like to call on the Mayor to make her plan for the Nay Aug Pool Complex public with Council so that we know what's going to happen up there. And I would urge her to go big there and that we need to make the impact because it's that important . I just want -- the budget is going to remain tabled tonight . We'll bring it back next week for a final vote on Tuesday . I was not really impressed with the caucus tonight . I have to be honest with you with Jerry Cross from the Pennsylvania Economy League. I asked some very pointed questions . The first one being, was the draft budget submitted to PEL on time and he said it was. It was not submitted on time. According to Act 47, it has to be submitted 75 days prior to the end of the fiscal year. That would be October 18th. They submitted it October 24th. That's a week late. There's a pattern here. And judging by the caucus tonight , there was an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 awful lot of people who were asleep at the wheel here in terms of the budget, which is very, very concerning . Now, I don't have to rehash all the mistake s that were made with the budget because I think I've done that over the last two weeks, and I've said my peace. But I was even more concerned tonight with Mr. Cross from PEL. We went from you got a budget, two and a half million dollars in getting delinquent tax revenue . And he said, yep, stamp of approval . Sounds good to me. We get another budget, four and half million , yeah, that's good too. It's like we're dealing with monopoly money here. It's unbelievable . I still have concerns about that revenue figure because of all the things I said earlier . And I think we really should get together with or talk to the County Tax Claim Bureau and find out how much is left to collect on the table. I think Mr. Coyne said it correctly . And I think I made the point during the caucus, they didn't have those figures tonight about how much is left to collect . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 I mean, I had the figures from the Tax Claim Bureau which I stated earlier . We've collected so far from 2018 and prior 2019 and 2020 just in this year alone, we've collected 4.7 million dollars . Prior to the County Tax Claim office collecting the delinquent taxes for the City, 2018, 1.7 million; 2019, 1.7 million . It's just hard for me to believe that we're going to continue to do that next year, especially in light of the fact that the whole agreement with the county is up in the air. The Mayor was here tonight and said they're still negotiating . Well, it's December . It's going to be January . It's going to be February . We've been negotiating since the summer. So I really have concerns about that 4.5 million dollar figure. Mr. Voldenberg , if you could get in touch with the County and the Tax Claim Bureau, I'd like to know what's outstanding , what are we still able to collect from those years. And then we'll see what they say. At this time, I would like to make a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 motion to have Mr. Voldenberg , our City Clerk post an advertisement that City Council hold a public 2022 budget hearing on Tuesday , December 14th at 5:45 p.m. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? As I stated at the top of the meeting , I think it's -- and I know my colleagues agree with me that it's very important that we have this second budget hearing because of all of the changes . Now hopefully , we will have those changes that Council is going to make in amendment form in the same form that we had to use last year when we had to make 55 plus amendments . We'll hopefully have that published Friday -- if not Friday, on Monday so that the public can view changes that we have to make and that we are going to make before the final document is passed by Council . And we will do that. MR. DONAHUE : Just on the question too, I'd like to also have -- I think we have it set up this way where we have the spreadsheet s in its entirety , not just in, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 know, the amendments we're going to make but what it looks like in terms of its entirety will also be posted on Friday as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Anybody else? MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I did discuss it in caucus about my concerns with the revenue compared to expenditures . PEL has warned in the past about that creeping structural deficit that we have. It seems like we're adding more again or we're proposing to add more to the budget again. I'm seeing some fluctuating numbers , real estate being one that you've already identified . And what this budget has included in it is hard increase s to expenditure s that are going to continue into the future and fluctuating numbers or inaccurate numbers that may not pan out at the end of this year and especially aren't going to pan out when it comes to again what's being left on the table in terms of delinquent s. So we're going to come to a spot where, I mean, eventually taxes will have to be raised. But we're going to come to a point in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 time where these things aren't -- I mean, I don't see them as being sustain able at this point in time. But they're my concerns at this point in time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : And to add onto that too, by the way, I failed to mention this. It was clear after talking to Mr. Cross tonight although he wouldn't come right out and say it, this process was rushed. They gave him a budget -- a draft budget on October 24th. He had to have a letter to us by November 15th. The numbers changed so many times. I could only guess that maybe that's why they missed all the mistake s because the numbers were changing . They were getting different numbers up until November 11th. So it's just very, very concerning and hopefully it doesn't happen next year. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 ayes have it and the motion passes. I'd also like to make a motion at this time that Council instruct our City Clerk, Frank Voldenberg to publish an advertisement in the newspaper that we have a special meeting on Wednesday , December 15th at 5:45 p.m. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a second. On the question ? On the question , the reason for this motion is just in case something were to come up, new numbers were thrown at us which at this point I honestly wouldn't be surprised . And we have to pass the budget on December 15th. So we're really just giving ourselves some wiggle room in case that happens. So if that doesn't happen and we pass the budget on Tuesday , December 14th, then we just -- we won't have meeting . The meeting will be cancelled . And we'll post an agenda. And the agenda will be the 2022 budget. That will be the only thing that we will be discuss ing if we need to. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE NAMING OF A NEW POCKET PARK LOCATED AT 248 WYOMING AVENUE IN HONOR OF FORMER MAYOR CHRISTOPHER A. DOHERTY . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , it's an honor for me to speak on this legislation tonight . As everyone knows, public service is often a thankless and a difficult job. There have been 36 mayors who have served our city starting with Mayor Elliott Hill back in 1866. Every mayor who has served our great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 city has in some way had an impact on Scranton 's history . Mayor Doherty had an enormous influence on Scranton which can still be seen to this day. When Mayor Doherty took office in 2002 I was in ninth grade. The downtown was suffering as was our park system, especially Nay Aug where it wasn't surprising to see needles littering the area and criminal activity . Mayor Doherty brought a clear vision of restoring our park system and making our downtown a place where people wanted to live and open businesses . And I just think of all the people throughout the years who utilize Nay Aug once it was restored under the Doherty administration . All of the other parks that were restored under the Doherty administration -- I know I've talked about this numerous times over the last few years, but our park system is so important . I lived across the street from a park. My children use that park. That park was rehabbed . It changed the entire neighborhood . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 People who want to move into a city want to move into a city with a good park system. The lights at Nay Aug Park which were started under Mayor Doherty . The tree house, so many things were spurred by Mayor Doherty . Instead of becoming a dumping ground, Nay Aug Park became an attraction known not only through northeastern Pennsylvania but through the United States. Under Mayor Doherty 's leadership , significant investments were made to our park -- almost every park in each of our neighbors , which actually had a ripple effect throughout the City. So you would rehab a park and other things would start to come alive again in the neighborhoods . Mayor Doherty 's vision also transformed our downtown . New program s were implement ed to attract businesses and resident s to relocate to downtown Scranton . Which if you think about it, back in 2002, no one in their right mind would have ever believe d that we would have resident s living in our downtown . You can't get an apartment in downtown Scranton . There's a waiting list. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 there's been a huge resurgence in our downtown. So someone asked a question , why would we do this? Why would Council unanimously support this? Naming this new downtown park in honor of Mayor Doherty is fitting because it ties together two areas in which he made arguably the biggest impact of any Mayor in the City's history , our downtown and our park system. The fruits of his labor and leadership have had a tremendously positive effect on the City of Scranton . And because of that, it is fitting tonight that we honor him in this way. And I want to thank my colleagues for their unanimous support . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And just to add onto this, we will need to suspend the rules 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 next week to put this in Seventh Order for final passage , Frank, so if we can set the guide up for that. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE FILING OF A PROPOSAL FOR KEYSTONE ELM STREET PROGRAM DESIGNATION WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PINE BROOK NEIGHBORHOOD REVITALIZATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just talked about our neighborhoods . Our neighborhoods in the City of Scranton are so important . It's funny to me, you know, when you talk about living in Scranton and somebody asks you where you're from, Minooka , South Side, Pine Brook, West Side, you know, we are centered in our neighborhood s.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Pine Brook is a neighborhood in our City which needs revitalization . There is so much history there. A lot of the history of our city starts in the Pine Brook section . So I am thrilled that Council along with Mayor Cognetti is taking the initiative here to create this vision and this framework for the resurgence of that neighborhood . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.
