Icertainly hopethatinputfromtheaudit wasconsidered asitwasdrafted .Onthe issueofpensions ,Ihopeyouhavesomekind ofupdate onthestatus ofdouble pensions andyoursubpoena .Ifyoucouldexplain thatduring motions ? Also,IwenttothePension Board meeting yesterday ,Composite Pension Board, andIaskedaboutthatthestatus ofthe thirdpartyadministrator andamongother things Ilearned thatapparently this administrator willbefocusing ondisability pensions ,notpension singeneral ,and though Ihavenoobjection tosomeone looking atdisability pensions ,howwill thisappointment ofathirdpartynationally recognized pension administrator prevent the recurrence ofsomething likethedouble1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 pension fiasco?Inlooking atthe statements thatthemayorhasmadethatthis wasoneofhismajorpension reforms,why arewenothaving anadministrator thatis dealing withanentire pension issueandnot justdisability pensions ?Isthisperson simply goingtositatthetableandifa disability pension requests comesupandhe makesacomment .Otherwise ,hesitsthere doingnothing ?Idon'tunderstand this. Also,I'dliketothough whenweare goingseeanRFPsowecanseethe qualifications thataregoingtoberequired forthisposition .Also,veryinteresting article intheTimes-Tribune afterthe election andwhichitencapsulated statistic forthecityandthecounty andthese apparently arebasedonUSCensus Bureau datafrom2014.Thecounty hasapparently something like40municipalities ,andthey lookattwoissues,onewasmedium household income,andtheotheronewaspercentage of bachelor degrees .Scranton cameinnumber 38outof40formedian householdincome of $37,551.Thatwasbehind Mayfield ,$42,564.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Jermyn,$42,188,andThornhurst Township , $41,833. Intermsofpercentage ofbachelor degrees ,Scranton camein26with21.4 percent ofwhichbeatoutMayfieldwhich onlyhad7.5percent ,Jermyn whichhad9.7 percent ,andThornhurst Township whichhad 10.1percent ,soIwouldsaythatthelow median household income,andit's considerably lowerthanthestateorthe national average isnotduetotheeducation ofourworkforcebecause ourworkforceis pretty welleducated .There'sgottobe someotherreasons andIthinkitwouldbe behoove thecitytolookclosely atthat because oneofthethings thatScranton needsmorethananything elseisajobs,and also,thatpublic sector jobsshould bewell advertised andopentoallqualified residents .Thankyou.

Thirdpartyadministrator forthe pensions cameuptoday,andplease forgive me,Idon'tknowhaveaccurate numbers ,but Iknowitdoesinvolve thedisability claims,andagain,theseareroughnumbers because itwasseveral months ago.Thecity average ofdisability claims were50 percent .50percent ofthemgotapproved .

MR.ROGAN:Yes,IguessI'llpick upwhereMr.Perryleftoffregarding the budget sinceIthinkeveryone wasveryhappy tohearthattherehadnotbeataxincrease inthisyear'sbudget,anditreally represents aturning pointforthecityover thelastdecade whereeveryyeartherehave beenincreases .Ihavelongstated thatone ofthebiggest hindrances tothecity's throat isourtaxstructure ,notonlyreal estate taxesbutthewagetax,fees,which wehavetalked aboutquiteabittonight regarding contractors ,andmanyotheritems within thecitythatreally haverestricted ourgrowth.Myhopeisthatthisbudget is aturning pointforthecity.Wehaveseen,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 asIstated fordecades ,increases .Andno taxincreases isverygood,butevenbetter thanthatisataxcut,andI'mhopeful that thisbudget andmanyoftheinitiatives that havetakenplaceoverthelastyearwill leadustowards reducing taxesforthe residents ofScranton . Acouple ofotheritemsthatwere brought uptonight ,theissueofthe subpoenas wasbrought upagain.Iknow Attorney Minora willbefiling nextTuesday attheCourttosubpoena thosedocuments regarding thedouble pensions scandal .Iam veryanxious togetthosedocuments andto lookthemover.Ihopethatwe--first,I hopethatwedoreceive thedocuments ,we'll seetheremaybesomelegalwrangling ,but I'mconfident ,wehaveanexcellent attorney inAttorney Minora,I'msurewilldoagreat jobrepresenting ourcaseforus.

Wedohavealongwaytogo,butweare certainly ontherighttrack. And,finally ,actually onthe contractor legislation ,Ithinkit's--I thinkweallagreethatwemaybealittle moreconfused afterthecaucus thanwewere prior,IknowIam,butIdothinkthereis middle ground thatcanbereached herefrom whatMr.Hinton saidfromwhatmanyofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 contractors thatareheresaid,andIthink wevery,veryclose.Itjustsounds likeit mightbeoneortwoitemsthatneedbeadded orsubjected inthisordinance tomake everyone happy.Personally Iwouldlike, andasIstated lasttimearound,Idid support theoriginal legislation whichI'm confident wearenotpassing inthisform, sotherehastobeamiddle drowned that's mether.Personally Iwouldliketosee morelicense dcontractors inthecity, especially ontheresidential side.Ihave heardofsomanytimesfrompeople throughout thecity,manytimesseniors that theycan'tfindsomebody todothework especially asmalljobwhen,youknow,they can'tfindsomebody thatwantstogooutand dothat,youknow,veryminorjob,butit needstobedone.SoI'mhopeful thatwe cancomeupwithsomething thatkeepsthe safety,keepsthe--youknow,theitems thatneedtobe--boxesthatneedtobe checked asfarastesting goes,andatthe sametimeallowmorepeople iftheyneedthe qualifications todoworkwithin theCityof1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 Scranton .

MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou, Mr.Gaughan .It'sbeenlongevening soI willjusttouchbriefly onsomeofthe issues thatcameuponusthisevening . Number one,inregardstothebudget wehave received abudget,wearequitehappythat thereisnotaxincrease ,andtobehonest withyoutherecouldnotbeataxincrease . Weareatthepointoftax--thehighest taxesthatwecanhave.Therecannever beenanysignificant taxincreases again. Inmyopinion ,overthepastthreeyearswe havetakenthetaxratetowhereitshould havebeenforalloftheyearsthatthere weren'ttaxincreases ,andIthinkrightnow weareatthepointwherewebeginto gradually workwithourbudget andcontrol ourcoststhatisatleastinlinewith inflation ,soIthinkaswemoveforward I thinkweareinabetter place. Also,fromspeaking toBusiness Administrator Bulzoni ,thefactthatour1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 financial houseisgetting inorderandthe budget isinplacewealsohadabetter reception toourapplication fortheTAN, taxanticipation note,fornextyearandit ismyunderstand thatthatwillbedone quitesoonatamuchbetter ratethanwe experienced inthepast,soallthesesteps thatwehavebeentaking intermsofgetting ourfinancial houseinorderarebeginning topayoff.Wearegoingtogothrough the budget again,wearegoingtotakealookat whereperhaps therearesomesavings , perhaps therearesomebetter efficiencies inthebudget,butwewillbedoingthat overcourse ofthenextcouple ofweeks. Intermsofthecontractor 's legislation ,it'stakenusalongtimeto gettothispoint.Lastyearwewent through it,itwasn'tsatisfactory tous, Director Hinton hadworked onitandwealso continued tolookatitandalsoworkwith thecommunity ofthemenandwomenthatdo thiswork.AndIthink,asmycolleagues havesaid,Ithinkweareverycloseto coming toapointwherewehavesatisfied1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 ourconcerns forsafety,ourconcerns that workisdonebyqualified people,and Scranton alsobecomes abetter placetodo business soIthinkweareverycloseto thatrightnow,andIappreciate the comments thatwehavegotten fromthe public.Ialsoappreciate theworkthat Mr.Hinton hasdone,andalsoIappreciate theworkthatmyfellow council menhavedone trying togetthisissueresolved .Ithink weareinamuchbetter placewiththat.
