Also,wewilltryanddetermine what thestatus oftheauditis,the2013audit, andwhenitwillbecompleted .Hopefully we willhavethatanswer,again,bynextweek. Justageneral comment ,somebody talked about--Ifinditunusual that Lackawanna County isoneofthefewthat doesnothaveacounty fairgrounds . MR.ROGAN:Wearetheonlyonein thestatethatdoesnot.

Wecan'tsupport something thatdoesn't exist,atleastthatismybelief,andwhen somebody presents uswithanapplication or hasanapplication wewill,infact,dowhat Ijustsaid. Also,thecomments aboutsmokeand mirrors andinsults fromcouncil andcouncil beingdisrespectful topeople atthepodium, Iwouldlikesomebody toprovide evidence of anycouncil member beingdisrespectful to anyone atthepodium.InthispastyearI cannot remember anytimethatthattook1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 place.Ifanything ,theinsults and disrespect camefromthepodium towards council andthereisampleevidence ofthat.

Ifwedonot--ifweareunable to passthisnewcontract ,thesavings thatwe wouldexperience willnotbeexperienced . SoIthinkthat'ssomeofthethings that havetobeconsidered besides avalid extension aswelookatithere.Thereis alsothreegrievances currently thatthe police department hasthatwillbewaived if thecontract passes,whichisanother potential savings ofalotofmoney,so besides whenwelookatthiseveryone hasto lookatthewholepicture andconsider ifwe canstarttotakeadvantage ofthosesavings now.Thankyou,Mr.McGoff. MR.MCGOFF:Anyone else? MR.EVANS:Yes,onthequestion .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 TheAmoroso plan,whichIhavebeen steadfast insupport ofsaysthefollowing , "Reopen thecitycontracts withthe collecting bargaining units,focuson renegotiating health careandespecially pension reformaswellaschanges to starting salaries ,timebetween stepsand rankingstandards anddistribution ." Thatsounds likeablueprint or concessions .Ourgoalwasunionconcessions andsomehow weveered offinthedirection wehave.We'veturned itintoafully renegotiated contract .Sometimes Ilookfor simple answers forcomplex problem andI'm afraid thatsomehowthisMOAmayhave complicated theprocess evenmoreand,quite frankly ,I'mstilltrying tofigure outthe savings andthecoststothisMOA.Wehave received documentation fromChiefGraziano andAttorney Abrahamsen andBusiness Administrator DaveBulzoni ,all comprehensive ,butallseparate and different andunique intheirownway.I appreciate theirhardwork,butagain,Iam seekingsimple clearandconcise answers to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 thiscomplex issue.Iamlooking forone setofcomprehensive answers inaneasily understandable format,period,andIjust don'thavethatatthispoint. AsImentioned ,therearemany things IdolikeaboutthisMOAandIwill saythatthesection that--thesection thatcovers thepersonnel restructuring and someothers thatwereclearly werearesult ofChiefGraziano 'sinvolvement werewell though outandwillhaveapositive effect onthemanpower andovertime inthe department ,andtheaddition oftwoSIT clerks toenforce on-street parking citywide isaconcession 20yearsinthemaking,so thankyou,Chief,andUnionleadership for yourefforts onthoseissues. However ,I'mnotafanofother areasofthecontract ,particularly adding thefifthweekofvacation ,liberal sick leavepolicy,retirement andhealth care section ,andthefactthatthereisno reference toPennsylvania reformfornew hires.Withchanges inthoseareasIwould easily voteforthisplan.IfImay,I'd1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 liketoexpand ononeofthoseissues, retiree health care.Theintent istoallow sixeligible employees toparticipate in thisbenefit ,andinsomewayevenhelp lowerthedisability pension requests by someofficers thatareapproaching retirement age.However ,aswritten according totheScranton Times,therewere 99police officers thatwerehiredafter January 1,1994,andwilleventually be eligible toparticipate inretiree health carebenefits .Theargument thatthis benefit willbenegotiated outofthe contract whenthiscontract expires tome hasnomerit.Firstofall,morethan65 percent ofthevoting members oftheFOP willbeeligible forthisbenefit whenthe nextcontract isnegotiated .Humannature simply wouldindicate thatthose65percent thatareeligible wouldnotgoingtoremove abenefit thatwouldallowthempersonally andtheirspouses tohaveretiree benefits . Now,let'stalkaboutthecostof thisbenefit ifitremains ineffect beyond thecontract period.Theadministration 's1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 ownnumbers haveindicated a$224,780per employee fortenyearsofretireebenefits forthemandtheirspouse.Intoday's healthcaredollars thatwouldmeanthatall 99eligible employees eventually elected to takeit,iftheydid,itwouldcostthecity over$22million .Again,thatisintoday's health carecostdollars .Ifmustbe assumed thathealth carecosts,asthey always do,continue toriseandincrease overtheyears. Additionally ,ifitisproven that thefiredepartment hasaparity clause,and evenifdoesn't,surely theywillwantthis language intheirrenegotiated contract . Thereareapproximately 65firemen thatwill fitinthiscategory aswell.Adding to thisnumber,another $14million basedon thepolice calculation .Thiswouldmeana totalintheareof$36million .Now, again,usingtoday'shealth carecosts.So whatwouldappear tobeacostof$449,520 that'spresent bytheadministration forthe MOAperiod mostlikely couldcostasmuchas $40million ormoreiftheretireehealth1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 carebenefit costisnotnegotiated outin thefuture. Soonceagain,inmyopinion weare kickingthecandowntheroad,opting for whatappears tobeashort-termfixand setting ourselves upforanother long-term fiscal climate .Itisnolonger somebody else'sproblem ,itisourproblem .Weare theonesthatareheretodaymaking decisions thatwefeelwillbeinthecity's bestinterest andwedohaveachoice. That'sallIhavefornow. MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou. MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,onthequestion . Thankyou.Iwillbevoting against introducing thislegislation tonight .After reviewing theinformation thatwasgivento uspiecemeal andattimesbegrudgingly , whichIstillfindcompletely shocking ,over thepasttwoweeks,Istillhavemany concerns .Ithinkitwouldbeirresponsible tointroduce thiscontract evenfor consideration .Let'sfirstremember that theentire purpose ofasking forconcessions wastoaddress thecity'sescalating1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 financial crises withthegoalofsaving money.Thiswasnotsupposed tobeafull blowncontract negotiation . Scranton iscareening offafiscal cliffandisinnoposition andcertainly undernoobligation toofferadditional benefits thatwillsinkthecityeven further .Twoweeksagothemayortouted thatthiscontract willsave$750,000toa million dollars annually overthelifeof theagreement .Ifthiswassuchacritical savings andthecitywasinsuchdire financial condition ,thenwhywouldthe mayoraddover$1million ofdiscretionary expenditures tothe2015budget thatwas justpassed amonthago? Ifyouaddallofthenewpositions , allofthesalary increases ,andincreases indepartmental expenditures ,whichIdid, andIwasverygenerous ,Ididn'tinclude somethatIthought wemightneed,yougeta totalofover$1million ,andthat'snot including contractual expenses .Foracity that'sonfinancial lifesupport thismade absolutely nosense,sothealleged savings1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 andnumbers thatIstillfindsomewhat questionable thathadbeentouted inthis contract willjustaboutcoverthemayor's increases inthisyear'sbudget. It'smyopinion thatthecity taxpayers stillenduponthelosing end hereandthecityinthelong-termdoesn't really saveanymoney.Therearespecific revisions tothiscontract thatIhave serious concerns with.Thefirstis something thatMr.Evanstouched on.The administration agreed togivebackhealth carebenefits toemployees andtheirspouses hiredafterJanuary 1,1994.The administration hassaidthechange is intended toeffect onlysixemployees . However ,thoseemployees arenotmentioned intheagreement andthecitymaybe required toofferspousal health care benefits toallemployees hiredafter1994, andMr.Evansandthepapermentioned that thatIthinkis99employees . Somyquestion isandhasbeenwhy arethesesixemployees notspecifically mentioned intheagreement ?Whyisthat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 provision ambiguous ?It'smyopinion that thiscouldenduphaving adevastating crippling effect onthecity'sfinances . Employees willreceive a9percent salary increase overthelifeofthecontract .I haveaskedforadetailed breakdown ofhow thiswillcostthecityoverthelifeofthe agreement .Ican'tunderstand howthis administration andthefinancial statethat itfindsitself incanafford togiveout raises. Theadministration hastouted an increase inthepension contribution ,which isgood,butthefactofthematter isthat thattheemployees willonlybecontributing 21/2percent moretotheirpension ,which isaninvestment intheirownretirement .I talked tomanyresidents overthepasttwo andahalfweekswhohaveendured wage freezes intheirownjobsduring thistough economic timeswhocannot fathom howa struggling municipality cangiveoutraises. Thisadministration expects our citizens tomakesacrifices financially , yet,weneverseemtopractice whatwe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 preach. SomeoftheotherrevisionsthatI'm having trouble understanding isthesick timepolicy.Asthepaperpointed out,it's exceptionally generous .Othercities similarly sizedhavenowherenearthesame policy thatwearegoingtoinstitute ,and sotomethatmakesnosense.Theextra weekofvacation ,theparking enforcement , whichIbelieve ismaking money,andisnot asavings ,it'sarevenue generator sowho knowshowthatwillpanout. Butoneofthemosttroubling parts ofthiswholeagreement inmyopinion isit theextension ofthecontract until2021. Lastyear,asweknow,thestatelegislation madeprovisions toAct47,theDistressed Municipalities Act.Oneofthemost significant changes wastoimpose atimeline forcities togetoutofdistressed status. Scranton hasuntil2017tomakeprogress toward exiting Act47.Ifwearenotoutof thedistressed status in2017,wewillhave torequest athree-yearextension whichis thendependent uponapproval ofathree-year1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 exitplan.Iftherequest isapproved , Scranton 'sfinaldeadlineis2020before it faceseither receivership ,bankruptcy or dissolution asamunicipality . Theexisting police contract issaid toexpire proximate 2017.Ifitisextended to2021,Ibelieve thatitwouldtiethe city'shandsintwowaysmoving forward . First,weeliminate thepossibility ofthe citytorenegotiate thepolice contract in 2017whenpreparing theimportant three-year exitplan. Second,theextended contract would stillbeineffect foranadditional year afterthefinaldeadline in2020.This meansthatboththecityandthestatewill beboundtothiscontract forafullyear afterourAct47status expires .Sothis four-yearextension Ifearmayhavea negative effect onthecity'sability toget outofdistressed status before themandated deadline. Thedefinition ofconcession is something doneoragreed toimprove a situation .Afterreviewing thiscontract ,I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 believe thisadministration willonceagain bekickingthecandowntheroad.This administration willonceagainbemaking decisions thatwillshackle usfinancially foryearstocomeandthisadministration is onceagaingambling withthefuture ofour city.Scranton taxpayers deserve agood dealandwhenIseeoneIwillvoteforit. Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Acouple ofcomments . Firstofall,mybelief isthatthecurrent contract thatwehaveisnotsustain able. Thereareraises,thereareotherbenefits thatareincluded inthiscontract thatthe current contract thatIbelieve willmoveus toward further towards thecliffthat Mr.Gaughan mentioned .Ithinkthatthe revision thatweremadeintheproposed contract arethings thataresustain able. Whenthiswasproposed orwhenthis negotiation stated therewerethreethings thatIwaslooking for:First,someconcern aboutthepension ,andIbelieve thatby increasing thepension contributions ofthe police department oremployees tothepolice1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 department whileitdoesn'tnecessarily ,you know,fundthepension complete lyitisa stepforward .Itissomething thatwas needed tobedone. Ialsowasconcerned aboutnewhires andinthepropose dcontract thesalary provisions fornewhiresIthinkisofgreat savings moving forward . Iwasalsoconcerned aboutovertime . Wearespending closetoamillion dollars inovertime atthecurrent --underthe current contract .Ibelieve thatthe provisions thatareintheproposed contract willdosomething todecrease thisovertime . Also,included arethings thatI didn'texpect,whatIwouldcallextra benefits ,thereorganization ofthepolice department .Ithinkwillgoalongwayto making thepolice department moreefficient andalsogoalongwaytoputting more people --morepolicemenonthestreets wheretheyareneeded. Also,therevisionsinthemanning ofthepolice department Ithinkit'sa greatsavings andtheSITreemployment or1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 reemployment ofSITpersonnel wasanother thingthatisabenefit underthisproposed contract . Arethereconcerns ,yes?AndI believe thatCouncilman Gaughan and Councilman Evans,youknow,delineated those.Health careforretirees isa concern ,butit'saconcern aswemoveto 2021.Wedon'tpossess theability to foreseewhatwillhappen in2021.While Councilman Gaughan talksaboutmaybemoney, Italkaboutthisisamaybeexpenditure . Wedon'tknowwhatwillhappen there. Also,theconcern thatCouncilman Gaughan brought aboutthelength ofthe contract thatisalsoaconcern .Itgoes beyond thelength ofwhatwillbethe revisedrecovery plan.Thatisaconcern , butIbelieve thatthebenefits thatwewill seethrough thelength ofthecontract , whileyoumaycallthemshort-termbenefits , Ibelieve thatthosebenefits arethings thatweneedinordertomakethecitywhole again.Weneedrelief nowandifwedon't getsomething ,asIsaid,Idon'tbelieve1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 thatthecurrent contract issomething that wecansustain . MR.ROGAN:Ialready madethevast majority ofmycomments onthisunder motions ,buttherewasoneotherthingthat Ididwanttopointout,andit'ssomething thatalotofpeople don'tunderstand unless youareingovernment orinaunionit's difficult tounderstand ,contract negotiations between thepublic sector union andthemunicipality arenotcapable tothe private sector.Therearefairlabor practice lawsinthecity.Ifthecitywere tocomeinandsay,"Wethinkpolice officers aremaking toomuchmoney,wewant tocuteveryone 'spay10percent "orasthe previous mayordidfreeze wagesfora certain period oftime,itgoestoan arbitrator .Wedon'thavetheflexibility thatsomebody inaprivate sector wouldor withourat-willemployees whichwedohave thatflexibility toflatly change salaries .

Wouldweliketoseemoreasfaras concessions ?Ofcourse,everyone would,but thisisafaircontract .Itgivesminimal raises,whichareactually morethanupset bytheincrease inpension contributions by theemployees . Ithinkthevastmajority ofthe itemsinherearehelpful forthecity. Obviously ,asmentioned bymycolleagues therearesomeconcern s,andIdothinkit's dangerous togooutandsay,well,because ofthiscontract that'sgoingtoeffect 90 somemoreemployees because wedon'tknow whatwearegoingtobeinsevenyears. Hopefully thecitywillbeinamuchbetter financial position ,that'sallofourgoal, butthatmightnotbethecase.Alotcan happen between nowandthenandthisdealis byfarthebestdealthatcanbenegotiated besides goingtoanarbitrator wherewe wouldgetdestroyed andhaveincreases ,you know,inpayof55percent ,retroactive1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 benefits ,andnotonlythatbutjustforthe morale ofthecityandthemorale ofthe cityemployees theperiod oftimeoverthe previous administration wasoneoflabor unrest,especially amongst thepublic safety employees whicharecertainly themost important employees thecityhas. SoIwillnot--Iwon'tgoontoo longaboutthis,butthat'showIfeelon aboutthisissueandmainly thepoints that Imadeearlier comparing what'shappened in thepasttowhatwearecurrently considering .
