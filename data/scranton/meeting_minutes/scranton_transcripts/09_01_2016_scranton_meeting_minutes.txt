Next,obviously overthelastmonth therehasbeen--we'vehadsometorrential rainstorms,andIknowsit'sbeenanissue inallpartsofthecity.LastweekImet withresidents onWestMountain andKeyser Valley.Theyarehaving significant problems ,andtheyarenotnewproblems but theyhavegotten worseyearafteryear. FromwhatIhavebeentold,therainwater problem actually originates --onWest Mountain actually originates inNewton Ransom.Therehasbeenalotofnew development ,newhouses beingbuiltandthat waterhastogosomewhere .Unfortunately ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 it'sgoingdownWestMountain though West Mountain Road,andit'scausing alotof issues withpavement andfurther downonto Keyser AvenueandthenintotheKeyser Valleyarea.

Onanother note,thesewerdeal.No thereisnoPlanBasfarasIknow,Joan,I wishtherewasaPlanB,butthereisnot, butassomeone whohasworked foralarge utility for30yearsandhasbeenthrough numerous PUCrequests forrateincreases I foundtherecent comments bythe administrative lawjudges onthesewerdeal tobebothpredictable andinmyview somewhatexpected .However ,Idisagree with theirinterpretation andtheirlistofAct 11,andtheability forutilities tospread costsacross alarger customer ratebase.I thinktheywerewayoffbasewiththose comments .

That'sallIhavefornow. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou. Mr.Gaughan ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,thankyou.

Also,Iwasreally disturbed over therecess withthewayourLicensing , Inspections andPermits Department is currently beingrun.Director Hinton had sentane-mailtoallofusregarding putting thecontractor 'sordinance ,which hadpreviously beendefeated ,backontoour agenda,apparently therehavebeenchanges thathavebeenmade.Within thee-mail,Mr. Hinton stated thatsincehehasbeen director hehashadtodenyover250 applications foracontractor 'slicense in theCityofScranton . Inreply,Isimply askedforthe namesofthecompanies orpersons who applied foralicense andthereasons they weredenied andwastoldbyDirector Hinton thattheydon'tkeepthoserecords inthe office.Theygivethedenied application backtotheapplicant .Theonlyrecords thattheykeep,according toMr.Hinton,are whenaperson challenges thedenial.

Iwouldalsolikeanupdateonthe Rockwell Avenuebridge project andwhen exactly thatwillbecompleted .Iam hearing conflicting reports onthe completion date.Ithought itwasDecember , nowI'mhearing itmaybelater,soIwould likeclarification onthatbefore next Thursday . Also,somegoodnews,thecityis partnering withtheUniversity ofScranton andastudent whoiscompleting hissenior project todevelop aCityofScranton mobile appprototype orproofofconcept .This mobile application willbegivenoverview of cityservices ,downtown businesses ,things todowithin downtown Scranton ,anditisa collaboration between theCity,Scranton Tomorrow andtheUniversity ofScranton so thatwasexciting newsandIwasgladtobe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 involved inthatmeeting .

I'dalsoliketorequest anupdate ontheCity'slighting project .Wetalked aboutthisbefore therecess,butIfeelwe alsoneedanupdate onthepavecutprogram inthecity,andIwouldliketoknowifthe legislation thatwepassed months agoto protect ourinfrastructure andholdthe utilities companies accountable isbeing implemented andIwouldlikeknowifitis working.I'malsogetting conflicting reports onthat.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Asitrelates tothestormwater,I continue tobeextremely concerned aboutthe mayor'slackofaplanforstormwater management inthecity.Ifinditalmost unbelievable thatMayorCourtright would consider selling offoneofourmajor assets,theScranton SewerAuthority , without firsthaving aclearandconcise plantomanage ourstormwater infrastructure .It'snotlikethisissome bigsurprise thatjustfellintohislap. Themayorandhisadministration havebeen awareofthepending stormwater infrastructure mandates fromtheEPAfor quiteafewyearsthousand .Iamnotsure whythemayorthinks thewaitandsee approach isagoodidea,usually thatnever worksout.AndasCouncilman Evanssaid, thereisnoPlanB,Ialsodon'tbelieve thattheyhaveaPlanBwhichisreally scary. Ihavesuggested onmultiple occasions tothemayortoformashared services committee .Thiswasa recommendation intherecovery planand1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 required themayortobringallofthe stakeholders together fromoutlying cities andboroughs whoarealsofacedwithallof thesevarious issues andseehowwecanwork together andsharetheburden. Unfortunately ,themayorneveranswers .As usual,hecan'tbereached forcomment .

Intalking tothebusiness administrator , afterthisinitial studytakesplacean another comprehensive analysis hastobe undertaken.Whatisthemayor'splanto maintain thestormwaterinfrastructure on dayoneiftheScranton SewerAuthority is soldwhichnow,asweknow,isalsoin question ?Again,unfortunately ,hecan'tbe reached forcomment .Thishas,quite frankly ,become adisturbing trendinBill Courtright'salmost threeyearsasmayorof thiscity.Herefuses toanswer the difficult questions ,herefuses totakea1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 stance ontheimportant issues suchasthe landfill ,andhewon'tmakeamoveorspeak awordwithout theapproval ofateamof lawyers .Wedidn'telecttheattorneys ,we didn'telectthebusiness administrator ,we elected BillCourtright toleadandsofar inmyopinion hehasfailed.Thankyou.

Aswasstated earlier ,hewasdedicated to theCityofScranton ,hewasdedicated to hisneighborhood andwasdedicated tohis family andhewillbesorely missed. Oneannouncement moving forward is thatMonday isLaborDaysocityhallwill beclosed.DPWwillalsobeoffthatday andrefuge andrecycling collections willbe delayed byonedaynextweek. Inregards tosomeoftheother issues thatwerebrought upthisevening , overthebreakIdidrequest information1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 fromMr.Barrett attheSewerAuthority concerning thestormeventthathappened at theendofJuly.Thisletter willbe available ,Ijustbrought itintonight ,but twoofthemainquestions thatIasked Mr.Barrett wasifthelinehadbeenused during thatstormperiod,andalsoifitwas usediftheflowwasmetered andinhis response Mr.Barrettsays,"Thealternate lineforpretreated wastewaterbeing discharged fromtheKeystone Sanitary Landfill treatmentwasnotusedduring the weekofJuly25,2016through July31, 2016." Healsofurther said,"Again,the alternate linewasnotused.Thelineused exitstheKSLchuteandlandproperty listed amileorsointerfaces withthecombined sanitary sewer,thesewerlinenearthetop ofDrinker StreetandtheAuthorities manhole No.57.Atthispoint,the pretreated wastewatercomesincontact with untreated sanitary wasteflowing toour wastewatertreatment plantinSouth Scranton andMinooka border."1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 Sowedidaskifwaterfromthe landfill camethrough thesystem thatnight, Mr.Barrettsaidno. Ididhaveameeting with Mr.Barrett todiscuss thismatter,also,to discuss aswasspeaking hereaboutthestorm watermanagement system forthecity.It's myunderstanding fromspeaking tohimthat thedaytheSewerAuthority issoldthenext daytheCityofScranton isresponsible for thestormwatermanagement ofthecity.The SewerAuthority willtakeover--orthenew owners ofthesewerauthority willtakeover anyofthecombined sewerlines,soanything that--theolderlinesinthecity,the SewerAuthority willtakeoverthose,soin myopinion wehavetobereadywithaStorm WaterManagement Authority thedaythesale iscomplete andwehavetoworkoutthe details ofthat. OurDPWworkers haveaninterest and contract ualrequirement todothatworkof stormwatermanagement sosomewhere along thelinewearegoingtohavefigure outhow wecancreate astormwaterauthority and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 alsoworkinthecurrent obligations the cityhastowards itsworkers . Fromtalking toMr.Barrett ,weare waybehind ongetting thisgoing.Ifthe planistohaveaSewerAuthority sale completed bytheendoftheOctober ,closing probably sometime inthebeginning ofnext year,wehavetohaveallofthisinplace rather quickly .So,aswasdiscussed here bymycolleagues ,wereally havetoget moving alongwithhowwecanhandle this problem . Also,asIspoketoMr.Barrett , it'sapparently clearregardless ofwhether theSewerAuthority transaction takesplace ordoesn'tthestormwaterissuestillhas tobecontrolled .Thecityhasbeenfound inviolation ofEPArequirements onstorm waterthatwentintotheChesapeake Bayarea soregardless ofwhathappens withtheSewer Authority wearegoingtohavetocomeup withaplansometime nextyear. Ialso,aswasspoken about,Idid attend theSewerAuthority meeting last Thursday nightjusttogetafeelforthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 problem withtheeasements .Thewaywe understand itisthereis1,600easements thatareinrequired wherethestormwater linesareundercityproperties andinthe course ofthe40to50yearhistory ofthe city,theSewerAuthority onlyhasabout 1,000ofthoseeasements inplace.The other600havetobecompleted before the transaction .Onceagain,regardless of whether theSewerAuthority saletakesplace ornot,Ithinkit'simperative thatweget thisproblem straightened out.The easements wherepeople whohavesewerlines undertheirproperty it'samajorconcern , number one,people don'twanttheir properties damaged .Number two,people want theSewerAuthority tocomeoutona property ifthereisaproblem withthe sewerline.So,onceagain,regardless of whether ornottheSewerAuthority still happens ornotthisissomething thathasto betakencareof. IalsotodayIcontacted Mr.Barrett toseeifthereisanyplansforthe meetings forpeople whoreceived easements1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 letters andcurrently theydon'tbecause theydidn'thaveamechanism todoit.I hadsuggested tothemthatthemeeting really should besomewhere --heldsomewhere wheretheycanbreakitdowninto neighborhoods wheremapscouldbevisible . Thisproblem isthroughout thewholecity. Easements arerequired inWestScranton , SouthScranton ,Greenridge ,EastMountain , everywhere sothisisamajor,majorthing thathastobecorrected ,andatthemeeting Mr.Walker andMr.Barrett didagreethat themailing oftheseletters wasnothandled properly andtheycouldhavedidabetter job,andIagreewiththem,sotheyare trying torectify thatsituation andsee wherewearewithit.Ihavebeentalking withMr.Barrett totryandmovethatalong. Also,thereisnoPlanBforthe SewerAuthority .Thereason whythereisno PlanBisbecause thesaleoftheSewer Authority waspartofourapproved recovery plan.Thereshould beanalternative method andwedon'twanttothinkaboutwhatthe alternative method isbutwedohaveto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 realizethatrightnowthesaleoftheSewer Authority isamajorlynchpinofthe recovery plan,andasitiswehavetodeal withthatrightnowandwewillbeevaluated byPELinthenextfewmonths toseeifwe areontrackwithourrecovery planandthey willmakethedetermination whereweareat andifwearemoving alongfastenough to avoidreceivership andtheywillhavetodo thatevaluation toseewherethatgetsus.
