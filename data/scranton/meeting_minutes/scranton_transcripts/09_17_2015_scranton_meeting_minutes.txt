Inregards tothepension ,because ofthenewfirefighter contract thesenew employees willbepaying intothesystem not taking moneyoutsoincurrent timewewill actually behelping thepension fundlevels, andthecomment thatweshould nothireany firemenuntilweevaluate thecostofthe pension isunrealistic because wearegoing tohavetohirefiremen ,policemen,DPW workers andothercityemployees ,soweare goingtohavetokeephiring people,weare goingtohavetogetourcostsunder control ,butnottohirepeople because of thepension requirements Idon'tthinkit wouldeverwork.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 Intermsofthebenefits ,theSAFER grantcovers thebenefits forthenew--all ofthenewbenefits .Andintermsofentry costs,it'struethatthecitymustpayfor training forthenewfirefighters atabout $102,000.Thistraining willcreate apool offirefighters thataretrained notonlyin fireprevention ,butalsoEMTtraining and certification .Ifthereisalayoff,these officers wouldbeavailable forrecall as neededandwouldnothavetogothrough retrain ing.

"Wearegoingtotrytomakesurethat Boscov'sisdoingwellandwecontinue to payoffwhatever thecityhasdueeveryyear overthenext10years." WhenMr.Boscov washererequesting theapplication fortheRAP-PgrantI specifically askedhimifhewasgoingto makeapayment thisyearandhesaidyes, andIaskedhimifhecouldmakeitearlier thisyearandhealsosaidyes.SoIwould1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 justliketofollow uponthattoseeif thereisaplanforMr.Boscov tomakeany otherdonations tothecitythisyearto helpuspaysomeofthecostsoftheloans thatheisinvolved with. ThisweekCouncilman Gaughan and Councilman Evansandmyself wetookatour oftheMidtownapartments .TheMidtown apartments wereseverely affected bythe recent Sandone Fireandthrough nofaultof anyone therewaskindofalackof communications intermsofservices that needed toberendered during thattimeof thatemergency inregards tolackofwater, smoke,anddifferent things likethatsoand Ifigure mycolleagues willtalkalittle moreaboutit,butIthinkpartofthe problem ofthisiswenolonger havea director ofpublic safety whowouldbemore orlessresponsible forthegeneral safety oftheentire area. OnethingthatIdidwhenwesatand wetalked aboutthisIalsothought that Lackawanna County Emergency Planning should havebeenalittle moreinvolved inthis.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 IknowLackawanna County sometimes likesto thinkofScranton asonit'sown,butI thinkinasituation whereit'samass problem IthinkLackawanna emergency services couldhavebeeninvolved inthata little bitmore. EverytimeIhearaspeaker talk abouttheneighborhood associations itkind ofgetsmydander upalittle bit.Tonight wehadaspeaker saythattheneighbor hood association sarebecoming extensions of political arms.Well,Ihavemaintained my attendance intheneighborhood meeting ,I havemaintained mycommitments tothese neighborhood groups andIcantellyouright nowthatthereinterest isnotpolitical . Igotothesegroups,IwasatNorth Scranton onMonday night,theywere discussing plansforafundraiser ,withthe October festtheywerealsoplanning a ceremony ofcelebration ofsomeone upthere whodoesalotofvolunteer work.Iknow Mrs.Foster'sgroupdoesalotofwork, SouthScranton doesalotofwork,andI shouldn 'tgoonbecause I'llprobably forget1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 somebody ,buttoaccuse theneighborhood association leaders andmembers asbeing partoftheproblem youcan'tbeanymore wrong.Thesepeople dothisworkandthey don'tgetpaid,theyputlonghoursin,and theonlyreward thattheygetisfromthe people intheirneighborhood .So,youknow, youcanattack usandyoucanvoteforus, notvoteforuse,that'swhywehave elections everyfouryears,butIreally thinkthatattacking neighbor hoodgroups is uncalled for.

Anditwasjustoddthathestarted withonetrainofthought andthen completely switched toanother andIthink knowing myposition onillegal immigration andknowing whereIwascoming from,soI didalittle investigation intothistoday andIcallwasplaced totheUnited Neighborhood Centers totheSCOLAlearning center andaquestion wasaskedwasthatif anindividual wasintheUnites States illegally ,cametosignupforthisprogram1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 whether theywouldbeallowed andtheanswer wasabsolutely yesthatthisprogram would accept somebody whowashereintheUnited Statesillegally toteachthemEnglish .And asImentioned before,Ihavenoproblem withthattypeofprogram ,Iactually think it'sgreatthatthereissomething outthere toteachpeople English ,myproblem isthat $10,000oftaxpayer moneyisbeingusedfor aprogram thatisprimarily benefiting illegal immigrants overAmerican citizens . Sothatbeingsaid,Iwouldliketo makeamotion toamendItem6-Basperthe following changes :Change funding forDress Success forLackawanna County,whichisan excellent women'sorganization fromzero dollars to$10,000,interchange funding from United Neighborhood Centers fromtheSCOLA program ,from$10,000tozerodollars .

Iamalsodisgusted inthewayMayor Courtright hashandled thiscontract . Council washanded itatthe11thhour without anyinputorupdates fromthemayor throughout thecontract negotiations .This, unfortunately ,isyetanother example ofa lackofleadership andtransparency onthe partofMayorCourtright andhis administration .Thankyou. MR.WECHSLER :Onthequestion , Mr.Rogan,Iamalsodisappointed thatcity1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 council didnothaveanopportunity tobe involved inthisdiscussion priortoit beingissued tous.Ifoundthattalking to Attorney Cohen,although hemaynothave received thethings thatwewereafter,we mayhavebeenabletogetsomething in return.SoIhaddiscussions withAttorney Coleman andamodest,amodest acquiescence thatComcast hasgivenusisthatthereare internet programs andcablechannel programs thatareavailable fordiscounts forpeople whohavelowincomes .Theyhaveagreed to publicize thosemoretomakethemmore well-knownsothatpeople whodowantto applyforthemtheywillhaveachance. Theyinformed usthattheydohavea cablepackage withavariety ofopen broadcast andpopular cablechannels that rangefrom$22to$40permonth.Theyalso haveaneconomy internet program ,whichisa standaloneservice ,for$40or$30when combined withanother product .LikeIsaid, Iknowthatisnotwhatwewereafter,but perhaps ifpeople wereunaware ofthat program Comcast willtrytomakethemmore1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 well-known. Comcast isalsoworking onasmall PILOTprogram designed toincrease internet adoption ratesforlowincome citizens .We willbeworking withthemandtrytomake thatwell-known. Intermsoftheservice center,I havebeentalking aboutkeeping theservice center attheSteamtown Mallpriortothis contract beingsenttous.Ihadexpressed myconcerns several timesyetthat information nevergottoComcast andfrom talking tothemtheyactually hadconsidered closing thisstoreintheSteamtown Malltwo yearsago.Theywereoftheopinion that theSteamtown Mallwasgoingtofailsothey haddecided twoyearsagotomoveoutofthe city. Inspeaking tothem,again,tomake something ofabadsituation Comcast now established apartnership withWestern Union whichhasoffices downtown andalsoinWeiss MarketandGiantFoodsthatpeople willbe abletomakethepayments at.Customers alsomayreturn theirequipment toallUPS1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25113 stores.Equipment canbereturned asis without wrapping oranyboxandUPSwill sendthepackages directly. LikeIsaid,I'mverydisappointed thatwedidnothaveanopportunity to become involved inthiscontract .However , therearesavings thataregoingtobe-- thecityisgoingtoseesomefinancial gain andwealsogoingtoseemaintain funding of ECTV,sothisisoneoftheseholdyournose andvoteforme. MR.EVANS:Onthequestion ,first ofall,Iwouldliketoreadamemofrom President BobMcGoff."Theretermsofthe Comcast contract haveneverbeentheprimary issue.Inmyopinion ,aswehaveseen, Comcast isunwilling todiscuss anyissues brought toitthatpertaintotheproposed agreement . Lackoftransparency andcooperation bytheadministration hasprecipitated this situation .Citycouncil isbeingaskedto enteramulti-yearagreement without being provided anopportunity toofferinputany meaningful manner.Again,thisisreturning1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 ustoaprocess oflegislation thatwill leadtoacrimony andcontention .Thatwas notaworking relationship thatproduced the recovery andreform thatwesodesperately need. Refusing tovoteontheComcast contract accomplishes little,whileitseems tobringintoquestion atactic thatthe administration isusingtoalienate council itis.Thisissomething thatneedstobe resolved withthemayorandcitysolicitor . Weneedtomoveforwardwiththiscontract either positively ornegative lyand establish amoreamenable process forthis typeofcontract negotiation ." Again,President BobMcGoff. AndIcouldn'tagreemore.Iwant tovoteno.I'dlovetovoteno,butI can'tbecause thereis$300,000or$200,000 inthereforECTVthatissodesperately needsthemoney.Thereisnocompetition . Wehavenochoice.Weweren'tinvolved in thisprocess .Wehavesimply ayesorno.
