MR. KING: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , including Theresa Sylvester , Attorney Jim O'Brien, and Kaden Rabender . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. We have a few proclamations tonight . Dr. Rothchild I think is going to start off. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, so the first one I'll be reading is for Pride Month. And I hope that everyone in the audience is respectful as I read this proclamation because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 I think the last few weeks whenever I brought up Pride Month there's been some chatter and I'd appreciate your respect . June 13, 2023, Whereas , Pride Month is an annual celebration of the LGBTQIA plus community 's contributions to history , society , and cultures worldwide ; and Whereas , in the United States, Pride is celebrated during the month of June in commemoration of the Stonewall Riots which happened in June of 1969; and Whereas , the Pride Movement has grown significantly over the years, encouraging those members of the community to live their authentic lives despite growing anti-LGBTQIA plus propaganda throughout state legislatures ; and Whereas , the City of Scranton aims to provide a welcoming community to everyone regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity ; and Whereas , because of the great community organizations throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania , Scranton 's LGBTQIA plus community 's voices are amplified not only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 during the month of June but also year round. Therefore , I, Mayor Paige G. Cognetti , along with Scranton City Council Members declare June, 2023, Pride Month in the City of Scranton and encourage all cities to -- all citizens to uplift and support the LGBTQIA plus members of our community and their mission . MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . I have a second proclamation here honoring Juneteenth, June 19, 2023. Whereas , Juneteenth commemorates the day freedom was proclaimed to all enslaved people in the South by Union General Granger , on June 19th, 1865, in Galveston , Texas; and Whereas , this freedom came more than two and a half years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863; and Whereas , although not a federal holiday until 2021, Juneteenth was celebrated for many years among the African American community ; and Whereas , on June 17th, 2021, President Joseph R. Biden signed into law the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, establishing June 19th as a federal holiday ; and Whereas , in 2022, the City of Scranton declared Juneteenth a city holiday , encouraging city employees to reflect on the history of the holiday and celebrate the spirit of freedom that embodies Juneteenth ; and Whereas , Juneteenth is a day to celebrate African American freedom and achievements and to respect the history and culture that runs deeply throughout our community . Therefore , I, Mayor Paige G. Cognetti , along with City Council Members , declare June 19th, 2023, to be Juneteenth National Independence Day in the City of Scranton and encourage all Scrantonians to reflect on the struggle s and sacrifices our ancestors made to give us freedom , while realizing the importance of continuing to build a nation that truly reflect s the self-evident truth that all people are created equal. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT 2022-2023 YEAR TO DATE JUNE 7, 2023. 3.B. CORRESPONDENCE DATED JUNE 5, 2023 RECEIVED FROM EILEEN CIPRIANI , CITY OF SCRANTON BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR , REGARDING THE NOSSAMAN LLP CONTRACT UPDATE. 3.C. CITY OF SCRANTON PERSONNEL POLICY MANUAL UPDATED MAY 22, 2023 FROM CITY HUMAN RESOURCE DEPARTMENT . MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So 3-B, we asked for an update from Nossaman which was our lobbyist . And the information -- the update we got was this firm is in discussion with legislators we already elected to get us grants. The contract for Nossaman Associates was to get us grants. So can we expand on this information ? Can you circle around and ask can we see some, you know, dollar amounts , grants that we've actually received or going to receive , not just discussions with legislators 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that, you know, are doing that for us or should be. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. KING: Are there any other comment s on Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I would like to make a comment on 3-C. So I'd like everyone here to take note tonight it's in the City Code as well as the handbook that we have receive d in Third Order. I'm happy to see the handbook . But in this handbook and also in the City Code it states that the city hires need to have the advice and consent of Council prior to their employment . So I think tonight we're going to see a pattern throughout the meeting in which has consistent ly violated the City Code for the last three years employing individual s prior to Council approval starting on the job prior to being passed through us. So since we're on the second -- well, since we're on the third and fourth rounds of some of these positions , I would like to see them coming before us before they start day one on the job.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. MCANDREW : Yes, that's fantastic , Mr. Schuster . I also saw that. But in addition to that, the handbook which was finalized May 22nd also states that when the Mayor is seeking a residency waiver for a new hire, the waiver has to be sent down to us before the hire. So that's another area where the new handbook has already been violated . MR. SCHUSTER : With that also being said, looking at the City Code it states that if residency isn't -- I'm trying to think of the wording , isn't obtained within the six months they may be term -- the new wording in the handbook is may be terminated which does not -- does not echo the code. So the code and this handbook are somewhat at odds when it comes to the waivers . MR. KING: Okay. So I think what we can do, Frank, if we bring that to the attention of the Mayor, I'll -- I did not have a meeting with the Mayor this past week. I'll bring those concerns to the Mayor's attention and see if we can make sure we rectify those issues that were brought up. And I think that they're valid concerns .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, just to specify that, so the code says, "Be a cause for immediate termination ." Where in the handbook it says, "May result in termination ." MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll clarify that. MR. KING: Are there any other comment s on Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few announcements . First, we had the proclamation tonight for Juneteenth . So I wanted to mention that there will be an annual Juneteenth event this weekend . Let me find the information for you here. You could find out more about it through the Black Scranton Project . They always have it up at their location over on East Market Street and Main Avenue. And then the other event happening this week is the Holy Rosary block party. That's going to be Friday night through Saturday up in North Scranton . And I wanted to thank all of those who had participated in City Pride week last week and the garbage olympic events and all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 cleanups that were happening around the city. I think it was a great way to work towards cleaning up the city, beautifying the city. And I was happy to participate over in West Side with the cleanup through NeighborWorks . That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . I would like to mention the Scranton Municipal Rec Authority Flower Show -- Electric City Flower Show that was held this past weekend , extremely well attended . I think they had double the number of people, booths set up. I couldn't believe it. I saw Norma up there. I just couldn't believe how much larger it got this year compare d to last year. That park was hopping . I mean, there were people all over the place. And it was just really nice to see how widely people were out and enjoying -- and we actually had a beautiful day this year. It wasn't 105 degrees like last year. So I want to thank everyone that was involved with that and congratulate you on a great volunteer event. And that's just a great thing for our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 city so thank you all. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. I was also at the flower show. I was greatly impressed with the amount of people. I couldn't find a parking spot. When you can't find a parking spot that means it's a very successful event. Also, so this Friday even though it's a couple of days after Flag Day, the Ukrainian Club is going to have a Flag Day party on Railroad Avenue. And it's Friday, June 16th from 6 to 10, entertainment by Drew Loomis; hamburgers $5, hot dogs $2, macaroni salad $1. So if you could stop by and celebrate with these vets it would be fantastic . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I would have to say that the flower show was a huge success . Like Mark said, the parking lot, it was hard to find a parking space in the lot. There was definitely double the vendors that we had last year -- that you guys had last year. And you receive d some feedback about young children about getting them more involved . You guys did the scavenger hunt. And I would have to give you a little bit of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 feedback . My son loved the scavenger hunt. He participated in the whole thing and had a blast doing it. So it made his day a lot more fun. I think we spent three or four hours there do to that scavenger hunt and it kept him engaged the whole time so thank you. MR. SMURL: Just in case you haven't read it, Scranton has achieved an investment grade bond rating from Standard and Poor's for the first time since 2011. I want to thank the administration , Mayor Cognetti and the city financial team for all the work. And I'd also like to thank my fellow Council members Tom Schuster , Bill King, Mark McAndrew , and Jessica Rothchild for all the work they've done in the past two years so we could obtain this. That's all I have. MR. KING: That's a good thing as well. So it seems like we're headed in the right direction . DR. ROTHCHILD : I just wanted to add to, I'm sorry, the details for the Juneteenth event, that party that they're hosting is going to be Saturday from 12 to 5. And it's at 1902 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 North Main. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Please dispense with the reading of the minutes -- excuse me, Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton resident . Whatever happened to the public caucus at 5:45? Was I at the wrong place at the wrong time? MR. KING: Unfortunately , we had an executive session that ran over. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, could you in the future when that happens send someone in here saying we're not having a public caucus or something , you know, for the people who come early? Thank you. With regard to the City's website , the firefighter 's contract is still not posted even though the arbitration was posted in April. That is not the same thing as the contract . MR. KING: I'll address that in Fifth Order.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And also, there is no property tax database which we were promised would be coming. And the trash fee database is still dated as of February 28th. It's getting a little old. What is the status of the arbitration for the police union? MR. KING: It's getting very close. I spoke to Attorney Ufberg actually today. They had multiple meeting s in the last week, so hoping to get that closed out ASAP. MS. HODOWANITZ : I hope that we, you know, it doesn't drag out between lawyers this and lawyers that before we see the final product . Once we do see the final product , I'll do a right to know request to find out how much we had to pay Ufberg as labor counsel since he started back in November of 2021. With regard to the Standard and Poor's credit upgrade , yes, it was good news that we're now investment grade. But if you read that eight page document carefully , you saw there were some words of warning . They pointed out that the city still has a very low wealth and income level, which is a problem . And the city has very high fixed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 costs, for example , with regard to the 2021 budget, debt pensions and retiree healthcare accounted for 35.8 percent of the budget. That does not include the salaries and wages paid to employees . That's almost 36 percent of the budget right there. They were pleased that the city has a new auditor . They pointed out that we had a tradition of late audits and that audit is expected in the early fall of this year, not next year. But that if it's late, it could be a reason to look at re-examining the credit rating again. It could even be downgraded, not that there's any pressure here. And they also pointed out some questionable assumptions in the pension plans. The salary growth figure of 4 and a half percent yearly, rate of return at 7.25 percent . Standard and Poor's likes 6 percent and the ongoing COLA lawsuit . And then with regard to the personnel handbook, it was impressive 85 pages. But 21 of the 32 sections , two-thirds of that document might not apply to unionized employees if you read through the document . That means 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 it only really applies to 12 percent . Eighty-eight percent of the employee s are unionize d. 448 of the 507 personnel in today's budget are unionized , 88 percent . So are we going to give new hires a copy of their labor contract in the one hand and the personnel handbook in the other because the policies may be different . You've got four unions and you got this personnel handbook . You have the possibility of five different policies . That makes no sense to me. Let's see what else. Also, I didn't see anything in there about performance evaluations . I saw the thing about overtime which is going to have to be updated since you've got legislation pending . And, of course, the residency waiver which is suppose d to be six months but looks like the Mayor wants to have her cake and eat it too. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Faye Franus. MS. FRANUS: Faye Franus, Scranton . Mr. Smurl, I'd like to ask you a question . You used to be on the Housing Appeals Board. Do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 they have minutes at their meeting s? MR. SMURL: Do they have minutes of the meetings , yes. MS. FRANUS: And how often are those meeting s held? MR. SMURL: It depends . You need a minimum of three participants . So you would need three people to file so and then they would meet. MS. FRANUS: Is it every other month or every month? MR. SMURL: Sometimes every month. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Are they held here at City Council ? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Thank you. Where would you happen to find those minutes? MR. SMURL: Should be on the city website . MS. FRANUS: I did a right to know and they said no records exist and my request was denied, no records existed , no minutes existed . Okay. I don't what's going on with this legislation for the overtime . Did you hear back from the city as far as if they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 wanted to change anything yet, Mr. King? MR. KING: We did have discussions this evening . MS. FRANUS: Did they want to change anything ? MR. KING: There was some suggestions , yes. MS. FRANUS: Are you going to listen to them? I mean, as far as will anything change with the DPW and their overtime ? That's what I want to know. MR. KING: I can't tell you that. There's a possibility that that might happen. I can't say that because I'm one individual . MS. FRANUS: Okay. Well, we'll see. But all I know is one thing. The Mayor ran on transparency and accountability . If by chance the overtime for the DPW is not put in this legislation for records , dates, and everything else that Attorney Gallagher said, then there is no point in any legislation whatsoever . The DPW already has over $270,000 in overtime up until now but no records and no dates. They did at one time they had nine snowstorm s. There was only like 6 inches of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 snow all year. When are you going to have Rubicon come in? You said by May they would be in. What happened to that? MR. KING: We're waiting to get -- I believe that we're suppose d to get a report. Did we ever get a final answer as to when Rubicon is coming in here? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, Mr. King. Director Pietreface is going to advise. MR. KING: They are suppose d to come into caucus here. I'm hoping -- if you could check on that, see if that could happen sooner rather than later, appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Another thing, Rubicon , the Mayor wrote me an e-mail and said in there that -- in June she believes they're going to come full force -- Rubicon , I'm paraphrasing . There's no way Rubicon can be full force until you have a second contract and include the highways department . Right now only refuse and recyclable s is in Rubicon 's contract . So without highways , what's the point of Rubicon ? Highways is the most abusive group of people in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 DPW of overtime . They use the most overtime of anybody . The director himself got $29,800 last year, Mr. Pietreface , in the highways department . So unless Rubicon includes -- gets another contract and includes highway s, there's no point in having Rubicon . The only way you could track overtime is if Rubicon is tracking them, where they are, what they're doing. That's the only way to follow them. So someone better suggest getting Rubicon in that contract . Also, in the e-mail I got from the Mayor she said that citizens , residents are not suppose d to be contacting employees . There's a process for that. And I believe it's called, right, the 311 Scranton , PA. Well, if you try that, good luck because they don't reply. How many times have Marie and myself and everybody else write to them and we get no response . And I believe since City Hall is closed to the resident s which we own, not the Mayor, she has no right closing this building . It's not hers. We have a right to contact employees anytime we want. And I certainly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 will. I absolutely will and I have and I still will. We pay for them. They are our -- MR. KING: Excuse me. Mr. Argenta , this is several weeks now. MR. WATKINS : No, that was me. MR. KING: Okay, I'm sorry. I apologize , Mr. Argenta . MR. WATKINS : No, that was me. I'm sorry. MR. KING: Okay. And I'm going to give you your time back. I'm going to give you your time back. But when people are speaking we need -- MR. AGRENTA : I accept your apology . MR. KING: Thank you very much. Sorry, Mr. Watkins , I'm trying to, you know, we're trying to listen and everybody needs the opportunity to be able to speak. MS. FRANUS: Thank you. So I hope you understand what I'm saying about Rubicon and everything else and about the fact that resident s have a right to contact employee s. That's why they have e-mails. That's why they have department s to call. I've called many department s, no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 problem whatsoever . I call Eileen Cipriani . I call Don King. I even called the Parks Director , no problem at all, very nice people. So for her to tell me I can't call employees , it's not going to happen. And I think City Hall should be open. We own it, not her. Okay, what about I asked you last week -- I asked a couple weeks ago and I know you mentioned about the property at 1424 Mylert. You said the police are investigating that raid. Well, right now I'm concerned about -- I asked you to find out if the city -- who's paying the rent to the city? The city owns that building . And they own the building next to it too on Von Storch. And the city's not supposed to be owning building s and renting them out. But they owned this building -- the Sewer Authority which is the city have owned this building since 2016. I asked who is collecting the rent for that. Is that Howard Moss still collect ing, the guy that owned it before 2016? I have never gotten an answer. I would like you to check into that because the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 city is not suppose d to be owning properties and getting rent. And if they're not getting the rent, who is? People have been in there since 2016. This biker gang was in there for over a year. So how is that possible ? Another thing, I had three denials -- three right to know requests denied this week. One was the minutes for the Housing Appeals Board, the second was recycling , the recycling document that says shall. They shall have notarize d affidavit s proving that the business es and restaurant s and bars all have private haulers. They shall and nobody has done it. Cecelia Monroe the recycling supervisor , that is her job and it is also Director Pietreface 's. Now, he could have her do it or he could do it, but neither one of them are doing it. And that's another law that the Mayor is violating . And I would like to know what's going to happen there. And the other one was DPW overtime , no records, no dates, request denied. So thank you and I hope you could find out what I want to know about that property who is renting it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 And thank you, Mr. Smurl, I appreciate it. And like I said, please try to get a contract for Rubicon to have the highway. Otherwise , there is no point in anything . And if by chance you don't get the legislation where the DPW has to report their days, their dates, their reasons -- and the reasons have to be verifiable . And the only way to make them verifiable is to have Rubicon check where they are, when they're working , where they are. That's the only way. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. MS. FRANUS: Okay, thank you. MR. KING: Mark Scaringy {phonetic }. MR. SCARINGY : Good evening . I waited about three months to -- I mean, three weeks to get up here. I never got a chance. I want you to look at this picture . Can I bring it up there? MR. KING: Sure. Mr. Scaringy , when you go back, can you please speak into the mic so we would hear you? MR. SCARINGY : Okay. Okay, the middle of that picture is the firehouse in -- 1905 firehouse . And so that firehouse is on a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 truck route. You got these 20 ton trucks going down that hill. Some day there's going to be an accident because that truck driver got distracted and he's going to say to the Judge, I was looking at my GPS and I didn't stop in time and I crushed that family. We need a new firehouse . I'm going to ask you to take a look at this picture . MR. KING: I thought you were going to point out the fact that there's a truck parked right in front of the firehouse blocking the fire truck. MR. SCARINGY : When the siren's going off on those fire engines , what happens is it makes a very loud noise, especially that air horn. It sounds like a cruise ship. These firefighters , they don't hit the siren first and then the air horn. Sometimes they hit the air horn and then the siren. You keep doing that and you're going to give an elderly person a heart attack. You will find the phrase scared to death. You -- trust me, we're going to be scared to death some day. I live on Mulberry Tower right across the street. I got here last month. I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 a transplant from Las Vegas. And so the noise ripples apart. And if you see, it's a U-shape and because there's building on one side and a building on the other. It's echos and it magnifies it and all of this noise is on the windows are closed in the nighttime . I want you to look at this picture . There's no money for that. How about we put new windows in the Mulberry Tower Senior House. That's going to cost millions of dollars . Well, find the money. I'll tell you what, there's not going to be really a lot of money to replace all of these windows facing Mulberry Street. So here's the suggestion and the solution is in that third page I gave you, the final page I gave you. That windowsill is a large windowsill like here. What you need to do is have an (inaudible ) that window is soundproof so we cannot hear any sounds because I'll tell you what, there's going to come a day. This might be my last -- first and last before the City Council . You could keep those pictures . But there is a term called 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 scared to death. And I went to the Chomko Funeral Home. And I said to the Chomko Funeral Home put on my death certificate scared to death. And he said, oh, no, no, we can't do that. We have to put natural causes. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Scaringy . Mike Passero . MR. PASSERO : Good evening , Council , I want to start this off on a nice note and hopefully end it on a nice note also. I'm a proud Scrantonian , proud Westsider in my 60th year in the same family homestead on Academy Street. I can't picture myself living anywhere else. Mr. McAndrew is a Westside r and we remember West Side the way it used to be. Every morning I'm up at five, 5:30. And I'm walking the trail all the way sometimes to Green Ridge Street. To get to the trail I have to walk through West Scranton . There is just an abundance of rundown homes, unattended to properties , garbage in the streets . Scranton just had a pride pickup the garbage thing -- a contest. And it was sad 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that I saw that one of the awards or whatever it was, was given was for the most unique piece of garbage picked up. That's sad. That should never -- never happen. Everybody that was in that pickup should have been allotted a dumpster to carry on their back. Two hours was a miniscule amount of time to do that. As I said, I walk from my home on Academy Street down where the ball field is on over on Meridian to the trail around the viaduct back up around and past Redner's and sometimes up Green Ridge Street. The trail is nice, no problems at all with that. It's just disappointing. It's heartening . It breaks my heart that there is so many -- and what I'm going to say I don't want to offend any resident , but we have out of town and absentee landlord s that are buying these properties that are a little sketchy to begin with and slapping a coat of paint on them. I walk about these houses every day. I'm on the trail just about every day. So 365 days a year I'm probably on that trail 350, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 rain, snow, sunshine , whatever . There is grass in some yards that hasn't been cut in two years. When the snow flies and a Burger King wrapper ends up on the ground and it's covered with snow and it's in the ice, that's one thing. That's fine. And I walk past it and I think it will be picked up when the snow melts. No, there's just three more Burger King wrappers on top of it. And trash pickup I'm sure there's an ordinance somewhere . I should have looked it up, that regular trash pickup you are not suppose d to put your garbage out prior to 24 hours. In the court behind my home ii Rachel Place -- my home is on Academy Street. Rachel Place faces Washburn and Academy . If people miss the garbage on Monday morning , they put it out Monday afternoon and it sits there all week. My question is, is there code enforcement officers ? Are they overwhelmed ? Why aren't they doing their job? I volunteer completely free of charge. Give me a citation pad and I'll go out there. And I'm sure I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 come back looking for more citation pads. A blight hotline, I think was a blight hotline one time. It probably goes right to the Mayor's office. It needs to not be -- if there is a blight hotline it needs to not be an answering machine . It needs to be manned. And I understand staffing problem s and manpower problems . Some of the addresses -- and I'll leave you this list when I leave, the thousand block of Oxford Street, the South Edwards Court behind the Scranton post office, just garbage you could literally fill a dumpster with the garbage behind the post office. And under the railroad bridge on the bottom of Luzerne Street going to be the Bellevue section . There's a strip of homes there that are just in the worst condition . And I'm sure they are owned by out of town. There was one man that used to come to Council who lived in the red home on the corner of Meridian and Luzerne Street. And he used to complain about, you know, the conditions of the neighborhood . He 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 gave up the ghost and sold that house a few years ago. That house was a jewel on the corner. Now it's one of the worst. There's a junk car sitting right on the corner with a '21 or '22 inspection sticker on it. Police officers , code officers , have to pass by this vehicle . Across the street from that abandon gas station somebody dropped off a fire board wall unit and it sits there. Underneath that bridge, you know, we want walkability for Scranton , underneath that railroad bridge, glass and garbage and just it's just deplorable . MR. KING: If you would leave that list, Mr. Passero, we'll make sure that code enforce ment gets out there and jump on it. They actually have been getting around quite a bit. But obviously it's a large city. But absolutely , when these things are brought to our attention they will jump on it. Plus that 311 when people submit different complaints on there, I know that they do pick up on them and address them. I appreciate you bringing these things to our attention . I agree. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 I taught in West Scranton for seven and a half years. I was principal at the high school for five. And obviously there is, you know, reasons why we have to have these cleanups. MR. PASSERO : And actually and it hurts. You know, like, I leave the house and I'm in a wonderful mood in the morning . And I know by the time I'm on the trail and then I'm back off the trail and on the city streets and it's -- you know, I come home and I'm in a mood. You know, this is just -- just absolutely -- MR. KING: Thank you. And I hate to cut off but we do have a five-minute rule. But if you could leave that we would greatly appreciate that. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you for the list and feel free to e-mail me. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries . I'm a city resident and I'm happy to be a city resident . And a lot of people ask me why I do what I do and that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 I'm constantly out and about. And I'm out and about and doing because I do -- I enjoy living in Scranton . There's a lot of things that need to be corrected . There's a lot of issues. But I like being involved . I thank all of you for the wonderful comments about the Electric City Flower Show. It was a lot of work that went into it. And Carol is our leader and it wasn't uncommon for my message to go off at 6:30 in the morning and I know it was coming from her as to what we needed to do and how we were doing and everything . So I just thank everyone , you know, that attended . You know, and it's so good when everyone on Council was there and they came by the table. People from the audience was there. And when they come up and say, oh, Hi, Norma, and to see their faces at the flower show, you know, it really makes you know that we're doing something good for the city. There was a lot going on on Saturday , you know, a lot of events that were taking place. And yet folks took out of their time out of the day to come up to the park. And we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 need more volunteers . We need more volunteers because I wasn't even able to get away from my station to see all the vendors that were there. So that was something that I missed. But, you know, look for in the future on the Nay Aug Park site we'll start to advertise about volunteers . And we got hit because of graduation . We learn each year. So we got hit with graduation . So who thought that graduation parties would be held that day and we couldn't get as many volunteer s as we needed. So I thank all of you. I thank the resident s of Scranton . I thank the resident s of the surrounding areas that came and supported us. And, you know, I'll do all I can and we can hopefully get a bigger team. The Rec Authority is there to also help in what we could do. So I say thank you to everyone . And another big thank you to the City of Scranton because , you know, this is something new for us. And we didn't have our license a week before. You need to get a license . We do? You know, so I thank the staff of the City Council -- not City Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 but City Hall that did all they could and got us our license because I don't know what if they would put us in jail or what would have happened . I don't know. But anyway, we got our license and everything was good by Saturday morning . So the second thing I wanted to talk about was Nay Aug Park. You know, I call that my backyard . So I'm up there quite a bit. And now that it got warm in May and to see people walking -- people walking across the parking lot where there's -- Geisinger people park and they have their towels around their neck. They have their coolers and you know where they're going. And like I said, I only live a block from there. And when we hear the helicopters going over and they circle and they circle and they circle and you know what they're doing. They're looking for someone that jumped into that pool. And the worst part is when you see the little ones, they put life vests on their little ones and take their little ones down there because there's a pool of water that is sort of calm. But if that water is coming down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 from Covington Township and Roaring brook and if it's -- well, it's just a nightmare , you know, to see them going over there. So I just pray that we don't have a disaster down there. I thought there was cameras down there. And I thought it was being monitored by the police department . But I'm not sure. But I do see -- and especially those warm days that we had in May, you know, it was quite active down there. It's kind of scary, you know, because I don't want to hear it -- the helicopters going over. And what else do I have on my little cards here? Oh, yes, because the reason I thought of it too is that the Times did an article on the front page of the paper. And it's good and it's bad because it's good because to let people know it's there and they shouldn 't be there. But it also stirs those copycatters that want to go, hey, let's go try it out and see what it's like. And another thank you I want to give to City Council for the proclamation for Juneteenth this weekend .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Thank you, Jessica , you know, for mentioning that. And I like and get involved with it because I don't know about you guys but I know I did not know anything about Juneteenth until maybe a few years ago. We weren't taught that in high school. We weren't taught it in school about the history of Juneteenth. We knew that the emancipation came along but nothing about what happened in Texas. So I thank Jessica for mention ing it. And if anyone could get out there on Saturday , I'll be there. And, you know, like I said, I like running into people there at different events that I met along the way in Scranton . So I thank everyone that was there. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council , Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . I'm going to tag a little bit onto Norma where she was talking about everybody going down by the falls to swim. We will not eliminate that ever. But we are seeing people going down there that would never go down there if the pool was open 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 or if there was a place for them to swim somewhere in the city because now you're seeing families picnicking down in the Hanlon's Grove and then just taking the little kids and going down into the water. They did that last year also. What brought me in tonight was I saw something that somebody sent me when I was out of town. It was in the paper. City of Scranton Nay Aug Pool Complex feasibility study update and pool complex construction design. It was in the paper. I read it, didn't understand it too much. But I was -- I didn't know why -- are they advertising for somebody to come in and do another feasibility study? And if so, I thought a few years ago -- and I'll direct this to Mr. Smurl because he was on Rec Board then. I thought we had a feasibility study done. I thought they had engineers come in also to sonogram or whatever the pools to see how sturdy they were -- correct me if I'm wrong. And it seems like this is a stall tactic, like, let's study again and now we could push back the start of a pool later and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 later and later. So hopefully I'm wrong about that. But that's kind of my gut feeling . And maybe Mr. Smurl can shed some light on that. MR. SMURL: I will do that in Fifth Order. I will tell you what's going on there. MS. KOLOSKI : I'm sorry, what? MR. SMURL: I'll tell you -- I will say in Fifth Order what's happening at Nay Aug Park. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, that's really all I have to say and thank you, Jessica , for your proclamation on Pride Month and for your proclamation on Juneteenth. MR. KING: Thank you, Doris. Jack Watkins . Okay, is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I hope that in Fifth Order when we announce the executive session that was just held that there is more detail that is required for that announcement to give us an idea of what happened in that meeting . I also looked at the website and noticed that the HUP contract has failed that it was put out for bid and you actually had no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 one sign up for it. I'm curious if you are going to rebid for the HUP testing , get it out there and see if you could get another person on it. Or if you might do what the Mayor tends to do since there's no one there just find someone and put them in the place just because it's in the best interest of the city. Next week I expect the 3-2 vote for the residency waiver. But as it was brought up again today, it's quite interesting that it's against the city charter and against the new code in place, the employee handbook that you can't give a waiver out after the employee was hired. The process is put in beforehand. So it's going to be interesting to see if one of the first actions of this body when the employee handbook is present ed to them is to violate the employee handbook , ignore the fact that it has to be done before the employee is actually hired and waiver of the waiver of the rules to give this exception . I expect that will happen. Earlier this week I receive d a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 rental registration card at the house. I appeared to City Hall and asked why. And they inquire d if my home was a single-family home if I was the owner or family. I said, yes, I'm family and it's not been a rental home ever from the time it was built in 1964 to 1965. I asked why did I get this and what database did they pull the information from? I was told I should just ignore it that the city sent this out to every household in the city. I was told they had rental listing s. But since it was incomplete , everyone is getting mailed a rental registration notice. And if you're not a rental person, just ignore it because I guess they have no way to certify who has rentals anyway so they are just doing a random scatter shot approach . Since we're desperate for money, I'd like to inquire how much money was the total cost for the printing and mailing of these documents ? I notice in the document we have a Planning Commission . I have a question of how does a hair stylist qualify for a Planning Commission position , name Shaquanna Bennett as she noted Koni is technically -- is not her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 name. It's a nickname and using Koni is technically not a lie. I always like when it's prefaced with technically . The body should be aware that -- takes mispronouncing a name in her own statement is microaggression . I mispronounce names all the time. I figure that's just learning what another person's name is. I don't take offense to that, nor do I consider that microaggression . Last, I'm going to hit on flag burning , 6-C. Flag burning has been attempted to be regulated five times and has failed in the Supreme Court many times. One comment from one of the Supreme Court Justices was, I may not like it but I am not the king. Right now open burning is under the scope of public safety. And as some are aware the exception s of fighting wars, true threats , actions that endanger the public safety, slander and libel aren't covered by the First Amendment . But unfortunately with this document , to cut out a specific section that labels it as protect ed First Amendment rights 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 squarely removes the flag burning from public safety and puts it into a move to suppress First Amendment rights to speech. By doing this action, by putting a timeline in beforehand for these protests you take out the ability to control it under a safety issue, which may be legitimate and you put into a conflict of a First Amendment speech that should not be violated and is protect ed. The law as it's written in this document in this ordinance is actually contrary to what this body and the intention of it is. I would ask you to talk to your solicitor and take a look and see whether or not there is a better way to take a look at this. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Mr. Watkins . MR. WATKINS : John taxpayer . I got a couple concerns here with the park that the city is building up there where I live. They're putting B2 stone in there, this and that which shouldn 't be because they are putting rubber mulch on top of it. And there's no handicap swings for the handicap children . And they're putting a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 parking lot in there, like, a two parking thing and this and that and everything for the handicap children whoever parks there. And I got a problem with the drugs in the neighborhood . Enough's enough. The lady was slumped over today in her car botta bing botta boom. It is what it is. They came, boom and that was it. It's continuous . But I would like to see something done up on Return and Bundy Street. It's got to stop. I don't know what we could do, but it's got to stop. And it would be nice if we could get our alley done and get that paved. You're paving all the streets around there but that alley hasn't been done in 19 years since I lived there. Nineteen years I lived there. MR. KING: Mr. Watkins , what's the name of that alley? MR. WATKINS : Excuse me? MR. KING: What's the name of the alley? MR. WATKINS : There is no name. It's on Return and Bundy. It's right there. And you can't miss it. Nineteen years I lived 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 there and it's not even done that they paved my street and next thing you know here they are marking it up, digging it up. I don't know what's going on there. But I like to say another thing. I was down at the bus stop the other day. Boom, I had a white van pull up to me, boom. Guess who it is? I'm not going to say no names. Oh, you got to stop talking about me, this and that and everything . Put two and two together , guys. I'm not going to say it. Why, because I run my mouth? I open my mouth? It is what it is. But I like to see you guys do something , man, come on. I'm a taxpayer here. I want to see something good for this city. And that's it. And with these guys doing this park, Joe Alcowski runs it. I even told the Mayor have them audit it. You don't want to audit it? Where did $80,000 go? That park didn't cost 80,000. On the permit it says 27,5. The permit, 27,5 it says on that permit. Where did the $80,000 go? But I guess my word don't mean nothing . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Watkins . Mrs. Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry about my sneezing and timing is terrible . But it is what it is. I also attended the flower show and had a good time and was impressed with the attendance . But I actually even won a raffle. So, I mean, that doesn't happen to me very often. Anyway, moving on, getting over there -- I'm up there quite a bit. And the sign that says -- arrow to the pool complex , I've asked before if that can't be covered over or taken down. But it just adds, you know, like putting vinegar on a cut. And fire engines , I live very close to engine ten. And it's fairly close to my bedroom window when they do go out at night. But I really -- I actually look at that as something good because I like to say a prayer for the people who are going out and for the people that they are going to help. So I look at it as something good. Now, effective January of last year, 2022, the city replaced the Business Privilege 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 and Mercantile Tax with a new Payroll Preparation tax. So why are we still seeing the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax? It's in the first one was on 3-A. So, you know, why? I think -- MR. KING: I believe those are catchup payments or delinquent payments that they are still trying to recoup that were owed previously . I could be wrong on that. We'll have to check on that, okay, Frank? MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. And then -- oh, 5-I, I was reading that and it said on a memo from the Department of Law that in response to your request we need to vet all in city real estate tax, refuse fee tax, and code enforcement violations of Koni, I believe , Bennett , etc. So I thought , oh, I have nothing to do. I'll just go back and look at that myself. And I went to the assessor 's page and I could not find a Bennett . I think there was like seven Bennetts , none of them were Lori. And I followed up on a couple of the other things. And I understand she's at 505 North Main Avenue and she's a beautician . That's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 beauty shop. But there is nothing to say that is where she -- that she owns it. There was nothing saying she owns it. So there's some misinformation in the backup on that. And then 6-E -- no, forget that one. Let me make a note here -- the one on the fire company wanting a special building for training . You know, it was back in 2017 that we had the Serrenti . And as I recall, that was supposed to be our safety place and they were going to do all kinds of things. And it was going to be so wonderful all these people could -- even from another area could come and even maybe make some money on it because they could sell this service . I went up there one day and knocked on the door. There was no action at Serrenti . But also, I mean, why do we need another building ? MR. MCANDREW : This facility is going to have a burn house. And where it's located they could, you know, they could practice putting out burning building s where they couldn't do it in proximity where resident s -- where the Serrenti Center is.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MS. SCHUMACHER : But that takes 2.3 million dollars ? MR. MCANDREW : It's going to be a training center also in addition to that but training and that type of application . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, and then quickly if I may, Meadow Brook 2, are we measuring -- is anybody measuring how the Ryerson wall is leaning towards Wyoming Avenue? And does anybody do that on a regular basis? They do? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm looking at Frank. Frank, can we check into that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll check into it but I believe that is part of the Reilly Associates Meadow Brook Project underway . MS. SCHUMACHER : They are doing it regularly ? I would like to know -- MR. VOLDENBERG : The project follows along that wall but I'll check on it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , I have a couple issues. The street clock in the 500 of Lackawanna Avenue for a couple years now it's been stuck on 11:20. Is there any kind of guarantee or warranty on that clock that we can get that addressed ? MR. KING: Mr. Argenta , I received an e-mail from the Mayor because I brought that very thing up to her probably several months ago. There's a company out of Ohio that is going to come out here and evaluate . It's kind of like a specialty clock where they're going to evaluate and see what needs to happen to get that fixed. And it's been 11:20 for the last 10 years. MR. ARGENTA : Also the clock at the end of Washington Avenue in that little park there, that clock is also off. So maybe they could check the both of them. It's the same type of clock. The other issue, the 1700 of Dorothy Street, the Missy League. It's the season now for the Missy League tournament s. Last week we had the tournament there. The road's been dug up for about two years now. There's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 barricades . There's three -- it looks like they started a project as usual and never finished it. There's three manholes. The new manhole s are there. It's loaded with gravel. There's about 15 barricades scattered around and certainly it doesn't look good, especially when the parents and volunteers maintain that Tripp Park Little League. And it's a pretty pristine , you know, jewel to the city that we have. And I also got a rental registration or a form from the city. I don't have a rental. I went on the city's website and it says that the rental app is currently suspended waiting on data from the county. So you go on for the rental app and it's suspend ed with the City of Scranton dot gov website . And one other thing, I'm also concerned like with Mr. Passero with the blight and it's -- you guys are well aware of that. And do we have a list, some type of inventory list of city-owned properties and vacant lots? And is there somewhere I could take a look at it and we can could take a look at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 it? I had an open invitation for you guys and woman to maybe meet up and do a walking tour. And if that's not going to happen, I think we're getting enough of movement right now that us city resident s and taxpayers , we'll take the walking tour and if you could provide us with a list of vacant properties and city-owned lots and we'll check them out and we'll report back to you guys. We'll be the liaisons . And also with the condemned properties , I have another issue here. I've been checking like the Mayor likes to compare us with other cities, other towns. Well, I've called around. And all other towns and other cities when they have these condemned building s and the grass is 2 and 3 feet high, they have a DPW crew or a city crew that goes out. They maintain them. They charge a fee. What we could do is when we charge it, take a log of what we're doing and keep and we could go in and put a lien. We have enough solicitor s that work with the housing and code enforcement, assign a solicitor to file a lien on these properties and maybe we could lien the property out of the value with our liens and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 take the property back. Go to court, go through the motions and take the property back. But for condemning the property and you put the green sticker on the property that nobody is in and you give them 48 hours, who's going to comply? Let's bring our team out there, maintain the property , give them an invoice , put that invoice with that property . And we could move on from it and put a lien on the property . Whoever takes the property over pays the lien. You know when you are looking for a loan, you don't do anything unless the lien is satisfied . Let's start putting liens on these properties , maintain them ourselves. It's the summer. Get a youth program together with a DPW guy as a supervisor . Let's try something . Right now putting the green stickers on you're little fancy orange and pink. And all this color stuff does nothing at all. Nobody is paying attention now to the property . And nobody is paying attention when you put your sticker on it and giving them 48 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 hours. It's just like nothing gets done. Let's take it upon ourself and let's do it. Whoever 's in charge of the DPW, put something together for them. If you want to sit down, let's sit down and do it as a group. I mean, maybe we put all our heads together and we could come up with it. We don't always have to be butting heads. Let's sit down like people that really care. If you really care about what you're doing, take us up on the offer. Let's clean it up and let's make a difference . I'll do it for tree. I'm a volunteer just like -- like he was. We'll volunteer together . I put a crew of 20 guys together . Call me up on it. Have a good night. Thanks for listening . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. AGRENTA : You're welcome . MR. KING: Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 MR. SMURL: Yes, I have a few comments . First, Norma, there are cameras at the Nay Aug -- at the gorge and also on the bridge going over. There are cameras there. So if you see people going down, you just call 911 and tell them you see them there. They could see them on the camera at police headquarters . There are multiple cameras down there though. Okay, these are a few land bank properties that we were at this weekend and cleaned up, one is at 520 Harrison Avenue. On that property , there are two temporary structures I guess we'll call them built in the rear of them. We need to send zoning up there or City Code Enforcement to see what they actually are. Frank, I gave you a copy of all of this so if you could forward all of this. Second one is Prospect Avenue and East Elm Street, Pioneer Pipeline Company is there storing equipment and stuff. We cleaned all their garbage up and cut all the grass and weeds and everything . So I have a request here also to send them a letter and ask them to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 maintain the property if they're going to be using it. And the third one was 1423 Vine Street. That was also a lot that was used by -- we don't know who was there. They can't remember the names on the trucks. We cleaned everything else out of there and there is still a lot of blacktop left there, a lot material that they use for patching the road. We don't know who was there. So I don't know if there was a permit for the Hill Section if we could find that out. And next thing is, I didn't forget about the people at the Roaring Brook, the FEMA debris removal part around the Richter Avenue and Myrtle Street area. That was put out for bid. We have all the specs on it. I don't know if we received any bids yet. But we will find out this week. That is going to be cleaned up. And there was in part, the embankment has been repaired already . The rest of it is just cleaning the rest of the river base out and right by the bridge it was pretty blocked up. My next one is my favorite one, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 one I've been working on since I started City Council and this is pretty much why I stay on City Council is parks and neighborhoods . There was an RFP put out for the pool complex. There were some studies done at Nay Aug Park. They were done by the Recreation Authority . We did have companies come in and look at pools, see if we can repair the pools and stuff, but none of that happened. This is -- has to be done. We need an entire park design so that we can move forward and apply for a DCNR grant and other money. They are going to have a meeting on Thursday evening at the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority up at Nay Aug Park. I plan on attending that. I have the entire RFP here. So we can go over it then and if you have any questions on that or want to know what is going into the park. And that's all I have for right now. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Real quick, that meeting on Thursday , what time is the meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 at? MR. SMURL: I believe Norma is our meeting -- your meeting is at 6 p.m.? Yeah, six. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. It's at the -- it's a Rec meeting , okay. Do you know who is going to be coming in to present that? MR. SMURL: No one from the city. This is -- I was invited by Mr. Gattens to go over it with the Recreation Authority just to get more ideas. But there's a lot more to it. There's a lot more -- there's going to be scheduled meeting s. There's four public meetings going to happen. But that's all in the RFP. If you want, I'll give you a copy of this. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. I'll take a copy. It was mentioned in -- do you want me to just take over? MR. KING: I don't know what you're going to say, so go ahead. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. It was mentioned in public comment , the article in the paper the other day about the study. And I don't know if you took note about I'm trying to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 think of who brought it up, the Mayor's comment because I think the Mayor leaned towards not having a pool at Nay Aug, just to put that out there. We got a couple of people coming up tonight about the rental licensing . I, myself received one of these. I do not have a rental property . I think several other Council members got them as all. I got a couple calls from a couple friends that also had rental properties . There was somewhat of an answer from our -- let's see who it was, our rental regulation manager that came out to one of -- Council received an e-mail from the city -- from a citizen of the city about the same thing. And they responded that the county had a database and they used the county's database to send out these postcard s to the addresses . I don't know how accurate that is. From public comment tonight it seemed like one of the people called and they had a little more information . And the information said that it went out to all city address es. I'm not sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 if that's the case. But, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could reach out to our rental department and see if it did, in fact, go out to all address es in the city and what the cost of that was. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Last week it was brought up as we're talking about nonresident city employees , in public comment last week I think the number was point 8 percent of our city employee are nonresident . Mr. Voldenberg , can we please reach out to the HR Department and see if we can get a list of our nonresident city employees ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, did we get an update on the Weston Field bathhouse? I know last week they said on Tuesday they were going out to assess the situation and that we should get a response by this week. Did we get that response ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did not. I'll follow up with the director . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. That's all for tonight . Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I know that it's been brought up tonight about the Nay Aug gorge and the swimmers and cliff divers over there. I did actually receive an e-mail from someone too just a couple days ago about the same complaint . And they have pictures documenting people there, like, 7:30 at night on a Sunday. So I would like to ask if SPD could start sending some patrols over there on the weekend s. I know that they have the cameras. But I think if they have an officer around at certain points that might help to dissuade people from visiting there. So I would like to make that request . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of that, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : And I do have a number of complaints about blighted properties . And it's that time of year where we're starting to notice those properties getting overgrown, especially the condemned ones. And so I'm just going to send that list over to you, Frank. And I think it's really frustrating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 to go around the city and to see all of the blight. And I know it's really frustrating for me. And I feel the same way as many of the people who spoke tonight about it. And I think the more that we get the property addresses , then the better that we could work to address them, make sure they are already on the list and then we could provide you with an update as to where we're at with it if they've received a ticket, if they need to receive another ticket, if it's being taken to the magistrate . Some of those things are already in process for that property , but unfortunately it takes a while to come to a resolution . But the Land Bank properties we certainly should be taking care of because the city did contract to maintain those. And I do appreciate Councilman Smurl taking the time on the weekend s to be able to do that for some of them like the one on Harrison . That's been problem atic. But I do want to look towards a long-term solution for what the city needs to do about them. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, thank you. I have a couple things. Guess what, I got one too. And I'm hearing that people are getting more than one. So the rational e being explain ed to you, Mr. Coyne, by calling in, oh, we sent them to everybody . Well, if you're going to send them to everybody , you should put on the bottom, okay, we sent these to everybody and this is the reason why. We shouldn 't have to call. This reminds me of when the recycling calendars were mailed out to people in Dickson City and the outskirts of Scranton and then they had to be re-mailed because they blamed the printer . Something 's wrong and this costs money. Guess what, so it's a poor excuse of spending -- the excuse is we're going to send it to every resident or every homeowner in the city just to try to capture some landlord s? It doesn't make sense. So I want to echo what Council man -- Mr. Schuster said. Let's find out how much this cost. Let's find out what really happened, okay? And let's -- we got to stop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 this. It's a hemorrhage . Every time we mail something out, it's a hemorrhage . MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask them also for a rational e as to why everyone -- I don't know that I got one or not. My wife usually throws things out quickly . So I may very well have gotten one too. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. When I was looking at that e-mail, I know that -- I think some of you saw the e-mail that went back and forth between rental and I was trying to guess -- ascertain what happened there. It seemed like one answer came in that e-mail chain and then it seemed like another citizen received a different answer. So it would be good to know what occurred . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Also, I have three e-mails, Mr. Voldenberg , about blighted properties , 1710 Philo -- instead of me reading all of them I'll just hand them to you at the end of the night for time's sake; also, some issues with quality of life and blight issues on 1604 Pittston , 218 Cedar. And I'll just leave them here, Mr. Voldenberg . You could take that later.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 And then I also got a nice e-mail from Mr. Derek Raines. He's the gentleman that comes here with -- very lovely gentleman and his wife who come and has concern s about ADA compliance with the building . I agree, you know, we could do better. We should do better. We better do better. But he just sent me a nice -- and he doesn't always come and complain . Sometime s he highlights the nice things we or the nice things in the city. So he asked -- this is his exact message I got: Good morning , Mark. Could you share these comment s with your comment s on Tuesday night? Unfortunately my wife has to work and I will not be able to attend the meeting . I would just like to say we had a greet Multiple sclerosis walk and the group that was there really enjoyed it. And I also -- also, my wife and I went to the flower show this weekend and that was just wonderful . Everybody enjoyed that and thank you. It looks like 24,000 so far that was raised. So thank you. So nice to hear from him if he can't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 make it. And then I want to report out because , you know, there's been issues with the pool at Weston Field. And I know we have a new parks director . So, you know, we brought him up to speed with the issues that were always present ed to me by the lovely ladies that swim over there. They call themselves the zipper club. So I would like to report out for them because I know they're watching . Most of the time they do that the indoor pool at Weston is open Monday through Friday 8:30 to 12:30; and Thursday to Friday 3 p.m to 5:30 for family swimming . These hours are consistent except for on certain days which there is an unexpected event, you know, the (inaudible ) restriction , etc. The temperature issue -- this was a concern last week -- was fixed yesterday 6/8, great to hear this, great news with a new pool heater ignition assembly . The pool temperature is back up and all residents utilizing the pool report a wonderful experience . I will be getting certified -- because we asked this of him the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 new hire. Now he's telling us this. This is great. I'll be getting certified to become a lifeguard . This will occur when my lifeguards become -- I'll become certified . I will be taking the course with them, which is great. This date is to be determined but it should be within the next week or two. There are enough certified lifeguard s currently to man the two pool splash pad facilities until these lifeguard s are certified and the other two pools are ready for opening later this month. So I'm glad to report that out. And that is all I have, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . With respect to the contracts , we found out that what would it be -- is it the fire contract and the police contract . MR. MCANDREW : The fire -- the police contract isn't settled or ratified . So the fire contract , the whole contract goes back late -- mid90s. MR. KING: '96, I think. MR. MCANDREW : '96, which what that means -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 MR. SCHUSTER : Can we just ask for that in writing to get an official -- what actually is occurring. MR. MCANDREW : We'll ask for that. Okay. That's fine. So, Mr. Voldenberg , let's ask for that in writing . You were there for this discussion . But we're asked all the time, especially by Mrs. Hodowanitz as to why they are not on the website . And we've ask that publically. And we've ask that through e-mails and correspondence and we never got an answer. Well, guess what, today we got an answer. And what we heard -- I'm like, why didn't you tell us all along? I mean, people can handle the truth if you tell them if they're aware of what's going on. So what was said to us is they've had the last -- I don't want to say original -- the last full contract in writing was '96. Everything after that was either an extension or addendum or MOU, which, okay, it should have been taken care of a long time ago. So there is no one to blame. But what they're trying to do is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 compile all of them and make them one. Once that occurs, then it will be posted on the website . So there is a reason why it's not there. And I'm glad we heard the reason today and it makes sense. So we're going to hold them to it. They said hopefully 120 days after ratification . It might be a little longer. They have to, you know, have some communications with the unions. But at least we got a real answer this time. And I hope you're satisfied with that for now. MR. KING: And the executive session had to do with contract discussions with the Scranton Fire Department along with DPW and Scranton Police Department , three of those contract discussions . Just a response to -- for some of the citizens , Joan Hodowanitz , this would have been from last week the amusement tax for 2021 and 2022. Regarding the amusement tax legislation , 2021 amusement tax actual revenue was $191,837.87. They had budgeted $50,000. And in 2022 the actual amount received was $300,814.54 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 and they budgeted 200,000. Delinquent real estate tax is on the city website . Council is working with Single Tax Office solicitor regarding placement of delinquent real estate tax information on the city website . Marie Schumacher , update related to Nossaman , LLP progress to date since March of 2023, report was placed in Third Order on tonight 's agenda. And I know Mr. McAndrew would like further detail to that. Also Council was advised by our Business Administration office that Nossaman has worked with the city in completing the grant application for Congress man Cartwright appropriation 305 million for -- is it 305 million ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 3.5 million . MR. KING: I was going to say, wait a second, 3.5 million for police technology . This has been awarded . In addition , Nossaman has assisted in submitting the appropriation recently submitted for the EMS/fire training center at the CTC. Regarding street sign program in the city. The $360,000 grant from 2021 has been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 completed . There is not a current grant for street signs. However , the city grant writer is on the lookout for opportunities . Speeding on Theodore Street in North Scranton ; we receive d a resident request regarding increased traffic , speeding and stop sign violation s related to the area of Theodore Street in addition to Return and West Pass avenues as a shortcut to both Keyser and North Main Avenues. Scranton Police has confirmed that the highway unit and patrols will monitor the area for violations . Legislation has been received for next week's agenda as additional stop sign and stop bars to be placed at Theodore Street and North Sumner Avenue near Neil Armstrong Elementary School. Environment al Advisory Council appointments , the Environmental Advisory appointments are staggered so all do not expire at the same time. The question was asked, for example , why Bernie McGurl was provided a one-year term considering his vast experience and leadership skills. The administration advised they very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 much anticipate appoint ing Bernie McGurl to a full three-year term upon the expiration of his initial staggered one-year term if he's willing to serve. They understand he will be retiring soon from Lackawanna River Corridor Association and wanted to give them the courtesy of having a year before deciding on a longer term commitment . And I could confirm that because Bernie was up at the flower show and I specifically asked him and he told me, listen, I'm happy to do one year and let me decide where I'm at after that year. City Council has received two applications to date for the Environmental Advisory Council and will advertise again on June 21st. Davis trail, rehabilitation and restoration project ; the current trail has dangerous conditions due to uncontrol led drainage and erodible surface . The trail restoration with asphalt will be more stable and maintain able and more easily accessible than the current condition s. It needs to be careful ly designed to not concentrate stormwater on the trail surface .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 After the project is funded, the trail will be surveyed and the profile and cross section of the trail designed in concert with new drainage and erosion control features to make the result safer as a pave trail compare d to a stone trail. If the grant request is not fully funded, some flatter parts of the trail could be improved with a stone surface in lieu of pavement. Stop sign replacement, Adams Avenue and College Avenue near Marywood University -- actually it was -- this came to me from a Dunmore Council person. I guess the stop sign up there at College and Adams is completely faded so you could barely see that it's a stop sign. So this Council person from Dunmore had sent the Dunmore DPW down and they said, well, it's actually in Scranton . So we're sending a request now to DPW to see if we could get that stop sign replaced because it's obviously a serious issue. If people don't realize it's a stop sign, we're going to have a serious problem up there. And that's all I have at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 MR.

KING: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-C. What is your pleasure ? MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-C pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , if we could just reach out to the administration and see if they could clarify a little bit further . It just seems like a really odd ordinance to be passing if there is any more clarification that they have, Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I agree. So after reading this and after listening to Mr. Coyne, and, I mean, I'm against burning the flag, trust me; do you know what I mean? If it falls on the ground, I'm one to do that proper 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 procedure . I'm also a firm believer of the First Amendment . So the problem I have here is we have to make an appointment or get permission to exercise that right. I get it might be a safety issue because it's a burn, fire. But usually , you know, and protests and doing something like this is spontaneous and doesn't -- you have to make an appointment . You don't have to pay a fee. But I just think, you know, and on err of caution maybe we tighten this up before final reading . Have, you know, have our solicit or look at it and just make sure if there is a way we can just tighten this up a little bit. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have to agree there. It seems rather odd a protest er needs to apply for a license . They need a burn can with holes no bigger than one inch, have a fire extinguish er present at the time of the protest . It seems -- it's just an odd ordinance . MR. KING: If we could get further clarification from the administration as to why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 this has to be the way that it's written at least.

KING: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-F. What is your pleasure ? MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-F pass reading by title. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I think there are a number of valid concern s that were explained to us this evening when we were in executive session regarding this legislation . And I know last week I had also said that I felt like there was some areas that might have been overlooked . And I was hoping that we would just be able to make some amendment s and move forward quickly on it because I do think that our overtime tracking is important . And I have concern s just like my colleagues do over the use of overtime and how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 it's frequently exceeded the budget in certain departments over the past several years I've been on Council . So I do want to do what we can as a Council to rectify and correct that. But, you know, with that -- those genuine concern s that there are over this legislation , I do want a motion to table Item 6-F tonight so that we could work through those and make sure that we -- that we're not putting ourselves in a bad place with this piece of legislation . MR. SMURL: And I would second that. And I agree. I would like to get further explanation on all departments on how it affects all of the departments . MR. KING: Okay. There's been a motion. MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I do feel this should move forward . Between now and final passage we do have some time. The Law Department does know that they could send their suggestion s over to Council . I would like to push the Council to move this forward into Seventh Order and let the Law Department give their suggestions on how we should move forward with this if they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 find that they have some concerns . MR. KING: Okay. So there's been a motion and a second to -- you're going to be able to speak on the question . So there's been a motion and a second to table Item 7-A. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , I'm going to vote not to table. The city's administration has had this legislation in their lap for three weeks, four weeks now. All right, all of a sudden we hear what they don't like about it. I don't agree with what they don't like about it. There is some pieces I do, certain pieces I don't. So to stall this, table this and then -- I know how this game works. We're never going to see this legislation come back. So I would rather keep it in motion and then, you know, between now and next week tweak it. I don't think they want to tweak it. I don't think they want it at all. So if we table it, there's a good chance it doesn't come back. That's why I'm voting no to table and, yes, of course, to move to forward . MR. KING: I have -- on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 question , I have some concerns although I'm not against wanting to make sure that we properly track overtime . I'm absolutely for that 100 percent . But I do have some concerns as they relate to unions and contracts and things that were maybe brought up by the administration . And I would prefer to make sure that any legislation that we pass with respect to this is done correctly . And, therefore , I will be supporting tabling this. So there's been a motion to table and a second. I'm going to do a roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. KING: A motion to table. MR. SMURL: Motion to table, yes. MS.

GASSENMEYER , DUNMORE , PENNSYLVANIA , TO THE POSITION OF PARKS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25105 AND RECREATION DIRECTOR , EFFECTIVE MAY 22, 2023. MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of item 7-H. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I would just like to remind Council that this is a violation of City Code as well as the newly formed handbook that we would be voting on this person -- well, that he started his position prior to our vote and that he is being voted on this issue prior to receiving a waiver. MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , so, yeah, we got the handbook , folks. We got it. You could see it. It clearly states that any appointments like this need advice and consent from Council before they're hired. This gentleman has been hired for a couple weeks now. Also, if there is a waiver requested , residency waiver, it needs to be done before he's hired. So there's two strikes , against the code and the new employee 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25106 handbook . So last week I said if Sergeant Gassenmeyer confirmed to us that he's going to move into the city he doesn't need a waiver. But that's good enough to me. He verbally communicated that. We have that in an e-mail. So I thank him for his service as a sergeant . I thank him for actively looking for a house in the city. So with that said, I'll vote yes for this appointment . MR. SCHUSTER : So back on the question , I will be voting no. I think that's great that he's looking for a home in the city. I hope he does find a home in the city. I feel actions speak louder than words. We have a waiver coming up next. If the waiver was removed from our agenda, I may be a yes at that point. But I'm going to vote no for this. DR. ROTHCHILD : I was also happy to see the rules that we received tonight . And it is important to me that in the future we do receive this legislation prior to the person starting their position because it does put us in a more difficult position to approve that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25107 person that's already started . That's not why I'm planning on approving this appointment tonight . I do think that he'll do a good job in the position . And I am supportive of the appointment . But I do want to make sure that we're receiving it beforehand because I don't think it should be too difficult to put this legislation together and to get it to our desk and to just take a few more weeks before the person gets fully on board and started in their position . MR. KING: Right, and now that we have our handbook , I was going to meet with the Mayor next week and indicate to her that in the future moving forward , Council , we don't want anyone starting in any positions moving forward until it's been approved with our consent . So I will be supporting this this evening. MR. SCHUSTER : And I'm just going to remind everybody it's been occurring for three years, the same thing over and over. I hope it does change into the future. He should have spoke to his employer to not put him in this position for me to be voting no. MR. KING: Roll call, please.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25108 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-H legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-I. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 247, 2023 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR SERGEANT SCOTT J. GASSENMEYER IN HIS CAPACITY AS PARKS AND RECREATION DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-I. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25109 just stated that this gentleman has committed to moving into the city and he has six months to do it. But then the next piece of legislation is a waiver for him not to. So first of all, I've been against waivers as long as I'm on Council . And like I said last week, I'll repeat it. I'm a God fearing Irish Catholic that wouldn't give Jesus Christ a waiver because it's not fair. And this legislation in front of us doesn't make any sense if he's already committed . And also once again, take a look at the new handbook. It violates it. MR. KING: I think you raise a good point here. And since Mr. Gassenmeyer has indicated that he is, in fact, looking to move, I would guess that Scranton would be a good place to move. So I don't necessarily see a reason for the waiver either. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm also in agreement . I don't see how this is needed if that's the case. I was looking for that clarity . And I'm glad that we received the e-mail communication from Mr. Gassenmeyer about his intentions to move into the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25110 Scranton . So, therefore , I don't think a waiver is needed. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: No. The resolution dies for, I guess, a 0-5 vote. MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-J. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 248, 2023 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR ATTORNEY KATHERINE “KATIE” KENNEDY IN HER CAPACITY AS FIRST ASSISTANT CITY SOLICITOR IN THE LAW DEPARTMENT FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 of Item 7-J. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'll remind everyone again that this is also a violation of the handbook and our City Code as she already started the position prior to her vote coming before Council . I did mention that last year this was made a full-time position . I would think that $77,000 which is higher than the Parks and Rec Director , so I think it would be a good idea for her to move into the city and I will be voting no for this waiver. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I hate to repeat myself. There's a handbook out there, guys. And it states that the waiver has to come to us before the hire. I've always been against waivers. It's getting like the Oprah Winfrey show, now you get a waiver, you get a waiver, you get a waiver. That's not how it's suppose d to be. It's defined in the code. It's defined in the charter and now there's a handbook in front of us and these waivers are still coming, so, of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 course, I'm a no.
