OVERTIME REVIEW FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER DATED OCTOBER 28, 2021 FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY TO OCTOBER 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the third order items? If not, received and filed. (Audio interruption .) MR. DONAHUE : -- November 13th and 14th and the 20th and 21st at the Nay Aug Park pool across from the pool entrance . They're looking for canned goods, boxed foods, instant potatoes and gravy packets , pasta sauce, pie shells, etc. So please support our DPW workers union Thanksgiving food drive. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple. So I spoke to Mr. Voldenberg about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 this before the meeting . But I'm just going to actually -- because I don't know the answer to this. And maybe someone here knows. If not, of course, you could send correspondence . This comes from a resident that lives near Marywood where permit parking is permitted , okay? Currently residents are allowed three resident 's parking permits and one visitor pass. This lady has a driveway to park. But I have five children who often visit. Could you possibly look into see if residents can, you know, get four passes that suit them meaning , for example , I would need four visitor passes instead of the reverse ? If you could please send that forward . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of that tomorrow morning , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. And then Thursday , November 4th, 2021, there is a car safety -- car seat safety check. And no appointment necessary . Commonwealth Health EMS Training Center from 2 to 4 p.m., on 1 Oakwood Drive, Scranton , PA. If you need any more information you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 could call the Traffic Injury Prevention Program number 570-471-3026. Then also -- and this actually started last week. So Friends of the Poor will be distributing winter coats at their warehouse on 240 East Elm Street every Wednesday and Thursday . Courts will be distributed outside in the front parking lot. All right. And this is a really -- this is a fantastic piece of news I got. I want to share it with everybody . So McDonalds , the Mueller family that owns a majority of McDonalds all around here is proud to announce our partnership with Lackawanna College to offer free tuition to all employee s. No cost degrees available to all employees who average at least 16 hours per week and attend Lackawanna College part time or full time after 90 days of employment . I know my students would definitely take advantage of this because a lot of them do carry on their education over there in their culinary program . But this is a great way to entice them because everybody is complaining they don't have workers . So this is a nice 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 little benefit . And that is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anybody else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I have one more thing to add. There's going to be a food pantry for veterans. Actually it's going to be every Friday from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., held at the VFW on Rockwell Avenue. That is 2291 Rockwell Avenue and it's available for veteran s and families and widows of veterans . They don't need to provide any sort of financial information in order to receive the food. They do have to register on their initial visit. They should bring with them like their military ID just to confirm they are a veteran . And, yeah, so that will be -- that's starting this month. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Welcome everyone tonight . There's several speakers listed on the sheet here. Before I call up the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 first speaker , just a reminder in your comment s when you come up, please state your name for the record clearly for our stenographer . Also, please make sure according to the Rules of Council that you keep your comment s to agenda items or anything related to City business . First speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . This morning on my way to the Cathedral at 5:15 a.m., I had to walk down Penn Avenue. And I passed by a homeless person sleeping on the street next to My Mother's Table. And it occurs to me that the temperature is starting to get very cold at night. I think for the next week it's going to go down into the 20s. Remember how we used to have this county thing called Code Blue? Is this program still in effect and is the City looking towards taking care of our homeless because this is a sudden drop in temperature ? MR. GAUGHAN : That I don't know. Gerard Hetman when he was the outreach coordinator as you remember used to come and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 update us on that. But we'll look into it. I don't know off the top of my head if they're still running that program . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, but we are entering a very cold period now. And it's a sudden turn. And, you know, you overlay the pandemic on top of the cold weather and I think we have if not a legal, at least a moral obligation to be looking out for the benefit of those people. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. MS. HODOWANITZ : I just ask if you would look at that. Speaking at looking at things, where is my audit? MR. GAUGHAN : We don't have it yet unfortunately . MS. HODOWANITZ : All I want for Christmas is the 2020 audit. MR. GAUGHAN : Me too. It's number one on my list. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yes, and also for Christmas it would be nice to get the rest of those union contracts posted on the website . I'm still looking . I saw in your backup material for this meeting tonight the overtime 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 through October . And the numbers are still going up. I understand there are probably some valid reasons for that. But it points to preparation s for the 2022 budget. So my question is, you have a schedule for the Mayor and her department heads appearing in caucus to discuss budget issues. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I'm actually going to announce it tonight . It will occur the week of the 16th. So we're going to do it on Tuesday and Thursday for about three weeks in a row. And we'll invite -- and then they already agreed to it. So they'll come in. We'll have a public caucus with them. And they'll be able to present their departmental budgets to us. And we'll be able to ask questions and, you know, they'll have to justify any increase or any new positions . MS. HODOWANITZ : I mean, overtime is obviously one of the issues. And I think looking very careful ly at any new personnel being brought on board, job description s, the budgets , of course, for IT and LIPS will be particularly interesting . Will that be in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 legals in the paper? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I'm actually going to make a motion tonight in Fifth Order to have Mr. Voldenberg place -- I think there will be two ads placed in the newspaper with the listing of the dates, the times, and the department heads who will be coming in. And that will be televised on ECTV. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Got that, Jim? Okey-dokey. As I was walking here tonight , I still see the sign outside of the Linden parking garage prohibiting Chevrolet Bolts. I don't know if you saw the article in the paper. The Chevrolet Bolt, it has a problem with its battery. They tend to catch fire. So they're all being recalled. So apparently in all the City garages , ABM did not mention this. Chevrolet Bolts are prohibited until the recall is completed . I find that very interesting because I think the entire electric vehicle industry has an issue with their batteries . They're hardly been perfected . But, you know, this is the Electric City. And I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 curious to see what kind of strategic vision the administration has from converting from a City used to gasoline powered and diesel powered vehicle s transitioning in 10, 20 years down the road towards a county which supposedly is going to be primarily either hybrid or all electric vehicles . But let's hope we have no battery fires in any of the garages . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could check on the code blue, I'm interested in that as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. DONAHUE : And also on as union contracts , Mr. Voldenberg , on the website . MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, sir. MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council . Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . First thing, I got here tonight and I realized I forgot a mask. So, first of all, I think Council -- it's because of you that we have to wear a mask. I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 you should supply them in case people forget. Sometimes people forget things. I almost had to go home. But on the way to the car, Mr. Coyne I saw him and luckily he had some extras. So thanks to him or else I would have had to make a special trip home. I think Council should supply them to people. Next thing -- first thing I wanted to say is congratulations to all the people who won their election s yesterday . And I just hope they do a good job. Okay, we're coming up on budget time. And here's my annual rant of what I call the illegal garbage fee. I've been talking about this for 19 years now since I've been coming here. We pay our property taxes to have our garbage collected . I think it's illegal to charge another tax. And for years, prior Council told me, oh, it's not a tax, it's a fee. Well, this year I'm proven right because you can't put a fee in with property taxes. And the garbage tax was put in with the garbage taxes. So now we're being taxed twice to get our garbage collected . So I hope in this budget the Council looks to change 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 something . Either do away with it altogether or at least put it back to the $178 that it was a number of years ago before it went up to 300 because a lot people like myself who are senior citizens , we're taxed to the limit. I'm retired now. But I still have to work part time to pay taxes and other bills. People my age -- a gentleman I work with, he's 76. And he's still working . People that -- you shouldn 't have to work at that age to make ends meet. It's just not right. Well, at least one thing, thanks to President Biden we're getting a pretty good raise in our Social Security next year. This year my raise in my Social Security was $13 a month. You could barely do anything with that. Next year it's going to be 92. That's a pretty good raise going from 13 to 92. Maybe I could pay a bill with that. So thanks again to President Biden. He kept -- that was his campaign promise . And he's keeping it. He said he was going to take care of the seniors and he's doing it. So I hope Council considers doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 something with that garbage fee -- garbage tax, I'm sorry. Next thing, before I went to my job last Friday morning , I'm looking at my door, saw a DPW supervisor pickup truck parked on the corner across from me. I see a guy spray painting lines on the street. I went out. I said, What are you doing? Very nice man, he told me something . We're going to take care of the whole corner. We're going to raise the curbs that aren't up high enough. We're going to take care of your corner. I said, oh, that's great. I've been going to Council for a couple of times and hopefully what I said is why you're here, really nice man. He said, oh -- he said tell them Latino supervisor was here to do it. And -- well, Latino in Italian , really nice guy. I'm glad he was there. He said, well, I can't give a date but we're going to do it before the real cold weather starts. So I really appreciate that they're doing more than I asked for. They're doing the whole corner, so everybody 's house. So that's really good. I think it will really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 be good for the neighborhood . But again, like I said last week, I don't know why we have blacktop curbs. Everybody should have concrete curbs. I don't know who made that decision just to make that area of Tripp Park blacktop. But that's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a good night. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . MR. GAUGHAN : Good evening . MR. ELLMAN: I didn't vote for any of you all. Congratulate everyone . I'm not mad. I'm sort of disappointed . I think -- I think you could almost say that the Mayor didn't have any opposition in this. If she ran against Mary Walsh, I think it would have been a different result. As usual, I don't know what I'm talking about, but I have a question really. Why can't they put some solar panels for that Electric City light? They're paying $6,000 a year rent. I have no idea what they cost. But it shouldn 't cost that much. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that would have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 to be -- those solar panels cost money too. So that would have to be an investment made by whoever owns the building . MR. ELLMAN: It seems to me it would be -- I don't know what -- how long that light's on, six, eight, hours. How much electricity do they need? Well, just a passing thought anyway. When I walk my dog three, four times a day, I think of all of these things to kill time. And now I'm going to talk about the gentleman Roseanne -- that got killed in front of my house, Mr. Minicozzi . Mr. Rowland says it was an accident . It was no accident whatsoever , none. The man was standing about 2 feet from the curb waiting to across the street. The car that hit him was going over twice the speed limit. He never put his brakes on. There's not a single skid mark. After he hit the poor guy he went a hundred feet up the street before he stopped . He should have been taken to jail immediately for manslaughter or something . This case isn't going to be swept 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 under the rug like Mr. Binki's I hope -- the gentleman that got killed on Wyoming a couple years ago. The people that run over him didn't even send $10 for his funeral . He was buried by Keystone Mission . Rosanne 's brother grew up with Mr. Minicozzi . That's how she knows him for probably about 15 years. If this was a six or eight year old, it would be different . It would have been handled different ly. They would have cared. They don't seem to have any interest in this. And one other thing, I saw free grants for West Side. Now that the election is over, maybe you could get some two by fours for the benches over at Western Park. You know, my neighborhood is so bad they raised my insurance , like I said. And you give free grants to West Side. That doesn't make sense. You know my neighborhood is going to pot. Like I said, three houses with just inches from me with junk cars all over the place. I don't know who is suppose d to take care of it in the licensing bureau but they ought to be fired. It's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 shame. It's a shame what's happened to north side up and down the streets. The whole place is a mess. But I have seen a street sweeper a few months ago. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Next speaker is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council . Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton , taxpayer . That announcement about the Chevy Bolt, that's also Volvo, Honda, several others. And I spent my whole life working on -- in transportation my whole work life. Fortunately I don't have to do that anymore. But I would recommend that the government start pushing hybrids. And some of these vehicle s that the car companies are handing out to politicians , not necessarily from Scranton or formally ; but they're an insult. You know, an electric humvee, it takes way more energy to push a humvee around and jeeps, giant jeeps. And, I mean, it's just kind of sickening . I mean, what am I suppose d to do with our narrow City streets ? Pull over, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 raise the flag and salute, I guess. You know, we're looking for efficiency here. And I would think that a hybrid would be more efficient than one of those clunkers . At any rate, congratulations to everybody that won. Hopefully we can all get along. And I have a little disappoint ment. It seems like here and all over the country a lot of voters that qualified to vote haven't. If you're out in TV land and listening, next time get out to vote and hopefully inform yourself on the issues before you do. Don't get sucked in by silly stuff like racial things or whatever for lawyers . That course was for lawyers , law students . Televisions in our courts, they are starting to pile up. Now, several months ago they stopped taking televisions down at the Recycling Center. I would be glad to pay. But I have three of them that are defunct. You know, and people are putting them out in the courts. I started walking the doggie a couple of blocks with my whacky ankle.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 And it's just -- they are starting to pile up. I'm seeing them here and there. And maybe after Christmas they'll be exponentially more when everybody goes out spending their money if they could get it. Now on taxes, last week I spoke a little bit about Scranton taxes. And here's some institutions that don't pay any taxes in Scranton ; General Dynamics , that's the former Chamberlain down there; state offices , county offices, federal courthouse . The county occupies at least two and a half city blocks in downtown . And the rural suburb hospital s are closing at an alarming rate. So then we have people living on the outskirts coming to Scranton to our hospitals . And I'm all for hospitals . But it would be nice if some day the state would start to compensate these cities that have to take in all of these tax exempts . And they might have to be -- they might need a little push. I was very enthused about that suit. And I'm disappoint ed that Scranton wasn't part of it -- the school district to at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 least get compensated for the low wage earners and people that are -- and once again, COVID. They're not announcing the death toll anymore. And yesterday I got my -- or Monday -- it might have been yesterday , my third vaccination . So get down there. I'm not dead. You could see me, you know? I'm not drying up into a ball or anything . And it's really important that people get vaccinated because we're never going to get out from under this. We should be producing vaccinations for the whole world because it's just going to come back like a boomerang. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a good night. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else in the audience like to address the Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, we had a bunch of conversation here about the electric cars and the parking garages . Electric cars are like a lot of things, a fad. They have limited range and a lot of people put them forth as the new green technology . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 But when you take a look further down the line for electric vehicles , electric vehicles use heavy metals and the batteries do not last that long. So you may not be putting pollution out in the air locally from that car, but over a short period of time roughly about 10 years the battery systems need to be replaced. Those battery systems have a lot of toxic heavy metals in them. And, yes, we're going to be dumping and dealing with instead of toxins going into the air, we'll deal more with toxins that are heavy metals that's are going to be storehoused -- storehoused somewhere until they reuse some of those battery parts or they get rid of the chemicals by putting them in dumps or anywhere else. The other fraud about electric vehicle s, oh, they're clean burning . No they are not. Wind power and solar power is great. But it's not the majority of what's powering those electric vehicles . What electric vehicles are at this point is the pollution is not in my backyard . The pollution is not something that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 I say. Whether it's coal-fired electric , or oil or electric as long as a generation of electricity is from a pollution source even though you are not seeing it coming out of the back of the car, it's just coming out of a facility that's producing the electricity . I would rather than see hybrid cars. If the City is going to consider in the future, I would rather than see propane or natural gas vehicle s as most larger cities have gone to because natural gas is readily available . It's clean burning . And it actually lasts for a longer period of time. That's why large buses in a lot of metro centers use natural gas as fuel for vehicles rather than electric . Electric at this time is impractical and the batteries (inaudible .) Moving onto trash, I had inquired last week whether or not the trash fee was put into a separate interest -bearing account . Do we know if it is at this point? MR. GAUGHAN : We're looking into that. That question has come up before. So Mr. Voldenberg is looking into it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. COYNE: The trash fee has been put in place a long period of time. I'm kind of startled that we don't know whether or not that special account is in place. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, as I mentioned to you last week, I believe it is but we're just waiting for confirmation on that. MR. COYNE: Okay. I'm just surprised that since 2018 it was brought up in a lawsuit that no one actually knows whether or not that -- I would figure that when that got brought up, someone would go out there and go, is this actually put into a special account . And if it's not, I'm curious to know which of the laws that Council has passed does City government not have to obey? It's part of the laws and ordinance that this was set forth when it was put through that the money was being put into a special account . If it's not being put into a special account as the law assigned , I'd like to know which City laws are optional ? Out of the stuff that the City and the Mayor signs, which laws does the City not have to obey have been put on books? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Is there a special exception for the City where the City does not have to follow policy even if it's law just because it doesn't want to? I know that's a little harsh in saying it in that term. But if I'm require d to put an escrow account up for money that I take in, I can't spend that on my own expenses because I'm taking away from funds that are specifically earmarked. In putting through the garbage fee, these were specifically earmarked only to be spent on cost for waste management . And without having a separate account , it makes it extremely difficult to be able to audit exactly where those expense s are being spent on. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : And you know that that exact thing that you're speaking of is now being litigated between the City and several parties . MR. COYNE: I do know that. But I also have to look at it that we cannot -- the City not be financially clear for three or four years to hide behind lack of clarity because there's a litigation going on. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 We're not asking for details on litigation . We're asking whether or not the City is complying to the law. And it's financial data. It should be available . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : We'll get an answer for you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Thank you. MS. WALTMAN : May I bring these up? Good evening, Carla Waltman , City resident . I want to continue with what I was reading last weekend or last week about the resolution that I hope that you really not act upon at this point because you're still doing your due diligence for research . One of the papers that I just gave you is some contact information and also a video that you could watch that might answer some of your questions about something Mr. Gaughan had said last week. But this is in reference to Chapter 317, noise. I got cut off at a certain point. But I want to go back through a couple things, Prohibited Acts A1A. This prohibited act 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 require ment is exactly the same as the PA Liquor Control Board that noise does not cause a disturbance across a real property boundary . 317-7, Prohibited Acts A4, loudspeaker , public address systems is exactly the same as the PA Liquor Control Board that the noise does not cause a disturbance across the real property boundary . 317-8, sound level limits by the receiving land use district 10 feet inside a lot in a residential district Monday through Saturday until 9 p.m., excluding major holiday s of 69 decibels . 70 decibels is a dishwasher . My house is about 225 feet away from that gentleman 's property . That bar by law I should not be able to hear a dishwasher from that distance . From 9 p.m. until 7 a.m. all day Sunday and all major holiday s the sound level decibel is 64 which is between an air conditioner and dishwasher. By law I should not be able to hear a dishwasher or an air condition er from that distance . Pertaining to the language in your resolution , Scranton is no longer a Class 2A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 City. It was reclassified as a Class 3 City on October 1st, 2021. And also Section 203 of the Home Rule Charter authorizes City Council to adopt legislation for the maintenance of peace, health, safety and welfare of the City and its resident s, not just bars, nightclubs , and restaurants . From what I'm saying here to all of you is that the laws are there. They are the same as the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. The one thing that is different is the enforce ment. With the Liquor Control enforce ment, the neighborhood s will see the correct enforce ment. With the City enforcing its own noise ordinance , you will get no enforcement . I saw it happened . I was a witness to it. I lived it. I had to fight hard to be able to live in peace and quiet so that my neighborhood and neighbors who work nontypical shifts could sleep for work and school. My house is no longer being rocked by pounding bass and loud music. I ask you not to go any further with that resolution . Could you tell me at this point where that resolution 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 is? MR. GAUGHAN : So we passed that resolution . It was voted 5-0 by the Council . Now, I will give this to our Solicitor and have him review this information . But to answer your question , it was passed 5-0. MS. WALTMAN : Have you already scheduled an appointment with the Liquor Control enforcement -- Liquor Control Board, I guess? MR. GAUGHAN : I believe now the -- it's in their hands to schedule . It was sent I think to the Liquor Control Board -- the resolution . I think they were notified . And now it's on them to have public hearing s throughout -- I believe throughout the City, each section of the City. MS. WALTMAN : Didn't the Mayor have to sign off on this? MR. GAUGHAN : I believe the Mayor did, yes. MS. WALTMAN : The Mayor approved it. MR. GAUGHAN : When the Mayor -- the Mayor has 10 days from -- did the Mayor sign it, Frank? I think she did. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, she did. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, she did. So when she signed it, it officially becomes law. MS. WALTMAN : So she's okay with rocking the neighborhood s with noise too. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I mean -- I understand your argument . But when we looked at this whole issue, you know, from 300 feet up in the air, we felt that it was in the best interest of -- we heard from several neighbor s who were not opposed to the noise. MS. WALTMAN : Who do I call when things don't get better when the ordinances are not being taken care of by the Scranton Police? Who do I call? Do I call you? MR. GAUGHAN : No, it would be nothing that I could do. I think the argument that I made last week or the week before when this was in final passage was that he is authorized by the Zoning Board to have an outdoor seating and outdoor music. So he's authorized by the Zoning Board to do that is my understanding . So for then us to say that he can't do that until a certain time at night wasn't fair to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 business I didn't think. MS. WALTMAN : He is allowed to do that. But he still has to abide by both noise ordinances . MR. GAUGHAN : Right. MS. WALTMAN : And that's what you guys aren't understanding . He didn't do it before. And he's not going to do it again. The only one that stopped him was the liquor control enforcement . And now you're going to tie their hands. And now we as neighbors won't have anybody to help us because you say you're not going to do anything about it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, well, I will give this to our Solicitor to review again. And when there are public hearings they'll be published in the newspaper for further comment on it. It's not official -official yet until the PLCB gives their approval . MS. WALTMAN : You need to -- you need to call down to Wilkes-Barre. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Okay. Frank. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments this evening ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. So we once again receive d a weekly update from OECD regarding resident complaints and for the complaint regarding the Vine Street station which is at the corner of Vine Street and Prescott Avenue and that's been closed down for many years now. It said under there that there was a car removed . But I'm not sure if it was another vehicle . But there's currently a truck or SUV that's parked there now has graffiti all over it. There is still plenty of overgrown weeds. There is broken glass. There are some windows that are boarded up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 But the one that's not, the glass is broken. There's a mattress randomly . There is plenty of trash over there. So it really looks quite horrendous and affects the neighborhood . So I'd like to once again find out some more information about it, get SPD over there to tag that vehicle if it has not been already and have that property updated because it's clearly not -- not fixed. And then one of the other properties on the list is towards the lower end of the 400 block of East Gibson Street. And I, myself have passed by this property numerous times. And the overgrown shrubbery it's out into the street. I think there's some junk vehicles including a boat that also seems to be out onto the street partially . So I did not see any updates that's been on the list for a few weeks. And I'm not sure if it was missed. But there is nothing written under there. So I would like to check in again regarding that that property . And that's everything . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 both properties , Dr. Rothchild . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments today? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. As I mentioned earlier this evening , I want to give everybody an update on the 2022 budget timeline in terms of, you know, what we're going to do moving forward here when we entertain the Mayor's budget. So the legislation -- the budget will be placed in Fifth Order for introduction on Tuesday , November 16th, 2021. Council will most likely receive the budget the week prior because it has to be placed on our agenda. And there's things that we have to do in our office. On Tuesday , November 16th, the Mayor, the Director of the Office of Economic and Community Development and Licensing and Inspections and Permits will be here at 5 p.m. for a public work session we're calling it where they will present -- the Mayor will present an overview of the budget.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 And then we'll get into specifics in terms of OECD and Licensing and Inspections . So that will be at 5 p.m., Tuesday, November 16th. At 5 p.m., November 18th, we'll have the Director of DPW and Parks and Recreation . So we'll be focusing on those two departments . 5 p.m., Tuesday , November 23rd, we'll have the Chief of Police and the Chief of the Fire Department . 5 p.m. on Thursday , December 2nd, we'll have the Business Administrator , the IT Department . There is no director . But I'm assuming Mr. Deeley will be there to represent the IT Department ; the Treasury Department and Human Resources . I do believe that the BA will be at every single one of these. But since IT, Treasury and HR fall under the Business Administrator umbrella in terms of the way the budget is laid out, that will be the specific time period where we'll focus on that. So that will be the layout. So again, introduced Tuesday , November 16th. The second reading will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 November 23rd. We'll table the budget as we usually do every year on November 23rd. Tuesday , November 30th at 5:45 we'll have a public hearing . This will all be advertise d in the newspaper . And then we'll have final passage of the budget either December 7th or December 14th barring any unforeseen circumstances . Now, the reason that I've always wanted to do it this way but could never get it done for many different reasons , this is the most transparent way to look at the budget. I don't think there is any other good way to do it. We should have every department director in here in front of not only the Council but the public to explain their budget. If there's going to be a new position , if there's going to be a salary increase , they're in their departments working with their -- the City employees every day. Let's have them defend their decisions and the asks that they're making to not only Council but the public. It will give us a much better idea of the thought process behind the budget. In the -- I still think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 this is a bit rushed. And people from the public had mentioned that before. I would have liked to do this months ago. But we weren't able to successfully do that. But this does give us a good rope now to make an educated decision on the budget. And I think it will be very informative for the public as well. And I'm hoping this will continue years afterward . And as I mentioned here in the last few months, this isn't anything groundbreaking . They do this in the county. They do it at the school board. They do it all over the state and the country . So we need to start doing this here so that we could make educated and good financial decisions on the budget. So if there is any questions on that, just let me know. But at this time I'd like to make a motion to have our City Clerk, Frank Voldenberg place legal advertisement s in the Scranton Times that details the budget timeline process . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second. On the question ? All 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. So Mr. Voldenberg will place that advertisement in the newspaper . We'll see if we can get it on the website . I'm sure there will be some sort of article about it. Okay. Prior to receiving the budget -- and I've asked for this a few weeks ago. And I'm going to ask again tonight . And I think the Mayor and the department directors will agree with this request . Council would like a list of all the new position s that were include d in the 2020 budget and an explanation of what value they brought to the City this year whether it was increased revenue , whether it was increased productive , efficiency . So if we're going to approve new positions in this budget which we're not sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 yet what that looks like, we want to know exactly what -- how these new positions that the Mayor asked us to approve last year what kind of impact that they've had. I think that is only fair. We -- I am very concerned that we have not received any legislation yet on two very crucial pieces to our exit from Act 47 and the two recommendations that were in our Act 47 plan, a debet management policy and a fund balance policy. Now, I've been told that we're getting close to receiving legislation and we're going to receive it, but we haven't receive d it yet. So, Frank, if you can check in with the Law Department on that. It's very, very important . I believe that we may end just like last year with a fund balance in our budget which is new to the City of Scranton . So we do need to have a policy in place I think and so does our recovery coordinator on what that looks like and how to manage it moving forward . I asked several questions -- Council asked question s about the SAFER Grant sent a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 month, month and a half ago, no answer. I spoke to the Mayor and the Business Administrator about it. They are suppose d to send something over. This will most likely have budget implications if they do intend to move forward with adding 10 new firemen . So the quicker we get those answers the better because we're going to have to make a decision on it I think. Still no response on an overall plan for the pools at Nay Aug Park. I'm not going to get on my soapbox about that because I've said it here before. But we need to know what the Mayor's plan is. Are you going to demolish the pools? And the longer that sits vacant, the worse it is for our young people and our residents in the City of Scranton . I asked about the citywide DPW paving project . So I did request a paving list. I also asked why we have not seen any movement on the OECD paving project . Usually that occurs in the fall. The OECD Executive Director Eileen Cipriani did advise us that the engineering firm has completed the design. And they are awaiting review of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 ADA ramp drawing s. Once this is completed , the speck book will be finalized and placed out for bid. But I'm assuming now that's a spring project and not a fall project . So, Frank, if you could double-check on that. But I don't think there will be enough time to do that this fall. We should be receiving a monthly collections report from Portnoff Law Associates . Miss Schumacher had asked about that. So I believe we're -- we should receive that relatively soon. And then there was a woman who had reached out to me about severe flooding in the 3200 block of Powell Court and Birney Avenue. And we did send that request to DPW to revisit the issue. This is an issue that's been going on since the Peters' administration in the 1970s. So I would like an update on that. The other thing we need to find out about is the garage on Wyoming Avenue, Al Young's issue and the people's issue on Wyoming Avenue. The controller signed an emergency order to take the garage down. As of today, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 the garage is still standing . So I'm really not sure why it has not been knocked down yet but if we can get an update on that. I've asked several times now about the SAPA legislation . Dunmore has put it on hold. I believe every other community that's been within -- that's been working on this now since 2014 and '15 within the Scranton Abington Planning Association has approved it. Dunmore put it on hold to see what Scranton was going to do. We haven't received anything yet. Now, I don't even know if we'll have enough time to get that accomplished before the end of the year because it has to be three reading s and I believe a 30 day -- or a public hearing or some kind of comment period. So if you could check with the administration on that I would appreciate it. I know we do not have an HR Director anymore. We know how crucial of a position that is. I've asked a very, very simple basic question , how many employees do we have out on compensation and disability . And we -- all we get is crickets . I know that Jessica Eskra now is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 leading -- in charge of the HR Department , Frank. So if you could send that directly to her to see if we can get that question answered. It shouldn 't take more than five minutes. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.
