CITY OF SCRANTON 2ND QUARTER 2021/2022 REVENUE COMPARISON REPORT RECEIVED FROM THE CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION OFFICE DATED AUGUST 31, 2022. 3-R. CORRESPONDENCE TO THE HONORABLE GOVERNOR WOLF DATED SEPTEMBER 6, 2022 FROM SCRANTON MAYOR COGNETTI , SCRANTON CITY COUNCIL , DUNMORE MAYOR CONWAY AND DUNMORE COUNCIL REGARDING THE KEYSTONE SANITARY LANDFILL ’S REQUEST TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION . MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Sunday, September 18th at 12 p.m. to 7 p.m., will be the Lebanese Heritage Festival at St. Ann's Maronite Catholic Church on 1320 Price Street, Scranton , PA. So it's a great event, great Lebanese food. So if you could make it and support them, that would be great. That's all I have. MR. KING: I have a few quick ones. While we were on break there were a number of great festivals and things that took place during the month of August, one being the Electric City Flower Show. And I know that Norma Jeffries was involved with that. I was able to attend that. That was great. It was really nice and well attended . That was held up at Nay Aug Park. Also the Electric City Classic , the bicycle race, which was held downtown . I was able to get downtown for a little bit of the race on Saturday . But then on Sunday I was able to go over to the Hill Climb Race. That was pretty exciting , kind of a unique event for our City. It was amazing how it drew so many people, you know, out into the neighborhood up in the Hill Section . So I thought that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 pretty awesome . And also the LaFesta Italiana , just this past weekend . Unfortunately Monday, yesterday was kind of a wash for everyone . But that was also a great weekend . And it brought a lot people into our City and generated a lot of business for our vendors . So congratulations to Chris DiMattio and all his volunteers for that. Also as mentioned earlier tonight during caucus from Eileen Cipriani , thrilled to announce that the City's going to receive a DCNR grant $481,000 for Robinson Park on East Mountain . So that cuts a big chunk out of that 1.2 million that they are hoping to do for the rehab of Robinson Park. So it's all good news. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I had a couple. I agree with Councilman King that there were a lot of great events over the course of August. I went to the ones that he had mentioned as well. I really enjoyed getting to see so many community members just enjoying the City and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 what we have to offer. So it's one of my favorite parts about the summer is having so many of those different outdoor events and going to the parks. And I wanted to mention that the grant applications were open for wellness programs that it opened up back on August 22nd, but the grant application period is open until September 16th. And this would be for a nonprofit organization , private entities, for government agencies that help address key areas of community wellness . And the applications can be found on the website . It's covered under part of ARPA. So the ARPA section of our website is where the application can be found. And some of the focused areas that they're looking to fund include drug overdose prevention programs , behavior health response and violence prevention and wellness programs . And one other thing that I wanted to mention , I had seen in the paper that legislation is going into effect from the state to be able to better enforce the use of ATV or all terrain vehicles within cities throughout 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Pennsylvania . So I was personally really happy to see that. I hope that it helps to dissuade people from using their all terrain vehicles on the city streets . I know that the fall time is coming. So it still might be a problem for a couple more months before the cooler weather hits. But if people are caught because it is illegal already , the police now could potentially impound the vehicle or confiscate the vehicle from the person. So it just gives some more teeth to what local city police departments can do with regards to that. So I just wanted to bring that up in case anyone missed that. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? I have a few. Just quickly , Council held an executive session this evening with the Mayor and the Business Administrator to discuss personnel issues. Also, if we look a little different from -- to the audience at home it's because this is the first HD broadcast on ECTV Council meetings . Next, some of our local state 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 legislators are going to holding a free joint Senior Fair this Friday, September 9th from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The event's sponsored by State Senator Marty Flynn, State Representative Bridget Kosierowski , State Representative Kyle Mullins and State Representative Tom Welby. It will be from 11 to 2 at the Marketplace at Steamtown . It's a free, one stop shop featuring 60-plus venders , health and wellness screens , information from local, state, and federal agencies plus much more. There is free three hour indoor parking with validation from any mall merchant . Also, I got a request from a resident who recently took advantage of the free smoke alarm, carbon monoxide detector installation program offered by the Scranton Police Department . She just wanted to express how convenient and helpful it was. And if anyone would like to take part in that program , they could call 570-969-6607, extension one. And the Fire Department will come out and install free smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors . And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . What is the status on the negotiations on the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : They are still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : You know, it's been eight months now since those contracts expired . And it's interesting to see that in July we paid Ufberg and Associates $31,393.75. So the cost -- the meter for that cost is still ticking . And what is the status on the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : We are still hopeful that we will receive it by September 30th. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, we're down to hopeful now, okay. So we paid Rainey and Rainey by the way $3,851.25 in July for audit prep. So one of these years we're going to get it right. MR. DONAHUE : So I will say that when we put this out for bid and we have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 discussion on the contract moving forward , we're going to put a September 30th as a hard deadline . MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. That should be in the engagement letter. Now the capital budget, my first question is, did I miss a legal announcement in the legals about that caucus? Didn't that have to be announced in the paper? Was that publicized ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't -- I don't know. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I thought we advertised caucuses and legal proceedings . MR. DONAHUE : I'll look into it and see what was advertised . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, because I think a lot of people were unaware that that was going to come down tonight . And speaking of the capital budget, good news/bad news. It was certainly the most detailed document I've seen in years. So I think that was a good thing. It laid out a long-term plan. Although , I got to tell you, those -- Frank, those spreadsheets , I needed a magnifying glass 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 to read those when I printed them out. MR. DONAHUE : So I saw the same thing. I'm going to -- we're going to send a request to get bigger spreadsheets because sometimes when you put that into a PDF and it gets transferred over, they shrink a little bit. But, yes, I had the same problem . MS. HODOWANITZ : But having said that, when I got down to the part about the City Hall feasibility study and the expansion building , that kind of set me off on edge. We're spending a lot of money, number one, on renovating this building . And again, it's long-term. But this is City Hall. During COVID most of the people were working from home remotely and operations continued . So I'm wondering -- I could see that the building needs updates, ADA accessible and other issues, wiring and internet and the whole nine yards. I understand that. But I'm not convinced that we need another building , number one. Number two, this raises the whole issue I'd still would like to know what's going on with the restricted access to this building ? To my knowledge , it is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 only government building in Scranton that has restricted access after COVID. So if COVID is not the issue and there is some kind of security issue, surely we need to discuss that and try to find another fix because the public should have access to this building . I understand that you could call and make an appointment . But that puts off a lot of people that the government's not here to serve them that they must request an appointment to get a government service . That stinks. And we need to look at that very closely . Also, the disabled access door in the back during the daytime that's locked. They used to have a sign there that says to get access to this door, press this buzzer. After COVID they took that sign down. And it's never been replaced. So how would somebody disable d know how to get into the building ? And I pointed this out to the Mayor in July. It's September 6th. That should be fixed. So I want to know how long they're going to restrict access to this building , why, and what we're going to do about disabled 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 access. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Tonight I'd like to say to Council that I gave you some envelopes and everything that's in there is all documents , e-mails and information that I got from the City to back up everything I'm going to tell you tonight because everything is backed up. This started in the beginning of August. I went to Chick Feldman park over in Pine Brook. I go there with my sister and we walk around the field for exercise every day. We go to Connell Park and we go to Clover Field, Grace Park, and Robinson Park. But anyway, this particular Sunday morning we went and there was 200 football players there on the field practicing from Lackawanna College . There was many people like mothers and their small children that usually come because I know them. I see them there. They come and they put a blanket down on the field and the kids run around and play and have music with them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 They couldn't do that because they had football players. They had to turn around and go home. This is not just one or two. These are like five or six people because these people -- these players are there for hours and hours. So not only that, they're ruining the field. What was grass now is dirt. When you look at the field you will see grass but you have to walk onto the field. You only see like 40-50 spots. It's just dirt. Right now it's wet so it's hard. Once this dries like the hot heat, it's like dirt this high. You could just run through like pig pen, you know, dirt all over. So I wrote -- when I came home I wrote a letter to the 311scrantonpa .gov where you ask question s and get answers from the City if you have to get any questions answered . So August 8th, I wrote question s. And Marissa Duffy, Director of Parks and Recreation and since I had to wait nine days to the 17th to get an answer, in the meantime I went and I looked to see if I could get the answers myself to some of these questions .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Some of the questions I asked I'll tell you. One was, who gave Lackawanna College permission to use Chick Feldman Field? And they said -- Marissa Duffy answered , the Parks Director , which is herself . The next question I asked does Lackawanna College own the field at the end of Sweeney Beach because there's a field at the very end of Sweeney Beach, a football field, beautiful big football field. Does Lackawanna College own that and she replied no. Well, that's not true. Like I said, I found the answers while I was waiting for her to reply. She said no. The answer is yes. Eric Larson the athletic director told me himself on the phone, yes, indeed Lackawanna College does own it. And the assistant director of athletes told me that too. And someone from the City also told me and I got the pin number from Marie. She went to the county and got the map. And we looked that up and Lackawanna College has owned that for years. So Marissa Duffy either is lying deliberately or she should certainly know the answers to these question s. And all of these question s I will tell you, they're not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 true. The other question was, is there any written agreements between Lackawanna College and the Parks Department or the City? She wrote back and she said there is internal documents for office use and use agreement with City Council . Well, there is no use agreement with City Council . Council has not heard one word from the Parks Department or Marissa Duffy. They just never heard from her. So I want to show you some picture s of the field. Oh, she also said -- I said did you get Council approval ? And she said Council was off for August recess. But we had it on the agenda before the recess. It has never been on the agenda. Frank Voldenberg told me that himself . I want to show you some pictures of the dirt at Chick Feldman Field. Take a look at this. This used to be grass. Now look at this. This is Lackawanna College football field at the end of Sweeney Beach on Poplar Street. Look at this. Do you think that's a small field? Look at that. That's a huge football field. Eric Larson told me the reason they don't use that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 field is because it's too small. That is hardly small. Now, look at this. This is the beautiful grass right next to where Lackawanna College at Chick Feldman Field practices right next to where they practice . Look how nice the beautiful grass is. That should tell you something what they did. Here's another picture . And at the very top -- I hope you could see it. There is the grass where they don't use it. But this is the dirt. So I don't know what's going on. But I'd like to know why Lackawanna College is also paying to use this field. So how much are they paying and who decided ? And there's no agreement s at all. There is no insurance . And I gave you pictures of 12 foot umpire chair for 20 days it was standing up in the field. They just took it down last week for the first time to lay it down, very dangerous . There was no insurance nothing , no agreements , anything . Please check into this, Council . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I'll address what I know about this in Fifth Order, okay? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MS. FRANUS: I won't be here but thank you very much. I appreciate it. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . Coming up on almost a year now since I was here and told them about the DPW supervisor coming and painting lines on the intersection where I live. And he said we'll be here before the cold sets in. Obviously that never happened . Came here in the spring and asked when it's going to happen. I'm told all the time, oh, you're on the list. You're on the list. Here almost a year later the problem still isn't solved. I happened to bump into the Mayor when I came in tonight . She was leaving . I let her know about it. So she took all the information . So I hope something is finally done. And I also told the temporary Director West and he said he would speak to the Mayor. So -- and I know, Councilman Donahue , I spoke to you at the National Night Out. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, and we keep on -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. SPINDLER : I keep being told I'm on the list. But it's not helping . We're coming up on a year now. Before you know it, the snow's going to be flying. I hate to say that. But time is moving quickly . So I hope something is done. I even told the Mayor if Tom Preambo was still in charge of DPW this would have been done already . Tom got things done. And I don't know why he's not director anymore. But I told the Mayor I'm not pleased by that. I told her point blank I don't like the way the City is being run now. The DPW Director went on leave, then mysteriously he resigns and no explanation why. The Mayor told me it was a personnel issue. Every time they don't want to answer a question it's a personnel issue. (Audio interruption ) the Doherty administration , that's the way things happen. The same with our former Police Chief Namiotka . I said to the Mayor he was doing a great job. Yeah, he was. Well, why was he replaced? No explanation for that either. I know what it is. I know Len 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Namiotka for a long time. He told me the whole story. I'm not going to get into it for television for the public to know. I think the people of this City should know what's going on. And I like -- Joan -- excuse me. I agree that we should be able to get into City Hall. I told that to the Mayor. I said, you know, in my lifetime -- I lived in the City my whole life. And we never had a security problem in City Hall. She said I'm not going to let people running in and out of City Hall as they please. That's ridiculous . I said why don't you put a police officer there? She said, well, we can't afford it. There's got to be an explanation . City Hall belongs to the citizen s of the City and we should have access. We shouldn 't have to make an appointment . I think it's ridiculous . If you go to the county building there is sheriff deputies there. Maybe we -- we should be able to hire some kind of security . Have a -- let's get a metal detector . There's never been a security issue in City Hall as long as I lived in the City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Next thing, the Mayor did tell me -- I guess she's getting together with Council on a dangerous dog legislation . I was happy to hear that. And my advice would be to maybe Google different cities in Pennsylvania as I did when my dog was attacked several years ago. Pittsburgh , if your dog is deemed to be a dangerous dog, you have to have a 10 foot high fence and insurance on that dog. That's just one idea. Okay, moving on. The landfill wanted to dump all the leachate in the Lackawanna River, I just couldn't believe what I read. That is just outrageous . When I was growing up, the river was terrible . It's been cleaned up really nice now. And to allow that -- I think the number was like 200,000 gallons a day. I wouldn't allow a gallon a day, never mind $200,000 gallons. That's unfathomable . I can't believe anybody would even consider it letting that happen. Next thing, I received the smoke detector s and the firefighter s were terrific . They were in and out in a hurry. They would have been out faster but I kept talking to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 them. Quickly , All Phase Electric on Capouse Avenue, I brought this up a while ago. There were broken windows , blah, blah, blah. I went by today, all the glass was cleared up. The windows were boarded up. But that's a good thing. I hope somebody takes care of that, takes it over and does something with that building . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Les. Next on the list, Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hello. I'm Rick Little. I'd like to talk about I read in the paper today about the Mayor wanting to get people on boards. But I was looking at it careful because boards, commissions , you know, it always comes down to (inaudible ). Anyway, I put in my application a couple weeks ago because I'm having a hard time living in Scranton Housing Authority . I've lived there since 2009. And there's an atmosphere of fear. And I think it's based on -- I think it's based on the prominent law enforcement power figures like the District Attorney being there and then everybody in the staff, you know, if you don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 do this, you know, you're going to be evicted . You're going to have to pay the Court fees. And I've been through that, you know, I found out that anybody who complains about stuff, first thing they do is send you up to the executive and then if it's not resolved , they just ignore you. And they have a -- there is no rule of law. And the important thing to Scranton is because I've been doing Right To Know after -- over 10 years of coming to City Hall and trying to find out who's in charge here. Does anybody know what's going on? I haven't found anybody that knows what's going on. But I live there. I know what -- I could see what's going on. And you just recently with the -- what is it, the three police officers , you know, getting federal funds, you know. I wish I had a Right To Know but I would like you to know that I did some pretty poignant right to knows. And I did them with the City of Scranton . Oh, we don't know anything about them. You have to go to the Scranton Housing Authority Right to Know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 officer , which I did. And I'm, you know, I haven't gotten those documents yet. But the good thing about Right To Know, it becomes public document so all of you could see what I'm asking because we had fires every single week. The fire alarm would go off. And then suddenly it stopped about three years ago. And I'm a film maker. It just didn't make sense. How could you have a fire every single week and then it stops, you know. And then the construction started and construction went on for two years and then the COVID, all of these things. And there was never a person to go to. But the structure of it, you know, in a company there's a president or, you know, a hierarchy of who is in charge. The way they run it, they have this like -- it's almost like a prison guard. It's like this woman -- it's always a woman who you can't ask her anything , you know. And it's not a personal thing. This is by design. So no one has names. No one has accountability . Like I was in family court for 15 years. I learned how the Courts work. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 I was evicted from Scranton Housing Authority . And I almost died doing the notice of appeal because I had to learn Pennsylvania Court procedure . And what I discovered is over the -- in the Court of Common Pleas, I was the only one who was doing Court procedure . Everything else is like passing it off, you know, go out in the hall and make your decision . That's why so many people are evicted because they get taken to court. They are filled with the fear, you know. And then they go out and they sign something and they move you around. But this is a problem . This is a big, big problem for -- because I know so many people that are evicted . I know people that have had their property and their storage areas just taken away. And then they're evicted , you know. It's unfair legal practice . And in New York State Court Family Court how it worked, I understand the criminal record when I see it. But I'm running to be on the Board of Commissioners for Scranton Housing so maybe I could read things better from the inside and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 then there's the Right To Know to try to put together who is actually running the show because -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Little. MR. LITTLE: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton , homeowner . I have a question myself. Why when somebody else gets their eyes on the -- something we have, it's always given away. And I'm not accusing the Mayor or anybody else. I read an article today (unintelligible ) dumps water to the sewer -- I saved this from about a month ago. Now that is leachate water. And years ago there was a scandal about battery casings from Gould Battery and Marjol Battery being buried there. People threw televisions away. We can't do it anymore. But it was done for years. And time and time again, I mean, we even have (unintelligible .) But the point being that that should continue to be shipped to the land -- or the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 sewer plant. And I'm not interested in their water and that is flowing into a tributary of the gorge. So any pollutants that flow out of there are going into the Nay Aug gorge and the creek. And that's a national landmark . So I'm sorry, Mr. DeNaples , but that's not right. That's not right at all. We don't need this. And I hope that Council is totally adamant and militarized practically to the point where we don't want any more. And 200,000 gallons a day is liable to turn into 600,000 gallons or a million gallons a day. That is going to go up by 300 percent . And it was mentioned on security , I think we should have a policeman present and a front door -- at the front door and include the elevator because when these things happen, somebody -- some crazy ya ya decides that he's going to take revenge on somebody , it's too late. It's too late. It could easily be done. I have a little bit more of a plan in my mind but I'm starting to run low on time. COVID, I dealt with two times this summer. People are not getting vaccinate d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 because they think there's microchips in the syringe . And, you know, you got a cell phone in your pocket. And they know where you're at if they want to. I saw that Snowden, like a document ary on him. He's the guy that ran to Russia -- fled to Russia over all of these -- if you have an iPhone, they could turn that camera on. They would record while you're sitting there at a kitchen table. At a party this summer, disgruntled vet and he was talking about all kinds of baloney , you know, and playing with his iPhone. It's like -- it's like having big brother sitting right next to you, you know? So unless you remove the battery out of that and, I mean, talk about stupid, you know. And once again, I was kind of mixed on this. I wore my (inaudible ) shirt for the Trump appointees to the Courts. And you have all of these little skeletons here. And, I mean, it's just a -- I wasn't going to do it until the decision yesterday that stopped the investigation on compartmentalized top secret information and packets in his possession at Mar-A-Lago and who knows where the contents of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 those packets are. Maybe he just took the packets, I don't know. But it's really getting to the point where I agree with our President , you know, democracy is in trouble . Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . That exhausts the sign-in sheet this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I was really disappoint ed when I came in here tonight . I thought we were going to have decent acoustics when you came back from recess but, no. And it would have made the unannounced start of your meeting being that caucus, I would have liked to have heard what was said. But you can't. All you could do is sit back there and twiddle your thumbs because you just can't hear. You really have to do something or at least let us know when you're having a caucus like that. It should be -- MR. DONAHUE : We have a public caucus every week. And that's advertised at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 the beginning of the year. They start at 5:45. MS. SCHUMACHER : 5:45. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : But the meeting on your agenda is 6:30. That is your thing, whether you come or not. Anyway, no more time. I want to again as well thank the committee that put on the LaFesta . They did a wonderful job and the entertainment was simply amazing . I hope people come out even more next year. But I do want to thank them. Now, I did a Right To Know to the county in -- on the exempt properties . We're at 38 percent , people. It is time. It is beyond time where you have to decide to do a HUP test. I took it to the county. And the county said that's a Scranton thing. The City should do it. So I really think you need to take that under consideration . Again -- oh, and I was really disappointed . I -- on the first of July there was a bid submitted for the East Mountain stormwater and drainage study. And I certainly thought it would be on tonight 's agenda. I don't know how can you take two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 months to select a contract ? There was three bids, one of which I think should have been disregarded . But, you know, why? Mr. Donahue , you said we have to have that to get going -- light a fire under somebody . This is crazy. MR. DONAHUE : I'm expecting that either this week or next week that legislation . MS. SCHUMACHER : I expected it before that. Let's see. And 5-I, I have a problem with that. I think that is very disrespectful to people in the City. That's again asking for -- I mean, if you can't find the fiscal coordinator within the City, I mean, that is -- that's a slap in the face as far as I'm concerned . And when are we going to get 8-A back on? What's holding that up? MR. DONAHUE : We are -- MS. SCHUMACHER : You can answer it in five if you can because it's -- I've got a lot other stuff that I've been holding . Well, the leachate . I agree. I don't think that that should be in our water. And I was glad that the Mayor and you all got involved . But to me what you did was say, okay, we tried. We went to the Governor and, you know, we couldn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 do anything . But I think this is totally crazy. And I think perhaps that's all. And my time is pretty much up anyway. Good lord willing , we'll see you next week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Before recess a couple sessions beforehand I asked on the police who are under suspension or under administrative leave for driving under the influence . Originally they had just been put on suspension because the blood alcohol had not come back. I know it has since then and it has gone through the courts. And after that there was a question that came before this body. I brought up the question of how many of the total police and firemen in this City are on administrative leave or under suspension at this point, just a number. I'm not even concerned of what they've done in particular , just a number of how many police officers we supposedly have and how many fire department personnel we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 suppose d to have out there on the books but actually aren't because they're on administrative leave for their activities . I know there was a DUI. And we have a police officer recently reported to allegedly theft by fraud by billing for time through I believe federal funds for a job that he did not perform . And we recently had a fireman who was liberating tools from a hardware store up in Dickson City. They're all concerning as public citizens . And there was also question on whether or not these personnel who might be in jail for the time whether or not they were being paid using paid time off, leave, whatever they have. There comes a question of once they are convicted they have violated their Oath of Office. They should no longer get pay. They should be gone and they should not be protected by the union. The Oath of Office is what binds them to that job. Once they have violated that oath, they should be severed from it and there is no response . You violated the oath of office. You are no longer eligible , period.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 I'd taken a look at the zoning ordinance shifting to that. I looked at what was changing . I looked at the details of it. I looked at the fact that it's based on percentage of population according to the documentation . So the cost out of the nine separate municipalities , Scranton foots 70 percent of the entire bill. Some areas such -- since it's done by populations such as West Abington will foot 0.2 percent of the entire bill. That's billed right into that multi-assessment for the nine municipal ities. I looked at what was being changed in it. And over this break I realized I was being bamboozled . I looked at something and I started analyzing it. And I forgot the biggest thing of all. We looked at the City charter , the Home Rule Charter and it's been 50 years. And we say it's good as it is. We don't need to go back and review it. But this zoning ordinance has been in place for 12 years, I believe . Why -- MR. DONAHUE : It's almost 30. MR. COYNE: Okay, 30 years.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. DONAHUE : 92-93. MR. COYNE: Okay. Why do we need to change it? What is deficient in the zoning that is currently in operation that we need to actually change the zoning? I don't see anything in the old zoning that cannot be fixed by amendment that we need an entire new zoning regiment . I see some things such as the hospital zoning being put in place so that unlike other things that come before the zoning board when they ask for a variance , it gets struck down by the community . By having zoning changed for the hospital beforehand it liberates the hospital near Nay Aug Park from having to come for a variance and have the citizens be able to protest . I see certain areas that should be residential put to business . I see personal hands in it. But the main question is, why do we need this? What is deficient in what is out there that requires this change? Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just one. I was contacted by a citizen who utilizes the pool over at Weston Field, the indoor pool. And apparently people pay a fee to be a member over there. And there is like adult swimming that goes on. It's supposed to be Monday through Friday, 8:30 to 9:30 lap swimming. And these are adults, 9:30 to 10:30 it's like an exercise rehab type thing that goes on. But apparently in over the last month or so -- I'm sure it may have a lot to do with student s going back to college or kids going back to high school. I think the excuse was given that there is no available lifeguards. But they have been cancelling , like, first they took away Tuesday and Thursday , then they took away a Monday. And, you know, it's been scaled way back over the past few weeks. And they are cancelling a lot. So this individual , you know, lives in the City, taxpayer . They utilize it quite a bit for exercise . And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 don't think that we're fulfilling , you know, our obligation to the citizens when we're not providing lifeguards and being able to provide the service which actually they're paying for. So I don't know, I'd like to ask, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could just send something over to Parks and Rec to get an idea as to what's going on as to why this is being cancelled . And once again, are these people -- will they be reimburse d or will there be time made available to make up for these that were missed and all the person really wants to do is to be able to have to exercise . It's a retired individual . And it's not just one. The person is speaking only on their behalf but had indicated it's affecting a lot people. So if you could look into that I would greatly appreciate it. I've sent you a number of individual concerns of citizens throughout the City have contact ed me about. And I appreciate that you're forwarding those to the appropriate departments and following up on them. So I want to thank you because sometimes people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 think, you know, we're away in August, but we're away from meeting s. But we're not away from meeting with citizen s and talking on the phone with them about concerns or answering e-mails. So I appreciate your quick attention to all of those concerns and quick responses . So thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, Mr. King. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few for tonight . Thank you, Frank, for all the correspondence that you help us with and all the coordination to repeat Mr. King. And also to, you know, mirror Mr. King with Weston Park, twice tonight I heard of wellness programs , ARPA money for wellness programs , things like that. The situation at Weston Field, this is a wellness program . I know that people take their time at Weston Field seriously from the kids swim at 7:00. I don't know if it's still at 7:00. But I utilize d that at one point in time. And I noticed that the people that came to those, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 whether it be lap aerobics , things like this, they took it pretty seriously . And they took the time there seriously . So this is something that I don't think we're being -- that's being provided for our taxpayers . I hope to see the answer for that request there. I'm going to have a couple request s tonight , Frank. So prior to the break, we discussed street signs. And I know that we got a grant at one point in time for street signs. I know we received the money for that grant. They had to roll out an article in the paper and maybe a news story about street signs were going out. But it was just a grant and it was just for so many signs. So can we please send correspondence to the administration and to DPW? Now, the only response I got back from when I asked this question in public last time was a DPW worker told me that DPW was not involved with that project . It was outsourced to another company . So can we get an update on street signs if there's a timeline to work on some more street signs? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's number one. During the meeting I forward ed you an e-mail about Keyser Valley storm drain and cleaning . So I forward ed that over. One of the residents up there sent an e-mail with picture s. He did send it to I think myself and Mr. West. I forward ed it to you. But if you could follow up on that, please. Keyser Valley Community Center, there was line items put in the budget for them. They have contact ed me several times. I put in e-mails to the administration . I have not got a response yet. I started working on that in probably December of 21 and really this community center hasn't received any of the funding that was allocated for them. Next, it was brought up in public comment by more than one person tonight the restrict ed access to the building . It's something I brought up before. I don't think it's right. When the Mayor was here, she express ed that that's the way it's going to be and that's the way it's going to stay. So I don't know if you heard that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 that night that she was here, but that's what she said. I asked if it was due to COVID. I felt it was due to COVID. But at this point in time it doesn't seem to be the case. And I think the response was it's security . So I don't think this is appropriate . I have gotten many phones call from people that come into the building , many people that call these numbers that are in the lobby and they don't get an answer. They get a voicemail or a full voicemail . So can we please send correspondence over to the Mayor as to what the plan is going to be for citizen access to this building ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Let's see what's next. Also, while we're sending that over, outside groups that pop up in the City that want to work in our community or want to have joint project s with the City, could we please ask the Mayor and the administration what is our process for vetting these groups? Early on our time off here which I kind of wish we didn't have time off, I wish we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 continued to work through the month. I got several calls about a group that has been working with City that doesn't seem to be properly vetted. Some of the members of the group have criminal records , one of the members of the group has an active fentanyl arrest. So I would just like to know what is the City's process for vetting these outside groups that they collaborate with the City. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, Mr. Coyne's question the number of employees , we can we also send that over to the administrations what is -- not names, just the number of employees by department that are on administrative leave or have been suspended . Also, I think Mr. Donahue is going to touch on it, Miss Fraus brought up tonight the Chick Feldman Field. While we're sending over those request s, can we find out do we have an agreement with Lackawanna College ? I know the school district has an agreement for games but not practice s. So do we have an agreement with them? This might be a question for Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Donahue . At the shared service committee meeting was the HUP test brought up that was on the agenda? MR. DONAHUE : There was. I'm going touch on that tonight . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. So that was something -- the HUP test was brought up at the shared service committee meeting. It was put on the agenda. And it was discussed . I haven't gotten an update yet. But it was discussed at that meeting . Let me see if there is anything else I have. The decks -- one thing I didn't touch on with the capital budget -- I think it was included in the capital budget was the decks on the Davis trail. I felt like in the past I was contact ed that supplies were donated to the City to replace the decks on the Davis trail. Can we please find out if that is still something that -- has that material been donated to us or do we plan on working on that because it was a surprise to see that it was in the capital budget. I thought it was something that the City was already working on. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And just to clarify , we also discussed the FEMA extension . As was stated tonight , that emergency happened in 2018. That is five years. The City did go to FEMA or PEMA to get an extension . That was also stated tonight . I don't think it was stated clearly . But the City hasn't worked on any of those project s for the last several years. And they were granted an extension . I'm glad to see we were granted an extension . But I hope there is a priority put on this and these project s start. That's all for tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few quick ones. I just want to provide an update. I have been in more frequent communication with Geisinger over the past month as well as the neighbors in the Hill who have concerns about a Geisinger expansion . I had a great meeting with those neighbors as well. And so Geisinger has been developing drafts to show the neighbors which I thought 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 had been in development earlier this year when we had spoken about it. But now that does seem to be occurring . And I was told that by the end of this week they should have something to show to Council . There was something I'd already been shown. But it was really just something very early but at least gave an idea as to what they were thinking which was good to have some more of that insight . And then they plan on setting up some stakeholder meeting s with the neighbors and interested parties , which I think will be helpful because I think they need to hear what the concerns are from the neighbors . I've heard many of them. And I'm sure they'll be coming to Council to express those concerns too. But that way they could have some further conversations about it and then be able to present their ideas and their draft plans to see if it's something that would work for the neighborhood . So that's the update that I have there. There were a few properties that I just wanted to check in on with Mr. Voldenberg . Some of them I don't have the exact numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 for. But I know that we've talked about them before. I know that you already have them. There was a request for a potential paving of the 600 block of North Webster Avenue, the other lower numbers -- numbered blocks on North Webster have been done over the summer but not the 600 block. And I had driven up there the other day, still not in great condition . So I wanted to see if that could be on a paving list in the future. There was also a property listed for demo but not on the first list. So I wanted to see if it's on the next list that's located on the 600 block of Prescott that's in really bad shape. And then another issue with Prescott , an ongoing issue since -- I think the fire was back in March, February -March had taken place in the 400 block of Prescott Avenue, the rental property that's close to the old bingo hall there. And there were a number of concerns with debris and liter outside . I think that's been taken care of. But from one of the storms a few months ago, a very large hole had opened up in the sidewalk . And that was going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 on the responsibility of the property owner or manager . But that has not been taken care. And one of the neighbor s has been in contact with me and complaining that the hole is getting larger and opening up. And I know they have been fearful to even park near it and what might happen to the property that's adjacent to it. So that's something that really needs to be taken care of. And I'd like some more answers from Code Enforcement as to what we're doing about it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask them tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And there are two other properties that I know that there have been complaint s about previously . And I'm not sure if they're going to the magistrate and what the status of them are. Those are both on Harrison . And they are, like, on opposing sides of Harrison . One is on the odd side next to 631 Harrison . And that is an empty vacant lot that's overgrown. And the neighbors are having issues with skunks and other animals that are dwelling within the overgrown greenery there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 And they have been having to pay for traps for the skunks and animals also on a weekly basis they've been telling me. And so I think it would be important to get that vacant lot cleaned up. It's not really fair to the neighbors there. And across the street ongoing for years, never touched , the sidewalk is not useable . A while back I think the gentleman has moved. But he lived across the street on the odd side of Harrison and complained that people were frequently crossing the street because they couldn't use the sidewalk on that side because of another overgrown vacant lot that I've brought forward many, many times. And that's next to Harrison House on the 600 block as well. So all these I know we've talked about before, but I really want to check back in on and see what their status is and try to get them resolved . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up on them, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thanks very much. I think that is all I have for tonight. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a few. So Mr. King brought up a concern -- I'm not sure if it's the same person. So when I spoke to this lady I said I would share her concerns with it in Fifth Order and I will. So this is the Weston Field swimming pool -- the indoor swimming pool. And, you know, on the website it says it's a full service community facility , right? Memberships . So this concerned resident and, you know, taxpayer and a paying member of Weston Field swimming class program has brought valid concern s to me about the days that the pool is available to her and other residents that pay to use this program as part of therapy and exercise . The resident stated that recently the pool went from being open five days a week to three days a week and then now like one day a week without any notification . So, you know, I brought up some concerns to Parks and Rec, you know, probably before recess asking about the rules being changed. And, you know, we were advised by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the Parks Director that she said -- she was urgent that we should or strongly recommend that we look at the City website and, you know, because obviously we're missing some stuff. So these concerned residents were never notified , right? Most of them live in the City. Most of them are elderly. Most of them are rehabbing from either knee replacement s and they are making progress . Their doctors are happy because of this. And I guess, you know, I get the fact -- and this resident said she gets the fact that, you know, lifeguards being student s that are going back to school is an issue. But that should have been part of the thought process early on because they have memberships . And so I did take a look at the website , nothing stating any changes in the hours of operation from going from five days to one day. I also looked at the social media page just in case, nothing there to inform the resident s or people with membership s that, you know, that they're no longer providing a service that they paid for. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please send correspondence on behalf of this concerned resident to the Director of Parks and Rec just to see what's the plan moving forward ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And some people paid for the year. It's unfortunate if this service isn't being provided . Next, I just want to touch base or, you know, agree with Mr. Schuster -- Councilman Schuster about the restrict ed access. I received more complaints about no one returning phone calls, voicemails being full, and an incident that, you know, with animal control . A concerned resident called me about it that, you know, she tried to get ahold of animal control . She didn't really get satisfied . There's an issue with her cat and a stray cat on the porch that's constantly spraying . So she decided, you know what, you know, she's not one that always complain s. She's lived here her whole life. So she came down to City Hall. She couldn't even get in the building or past the vestibule . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 she said the people that she did talk to were very nice at the office there. But the reason why she came down because every department she called, the voicemail was full. And she couldn't even leave a message . And ones that she did, no one would call her back. So she inquired and said is there anybody I could talk to in the building ? I'll talk to anybody . And they said, you know, some people still work at home. The Mayor -- she wanted to see the Mayor. She wasn't in. She wanted to see the representative from the Mayor's office. They weren't in. So, you know, the restriction of getting in the building is one thing, but not even being able to communicate with a department or leave a message is just as bad. It's kind of like we're not even open or exist. So I agree with Mr. Schuster , send some correspondence . Let's try to get this fixed. All right. All right. So as a teacher having gone back to school last week the question of what did you do over the speaker arises. Right? You always say what did you do on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 summer vacation . Teacher s talk about it. Student s talk about it. So what did I do over Council vacation ? Well, I begged administration through our solicitor , Mr. Gallagher for transparency , answers, and updates regarding power washer investigation . And something that also came up to us that was present ed to us in an e-mail from City Controller about the former DPW Director who resigned on June 11 is still getting paid with benefits . So this is some kind of unprecedence severance feel with no past practice . So the employee being investigated for the power washer sat home from 9 to 10 weeks getting paid. The former DPW Director has been sitting home receiving pay and benefits since June 11th. And, of course, labor Council is also getting paid associated with these two concerns with e-mails back and forth and discussion . So as when I type this up, one of them has been rectified . All I could say is that the power washer investigation is over with. But I'm not privy because it was explained in executive session the outcome . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 That is something that I believe the public should know. All right? So all of these people that sat home all summer, guess who was footing the bill for all of this? All of you, the taxpayers . So with that said, I wanted to update all of you because it was a concern . I brought it up in June. So the answers that you probably still seek officially will have to come from the Mayor's office. And, you know, in addition to that, the DPW thing -- director thing, there is still not one posted. We're without a DPW Director . We had a supervisor that was on administrative leave. And it's still not posted. So we need to ask why there's not even looking to replace that position . It's a very important position . Also, earlier in the summer I went to visit some residents about multiple paving issues and sent some correspondence to OECD. I brought these up in public. Some streets were half paved, some were quarter paved, some were paved up the middle, right? So, you know, these concerned citizen s were very concerned . They walk out their door every day and see this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 which is beyond belief. So and, you know, we were told, you know, utilities are suppose d to pave curb to curb. Well, they're not. And then they're saying they don't have to. So, you know, there's some discussion there. So what I said was and I contact ed OECD as to why the streets were not fully paved by the utility company curb to curb and if the City could use some ARPA money like some cities across the Commonwealth are. The answer that I received is that money would have to come out of the revenue loss component of the ARPA funds, okay. But they didn't say that they would put some of the money to do so. So the affected residents have created a petition request ing some help from the City to rectify the situation . Like I stated when I first brought forth these concern s, that we should be working with our resident s and not against them. So with that said, I'll be happy to sign this petition as to show of my support for these residents . I will leave it here after the meeting so if anybody else here or any other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 fellow Council members would like to sign it or do the same, it will be available. And then when that's done, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please put it in Third Order for next week and then send a copy over to administration ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. The petition 's right here. I'm going to sign it to show my support for these residents . I'll just leave it here if anybody would care to do so after the meeting . Okay, next, so I need some clarification . And it's just -- maybe it's something that we're missing . But, you know, the work that's been going on over on 1717 Wyoming Avenue and Ryerson Avenue, a concerned resident reached out to me wanting to know if permits were pulled for the work. I don't know they were issued. They were probably issued but they're not visible . I don't know if that's an issue with the City, but some of the work has been done at 1717 Wyoming Avenue and 1725 Ryerson . Work has been taking place for three months at 1717 Wyoming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 and work trucks are now at 1725 Ryerson Avenue with no signs of permits. This was stated by the resident . So I would like some clarification . Can you reach out, Mr. Voldenberg , please to Code Enforcement and Mr. King seeking answers to these questions ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. All right. I also received something earlier -- on the way here actually that was brought to my attention . So I said I would definitely bring it up. So the following pertain to 1800 Clearview Street. The residents are operating a food truck out of this address . I referred this to -- 311 e-mail address . It was told they are in compliance with zoning. I believe this area is zoned R1A. This is a new business operating without a variance . Every Tuesday the business puts out its trash which is picked up by the City refuse truck. It appears they back the food truck between the houses and transfer food from a shed which was condemned after a fire or the house to the food truck. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 If the City has a health department , it should be investigated . Trash is frequently stacked outside the shed. This truck also parks on Mulberry Street by the Geisinger CMC parking garage during the day with a generator protruding into the street. This is a metered area. Any help you could give me will be appreciate d by the residents of Clearview Street. I've spoke with residents -- I'm sorry, the neighbors and we are not content to having this operation here. So I find a ton of food safety violations here. I'm not even going to go into all of them. But could you please send correspondence -- I will forward -- you have a copy of this e-mail, I think. MR. VOLDENBERG : I do. MR. MCANDREW : Please send correspondence to the proper department s because , you know, this sounds like somebody could get very sick from, you know -- not MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : -- maintaining time and temperature so it looks a little scary, so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 please take care of that. And then I got one more that I got on my phone and this is a gentleman who comes here all the time. I apologize I wasn't able to print it out because I just got it when I got here. But this is from a gentleman that is here all the time. This is from Derek Raines. So he's still having the same issues with the drainage near his house and the driveway . This morning the bus could not let me off close enough to my driveway due to the water that is there. So I had to drive down the street to the end of the block where there's also a big hole at the corner that has been there for a long time. And I know he brought that up. I had DPW come out and I was assured that they would do something about this and nothing has happened . Now as the winter begins, it will be very difficult for me to get in and out of my driveway with the electric power chair. This has been a problem for many years which began when the water company purchased the Sewer Authority and took out storm drain access across the street from my driveway . Now the water just runs down my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 driveway to the backyard . So could you please take another look at this? I know I brought this up and someone else did a couple of times. There's pictures that I think I have or the old ones, but it's clearly a problem that hasn't been fixed yet. We should take care of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , you have one more? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to ask for your assistance once again. Could we reach out to the Mayor, Larry West, and also possibly the Parks and Rec Director to see if they could provide us with what our relation ship is with the neighbor hood associations ? I brought up earlier about the Keyser Valley Neighborhood Association . They help with the community center there. Tripp Park has a community center. I know we've had some issues with the East Mountain residents at the park at East Mountain . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 And then I did get some phone calls this weekend about Pretzel Park in Green Ridge. Could we define our relationship with the neighborhood associations and how the City and the administration works with them? I know that residents in Green Ridge were a little upset about the vegetation brushes -- shrubs being removed from Pretzel Park. And I think they would have liked some input on it. But if we could just maybe have the administration define what our relationship is with those associations . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. So as we return from our recess, I agree with Mark I don't think that just because we go on a recess doesn't mean we go on vacation for the month. We still field citizens ' concerns . I still have my weekly meeting s with the Mayor. Every week we were on recess except for one because she was on vacation . We've had multiple shared service s committee meetings and/or subcommittee meetings 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 and we're actually making some progress which I will touch on in a minute. Pushing Geisinger to, you know, show the neighbors what is in their plan in terms of the new zoning, that is just to name a few. And I know we are still working on the sound system. We've done our measurements . We've -- a bid should be going out in the next couple weeks or a request for bids in terms of fixing the sound in here. And we're going to pair that up with also the sound in the Governor 's room because then we have the control panel back there. Again, we never got anything in return from the previous gentleman we used in terms of splitting it up. And the price he gave us was over the bidding threshold . So we couldn't just award him that work. We asked him to split it up to see if he could split it up, try to expedite the process but we never received anything in return. In terms of advertising , we always advertise our public caucuses . Our public caucuses start at 5:45. I don't know if I'm correct or not, but we do have a public hearing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 on the capital budget which will be advertised this week and which will be held the 20th of September in two weeks. So we do advertise for the public hearing . But our advertising requirements are, you know, we always have a public caucus at 5:45. In terms of public access to the building , I do agree that the public should access the building . I just think we need to figure out a way where that is financially feasible and then pair that with security in the building so if you go to the county Government Center, there is one entrance for the public and then there is a security station and then you move in. When you go to the courthouse , there is one entrance , a security station , then you move in. The federal building you could walk into the post office part of it, but then to get anywhere else in the building you have to go through a security checkpoint . The difficulty we have here is trying to figure out ADA access. Because if we were to put a security checkpoint at the front of the building and we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 would have two different access points with two different security which doubles the cost in terms of. But I agree that we should have that. We just need to figure out a financially feasible way to get that done. It would -- from some of the estimates I've heard in terms of what it would cost to put an ADA accessible ramp in the front of this building , I mean, we could fix three of these towers before we put a ramp there. You know, so I agree the public should have access to the building . But I do agree there are some security -- not concerns but there should be a security checkpoint you have to move through to access the building . I know Mr. Schuster brought up the Davis trail. So I think it -- what was it Azek, they donated the materials , Carpenters Union has donated labor to install those materials . But there are still some more under -- some subsurface work that needs to be done to make sure that that is still propped up. And I think that's where that -- I just don't have my notes from that meeting -- from the meeting I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 was in in terms of the additional work that needs to done on the Davis trail with the decks. But I will get back to -- I will mention that next week. In terms of Lackawanna 's use of Chick Feldman Field, we should be getting an agreement with Lackawanna . A little back story here, back in June the school district basically said that Lackawanna College can't use our facilities anymore. They came back and allowed them to use the -- because they used to practice -- both practice and play games at Memorial Stadium . They wouldn't practice on the field but they would practice on that far end of Memorial Stadium where there was grass. They would practice there. They would do it at night. The school district said they can't do it. We have a good partnership with Lackawanna College in terms of the community overall . Also, they are one of the premiere basically junior college programs in the country . So a short-term solution for this year until we figure out a long-term solution is to allow them to use Chick Feldman Field to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 practice and then the school district allow them to -- but we should be getting that memorandum of understanding that we have with Lackawanna College in the next couple weeks. I hit on the sound system. In terms of the HUP test, I'm hopeful that, you know, we're working out some legal shared service s with the school district . I know Miss Schumacher 's brought up sending representation to assessment appeals. So I think we're working on a way to split up those duties where the City might take on delinquent property taxes where -- and then the school district would -- to represent both bodies since we both have the same interest there. And we, you know, after we get that situated , it's moving into how do we separate out the cost of a HUP test because it's not -- it's basically something we would have to put out and a law firm would have to take on that task for us. But, I mean, in terms -- I know we've been talking about this for the five years I've been on Council . I actually do feel like it is on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 verge of actually happening and not just an idea to keep on talking about. In terms of Council 's and the Mayor's letter on the landfill putting in leachate , I disagree that it's just a way of saying we did something . I just think that this is a first step in this process . There's still public comment periods that the DEP will be holding that I'm sure a lot of us will be participating in when those happen to provide public comment . I don't know exactly when they are. But I know that that was a part of the article in this morning 's paper. I believe that, you know, everyone up here and even the Mayor both ran on -- both campaigned on being against the landfill expansion in any way. I don't think we're just going to let them just do whatever they want. I think, you know, we're going to do what we can on a local level to express our opinion s there. In terms of 8-A with the zoning, we have -- when will it be brought back? First off, I'm hopeful to have it brought back in October at some point. We've given Geisinger more than enough time to reach 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 out to the neighbors . That is basically the only issue that is still left outstanding . I know Mr. King is working on detailing the changes that were made from the original draft to an amended draft. And we want to be able to put those out in time for people to review before we hold another public hearing which we will hold on any changes , you know, so people could address -- any citizens can address any changes that are made to that zoning -- to the zoning ordinance . Even though we're technically not -- we've technically met our legal requirement on a public hearing , we will hold another one before it comes up on a public vote -- or on vote so that the public has a chance to comment on any of those changes . In terms of why we're doing a new zoning ordinance , one, I know Mr. Coyne brought up variances . But granting variances isn't a sound way of land planning . And so we need to update and modernize the terms in our zoning ordinance . For example , there weren't cell towers all over the City in 1992 when the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 one was passed. There wasn't airbnbs . The list could go on there. And also some -- and I believe that the regional ization part of it is a good benefit of this plan. It's because do we give some outside communities some cover in terms of the land use? Yes, we do. But there is also communities that give us cover because under current law, if we weren't to regional ize our zoning ordinance , we would have to designate a zone in the City to be a landfill . You know, so do we give cover on some of the heavy industry that we have on Keyser Avenue? Yes, we do. But at the same time we're also not require d to create our own landfill . So, I mean, those are just a couple of the reasons why a new zoning ordinance is necessary . Variances should be given if you're changing , you know, for a foot or two here, a foot or two there in terms of setbacks , egress, you know, those sort of things. Variance s shouldn 't be, you know, okay, you're going to build a 100 foot building or a 50 foot building on something that's only zoned for 25 feet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 I don't think that's a proper way of land planning . And I believe that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – APPROVING AND ACCEPTING THE CITY OF SCRANTON CAPITAL BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2023 PURSUANT TO SECTION 904 OF THE CITY’S HOME RULE CHARTER . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , we discuss ed in caucus about this pretty much being a wish list. So I don't agree with everything in the capital budget. So I'm voting yes to move this legislation forward . But like I said during caucus, I don't agree with spending 1.8 million dollars to buy a building probably next door. And I used an analogy is like you don't buy a second home when you could barely pay for the first home, especially exiting Act 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 47. And you don't buy a property right next door that is going to be taken off the tax rolls. So like I said, I will vote to push this through or move the capital budget itself to a final vote. But when this comes around again in another form in a general budget, I will be totally against this purchase . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I'd like to reiterate what Mr. McAndrew said about City Hall expansion . I do not agree with buying another property for the City unless it's clearly justified to us. In public comment tonight , a discussion was -- a topic was brought up about what we did during COVID working from home, things like that. I think in areas such as that, COVID brought on some, you know, some areas we wouldn't have thought of before. But, I mean, is there a possibility to work from home if we're going to do work on this building ? I think at this current point in time some of the staff in this building are working from home. Electric vehicles , I said it since 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 the start. The price here, it's a $75,000 grant, plus $213,000 of ARP money. If you are doing the math on that, it's $20,000, $21,000 per car. These vehicle s do not cost $21,000 per car. So, I mean, I've seen a lot of things on the electric vehicles where the electricity comes from. I think it's a headache that the City doesn't need at this point in time. And it hasn't been properly cost out. And I think this is something that I have stated several times. If we're not properly justifying some of these things, I'm not going be to in agreement with it. At this point in time I'm 100 percent against electric vehicle -- an electric vehicle fleet for the City even though I do understand there is some funding out there. One more thing with this as well and I'm going to come back to Mr. Voldenberg . Mr. Voldenberg , in this capital budget there was -- one of the items that it was stated under was the special service support vehicle . And with the little blurb about that vehicle it stated that a committee finalized this report. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 Can we find out if a committee worked on the capital budget and who the members of the committee were? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? Just in terms of the capital budget, I think there are a lot of good investments in here, especially to our police and fire. The one thing I wasn't too thrilled to see was the Engine 10 building feasibility study, not necessarily doing the feasibility study but just the way that some of the wording was there. I know looking back at, you know, some history of the Engine 10, this building being on East Mountain and when it was browned out a couple of years -- over a decade ago, there was a fire on East Mountain and the response time was severely delayed . So and I know in here it does say that 75 percent of Engine 10's responses are west below Interstate 81. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 But I know just speaking personally , I don't care what the feasibility study says. I would never be in support of moving Engine 10 off East Mountain -- in general . It has to be on the mountain where they could respond to the mountain . West Mountain has good response times from the station on Luzerne Street. Minooka has good response s from Engine 4. The north side has good responses from Truck 4. So I think that we are situated in terms of our firehouses pretty well. But I would never be in support of moving any -- the Engine 10 building off East Mountain . MR. KING: I agree. MR. DONAHUE : And just in terms of City Hall operations , expansion , I'm definitely in favor of a study to see what we need and what, you know, what we have, what we need moving forward . In terms of, you know, in terms of an expansion , you know, I think if we could rectify maybe some of our security and ADA concerns for 1.8 instead of spending 1 point or a million , 1.2 just to make this building ADA compliant I think that's something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 that needs to be part of the conversation . But I will always hold the opinion that this building should be City Hall. It should be the main City Hall. This building belongs to the people of this City. And it should stay that way.

VOLDENBERG : 5-I. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR MELISSA A. SADDLEMIRE IN HER CAPACITY AS FISCAL COORDINATOR OF THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 entertain a motion that Item 5-I be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so first of all, I consistently vote against residency waivers because of not being fair and equitable with all the other City employees . In a city of 70,000 I still believe we have qualified residents to do these type of jobs. Secondly , these ARPA position s are temporary and are exhausted at the end of the ARPA fund distribution . These position s should have been ones of private contractors without benefits . When a person is appoint ed and a residence waiver is requested , it looks to me like that this person appoint ed looks to be more of a permanent and will remain either around a lot longer or be in a future budget with legacy. So for them reasons I'm voting no. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I'm going to be voting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 yes on this this evening . But I would like -- I'm noticing that I'm not seeing a resume for this individual . So that is something I would like to see prior to any further vote moving forward . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree. I was curious too because I think the reason behind the residency waiver was because of this candidate 's qualifications over the other candidate s that were interview ed. So I wanted to know what those qualifications were and what put Miss Saddlemire above the other candidates to help me with my decision . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : And, Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask if any other candidate s were interviewed ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you ask how many applied and how many were interview ed, if you could. Thank you. And then a copy of the resume. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm sorry, I thought in the backup that it said eight interview s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 were conduct ed. MR. DONAHUE : I forget if it said eight interviews or eight -- DR. ROTHCHILD : It says eight interviews were conducted . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. I just didn't know if it was eight interviews or eight people applied . MR. MCANDREW : While we're asking, can you find out how many lived in Scranton or live in Scranton I should say. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. DONAHUE : So I'll vote tonight to introduce this legislation . But I will be interested to see the response to the question s that were posed before I decide whether or not to approve this -- to vote yes on this or not. Anyone else on the question ?
