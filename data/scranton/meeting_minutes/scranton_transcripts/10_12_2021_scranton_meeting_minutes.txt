GAUGHAN : Anyone else? Any comments ? Thank you. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have one. This weekend on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. instead of the Green Ridge Fall Festival that they usually do which was on hold last year due to the pandemic , they're also are not doing it this year. But instead , they are doing a sidewalk sale over at the Green Ridge corners for some of the businesses that are there. So it might be good to take a trip down there this weekend and see what you can get. And that's all that I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. First speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton resident . I want to remind everybody what I said last week, the Albright Memorial library in conjunction with the Red Cross will be hosting a blood drive on Monday, October 18th from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It will be at the Albright Memorial Library , 300 Vine Street. You need to register for an appointment . Please call Jessica Serrenti , 570-348-3000, extension 3023 or e-mail her at JSERRENTI at Albright.org or you can call the Red Cross at 1-800 Red Cross. And if you go there, you could get a free Halloween T-shirt while supplies last. And speaking of October 18th, that is the last day to register to vote in the general election on November 2nd. And if you have not yet registered to vote, you could do that while you are giving blood simultaneously at the library .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 So October 18th is the last day to register to vote. And with your third arm while you're at the library , you can also fill out a technical survey. What we're trying to do is gather what do our patrons , our community that we serve want in terms of digital and technical services so that we keep up-to-date on the technical world as it changes and can provide those services to the general public who may have no other access. So please keep that in mind. Okay. Today is October 12th. Do you know where your 2020 audit is? MR. DONAHUE : So the update I got today was that we're waiting for the audits from the Sewer Authority and from the Redevelopment Authority that have to be attached to that audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And I checked the City's website , no change to the documents posted for Firefighters ' Collective Bargaining Agreement . So that still has a gap. MR. DONAHUE : That was also brought up again. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 like especially in Fifth Order if you could please explain what are the advantages of Scranton becoming a 3-A city vice a 2-A city? And what does that mean in terms of Scranton as a taxing authority ? Does it matter? I know that we can't be a 2-A city if we don't have the population . But what will happen when we change classifications if we go down to 3-A? And how does that affect Scranton as a taxing authority ? And finally , in one of the documents in the backup was the distribution of the Single Tax Office funds, the revenue on October 4th. There were two documents so-to-speak. There was a chart which said that you got one million sixty-two thousand five hundred ninety-one dollars and 24 cents. Then there was a photocopy of a check for $810,241.83. Where did the difference go? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Mr. Voldenberg , I noticed that as well. If you could get in touch with Mr. Fox, the tax collector and inquire about that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I had an opportunity to watch the meeting last week and the Home Rule Charter came up. I think the residents of Scranton have to realize that that's the most important piece of legislation that could come into this Council and change the direction of this City from the decline it's in at this point. It has very wide range and ramification s for the resident s. And, you know, I just want to read this. This is preliminary objections in a court room. And it says: Respect fully, the Honorable Court has no jurisdiction for authority to enjoin a lawful ordinance adopted by the City of Scranton pursuant to the authority under the Home Rule Charter . The charter has a lot of ramifications for all the resident s of this City. It's been doing very detrimental 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 things to this City for a very long time. And when you have Council members up here who say that they support a strong mayor form of government or that they don't support review by the residents of the Home Rule Charter , let's not forget that the residents of this City voted the Home Rule Charter in. And you have to ask yourself in a representative republic that we were before Joe Biden was elected , do the residents and do the citizens of this country have a right to pick their government ? Now when you look at the City of Scranton it's done it already by creating the Home Rule Charter . And what the Council members here are saying is that they just want to maintain the government the way it is. And I really don't blame them because it's so twisted that it offers no benefit to the residents . And that's why our population base has been dropping for probably almost 100 years. And when the residents of Scranton -- you have to be honest with yourself, they have no interest in the people they elected to government that sits where it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 sits today. But if you look at some of the decisions made, whether it has to do with the Scranton Sewer Authority , the parking garages , just look at the renovations taking place to this building today? The City of Scranton could have bought the courthouse annex for I think 1.6 million dollars and gave the City just a great asset multiple times better than this building . But we've allowed politics to play like they have in the Scranton School District . Now when the recovery coordinator came to Scranton , I had a chance to sit down with her and talk to her about the Governor , the Recovery Plan for the Scranton School District , the loss of school infrastructure as a detriment to the student s in the City of Scranton and the academic scores of the students in the City of Scranton . And I just find it very sorrowful that we have such an elected government that really -- it's like the shanty Irish community where the lace curtain Irish rule over the shanty Irish. And that's what's happened in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Scranton . And it's just really a shame the people that we elect have no respect for the people that they should be representing . And the other sad thing is that when you look at City government -- and believe me, this is not a personal attack. We have people from the Scranton School District that were elected . And we have a Mayor in the office of Mayor who was on the School Board and they couldn't bring themselves to try to move the Scranton of Scranton schools to perform in a way that would give the student s here a chance to have a leg up. We've accepted very poor grades, very poor performance in the Scranton School District . And we've accepted the same from our own government . And I think it behooves the Mayor to show up here as she said she would come here and speak on the Home Rule Charter and where she stands. And I think this Council needs to seriously reconsider where it stands. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Ryan Barrett . MR. BARRETT : Good evening members 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 of Council . I have a relatively simple request here. My name is again, Ryan Barrett . I live at the intersection of North Washington Avenue and Woodlawn . And I'm requesting that the crosswalks at that intersection be painted. As you may be aware, that intersection has St. Clare's Elementary School. It is also a public school bus drop off and pickup. And for some strange and unknown reason, the crosswalks at that intersection aren't painted . I made a number of requests to DPW. I had reassurance s that the crosswalks would be painted . They have not been. I have a petition here. Although I don't think I need a petition for something so obvious , but I do have one here for all of you. It's addressed to DPW. I had Tom Preambo and I would like you to consider this request . That is all that I have for you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And I know that we have sent this on behalf of this Council have sent it numerous times to the DPW because we've heard from -- even the principal at St. Clare's has reached out to me personally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 for this. And I don't have an answer for you. It's mind-boggling that that cannot be done. That is a very dangerous , as you well know, intersection . So again, Mr. Voldenberg , if we can send something . And I will personally call Mr. Preambo again and ask him to get those guys out there and to do that. Thank you. MR. BARRETT : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Barrett . That exhausts the sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. COYNE: Thomas Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , first, I ask where can the minutes from City Council 's various subcommittee s that are require d to have public meeting s advertised and have minutes available for the Sunshine Act be found, the Committee on Rules, Finance, Public Works, Public Safety and Community Development ? Agencies subject to the Sunshine Act include any state or local government body, all subunits appoint ed by that body that perform an essential government function and exercise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 authority to take official action or render advice. It can include boards, councils , authorities , commission s, and committees . On the budget, the IT line reflects $155,000 for 2022. But the Bedrock contract alone is 155 percent of that yearly budget. Relating to 5-B I have some issues. The contract lists the costs of a year at $240,000. While the Bedrock interview on the radio reflected 75 percent of what they can do is done remotely. And that leaves an unbudgeted additional 25 percent as an estimated payable service charge. This is per the vendor interview on Tech(inaudible ) episode 27. The contract lists $100 per hour for other work. The covered contracted hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Off hours I assume are hourly as well. There are 11 people listed in Attachment D, disclosed , providing a professional service to the City. Are they planning on and have they as the prior contract been paying taxes to the City as doing business in the City of Scranton ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Nonresidents who work in the City pay a local income tax of 1 percent and an additional $52 surcharge tax per year. Attachment E of line two is deficient as it request s information on anyone employed by the City of Scranton . This is blank. This is question able as the current contract falls under this and the City has been paying for this service by this particular contractor which presumably would include the above names and personal -- personnel at the top of Attachment E. On the matrix, team qualification reviews marked as hire, H-I-R-E, to standard . It should be higher, H-I-G-H-E-R not hire, quality control failure . Backup and validation are listed as an hourly fee. Software upgrades , coordinate and install are a fee of $100 per hour. This actually may be $200 an hour as most likely would be stacked with nonsupport hours. Last, page nine overview of current technical (inaudible ) environment -- three person IT Department including interim director . This calls forth a few questions .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 The IT Director position that was not filled is the -- was the now the IT manager . Is he getting paid the rate of IT manager or has it been modified and not disclosed ? The IT manager is the sole head of the department . Therefore , the department head-director . Original conversation on the Home Rule Charter specifically included department heads under the City Council . More particularly , the interim director is in direct violation of the Home Rule Charter and it was put in place in violation of the rules. The interim director who should have been brought before this Council was, in fact, declined five to zero and installed back door by insertion into a lower position without the higher position to bypass the Home Rule Charter . Carl Deeley on this document is listed as the interim director . And in the official Scranton website lists him as the Director of IT, thus reflect s a position barred by vote. Is Council going to push this breach of conduct to be fully reviewed by the Ethics 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Board and remove the acting director as the position was granted by intent to violate the City Council 's rule, vote and the Home Rule Charter ? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Coyne, just to answer your question on the committees , the committees have not met. When the committees meet like the Committee on Public Works, those meeting s if they occur with more than two Council members, we would publicize those and have those here in Council Chambers . Thank you. MR. COYNE: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I watched this meeting last week from home. And I was very, very upset when I saw the discussion or if you could even call it that on the Home Rule Charter . I did go through it again. And it turns out that the 30 -- 30 seconds that Mr. Gaughan reported why he was against the Home Rule Charter being on the ballot managed to say I, I don't know, 10 or 11 times. And then it was followed by three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 other people saying, no, for the same reason. And that was just crushing . Do you people not realize your representatives ? I mean, it's what you like, not what the people want. MR. GAUGHAN : Marie, Marie, excuse me, you're the only person, you and Mr. Coyne who have brought up the Home Rule Charter to me or this Council . So, I mean, when you're referring to a great outcry from the public, you're the only two people I've heard of that are in favor -- and Lee Morgan -- in changing or looking at the Home Rule Charter . So it's not as if we're hearing this great, you know, cry from the public about it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, what's -- what is the problem -- ATTY. HAYES: Miss Schumacher , also, you have the ability to circulate a petition if there's this great outpouring of support for the Home Rule Charter being revised , then circulate a position . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you both for taking a good chunk of my time. But I do read the code as a matter of fact if you want to talk code. Let's go down to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 capital budget which you all passed. What does the -- what does that say? I believe I have it here. The Home Rule Charter says that we are the -- we are to be able to see the item -- itemization of what is in that budget. We didn't see that. It's just another -- well, you called it a wish list a couple weeks ago, Mr. Gaughan . And I just don't think that's what it is. I mean, we talked about one of the items now, you look at the money that's in there, for instance , with the Parks and Recreation next year. And I just saw an RFP for demolition of the pool house up at Nay Aug Park. Now, how much is going to be left after that is done? We don't know. But I'll tell you and this is going back several years you have been told what is happening up at the lookout. It is falling apart. It's falling apart because for every other reason just like this building , don't do maintenance . Just wait until it's falling apart and then let's throw money at it. And I would urge you to go up and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 see what terrible shape it's in. And I did bring the definition of the WPA and some background on it since you all were not around. But that is part of our history . And it's also used very, very much. Okay. So I hope you are not going to accept another operating budget as you did last year too. It should go back to the administration if it's just a menu thing, oh, we're thinking about this. We're thinking about that. Well, you know, and it's just -- it's ridiculous . You just -- and then I do like the idea by the way on a different subject of bringing in the department heads. But I also think you should be bringing in and not their representative or the Chief of Staff, our elected officials at least once a quarter . They are the people who bring back the bacon from Harrisburg . And I think they should be in here to hear what you have to say about what our needs are and what they're going to do to help us because we're not getting it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , City of Scranton . As long as the issue came up on the Home Rule Charter , several terms of Mayor ago I've often felt that once we could do -- and I do agree it's a tweak. I mean, this day and age you could wind up with better or worse but two term executive . Right now we have somebody that seems to be pretty good and honest. But as we found out that was not the case years ago. I heard all kinds of things and believe them to be true. Not too much on there so I'm going to talk on my pet topics again. With the COVID it should be known that Ron DeSantis of Florida had a sister that is deceased from COVID. The Governor of Maine is also an anti-vaxxer, anti-masker and his wife passed away and he went to an anti-vax rally seven days later. He must have really loved the poor lady, you know, that's sad. The same with Governor Abbott. He's banning masks and banning required vaccinations . Well, you know, how about if somebody has to work with a bunch of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 anti-vaxxers if they could just walk out and sign up for indefinite unemployment until those people decide to get vaxed. You shouldn 't have to subject yourself to that. But the moral of this story is, please get vaccinated , please. It's totally ridiculous the way people are rejecting science . And in our area we had some good news. There weren't any deaths in a couple of days. That's really good news to hear. That's on the upbeat. On the vote, the last week I heard Joe Biden getting bashed again and bashed again. He didn't have any choice with the Taliban and Afghanistan . He either had to withdraw . He withdrew four months later. And I feel very sorry for them women. On a personal note, I think we should have just stayed for a while but, you know, we can't not after it's been negotiated with anybody else. That's disturbing with the presidency that you could just wipe out a treaty that's been negotiated and passed through Congress and everything also. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Dobryzn , I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 want to interrupt you, but if you could try to keep your comment s towards City -- something with the City, anything . MR. DOBRZYN : Yeah, well, other people come up here and they start it and I just -- MR. GAUGHAN : Well, that's because it was somehow related to Joe Biden and the sign so I was trying to walk a fine line, you know. MR. DOBRZYN : Yeah, yeah. But anyway, try to contact your Congress men and tell them it's time to vote to get laws on the polls. You don't want to stand in line for six or eight hours or have a state legislature decide who is the Mayor of Scranton or who is on Council in Scranton or who is your representative from this area which we don't have a state representative assembly . But it is the area. All right. I'll pack it in there. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Is there anyone else who would like to speak tonight ? Mr. Voldenberg . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm just going to ask -- I'm going to reach out to Frank and ask him if we could get a list of -- a list of all the City condemned properties and then a list of the -- the demolition list for the City, please. MR. VOLDENBERG : Certainly , Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : No, that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a few. So last November I brought forth concern s and complaints about this illegal auto repair service on the rear of 1149 Sloan Street. And then I brought it up again because it continues . They leave. They come back. I think I brought it up again maybe a month ago. We didn't get anything back on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 that or any followup that I'm aware of. So concerned resident s came to me again over the weekend and said, you know, this is still occurring . Instead of opening the garage door and leaving it open, they're going through the side door and they're painting cars and I know that they're -- first of all, this is an illegal garage. But even a regular garage has to follow so many safety protocols . So the neighbors are still very concerned . Can we please get a followup or an update from code enforcement on this and have them, you know, really take a hard look at this because it's almost a year. Okay, next, I received a bunch of complaints about a stop sign that was removed last week on Wyoming and Sunset. So, you know, I've never heard of stop signs being removed . Maybe it happens in the City from time to time. I know for the most part, you know, different areas and residents want to see more stop signs because , you know, there's a lot more cars on the road. So their concern is why without any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 rational e or even some of the neighborhood associations said, you know, we don't even know about it because it poses a safety hazard to the neighbors pulling out of driveway s as well as the children in the neighborhood and kids going back and forth to Robert Morris. All right, so please find out why these were taken down. I don't think it was vandalism . So please check into that. And also, since we're on the topic of Green Ridge, it was also brought to my attention that there's a large pothole . I know it's been -- complaints have been sent, you know, to the City about a large pothole in front of 1805 North Washington Avenue. So can you please followup to see where they are with satisfying that? That request was already submitted . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with the water company on that, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And all right, so, you know, recently I brought up in Bellevue the truck issue. The large trucks that are, you know, violating the ordinance that was actually written for Bellevue . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And I want to thank the police department for the immediate responses to our inquiry . All right. So, you know, we asked last week is the -- Officer Guida, he's the only one that has certification to the truck weight inspection . So they respond ed and said, you know, he is the only officer to perform in depth commercial vehicle inspections . So we also asked is he retiring because that was the word on the street. And they responded , yes, he is retiring from, you know, the Scranton Police Department later this month. And I said -- I also asked is there any other officers currently in training as truck weight inspectors . And the response was, no, there is not. Upon researching training files, I learned that there have been six officer s that had attended the weights and measures class in the past. But we are currently looking into the next class offered by the state. And I guess that's not until the spring. So there's going to be a, you know, a time period where no one can actually pull these trucks over and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 weigh them. So that's an issue. So with that in mind, I did ask, you know, hey, can we share that service with the county -- Lackawanna County Sheriff 's Department and because they might have certified truck weight inspectors to assist the Scranton Police Department . And they responded the SPD has worked with other local and state agencies in the past for truck details within City limits. So they said they've done it before. Can they do it? And my understand ing is, you know, the administration is aware of this. And they are trying to work on this and come up with a plan. So I thank them and please thank them but could you, you know, send some correspondence back saying thank you for your responses but what are we going to do now that this police officer is retiring and is there any way we can actually set up this, you know, shared services or have these other agencies help us out? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with the other agencies . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you and let me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 see. I think that's it. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, first as we were discussing in caucus in relation to Item 5-B tonight , the Bedrock IT contract that's to be produced ; it did bring up, you know, staffing in IT Department and a while ago I'd asked for regular personnel reports from the administration so that Council could stay up-to-date on, you know, what City employees we have and what position s are filled or not filled. And I would like to once again send correspondence to the administration to ask for that at least on a monthly basis to have that report. So I'd like to make a motion for that to be sent from all of Council . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion and a second. On the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : And the other thing that I wanted to add, I did appreciate that Miss Schumacher bringing up during her participation time our communication with state legislators . I do think that we should have more communication with them. And I think that it's a great idea to have them come into Council Chambers to explain some of the things that they've done that will be helpful for the City. And I would love to hear from them. So I'm not sure where other Council members stand on that if they're interested in inviting state legislators into a caucus or Council Chambers . But I'm in favor of that. That's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Just to touch on the difference , the class three or the difference 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 in the classification between 3 and 2-A. It's my understanding that we're technically still not a 2-A City. We're a formally 2-A City that operates under Home Rule. So really this goes back to even to the discussion too with the charter . The real problem is, is how convoluted and outdated Pennsylvania law in terms of how municipalities are governed . This was created -- this was a system that was created in 1972 includes over 2,500 municipalities , 67 counties , 500 school districts . That can't be efficient in today's world. So whether it's a discussion on the charter or classification , realistically we use 2-A when it's to our benefit . And we use Home Rule when it's to our benefit . But that's the way Pennsylvania law is written . And that needs -- that's where that needs to change and be simplified and give us more direction to actually be more successful because the current system hamstrings us in a lot of things that we could possibly do or not do. So that's where I stand on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 And I just wanted to make that kind of -- that's all I have. I'll reserve the rest of my comment s for agenda items. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Yeah, in terms of in Third Order the letter from the Governor 's office as Councilman Donahue mention ed about the -- being a third class city, I think we need to have a better understand ing of what the implication s would be. And I don't know all the implications to be honest with you. So Solicitor Hayes is looking into that. I also think we need to reach out to Senator Flynn's office regarding that potential change. I do know that the City and the school district have had the benefit of special legislation over the years because of the classification with the most recent being the LST rate and the payroll tax review options . And I do know that under a previous Council they pursued the change to a third class status because they were trying to institute a nonresidents wage tax. But the changes to Act 47 since 2014 ruled even that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 out and that ended up not working . So I can't really comment on it and say, you know, whether I think it's a good move or a bad move. I think we need to find out what exactly the ramifications would be. So we'll continue to look into that. As for the Home Rule Charter , I appreciate everyone , you know, who has interest in changing the Home Rule Charter . But I think if you -- what do want -- exactly want to change would be my question . So I've heard it needs to be changed . But what are the issues with it, I guess. I look at it if there needs to be tweaks to it that's fine. But the overall form of government I tend to support . I like it. I like the strong mayor form of government and the strong mayor council form of government . So I wouldn't be in favor of changing that. This issue was brought up years ago as you all know. And the study commission was formed. They looked at it. They put it to the people, put it to a referendum to a vote. And the people voted against changing the form of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 government . So does it need to be updated ? There probably needs to be tweaks made to it. I haven't really looked into exactly what those might be. But as Solicitor Hayes said, if any member of the public wants to initiate that process and it is a process , you could do that. But for my sake, I'm just being honest with you. I would not support that at this time. There is an Ethics Board opening . I mentioned this a few weeks ago. And Mr. Voldenberg put an ad out in the newspaper . We -- I announced it at a Council meeting and we did not get anybody who is interested . So I'll announce it again. There is an opening . If anybody has any interest , please e-mail your letter of interest or resume to Mr. Voldenberg at Fvoldenberg @scrantonpa .gov or you could send it to 340 North Washington Avenue to the City Clerk's office. I'd like to make a motion at this time to -- City Council send correspond to Mayor Cognetti asking her what her plan is for the Nay Aug Park pool complex .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second. On the question ? I brought this up before and I'm not going to go on and on about it like I have in the past because I think everybody knows where I stand. But I am concerned that this is not a number one priority of this administration . There has been movement . They're going to apparent ly demolish the pools and fill them in. But outside of that, Councilman Donahue and I recently met with members of the Mayor's administration . And I really truthfully did not get the feeling that this project is at the top of the list. There is no plan moving forward yet on how we're -- what we're going to do up there, what option we're going to choose. And I really believe that every day that goes by that we don't have a plan, every day that goes by that there's not somebody looking into how we would finance this, it's another year or at least two years that there's going be nothing up there. And to me that is totally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 unacceptable . So I really think we need to see some movement on this. I believe that we should investigate . And I've made this point clear to the Mayor and the administration potentially financing this project through a borrowing -- a capital borrowing . There are different ways to do that. We could be creative with that. But to think that we're going to somehow come up with grant funding in the amount of 8 to 10 million dollars is -- even 6 million dollars is just not I don't think feasible . So the pool complex there is so important , not just to the Hill Section but it's important to the City. There's been great strides made at Nay Aug Park over the last few years with the volunteers up there who have just taken the park by storm. There's a project going on up there every single week. And the missing piece of the park is the pool. There's a slide. There was so many -- so much money and so much investment up there under the Dougher ty administration to let it kind of languish to me is again, unacceptable . So I know that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Mayor and her administration want to see something happen. I just don't think that there's enough push yet. There's not enough movement and I would like to light a fire under somebody to at least start the process and the conversation . Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Just to add to that, we need to get the design and engineering work done so that we know exactly or have a better idea of exactly what that final cost would be before we even, you know, get into a finance department . So I do agree that we just need to move forward on that on picking which option we're going with and then getting into the design and engineering work on that. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I'd also like to add that I'm in agreement with this motion. And we need to get a plan together . The park is such a great asset to our City. I mean, people come here just to go to that park and that park and events that are held there. And it's not -- it's certainly not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 the only park we have in the City. We have a lot of parks that need attention and different project s. And I'm still looking forward to getting our parks assessment to find out what we need in those other parks. But we can't just ignore this and, you know, wait another year to make a decision and come up with a plan because it's just going to be sitting there without anything being done for however long this is. We're thinking long-term this is going to take a couple of years. And I don't want to continue to prolong it. I'm not sure why that is the case. But I'm in favor of this motion. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, there's an old saying -- there's an old saying if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. So we saw a couple presentation s on this project . We saw options . There was a lot of excitement that I remember , a lot of discussion and then all of a sudden nothing . So, you know, it's October . October 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 becomes January like this. January becomes June like this. And then, you know, I don't see happening -- we know it's not going to happen this year. But once you stop it takes that much longer to get to the planning part of this. So I agree with this motion to be updated . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. Just a few updates as well. I think Miss Jeffries last week asked about the 600 block of Lackawanna Avenue near the Radison Hotel. The wall as you're coming near the Radison is in deplorable condition . And it has been for the last past few years. So there was a -- Mr. Voldenberg looked into it with Senator Flynn's office and they did get right back to us that there was a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 $351,000 grant received by the county in March of 2019 for that project for the complete rehab of that whole area there. And the project was delayed due to COVID-19 obviously . And there was a shortfall in funding to complete the project . So I reached out to Brian Jeffers , the County Chief of Staff today and had a brief conversation with him on it. And he was going to look into it. It's such a crucial area in the City. And if there is any way that we can help in moving that project along I think we should. We sent a followup message to the City administration regarding my question s about employee and management vaccination rates and possibly mandating that to all employees . The Public Health Coordinator acknowledged the receipt of that and advised that we will get a response very soon. So I appreciate that. Also, a resident had inquired about several issues in South Scranton regarding quality of life issues at the corner of Cedar Avenue and East Elm Street, corner of Cedar Avenue and Brook Street and the 1600 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 block of Cedar Avenue. Violation letters have been sent by the Licensing and Inspections Department . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND BEDROCK TECHNOLOGY A/K/A KEYSTONE TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING , LLC TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT SERVICES . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I have a few comments on this. So going through the documentation here on page three it states that the manage service agreement -- basically the contract contains proprietary information which is confidential . So they did not provide that in the backup. I have been going back and forth this morning with Solicitor Hayes. And the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 administration is going to send Solicitor Hayes the contract on a confidential basis so that he could go through and I think parse out what is confidential and what is proprietary . We can look at it. And the Council can view in a confidential manner. But it's not going to be open to the public. Now, I did speak to the Mayor this afternoon and raise the issue. And she stated to me that they will release whatever is not confidential and proprietary because there's things within the contract that we need to see, like, we know the term of the contract is four years. But I want to see what the language states on when that gets -- it automatically gets re-upped. So what does the language look like there. So there's questions on that that I would like to see. So that's in discussions . Also on page five it lists the Rubrik. Now, I'm not going to speak for everyone on Council . But, you know, technology and some of those technical terms is not is my wheelhouse. And the administration is choosing this company which is much more expensive than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the lowest bidder. The company that the administration is choosing is charging $20,000 a month. The lowest bidder is charging $12,500 a month. So I did speak to the Mayor about this today. And we both agreed that the IT Department -- we talked about it in caucus tonight , Bedrock Technologies and any other member of the administration should come in next week and we should have a conversation and a discussion about the Rubrik, how this company was chosen and what exactly they're going to do in laymen's terms so that we know what kind of -- it's a four-year contract . So we want to have a good understand ing of what we're entering into here. The other question that I had was, there was a $100 hourly rate if the company has to perform any work outside of what's listed in the contract . But it's hard to tell what exactly that would look like. So the company 's only on the clock technically from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., but will respond to emergencies after hours. So is that when the $100 hourly rate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 kicks in? That's not clear. So we have question s about that. On page nine it states the IT Department has an interim director . And everyone remembers that back in July the Mayor appoint ed Carl Deeley as interim IT Director effective July 7th. Council unanimously voted that down because we did not think he was qualified . The Mayor then put him in a network system's manager position . I think it was for $61,000 a year. I did raise this issue with the Mayor today and asked her why there is an interim IT Director because we did not approve that. She said it was a mistake , a clerical error. And it should have said network systems manager because there is no IT Director or interim IT Director . So that was her explanation there. On page 46, the disclosure s by current contractor 's form was not filled out correctly . They did not include answers to any of the questions . I raised that with the Mayor. And, Solicitor Hayes, they did send you that documentation , correct ? ATTY. HAYES: (Inaudible ). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. ATTY. HAYES: There was a disclosure form sent to me this afternoon . I can't tell if it's for this RFQ or the prior one -- the prior contract that they had. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. ATTY. HAYES: Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : And then I mentioned earlier the length of the contract is going to be four years. But it's hard to tell without looking at the actual contract whether or not -- what the renewal language looks like. I tend to not really like the automatic renewal of these type of contracts . So I think we need to look at that language . Also, I'd like to know how much the City has paid to Bedrock Technologies to date. The City has previously engaged them under an emergency order going back a few months. We don't have an IT Director yet. But I'd like to know, you know, where we are with that process . I'm assuming we interviewed people, but are we any closer to getting an IT Director . One of the question s I had before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 speaking to the Mayor was, if, in fact, we do approve this and hire this company we're hiring a third party to essentially , you know, manage the IT Department . Do we need all of the -- not all of the employees , we don't have a ton. But do we need all of those employees in the IT Department ? And the Mayor stated that there are going to be reduction s in staffing . What that looks like I'm not exactly positive . But she's suppose d to expand upon that by next week. So and that would make sense if we end up hiring this company . As I mentioned , the Rubrik in some parts, difficult to understand . So hopefully we can get that cleared up next week. It's hard to make a decision without all of the information that was not provided . So we're going to be receiving that information . We'll have a conversation next week with Bedrock Technologies hopefully , members of the IT Department and the administration and then we could move forward from there. And that's all I have. Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MR. DONAHUE : Just quickly , I also want to see what it looks like in terms of the whole IT budget. So I was made aware today that some of the stuff that's in this -- that's covered under this contract might come out of different parts of our IT budget. For example , software licensing , that's under capital improvement s or professional services , I believe now. But then that will be under -- covered under this. But I want to see that broken out in terms of what our total IT Department budget was last year compared to what it's going to be this year with salaries and all the other costs broken out more efficiently . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I'll definitely vote to introduce. But my question is a simple one. Does this $20,000 a month, $240,000 a year contract satisfy the need for an IT Director with the realistic salary -- that was the biggest complaint last year for the 2022 budget. I don't want to see both. I'd just want to see one. That's all. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : So I was glad to see there was a lot of question s on this. A few months ago -- and I think several times I brought up some of my concerns about the department when it comes to outsourcing , when it comes to consultants , things like that how much of the budget they've spent. So this is a department that has issues. And I hope for some clarification on what the plan is moving forward . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.

MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this doesn't really have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 anything to do with 7-A. But it just sparked my memory. Could we send something to Licensing and Inspections about Dollar Generals in the City and other convenient stores and minimarts and CVS, Rite Aids about someone just driving around from the City and looking at these places because when I drive around and I get a lot of complaint s about the garbage , the high weeds, the way that the properties look -- not all of them, but some of them look terrible . I've sent them in before. I don't know if anything 's been -- the one in Minooka was in horrendous condition . They just let it go. It makes the whole neighborhood look bad. And we need to start holding these stores accountable if they're going to be in our City and we're going to keep approving these type of things. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS.
