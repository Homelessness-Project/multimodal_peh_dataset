EVANS DATED SEPTEMBER 27, 2019 IN REFERENCE TO SALARY ADJUSTMENTS FOR TEMPORARY ASSIGNMENTS . MR. ROGAN: Are there any comment s on Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have announcements ? I have a couple. MR. DONAHUE : I have one quick one. The City of Scranton is preparing their Five Year Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plan and its analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. As part of the planning process , the City is conducting a survey to identify residents ' needs in the community and ideas on what the City -- what City residents would like to see funds used for. Please take a few minutes and complete the survey which can be found at the top of the City's website Scranton PA dot gov. MR. ROGAN: I have two. Last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 the Licensing and Inspections and Permits Department began taking credit card payments . This Friday, October 4th will be the last day cash payment s are accepted . Beginning Monday, October 7th, only credit cards, checks, and money orders will be accepted as form of payment . No cash will be accepted beyond this date. Next Monday, October 7th at 5:45 p.m., a public hearing will be held for Item 5-B on tonight 's agenda. The legislation is to approve a substantial amendment to the 2015 and 16 Action Plans in order for HOME funding to be spent on a project and avoid any future penalty imposed by HUD. The legislation will then be tabled for a 30-day comment period as required . ATTY. DEMPSEY : And I have two brief announcements as well. Good evening everyone and thank you for attending . The first one is in regards to a purse bingo that will be held this Sunday to benefit Kathleen 's Crusade . It's in memory of Kathleen Cavanaugh , a young woman who lost her life due to domestic violence . It's going to be down in Old Forge at the Eagle McClure Firehouse . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Tickets are $20 ahead of time or $25 at the door. This is somewhat close to my heart. Kathleen and I were shirttail relatives slash cousins. We shared the same aunt and uncle and cousin. I on the mother side, her on the father side. So the other thing I like about this is any and all benefit s from this stay local and will benefit our local Women's Resource Center. And to date this wonderful charity has raised over $100,000 to support the Women's Resource Center. So that's number one. Number two is the Green Ridge Fall Festival is going to be this Saturday , October 5th. It's from ten to four at the Green Ridge corners in Scranton . It's actually a beautiful family event. The streets are blocked down. You could bring your family, bring your strollers , bring your kids. There's plenty of food. We have beautiful retailers there. There's going to be lots of activities and things for the children to do. Last year we had hayrides as well. So I would invite anybody and everybody who is looking for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 something to do this Saturday to please join us there and it's going to be from ten to four. Thank you. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items and matters of general concern : Fay Franus Joan Hodowanitz Marie Schumacher Bob Bolus Gene Reed Ron Ellman Gerard Hetman Dave Dobrzyn MaryJo Sheridan ) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, thank you. I'm going to start off with the whole fiasco regarding Chief DeSarno and his personal use of the City-issued gas card.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I can't tell you the number of people I talked to over the weekend are just completely outrage d with this whole situation and rightfully so. City resources should never be used for personal use. And I really don't give a damn if there is a written policy or not. It's just basic common sense. The most egregious fact of the whole matter is that when the Chief was initially confronted about taking a City vehicle on vacation he lied and he told the Mayor he paid for his own gas. Given the current circumstances I do understand that the Mayor is in a difficult situation trying to keep City government as functional as possible for a short period of time. But if it were up to me, I would have fired him on the spot. The lie is worse than the crime a lot of times. At the very least, some form of unpaid suspension is absolutely warranted in this situation . The whole situation highlights the lack of internal controls and oversight that is require d to hold City employees accountable for how taxpayer money is spent.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 This Council requested an audit to not only determine if this problem is more widespread but also to get recommendation s on what internal controls need to be put in place to prevent any sort of waste, fraud or abuse moving forward . I also believe we need to reevaluate the need for certain employees to have gas cards at all. In the private sector, employees typically pay for fuel out of pocket and submit expense reimbursement s with receipts which would allow for more transparent oversight of where and when employee s are spending taxpayer dollars . Regardless of the steps taken to reprimand Chief DeSarno , one thing is crystal clear. The current system has failed City residents . This is completely unacceptable and has gone on for far too long. The residents of this City deserve better from their government . I've said it before and I'll say it again. Employees within City government must always treat their positions as a public service not as a self-service . Moving onto another note it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 brought to my attention this afternoon that some streets on the paving list that appeared in the paper this morning may be undergoing work by utility companies in the near future. So I asked Mrs. Reed if she would send correspondence to the BA and DPW to make sure that the paving list was shared with the utility companies to make sure they don't have any work planned for the streets on the list. Last week I also receive d a complaint regarding the old Garcia's Market at 826 Pittston Avenue. The building has been condemned and on a demolition list for quite some time. And the neighbors reached out to see if there was any sort of timeline when the building was going to be taken down. They have concerns about birds nesting in the building through open windows on the second floor. And the stench coming from the building is getting worse by the day. I know Mrs. Reed requested an update on that for me last week. I also received another complaint last week regarding street lights on Lackawanna Avenue and that a vast majority of them were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 out and that a majority of the street was pitch black. So, Miss Reed, would you be able to send correspondence to the Administration to have them look into that as well. Council woman Dempsey and myself attended the Hill Neighborhood meeting last weekend . Chief Graziano was also at the meeting . He provide d the group with updates on police initiatives in the neighborhood and also told neighbors he would look into their complaint s regarding the lack of proper sight lines at intersection s because people parking too close to corners especial ly on Vine and Olive Street. Neighbors also had concerns regarding a condemned property at 601-603 Wheeler Avenue that still has people living in it. So, Miss Reed, would you be able to pass that information along to License and Inspection . And also at the corner of Olive Street and Wheeler on the even side of the street there's a storm drain that is blocked so bad that weeds have begun growing out of the drain and water is pooling at the corner every time it rains if you could pass that complaint 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 along to DPW. And also there is a dangerous -- I was told there is a dangerous pothole in the middle of the 1000 block of Myrtle Street if we could include that too. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, thank you. I have some commentary tonight , not any motions . I'm going to start with some comments on the gas card audit, just a few of them. I believe this is a very important audit. The five of us took it upon ourselves to look into this and little did we know the timing would be so perfect . There's no doubt that as we dig deeper we're going to find some problems . And what I was most concerned about was this getting lost in the shuffle . We started this process via letter I think it was August 26th or 27th. And there was a little bit of back and forth. But it was a good month before the Controller got back to us and said that her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 office was unable to do it due to I guess a lack of personnel , which is acceptable . At this point in time I do want people to know that the matter is going to be put out for a request for proposals . We expect that that is going to be in the paper this Wednesday . I believe it's November 1st they're going to be opened. At that point in time a member of Council will be present . We want to make sure that everybody knows precisely what we're looking for here. I'm not going to go too much further into that except to say that what had been provided to us thus far indicate s that at least $30,000 is being spent every two months on gas. If we take that back over the last three or five years that is an extensive sum of money. So sometimes I think people hear gas card and they're thinking smaller amounts of money. This could end up being a larger amount of money if we find any element of abuse. We're not on witch-hunt here. But what we all agreed is we are looking for further element of transparency in this government . And we want to make sure that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 everything is being done above the board and as someone made reference earlier , no more handshake agreement s. So that is actually very important to me. I know some people have looked at that and maybe minimalized it. I do not think that is something that should be minimalized at all. The second thing I would like to point out is in terms of policies because that has been brought up numerous times this evening whether there was of a lack of a policy. While that may have been true at the time only in terms of a vehicle policy, we still did have an older ethics policy in effect. Bu what I would like -- my point is now on August 9th, Mayor Evans and his administration did put into effect a new vehicle policy. So it is also important for me to show that, yes, while there was a problem we have fixed it. And moving forward we have an answer to that. The second thing I wanted to address is I'm dealing with Solicitor Eskra on a handbook as we speak. I've sent her over certain examples and she is trying to put one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 together at this time. And the third thing is someone spoke about a hiring policy. I mention ed that I had done some research and found what I thought were two of the best ones around. I went ahead and I sent them over to Solicitor Eskra as well. So they are now in her hands for further handling and according to how the Mayor would want to proceed . I did have a meeting today with the Mayor, Solicitor Eskra and Mr. Bulzoni . And while I'll get to the garbage issue at the end which is, of course, you know, my main reason for meeting with them, I also did bring up the issue of a grant writer because again, I think that's very, very important . And while we do have one I understand who is very highly thought of and very well qualified and has done an excellent job obtaining grants for the City, my understanding is and Mr. Donahue could maybe speak to this if there is anything further to add, in a shared services meeting with the Scranton School District there's been addition al talk of possibly getting an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 additional one that we can share with the school district . I will repeat my belief that these are employees that pay for themselves . There is enough grant efforts out there that if they write three or four or five a year, sometimes they can double, triple, or quadruple their salary. So I want to look further into that and I don't want that to fall by the wayside . If anybody has been -- and I think most of the people in the audience here do pay attention to our agenda, you'll see that in Third Order there are additional letters that we have added in. There was one from the Mayor to us regarding salaries . And there was also our response back to him. The reason for that again is increase transparency in municipal government . We all feel very strongly in light of what happened with the previous administration and the political corruption . But that could no longer occur. And we will no longer allow it to occur. We want you to know what's going on when we speak to the Mayor. We want you to know what he's saying back to us. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 And I think those two letters are excellent examples . The one letter in particular for further administrations down the line if they are to question what Council 's intent was at any given minute, that two or three page letter easily determined what our intent was. So I think it's important for that purpose as well. Mr. Donahue did say that we spent some time up at the Hill Neighborhood Association . It was actually a lovely meeting . There was about 25 people very, very involved , lots of good questions . We were there for about an hour and 45 minutes . He is right as well that Chief Graziano attended that with us. I have to take this opportunity to commend him. With rare exception he is at most of the neighborhood meetings I go to. And as you know most of them are at night from six to eight or seven to nine. And I really just think he's a silent unsung hero. He doesn't look for a lot of credit. But he does so much behind the scenes to make sure that the police department runs the right way. And I want to give him my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 commendations for that. I will repeat what I said previously , no matter what neighborhoods I go to we all share the same problems , crime, blight, parking issues, the esthetic of the neighborhood , etc. And Mr. Donahue again took down some addresses and whatnot and we will follow through with the LIPS Department to see if, in fact, those issues can be taken care of. I know in particular there was one building where they saw someone crawling out of the second window later at night. So we want to make sure that we take care of that. I also want to thank Mr. Fallon, the Director of Parks and Recreation . Last week or the week before I had made a request . We had done a cleanup at Pretzel Park out in Green Ridge for addition al lighting and for the outlets to be fixed. And he was really on that. And when I checked one one night and there happened to be a small problem with it, again, he immediately fixed that and made sure it was taken care of. So again, on behalf of myself and everybody else who requested that I do want to say thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Just today I received a fax from Principal Cara Ware at the St. Paul's School out in Green Ridge. I spoke about this two weeks ago and I got sidetracked a little bit due to illness . But her letter basically says that she is the newly installed administrator at St. Claire's/St. Paul's School which has two campuses. One is at 2215 North Washington and the other one is 1527 Penn. She notes that she has many student s that walk to and from both campuses each day. "Last week our school crossing guard reported a very close call with regard to a student making his way across Green Ridge Street. The area where the student s cross at Penn Avenue and Green Ridge Street has been hazardous as traffic moves very quickly along that stretch of road." Then she goes onto say, "I myself have walked with the students to the corner and it is quite apparent that we need repair work on the crosswalk s there. I'm also requesting signage that indicates school student crossing and would appreciate City Council 's prompt assistance in this matter as our young 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 student s' safety is a number one priority ." If any of you will recall about two weeks ago I spoke of that as well that I had some concerns regarding crosswalks out that area. We do have St. Claire/St. Paul's School as well as Robert Morris School. So, Lori, I think what I'll do if it's acceptable is, I'll come to your office some day this week and we'll spend about 15 minutes or a half hour together because attached to that letter I also have nine other areas where the students walk back and forth to school. And I went around and looked and the crosswalks do need to be brightened or they do need to be put in place so that we can avoid any dangerous issues. I do think Green Ridge Street is a state road. So we might have to work with PennDOT on that as well. And to conclude, it would not be a Council meeting if I did not talk about trash delinquencies . So when I met with Mayor Evans today as I said before Solicitor Eskra and Mr. Bulzoni were also there with us. We spent about an hour discussing this topic. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 What came out of that meeting at least for today I did discuss with them some of the ideas I have. I did discuss with them some of the ideas that were thrown around between myself and other members or residents who came to see me. What I will tell you as of right now our next go to job is within the next ten business days which is either this week -- no, excuse me. It would either be next week or the following week. So I take that back, 15 business days. Myself, the Mayor, Mr. Bulzoni and Solicitor Eskra are going to get a meeting with representative s from Northeast Revenue Services . We're going to sit down with them. If anybody recalls two to three weeks ago Mr. Donahue made a motion that we all approved unanimously to terminate that contract . And I believe the term was as soon as possible . That has not yet been done. We all agree that there are moving parts and logistics and a contract in place. I was glad that I was invited to that meeting. I am happy to attend that meeting . I will have a voice at that meeting .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 So I will report back from that meeting to see what occurs with us and Northeast Revenue Services . And that's all I have for this evening . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Just on the line painting , I did have an opportunity , Attorney Dempsey , to speak to Mr. Gallagher . And apparently the painting machine was down for a period of time. So I don't know -- we should check, Mrs. Reed, on when that's going to be up and running again. But I know that they were trying their best to get out there to those corners . So thank you. We did receive or I receive d a permit parking request for the 1800 block of Wayne Avenue over in North Scranton . So Mrs. Reed had sent the direction s to those residents . I'd like, Mrs. Reed, if we can send correspondence or e-mail to the police chief about buildings 26 and 27 at Hilltop . Received another call as you're probably familiar with from a gentleman who lives on the other side of those buildings . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 The people on that block cannot sleep because of the noise and disruptions . And it goes on until three, four in the morning . Apparently the Housing Authority or the secure force up at Hilltop , they wrap things up about one in the morning . But these things go on well after that. So if we can just notify Chief Graziano again that the issues continue to occur I would appreciate that. Also, Mrs. Reed, another reoccurring issue, I ran into a woman this afternoon who lives on Leggett Street in North Scranton about rocks and debris. It's almost like a mudslide if you could imagine that. When it rains and it storms, the rocks and debris flow out onto the street and settle right in front of her home and other homes on that block. She did inform me that the DPW Director was out. And they did temporarily take care of the issue. But she just wanted to let him know that the problem is recurring . Last week Mrs. Schumacher had requested the amount of money that is in the escrow accounts from the Scranton Sewer Authority . So we do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 have a copy of that which I gave you before the meeting . So that takes care of that issue. The final thing I want to mention tonight is about the recent controversy with the Fire Chief. So let me just start by saying that, you know, maybe I look at things black and white. But it's just a simple idea of the difference between right and wrong. You know, I want to preface my comment s tonight by saying that I have generally so far since Mayor Evans has been appoint ed agreed with almost all of the decisions made by him and his administration . And I think that he's doing a fine job so far. But I cannot and I expressed my feeling s to him this weekend . I cannot wrap my head around this decision . I am extremely disappoint ed. And I do not agree with Mayor Evans' handling of the revelation that the Fire Chief used a City vehicle and gas card on a trip to the Jersey Shore this past summer. Look, I understand that people make mistakes . We all make mistakes . And as Attorney Dempsey said, this certainly is not a witch-hunt. I mean, let's remember the facts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 here, ladies and gentlemen . We did not go out looking for this issue. This was brought to our attention . If it wasn't for a person or someone giving a tip to the newspaper , I doubt that anyone would have stumbled upon this. As I said, people make mistakes . But the Chief's actions in my opinion are so egregious that I do not believe they can be ignored . The decision by the Mayor to allow Chief DeSarno to perform a self audit of his gas charges is one of the most absurd things that I've ever seen in my time so far on Council . Chief DeSarno says in a letter to the Mayor, "Thank you for having the wisdom to discern that while I did use my car during the actual travel time in question , that filling my tank the next time the need arose as mileage records can bear out, using my own funds as I've also done in the past was akin to paying for my own gas and that there was not an attempt to deceive . Thank you for that," Mr. DeSarno says. I have an issue with his statement because there was an article in the Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Times I believe in August where the City Business Administrator said that the City does not keep or has not kept mileage records . So I don't know if Chief DeSarno is referring to his own records or the City's records . But if he's referring to the City's records , we were told that they don't keep them. The Mayor and his administration are also claiming that the reason there were no disciplinary measures taken against Chief DeSarno for using a City vehicle and City gas card for his own personal use is because they were afraid of a lawsuit since there was no policy prohibiting this usage. This argument is extremely weak. And I would strongly disagree on two points. First of all, it states very clearly and very plainly in the City's Code of Ethics under the section , "Use of City Property and Personnel : City employees or officials may not use any personnel equipment , supplies , facilities , vehicles or any other property owned and belonging to the City for their private purposes use, enjoyment or benefit . I don't know how much clearer you could be. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 My other question is, when did City-owned vehicles become personal vehicle s for anyone? I don't remember ever hearing about this being a past practice . There's also major liability issues. The Chief got into a fender bender in New Jersey. I don't know if there was anyone else in that vehicle . But suppose there was and the accident was worse, who holds liability there? It's insured by the City. My second reason why I think that the Mayor and his administration 's argument that they're afraid of a lawsuit is weak is that we shouldn 't forget that Chief DeSarno is a political appoint ee and a member of the cabinet . He's an at-will employee . He's not covered by any union. And quite frankly , the Mayor and Administration should not be worried or be afraid about a lawsuit . They should be worried about the disappearance of trust that the taxpayers have in their public servants . What kind of message does this send the fact that the Chief was allowed to do this, allowed to use his car -- or his City vehicle for his own 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 personal use and the only thing that happens is go do a self audit and let us know how much you owe and then you pay us, reimburse us. What kind of message does it send to City employees who do the right thing that the only ramification is that he has to do a self audit? To me it looks like business as usual. What's the most concerning to me, ladies and gentlemen , is that the Chief is in a position of authority as we all are. He's in a position of authority in which the public places their trust. The fact that he lied and told the Mayor he didn't use his gas card for personal use and then admitted that he did weeks later after the Scranton Times obtained that information should be enough or should have been enough. The fact that he even thought that using a City vehicle and gas card for his own personal use racking up nearly 40,000 miles in two and a half years, the fact that he thought it was okay should in my opinion disqualify him from holding a position of authority in any administration . And quite frankly , I still cannot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 understand how you can rack up nearly 40,000 miles on a vehicle . The City itself is only 26 square miles. So I don't know besides going to the beach where else he was going with the vehicle . But I think that's another thing that needs to be looked into. I also don't buy the Chief's argument that he gave to the Mayor and his Administration that he had operated under the inferred agreement with the previous administration that he had the freedom -- and these are his words to use both the vehicle and gas card as he saw fit as his own in essence . I asked this question or posed this question to the news media. Where is this agreement ? Is it in writing ? Did any other City employee s have this agreement as well? As I mention ed to the newspaper , I am really sick and tired and I have been over the last five years of this handshake agreement s or verbal agreements . We're not dealing with monopoly money. We're not dealing with money that grows off of trees. We're dealing with taxpayer money. And I have to be frank with all of you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I have talked to many people over the last few days. People are general ly disgusted . Why? Because take an average Joe -- Joe Smith who lives in a neighborhood in Scranton . If he had done something like this or thought that this was okay, he would have been gone the second that his employer found out about it. I had a person e-mail me with 35 years of experience in human resources who basically said the same thing. So, you know, I'm expressing frustration here on behalf of the people. And I think the majority of residents who have reached out to me who are just disgusted that it seems like there is no repercussions for this sort of action. Another point I want to make here is that I think it was lost in what one of the speakers said tonight was that the Fire Chief makes nearly $90,000 a year. There's no reason at all for any kind of perk or any kind of inferred agreement . $90,000 a year, ladies and gentlemen , is more than most people make in three years in this City. And you need a vehicle for your own 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 personal use on top of that? That is absolutely ridiculous . Every single day that we allow this type of behavior to go on unchecked , undisciplined , the confidence in our government erodes. I want to thank Mayor Evans and his administration for taking steps to correct this issue. GPS, which I had floated the idea to them a few weeks ago and they are taking that seriously . And I believe they are going to implement that, the new vehicle policy which I think is great. But I strongly urge the Mayor to reverse course here and hold Mr. DeSarno accountable for his actions . This whole saga is an embarrassment for every elected official , for every public employee , for the Mayor, for everyone involved in the City, especially coming on the heels of the former Mayor being charged with federal corruption and possibly going to jail. The other thing I want to mention is that and other residents had mentioned this and Council people tonight , the lack of oversight on this issue is absolutely unacceptable . The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 fact that no one was auditing this and nobody was looking at these records ? You know, you have to remember we're the legislators up here. There's a Controller 's Office that is the financial watchdog. There are other avenues here where people should be looking at this type of stuff. Where this went haywire where it went wrong where everybody stopped looking at documents is outrageous . And I'm glad that from now on they'll be looking a little bit closer. But again, this is the type of thing that leads down this road to people being allowed to abuse this type of thing and to go and check. The last thing I want to mention which I'm very concerned about, Council woman Dempsey and I have been looking to find a contract between the City -- a contract or a credit card agreement between the City and Sunoco which is the City's gas provider . We did receive documentation today from the Administration , a letter from 2016 from former City Solicitor Jason Shrive in which they were basically saying Valero who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 used to be the City's gas provider was going out of business . So they wanted to use Sunoco as a sole source. Director Gallagher at the time said they were willing to provide the same services that Valero did in the past. And they would also work with credit cards. We to this point cannot find any documentation of an agreement between the City and Sunoco. To me, that is extremely concerning . So we did ask Mrs. Reed to send another piece of correspondence asking them -- I don't know, to look again or to get something in writing . Because if you look further in this documentation in 2014, it was bid out. The gas services were bid out. In 2016 as I mentioned it went sole source and there was no bidding done. But there is documentation in here from Valero where they give the discount s on the gallons of gas and other documentation . Again, we have not received anything from Sunoco yet and that's concerning . So again, I would urge the Mayor to reverse course on this. Hold Mr. DeSarno 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 accountable for his actions. And as I mentioned earlier , this quite frankly is an embarrassment . It should never be allowed to happen again. The fact that some people are coming up and defending the Chief for using a vehicle because there was no policy is absolutely outrageous and ridiculous . You should have a policy. But people who are in position s of public trust should know better. They should know better. And this, as I said, is an outrage . And I don't agree with the way it was handled . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Picking up right on that, I did speak with Mayor Evans about this situation late last week. We had a lengthy discussion how he came to this decision . It is the Mayor's decision . It's not Council 's decision . One thing he did mention and I think it's been alluded to by some of my colleague s is the various attorneys that were involved in this process felt that this was the proper course of action. If my colleagues would agree, I would like to see the labor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 solicitor 's opinion on why this came to this type of resolution . I believe the new solicitor is Kevin Hayes, Attorney Hayes. If we can get what his take on it was, I think that would be helpful to provide some additional insight to Council on the issue. Again, it is the Mayor's call. People always want to see somebody get fired or put somebody 's head on the chopping block. To fire somebody over a lapse in judgment , that's a judgment call to be made by the Mayor. What type of agreement s were made prior is anybody 's guess. Unfortunately nothing was put in writing . So again, it is the Mayor's decision . I support his decision . But the bigger picture is this cannot continue to happen. There have to be controls that are put in place, the gas card audit limiting who has gas cards, limiting who has City vehicle s are all things that I think need to be addressed . There are obviously some City employees that do need to have a City vehicle 24/7. I believe a Fire Chief and a Police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Chief are probably number one and number two on that list as well as maybe a DPW Director and some other individuals . But I do think we need to limit it. There has to be a limit on where to draw the line. I know that Mayor Evans is leading by example . He's not taking the Mayor's vehicle . My three week stint as acting Mayor I did not take the Mayor's vehicle . We'll see who, you know, the next Mayor if they decide to take that vehicle or not and lead by example . But it is part of, you know, part of the compensation for the Mayor. So it's up to the future Mayors to decide. Something that is troubling to me regarding this gas audit is correspondence was sent to the Controller 's Office. We did get some information back asking for an audit. But we did receive a letter back stating that the Controller 's Office, a three year review will take a consider able amount of time. If you would like a three year audit done immediate ly I believe it would be appropriate to hire an outside auditor . Based 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 on our decision with Mr. Bulzoni he believes the same as well. I would just say that I strongly disagree with this. I think the reason why we have a Controller 's Office is to handle these types of issues. Again, a certified audit somebody mentioned has to be done by a CPA. Obviously , Council is looking for information to put control s in place so this doesn't happen again so there are clear black and white rules on what can be done, what can't be done. In looking back over the last few years to see what has taken place that who knows, maybe we'll be talking about another employee next week when we get more information . But the reason we have a Controller 's Office is to handle these types of requests , not simply copying and pasting numbers on a monthly or quarterly report. So it is very disappoint ing that this is something that couldn't be handled internally. I'm not sure of what the total cost is going to be of hiring an outside firm to do it. I do think it does need to be done. But I do think that this is something that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 should have been handled internally . And finally , I know the Ethics Commission was brought up by a couple speakers . I believe there is an appointment on deck pretty soon for that. But if there's not, I'm sure my colleagues would agree that we would like to see it get moving as quickly as possible . I know a couple of you have grabbed us already . And we're here to help any way that we can. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
