Marie Schumacher spoke on city business .) MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just one quick comment , I'd like to wish everyone a happy and healthy new year. We have a lot that we are going to have to get done this year and I'm hopeful that this council along with the administration will be able to work together for the betterment of the citizens that we represent . That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, I do. First of all, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of Dr. Peter Cupple. I had the pleasure of serving with Dr. Cupple on the Board of the Architectural heritage Association and the Historic Architectural Review Board of the HARB. Peter was a tireless advocate for the arts and a champion to the cause of historic preservation his entire life. He was a gentleman , a true renaissance man, and a great friend and he will be missed by every person that every crossed his path, so rest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 in peace, Peter. Since this is our first meeting of 2019, I find it only fitting that our first legislative act for the new year will be to introduce an amended ethics guidelines for the City of Scranton . In doing so, we are ushering in a new era or transparency and trust. The public deserves no less than than their government and I'm extremely proud to be part of a city council that has taken the lead on this issue. I would also like to thank Councilman Gaughan for championing the effort. While the new code is extremely comprehensive , I'm particularly excited that it will include campaign finance reform. I cannot stress how important and groundbreaking this is for Northeastern Pennsylvania 's largest city. This not only will help level the playing field in many ways, but it will attempt to minimize the impact of infusions of large amounts of money that may have influenced elections in the past and will in the future. Hopefully it will not. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Also, in the last four plus years that I have been a member of city council I can point to many positive achievements that have happened for the city because of the dedication of the gentlemen sitting to my right as well Bob McGoff and Joe Wechsler , but 2019 has the opportunity to be the most significant year ever in terms of creating lasting , positive change, change that in some ways may have short-term effects , but more likely will have long-term effects that will be seen for years and years to come, but none of it will happen without a renewed commitment from those that are charged with making that positive change happen. Tonight I'm reinforcing my commitment to make those changes a reality this year. Changes like seeing the implementation of See, Click, Fix and the Smart Cities kiosk program. Changes like a downtown mobility study that will focus on our city's walkability as well the implementation of many of the great ideas that I'm sure will come out of that study, a new zoning code, blight reduction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 recommendations including a revamping of the quality of life ticket program , the removal and reduction of dozens or more fees and fines as well as a revised condemnation and demolition policy. Additionally , we will need to make changes to policies that will create a more business friendly climate in every department in this city. The elimination of the unfair and Draconian mercantile and business privilege tax and it's replacement with a broader , fairer payroll tax, an expanded historic district for the downtown , the continuation of additional funding for the SHAP program , which is a successful program that we developed for first-time homebuyers. The development of a companion program which will be called a beautiful block grant program can be now shortly which we funded in part by nonprofits , foundation and others. The implementation of a permanent and comprehensive storm water management strategy . The continuation , of course, of the idea session s, the implementation of an internship program in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 our city council office, and what I view as a very important the expanded use of city council work session s to move along these and other initiatives that my council colleagues would like to champion . We need to root out and implement innovation at every opportunity . As I have stated before, innovation is only creative ideas that are complete d. 2019 would be about getting ideas completed . We have an opportunity this year to change our city forever and we can only do it together so my promise is that I will work as hard as I can to make those changes and others that we may not even know about it yet all occur in 2019. I plan on doing all of that with continuing civility , working with others and with the clear vision. And, finally , I promise what I have done for the four plus years to make those decisions without the need to view results through a political prism but in the context of what is right for the City of Scranton . So I ask my colleagues , all of whom who have shown great support for many of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 initiatives that were mentioned earlier , and members of the administration and the public to join in this renewed commitment for 2019 and let's make this year when real positive change happens and the great ideas are finally completed . And that's all I have for tonight . MR PERRY: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, I'd like to ask if we can send correspondence to the administration for an update on the Serrenti Center project . The city acquired this Serrenti Center up in the Hill Section and I would like a breakdown of how much money the city has spent to date and what grants we have been approved for. When the city acquired the Serrenti building I was against that for a number of the different reasons , number one being that I thought it would cost a significant amount of money, number one, to maintain the building and to improve it. One of the reasons that the administration used, from what I can remember , in saying that the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 needed to acquire the building was they needed more storage and if they did not acquire the Serrenti Center building they would need to build a pole barn structure on the site of the Scranton Police Department headquarters . So in the 2019 budget, it says that the city will be spending money to construct a pole barn in the parking area for storage . Again, I was under the assumption that this would not -- this expenditure would not have to take place if the city acquired the Serrenti Center so if we can get an explanation on that I would appreciate it. I'd also like to send correspondence to Mayor Courtright and the superintendent of the Scranton School District on what steps both administrations have taken or will take with regard to the recommendations and suggestions from the shared services committee . In December , Councilman Donahue and I have had presented along with members of the Scranton school board a list of recommendations , kind of a guideline on things that we found where the city and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 school district could work together to share services to become more efficient and to possibly save money, so I do think we need an update on that so we do not let that conversation die out, so if we could send that I'd appreciate it. Also, I did meet with Representative Julie Shoemaker -Cohen from the University of Scranton about the internship program between the University and our office. It was a really great conversation that we had, I would like to get this underway by the end of the month, in the beginning of the February at the latest. I have spoken to Mrs. Reed about it. There is a template that we are going to use that the mayor's office currently uses for interns that they try to get from the University so we are going to use that as a guideline and we will continue to have conversations about that, but I think moving forward that's a really positive accept for the city and for city council 's office. The other part of that, and Councilman Evans and I and Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Donahue , Perry and Rogan often talk about the city's lack of presence on social media, whether it be Facebook or Twitter , Instagram , whatever . It seems to me that there are a lot of people that use social media anymore, so I do think it would be beneficial for the city to have a presence on social media, whether it's pushing out notifications or updates to projects going on in the city, leaf collection when they are picking up garbage and recycling , different things like that, and I think we can tie that into our potential internship program with the University of Scranton so that's the conversations that are ongoing . In December I spoke about bringing the American Lung Association to discuss requiring more signage where tobacco is sold within the city and looking at possibly banging establishments from selling tobacco within 1,000 feet of schools within the city. I also would like to discuss the vaping epidemic and what we might be able to do legislative to curb that so I will ask my colleagues if we can schedule that meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 with the American Lung Association over the next few weeks. Mrs. Schumacher brought up tonight two points, number one, the homeless population and what the city's policy is or the police department 's policy, and the opioid crises. I think at this point we should probably invite, if my colleagues would agree, Chief Graziano in to discuss both of these topics, especially the opioid crises, we have had, as has been pointed out in the newspaper , multiple tragic overdoses over the last month. What we can do legislative I'm not sure, but I do think that we should get an update from the chief and see what direction our department and our city is moving in combatting that. Also, Mrs. Reed, if you could just send a reminder to the administration to see if they could put the 2019 budget on the website and an update on the capital budget as was mentioned as well. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . Just a couple of things from tonight 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 meeting . Mrs. Reed, if we could send something to Mr. Bulzoni and Mayor Courtright about the Arcadis study in light of everything that has happened in Luzerne County in the last couple of days it just puts a new emphasis on what we are going to be dealing with and I think we all are definitely in the know and should be in the know and deserve to be in the know of what's happening and where we stand in this process . It's been awhile since we had any kind of update on the status of it so if we can get a status on when we should receive something and if even if it's not a final living document is there anything they could share with us that we could explain or leak out to the public because , you know, this isn't going away and that bolder is only getting closer. And echoing what Mr. Gaughan said about Mrs. Schumacher 's comment , I think that's an excellent idea to get Chief Graziano in here on both issues, the homeless issue that we have is no where near the epidemic that is some areas, but that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 doesn't mean we don't have one and that doesn't mean that what we have we can't do better, so it's a good starting point to know where we are at and what we actually do about it current ly. And the opioid epidemic , you know, I was one of the first people on the record saying this years ago about how that devastates not only families but communities and our entire area and, you know, any life we can save is worth all of the efforts that we can put into it because it's an awful situation . And while we are waiting for Chief Graziano to free up a chunk of time to come and meet with us if it's not too much to ask of him could he send us the policy that he currently has and enforced with the Scranton Police Department for caring for, managing our homeless population in the city as well as the policy for administering Narcan, kind of centraled around the training , how we log it once it's used and do we have any follow-up in place for the recipients . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Other than that, I just want to say happy new year to everybody and hope everybody had a happy and healthy holiday season and thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING “THE CODE OF ETHICS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA .” MR. PERRY: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I am extremely pleased tonight to be able to vote on this legislation to completely revamp the City of Scranton 's Code of Ethics for several reasons . First, I think it's extreme ly important for the residents of our city to have confidence in the integrity of their government . Every single Scrantonian has a right to expect that all city officials are independent and are fair towards every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 single resident and they do not favor a small group of individuals or themselves . A strong Code of Ethics creates a standard of professionalism in the city. This type of the professionalism and transparency should build trust within the community . With several investigations by the Attorney General and Auditor General taking place within our community over the last few months and last few years, it's really caused a black eye for our area and I think it's an important that the City of Scranton set a standard that we are not allow and we will not tolerate any type of corruption . I think that this Code of Ethics should constantly , even after we adopt it hopefully within the next two weeks, be taken off the shelf, dust it off, and revisit it constantly to make sure that it remains up-to-date. One of the issues, and I brought this up a year or two ago with the current board of ethics is that it basically has as been nonexistent and dormant . Every single board members term had expired yet none were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 reappointed and no new members were appointed even after I had alerted the mayor and the administration . This legislation , it's my belief, gives the ethics board teeth and the tools to do their job. Clear guidelines on how the board should conduct their business . There's a few things I want to highlight. Now, this Code of Ethics is 29 pages so I'm not going to go through every single thing, it is available on the city's website and on council 's page if you wanted to view it, but just a few things I want to touch on. Number one, the composition of the board. This will be changed if this legislation passes. In the past, the mayor would have all five appointments to the Board of Ethics. Under this legislation , council will have two appointments , the mayor will have two and the city control ler will have one. I thought that was fair and I have to get credit to Councilman Evans with that idea. I originally wanted council to have all five appointments just for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 check and balance effect of the legislative branch on the executive , but I do think that that was a fair compromise . Also, within the legislation there are strict rulings become city employees and city officials receiving gifts and solicitations or acceptance of gifts. No city official or employee or a member of his or her immediate family shall solicit any gift, gratuity , money, favors, invitations , food, drink, loans, promises or other benefits from any person, firm, corporation , or association which to his knowledge is interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the city provided that city official or employee has any influence directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in the city's participation in those business dealings . There are several exceptions , I won't go through every single one of them. There is a case if you do accept a gift and it's not minimal , anything other $50, you do have to report that to the Board of Ethics 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 and then they will meet and determine if you have to give the gift back. So, again, there are several -- there is it a very lengthy process that is delineated within this Code of Ethics. Also, this was in the last Code of Ethics but I think it's important to point out, we do have a nepotism policy. Hiring a relative is a special type of conflict that should be avoided . No public official or employee shall appoint , hire, advance or advocate the appointing , hiring or advancing a member of his or her family, his or her immediate family or household member to a city position . I think that's important that that remains in the updated Code of Ethics. Also, whistle blowing , Mrs. Hodowanitz brought that up tonight . Employees are expected to expose any violation of this Code of Ethics by any employee or business entity and they should not expect to be reprimanded in any way or threatened in any way, so that is also delineated in our Code of Ethics. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 There is quite a few other things in here about fraudulent or other activity , use of city property and personnel , political activities , there is lengthy information ab out contracts , the awarding of the contracts , and then there are specific recommendations to the mayor on what happens if you violate the Code of Ethics. One thing we talked about in the caucus that I think is really important , this board will be required to meet every January and elect a chairperson and a vice chairperson. In the past, I don't think it was required that the board meet and, therefore , they became kind of ineffective in and dormant . This board will have to meet and they will be able to give city employees or city officials advisory opinions , and what that means is for any reason you think something is going to be unethical or may look unethical then you should ask for an advisory opinion and get an official opinion from the board so that you can avoid that whole process . There is a section about how can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 make a complaint and the investigation procedure that will take place then after that. I also want to point out, and I think this is very important , that there is a section on here about the confident iality of the complaint and the wrongful use of the Board of Ethics. I don't think anyone on this council was eager to, you know, redo the Code of Ethics so that there would be fraudulent complaints . In other words, this board -- you can't use this board to harass a city employee just because you don't like them or for any political reason. Again, if you look at this document , it is very, very specific . The complaint process is extremely specific , so in case anybody was wondering about that. And, finally , and what I think is probably most important is the campaign contributions and reporting requirements . Under this Code of Ethics there will be a limitation on how much an individual can contribute to any political campaign for city office. We are limiting it to $2,700 in a calendar year. So if you are donating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 to a mayoral candidate , city council , city control ler, tax collector , you will only be able to give a maximum of $2,700, and that is the federal limit. Same thing goes for political action committees and that will be $5,000, again, staying in line with the federal limit. I think that this is extremely important because we are attempting to take the influence out of the hands of a small group of individuals and putting them back in the hands of the people. It's time to lessen the influence of money in our local politics by putting results on how much individuals can give. Right now there are no limits, and we have seen in some cases in the past few years individuals that have contributed tens of thousands of dollars to one candidate . So, again, I think that this Code of Ethics is long overdue . I think that the one component of this that is going to be extremely important is that the Board of Ethics educate , and there is language in here that the Board of Ethics has to educate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 every single city employee , because as was mentioned in the caucus there is 29 pages to this Code of Ethics so you can't just expect every city employee to understand the intricacies because it does get -- it is very lengthy in here with some of the procedures , so the Board of Ethics is tasked, according to this legislation , with educating all city employees and all public officials , so whether that takes place by a seminar or a meeting once the board is up and running that would be up to the Board of Ethics. I like to schedule a meeting with Mayor Courtright and his administration to discuss this legislation . They were given the legislation beforehand , but I really think that this is something that the mayor and I and the mayor and our council can partner on and can work together on and we can send a clear message to everyone in our community that we are setting the bar very high where it should be. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Anyone else? I want to thank Mr. Gaughan for the hard work that he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 has put in these so many months tweaking and getting this. Also, our solicitor , Mr. Minora, I know you worked hard on this as well. It's long overdue . I believe , Mr. Evans, I believe you said that last year, last December or last meeting , which it is, and I also hope that this becomes a template for other local governing bodies to use in the future. MR. GAUGHAN : By the way, I do want to mention , I didn't recreate the wheel here, this legislation I used the City of Reading as a model. There was an intense amount of corruption that went on in that city a few years ago with different elections , so they had updated their Code of Ethics to guard against that so I don't want to make it seem like I sat down and wrote this all out by hand on napkins , I did use the City of Reading as a guide. I talked to their solicitor . Mr. Minora also was in contact with the solicitor , so thank you. MR. PERRY: As my tenth grade English teacher said, Bill, when you get a compliment just smile and say thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR.
