MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MR. KING: Here. Please dispense with the reading the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. CITY OF SCRANTON SEPTEMBER 9TH FLOOD EXPENSE REPORTS RECEIVED FROM CITY ADMINISTRATION ON NOVEMBER 15, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So this Friday, December 1st at 5 p.m., there will be a Scranton Police Department Toy Drive at Laceworks Tap and Grill, 524 Court Street, Scranton , PA 18504. Please bring a new unwrapped toy.

It will be at 6 p.m. at the Keyser Valley Community Center. MR. KING: Anyone else? Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First off, I just want to mention that the Friends of the Scranton Public Library are conducting a book sale right now at the Market Place at Steamtown . It will run through Sunday. Hours are basically the same as the mall's hours. It's a great opportunity for finding some very good Christmas gifts, especially for children or even your friends . This is a book I got, hard cover, Tom Clancy novel publish ed in the year 2000 for $28.95 brand new. It's probably at least $40 if you bought it today. Two dollars , okay, I'm not poor but I am cheap. So I recommend if you want to get some really neat gifts they have DVDs, music CDs, puzzles , lots of books for children and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 adults, a lot of great things and a lot of Christmas ornaments so check it out. So what's going on with the 2022 audit that is only 59 days late? MR. KING: I believe it was received , right, Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's right. They received necessary information from the Sewer Authority . And I believe it's projected for a few weeks away. I'll get a date. MS. HODOWANITZ : All I want for Christmas is a printed copy of that darn audit. That's all I want for Christmas . Well, maybe not just that; but what are we doing about the labor contract s that are still not posted to the City's website ? The firefighters ' contract , the arbitration was completed 240 days ago; police, 123 days ago. And originally we were told that it would only take 120 days to tidy them up and get them on the City's website . So where do we stand now? MR. KING: Nothing has changed from last week to this week, I believe . They are still working on it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MS. HODOWANITZ : I'll tell you, you know, cha-ching, cha-ching. I haven't gotten an answer to my right to know request . But I'd love to know whether Ufberg has a cap on how much his contract pays or it's just open-ended billable hours. What a way to make a living. Did we ever find out who is the labor counsel for the Single Tax Office contract ? That one seemed to flow very quickly . Nobody knows? Okay. Has anything else been -- I see a lot of the tax resolutions are in tonight 's agenda. Has anything been done formally with regard to tax relief for the September 9th flood victims , any kind of legislation ? MR. KING: Not yet at this point. But I'm expecting that to be put together . MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm watching you guys. I'm not going to let you forget. MR. KING: That's coming. ATTY. GALLAGHER : I actually thought I had sent it out. Apparently I didn't. I drafted a legislation . I will send it out this evening after the meeting . MR. KING: Okay, yeah, we had asked, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 right, so our Solicitor has been working on it. He'll send it to us and we'll get that moving. MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. Now, I saw an article in today's paper and it gave me quite a bit of heartburn . It's about the three police officer s that were investigated for the overtime scheme. The one that concerns me most is the one that's never been charged. Now, is that very fair to him that he's been under investigation for something like 18 months? But the other side of that coin is, this third person has been on paid leave for roughly a year and a half and has not been charged with a crime. A right to know request which was done by the newspaper granted in May of this year showed that this person was paid more than $102,000 during the time he's been on paid leave. Now, that was as of May of this year, you know, I wonder what that total is right now. Here's the problem . First of all, how long is the investigation got to go on, you know, either the man's name is cleared or it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 not. Bring charges , you know, poop or get off the pot, number one. Number two, while this man is on paid administrative leave, isn't there something he could do to serve the city? Remember Covid-19 when a lot of people were able to work remotely from home? Isn't there some clerical function like maybe typing up the police and firefighter 's contracts , something . You know, when I was in the military , we made people work even if they lost their clearances under investigation . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Joan. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner, taxpayer . I was happy to see in the paper this morning there was a decision on the pool at Nay Aug that there's going to be two pools now, I guess a lap pool for people to swim laps and a smaller one, I guess. Is there going to be a splash pad? Is there a date when it's going to get started ? MR. KING: I believe that that's -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 it's already started I believe through putting out an RFQ for the design; is that correct ? MR. SMURL: Yes (inaudible .) MR. KING: Okay. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Thank you. 7-K, asking about the waiver for the Parks and Rec Director , wasn't it just introduced last week in Fifth Order? How did it get from Fifth Order to Seventh Order tonight ? What happened to Sixth Order? MR. VOLDENBERG : That is a resolution , Mr. King. MR. KING: It's a resolution . It's not an ordinance , so it's two readings . MR. SPINDLER : Okay. It just seems like you are in an awful hurry to get this done because that's I think you know you're doing something wrong. All right. Again with the pool, I hope when they are ready, I hope it's going to go back to pre Doherty administration when it was free swimming . He put his wonderful water slide up and started charging people five bucks to get in. I think it should be free swimming for city residents . If people from outside the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 city come, then maybe they should be charged . It should be free. It was always free swimming for city residents . I think it should go back to that. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Elaine Allegrucci . MS. ALLEGRUCCI : Good evening , everyone . I'm Elaine Allegrucci , Scranton resident , lifetime and a Keyser Valley resident 40 years. Thank you for the opportunity to speak in this public forum. I consider it a privilege to represent my fellow resident s. I'm not here to relive the devastation of the life-changing event of September 9th. I am here to say what has occurred since that date in response to our outcries. Curbs have been rebuilt to replace those that have been run down and worn down over the years, which did add to the flooding event. Washed away portions of properties have been refilled and repaired. Mosquito spaying has taken place to remedy the infestation from the stagnant water from the flooding , drains have been flushed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 We succeed in organizing a neighborhood walkaround with approximately 30 resident s for three and a half hours at which four of five City Council members , thank you, along with the 911 Director, County Controller , Mr. Gallagher , greatly appreciate it. And everything was done to answer residents ' questions . Destroyed sidewalks have been repaired, debris had been removed , several appearances have been made by the Mayor, PEMA, FEMA, etc. We succeeded in organizing an appearance at the October 3rd City Council meeting right here at approximately 40 resident s showed up for their support for all of us. The work that was done was directed by the Mayor and carried out by the DPW, most of which happened within less than 24 hours of a phone call. Approximately 90 grant application s have been filed by impacted residents . Moving forward I want to cordially invite everyone here along with anyone else that you may think may be of assistance to us to this public meeting . Thank you so much for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 reminding everyone . That meeting was organized by Mayor Cognetti . And the meeting is taking place on Wednesday , December 6th at 6 p.m., at the Keyser Valley Community Center. A network has already been coordinated to notify residents . We are all well aware of the depth of this project putting all of the past hurdles behind us but are also committed to making sure that this project gets started and completed in 2024 beginning in the spring of 2024. Our goal is to prevent such a nightmare from this reoccurring again. As many homes were condemned and lives were destroyed , we still have resident s living in public housing , hotels, staying with family, fighting for their homes yet still cringing with every raindrop that falls. This is not exclusive ly to the valley but the west mountain as well. Again, we realize this is an enormous feat but we also are committed to its completion . Hopefully this is the last time storm drainage will ever be a topic of conversation . Again, thank you for the opportunity of being here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 We look forward to seeing each and every one of you next Wednesday at the Keyser Valley Community Center. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Allegrucci . Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, Keyser Valley taxpayer . I want to say thanks for the people who organized the Toys for Tots. And it's a car show that I believe it's Saturday at the Steamtown garage down underneath . You know, I just want to put the thanks out there for the people who organized it. You know, I wish it was -- that kind of thing was around when I was a kid. Now, my family, I come from a family of 12, 10 brothers and sisters . And, you know, growing up we didn't have no toys. So, you know, what these people are doing is really something , like I said, I wish when I was a kid. Today though, I get to give back, you know, people who know me know I got a couple of hotrods that I want to take and show off to the kids and maybe see the small kids that are interested in what I love. That's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 real blessing . I want to talk about two weeks ago I heard one of the residents come up here. And he was supportive of the tax increase for the property taxes. You know, I can't believe that somebody is all for it when they are so high already . You know, are there really people like that? I don't know. But most -- a lot of us are senior citizens . We live on a fixed income. We live day to day. And the increase in property taxes, I don't know is -- we're afraid of losing our houses because we can't pay the taxes. They are ever increas ing. And they are so high now. But to me, I can't believe like it's a no-brainer that retired people over 65 should have to pay school taxes. You know, doesn't take much to figure out I don't have no kids going to school. You know, I mean, I paid my share over my lifetime . But 65 and Social Security just doesn't do it. I also want to talk about the infamous 24 inch pipe that is above Merrifield Avenue. I just don't get it why they don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 take care of fixing that pipe. That's going to not solve the whole problem but it will save us from the next flood which is definitely coming sooner or later. Also with the winter months coming now and a lot of -- if we get heavy snowfalls, you know, then it's like an un-- it's not a common thing but, you know, when you get a warm day after heavy snowfalls and you have that melt, that causes flooding problems too that we're, you know, we're all scared of up there. But I don't understand they discovered that that pipe that was stopped by one of the neighbors there on Briggs Street, you know, they found it out to be not his property . So it's such a cheap fix that's going to save us. You know, I just don't get it why something can't be done about that 24 inch pipe. It was said that the way I understand it that they are not going to do that until they do the whole project starting way up on West Mountain up at the turnpike . You know, we all know that's going to take many, many years to get done. So why don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 they do that 24 inch pipe? I don't know. I can't imagine what the reason to not do that. We even get an got an estimate . It would cost maybe $10,000 to do that. What's the big deal? Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . Sunday I read Kelly's latest incredible misuse of the facts in the Times, of course, making those mentally defective enough to purchase properties built on coal slag across from 100 years old landfill and declare this mediocre assemblage the victims . This is senseless . It wouldn't stop with these people. But they do have some solutions . One of them is you keep widening it enough, maybe the government will have a buyout which they won't. Maybe they could close this wretched sordid place. That would never happen or they just keep on aggravating the issue. Our waste rates are equal to mortgages and this can happen, believe me. Also, it appears to me that Kelly wishes to avoid his past ill-conceived esteem for his new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 friend is Sadod{phonetic } who so openly is a staunch loyal anti-Israeli , anti-Jewish racist supporter of those murderous jackals in -- that started this war -- this terrible war. I judge this by his past letters I've been reading for years to the paper. It seems like they can't wait to print one. I don't think he likes anything Jewish. I don't know. I never talked to him but judging by his letters . You know, Saturday there is another one joined these two from the Abingtons . I can't pronounce his name. Hammy Bistif{phonetic } or something . But he wrote that this is Jewish propaganda , Israeli propaganda , never happened. How do people like this -- I just don't understand how people like this can exist with these terrible thoughts . Maybe the three of them can join hands and dance to the Israeli revolutionary anthem. And there is one believe it or not. And anybody that wants to hear it, you could look up on Facebook I think it was the first week in May, 2019. There was two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 young Arab speaking little girls reading in a 2 minute video. And they come out with such -- by the way, this has been translated so Americans can have it. They come out with such lines as we would chop their heads off and so. This is their children from the mosque that we protect to be liable to say such things. I don't know. But this is to me, they ought to use the tunnels for a sewage system when we have to go back and rebuild Gaza and that would just be for another war probably . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , two things to start off here with today, the book sale at the mall, fantastic thing. I hope some people go there and buy some books and actually read them. And the other thing I have here is, you know, listening to Ron speak today, you have to ask yourself how a country has protesters protesting on behalf of terrorists . And I just think the best solution to the whole problem is that if they violate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 the law, take them into a courtroom , order them to do six months in jail or watch the videos of the people being murdered by Hamas. I think you should give people a choice. They had a choice and they do have a choice to speak their mind. But the things they are doing go way beyond that. The other thing I have here today is there is no update on the Mayor or her legal team in regards to things I filed in Federal Court, not that it's important . But I think that people should start watching these meeting s. They don't have to watch them on ECTV. They could put pull them up on YouTube and really pay attention and listen to what's taking place in our government . Now, it's my opinion that the pool project at Nay Aug Park was not a worthy project . It just isn't designed right and it doesn't meet the requirement s of the community . And it was based too much in politic s and too little in reality . It's easy to squander a lot of money and not meet the needs of the public. But I do think that the residents need to come to a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 realization that we need to rewrite the Home Rule Charter . We need to gain control of grant money. We need ordinary resident s to be able to come forward and voice their opinions on where money needs to be spent and remove it from politics . The city's population base has continue d to decline over my entire lifetime . People come here that at one time lived here and ask how does a city become this run down, misapplication of grant money. Just because you spend 5 million dollars , 10 million dollars , any figure you want to choose, doesn't mean that you are solving any problems . It just means that you are spending money. And when you look at the haphazard way that this money has been spent over a period of time, I'd really be interested in the city looking backwards 30 years and coming and laying it here all on the table and tell us where we've spent all of this money for 30 years and look at the benefits it's given the residents . I think the city lacks the commitment to spend its own tax money in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 city. We're always doing something with a grant. But we're not directing city-based revenue to any major problems . And when we look at our city, we have to ask the residents why so few of them vote and the answer is very simple. We have a government . It's like welfare to be honest with you. We elect people. They give us no benefit for the wages they receive . And all the people that come here and ask about audits and freedom of information , somebody has got to convince me why a free people don't have every bit of access to every bit of information this government possesses unless it's classified for a worthy reason. And to hash it back and forth is utter silliness because you're just a beggar begging your government to respond to you and tell you something they want to keep secret. And it's also time for these residents to realize that you have to start watching these meeting s. You have to organize . And you have to change this charter . Maybe we don't need a Council or a Mayor anymore. Maybe we need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 another form of government . But the one group of people we need to empower are the resident s. And we need to stop putting them in debt. We need to start cutting the amount of taxation and the amount of wasteful spending . The one thing to remember is, you have to control your past before you have a future. And that's why this city's population has declined over my entire lifetime because the people in this city don't have a future because they don't want one. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . Once again thank you, Senator Marty Flynn, for covering up the graffiti . Once again no city officials were present . He also cleaned up graffiti at Weston Field on Providence Road. This is where the Director of Parks and Recreation works out of every day. You would have to see the graffiti every day on your way in and out of work. But the administration wants to give this guy a raise and an assistant . Is this paying contract ors up front 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 with grant money something new in this administration ? Is that something we've learned in the Harvard Business School? Does that violate contractor 's law from the early 2000s? Does it violate any grant rules and regulations on the city's part? And can we be penalize d and held accountable for doing something like this? Or is there just another set of rules as do as we say, not as we do. You're all aware of the ethic boards. 7-K, Resolution 346, 2023, when you violate your own rules you are aware of the penaltie s that the ethic boards can hand out against you guys. Okay, with the rash of water main breaks lately, are we prepare d for fires when there is no water or low water pressure ? Saturday night, November 25th in the rear of the 600 block of Prescott Avenue, it might have been Buenzli Court. There was an issue of no water and very low water pressure . Tanker trucks had to be brought in. That's fine. I'm not looking to be a Monday morning quarter back here tonight . But as a precaution , when a break 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 like this happens and it affects the size of the area like it did, wouldn't it be wise that we would have tanker trucks stationed in the city from other communities and others on standby as soon as we're notified of the break? It was almost 24 hours later. Considering the water main breaks are more frequently lately, calling for tankers after the fact it's not only dangerous to the men and the women fighting the fires, it could be devastating to property loss. More importantly , would you agree it's important that we investigate purchasing our own tanker truck and maybe a foam truck? It would be beneficial . After all, we cover part of Route 81, part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and it's 2023. We all know the traffic is at an all-time high. With all the seminars , conventions , FEMA and PEMA disasters attended by a select group of fire department members , I'm sure we could agree this equipment is warranted . Having this equipment may be also billable when called out to accidents . Let's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 not forget we have many bright red shiny pickup trucks running around the city for fire department . We don't have a problem with that. It's not my problem either. The city administration may be very aware of the pickups due to the right to know filed on city vehicles that I had filed. The fire vehicle s were the only ones listed by the city. Last time we checked pickup trucks didn't put out fires, tanker truck and foam trucks do. If you want to justify the red shiny pickup trucks, they're good for the Gerrity 's and the Redner's runs. Can we justify the cost of a pickup truck versus their use, examples as insurance , gas, maintenance , wear and tear. Couldn't some of that funding be used for (inaudible ) the city's beautiful piece of apparatus , the rescue number one truck that we have? That's a piece of apparatus that deserves funding . Did you ever see that running down the road? It looks like a big red box. Do we know how much we're paying for the sheds for the fire departments that we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 getting them? Rumor within the ranks has it that we're buying a shed for each firehouse but we're buying it one at a time. Well, we're all smart enough to know what happens when we buy one item at a time without bidding it out, don't we? Have a great night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I love to wait for negotiations , we need to move on and approve the city's HUP legislation and move it out of Eighth Order. Letting it sit and die is not in people's interest . City Council requested and pushed for it and City Council should own the terms and the limits placed on it. I hope you would add a directive to work the top 100 first and then once top 100 are taken care of, report back to City Council before moving forward . City expenses report, the document provided page one duplicates page two except for a mystery increase in the Keystone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Container Line. 447,512.26 engineering estimate is no way reasonable as an -- under an emergency order. I really can't see how an estimate is an emergency order. The only way that I could see that it's put there is to inflate the numbers and to avoid oversight . Johnson College equipment and damage, $28,991.69. I believe Johnson College is probably insured . IT equipment listed as seven and one month. Seven what? Listed is also two hotspots and a printer at $10,000. I'm curious on the $35,428.40 in Scranton Police Department equipment charged . And can you tell me what the overtime rate is for DPW equipment that's listed? Does it get retirement benefits , the equipment ? Will DPW straighten overtime equipment was charged at $61,185.26. That is not for the personnel . That's for the equipment . Why are resident s in that listed in donation s counted -- resident donations counted as expenses ? Let's not forget while Johnson College is getting $28,991 and change, we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 bickering about the city tax relief of 2,000 and 2,500 for most of the homes in that area. I would give it to almost everyone . Doubling the percentage of damaged as a discount , 10 percent damage, 20 percent tax relief up to 50 percent which would be 100 percent tax relief for anyone above 50 percent ; 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 percent brackets . I understand you're going to table 5-C, but I have multiple issues with this. The fine structure for the handicap parking space is $75. And I believe that's too low. Most of the -- make handicap violations excessive to promote avoidance. Philadelphia , it's a $250 fine. Understanding the issue, I would like to see it at $150 not $75 for handicap parking. Section six should include immediate towing for any vehicle in a handicap spot. You get a ticket, a tow truck is called, the car is impounded if you're not lucky enough to get back and move it first. Section D4 states there's an appeal process and in the event of an appeal, goes to the one board. On a two to two vote it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 deemed denied. For a civil fine, why is this? Evidently Scranton needs even less than a preponderance of the evidence and not even a simple majority to find a plaintiff guilty which is completely opposite from any court where you go in and you charge someone . The burden is on the people prosecut ing. If it's a two to two tie it should fall in favor of the people who are appealing the fine. The citizen is also stuck with multiple steps, which is wrong. I have to -- I get a ticket from the city. I appeal to the city. If I lose that, I appeal to the city so the city can see whether the city and the city's representative was correct in appeal before I move onto court. There shouldn 't be that many steps. 5-B, the parking lot. As 11 car open space requires a Certificate of Occupancy as talked about, that's insane. Does is it need power? Does it need electric ? Does it need a sewer system for its occupancy ? Since it conveys any property over 10 spaces that means the university apartments , city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 properties , any business like McDonald 's that have over 10 spaces offering free parking for patrons are underneath this. And last, 5C is even hotter as Section 9, Subsection 439 -- 439-60B, defines a private parking lot as not applying if they do not charge with no mention of parking for patronage. I guess the Law Department decides to toss out any consistency in definitions between the two legislations . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I was happy to look at the early addition of the -- online of the Scranton Times because since Serrenti -- a report on what's happening up at Serrenti has been declined by the city, they do have one in I guess it's tomorrow morning 's paper. And I think it's very interesting and maybe why they don't want to talk about it. And I think you people need to get involved and find out what's happening and maybe go back and see what they promised when they bought that and see how they compare . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 But also the real reason I'm here tonight is a couple weeks ago I noticed that it was reported that there is water flowing down Snook Street from Lake Scranton from Seymour up to Lake Scranton . And, you know, it's not bad when it's warm out. But when it gets cold that white stuff turns to ice and it gets very dangerous , especially if you've got a slope. And, of course, as you know I think before you came in today, it got pretty cold and that is causing I think problems . Now I ask -- I have been looking at it and the water is coming from one place. And I know Snook Street has -- it's sort of crazy. Some lots have gutters and drains and other sections don't. And I think this -- where the water is coming from probably doesn't. But as I pointed out, there is a drain about 15, 20 feet at the most above at the very next lot and why, you know, some piece of plastic piping can't be from the one that's putting the water onto that 15 or 20 feet away into a drain just goes beyond me. Now, I did ask that that be looked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 at. Did anybody look at that or ask if DPW looked at doing that? MR. KING: Did we inquire on that? The drain is up above where the water is flowing down. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. MR. KING: Let's check with DPW and see if there's anything that can be done. I'm very familiar with what Mrs. Schumacher is talking about. That is a major part of the stormwater project that's going to happen up there. But in the meantime it is, like, it's bad. I mean, especially now it's starting to freeze. Part of it may be that the drain is uphill from where the water is coming from. I don't know. But we'll look into that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. I'll be back. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I'd like to point out once again for the 150th time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 whatever 37.5 percent of the buildings in town are owned by 501C3s, they are tax exempt. And many of them or most of them do admirable things. However , they are a significant burden on the residents that do have to pay school taxes and city support taxes -- city maintenance taxes and so forth. And we need, I feel, to look into the possibility of going to the courts to get the Pennsylvania Constitution put aside after a certain point. They can't keep requiring us to cover for an ever increasing tax exempt organizations and expect the people remaining behind to pay for it. It's just too much. The water company , I propose that we not only complain to the PUC who I regard as useless, it's time to look into potential of going to court or at least examining their bill of sale and promises made that they wouldn't -- they would keep the rates steady. And I did a little math years ago. I talked to somebody that was involved with water quality in Northeast PA. And it -- they have 25 years to fix this. They actually went 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 to court with the EPA and got 25 years. And the American people got -- or people of the area got bamboozled into thinking that this all had to be done overnight or they're going to have to move out of their house or something . And then we got the colleges involved . And they came up with this wonderful Henry Amoroso . And nothing that he promised ever came to fruition except that the water company will have the right to pick our pockets clean. And I don't know about anybody else, but I'm still angry about it. Every month I pick up the bill and look at it and there is some other excuse why they should be able to charge me 20 percent of my personal income to deliver water. And by the way, last week we were out of water for a day because the brand new pipes they put in sprung a leak. So -- and those pipes will be there for 50 years from now once they are finally fixed. And finally , I have a little time left. There's an article in the Scranton Times. They sent their employees out of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Times building to work at home. And there's a few people going to move into another building . And some of the articles in here are from people from Schuylkill Haven. Like, really? What does that have to do with our area? You know, it's really a shame that this has gotten to this point. I won't stop buying the Times because I need information from local people. But here we have Bloomsburg new opinion on Social Security . And it's all about the average jerk getting screwed . And that's about it. Forget -- higher wages would put more money into Social Security instead of $7.25 an hour. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I love the looks on your faces are very not happy. But I only have a short thing today is about the Nay Aug Park light show is on and up and running . And just to let anyone that isn't familiar with the light show that it does start at 5:00 and runs to 10:00 Monday through -- for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 the whole week Monday through Sunday. And there is a horse and buggy ride that runs through the park which is very festival and adds to the experience of being in the park. We also are looking for volunteers to help collect . And if you look at the -- everyone doesn't have Facebook . But if you could look online at Nay Aug Park, the schedule for the -- volunteer schedule should be up. And we always need volunteers to help collect for as the people go through the park. We do give out candy canes to those individual s that come through the park. So I'm here tonight just to ask for the assistance of our city residents to come out to the park. And it's free. And there was an article . I don't recall who it was that gave the ranking , but Nay Aug Park was one of 19 great displays in the State of Pennsylvania . So I think that's kind of neat. So to the residents out there, if they could just add that to their holiday list. That would be great. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . MR. SMURL: Norma Jeffries , I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 always happy to see you come up and speak. MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , Rick Little. I'd like to talk about the media and the judiciary . I watch the news and US Marshals took care of the -- one police officer who was collecting $5,000 working at HUD or not working at HUD. And he had to pay $17,000. This is what the media reports . There's construction going on at Scranton Housing Authority for the last three weeks that block the bus stop. I don't see any permits . It's a Linde Corporation doing the work, L-I-N-D-E. And it's just like everything . The Scranton Housing Authority whose board is chosen by the Mayor and you, it's a fiefdom under itself, could be a thing of great revenue for the city, for the county. But they have co-opted all parts of it. SHA was incorporated in 1939. And there's just too many lawyers . And I notice there's lawyers everywhere in this town. But who is -- who is protecting the interest of Scranton lawyers or protecting the county? All of these not for profits , I see the adds today, you know, these not for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 profits, these 5013Cs, you know, the Area Agency on Aging, Medicare Part C, and Lackawanna Pro Bono and NPLS, they are the only legal protections that people have. I know that it's like communism because in 1902, all Lackawanna Real Estate records were moved to Lackawanna , New York. So it's really hard to get a handle on anything . But the fact of the matter is there is no permitting and they're blocking the bus stop with this construction . And SHA is a fiefdom unto its own. A couple weeks ago they granted everybody from SHA a 4 percent raise. I know the salaries are astronomical and the people in place there, you know, the district attorneys , the ex-commissioners for New York -- for the county and police officers have been working there for years. It's part of the power of the district attorney and the two district attorneys who run SHA and continually take them to this Court, the magistrate court. There's no records of this Court with docket numbers so anybody could follow up on anything with it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 It's all dancing around a communism . I hope the new board of commissioners are -- get ahold of this. But I hope the city gets ahold of this situation . We're talking about signs and taxes and everything . The City of Scranton should demand an audit of SHA, its namesake because they are stealing Social Security . And they're ruining the whole area. Let's see, it's up -- I guess I'm out of time. But they are squandering money with 501C3 grants. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, just one. Mr. Voldenberg , I've received some requests to have the intersection of Birch Street and South Washington Avenue looked at for a possible traffic study to see if we could put a left turn signal -- or a left turn lane and a right turn lane at the bottom of Birch where it meets South Washington . They say when the Wright Center lets 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 out or South Scranton Intermediate lets out, you could be at that intersection 10 minutes because some cars want to turn right and some left, but just to see if it is wide enough to actually put those lanes in. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll send it out, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No comment s at this time. Anything that I'm going to speak about, I'll speak about on the question . MR. KING: Thank you. Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple things that were previous complaint s that I wanted to check back on that hadn't yet been resolved . One of them was the Front Street, Orchard Street alley which it's still in the same state. I think we had heard that that could be going to the magistrate but didn't get a date or really a clear response on that. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could once again check 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 on that one for me. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll get a date. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And then I didn't see anything , but did we receive a response on a parking study to be done at the corner of Colfax and Olive Street? MR. VOLDENBERG : No report as yet. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And also wanted an update on 621 Rear Alder Street which was supposed to be going to be the magistrate but a date also was not set from what we received . But that was several weeks ago, so I would assume there's a date now and the neighbors are asking if we could find out that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll get the information from Mr. Sunday. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. Thanks much. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have one concern that was brought to me today. And it's up on East Mountain . And this concerned resident sent me some picture s which I'll share 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 with you later, Mr. Voldenberg . But the issue that is there is about leaves that are collecting at the catch basins and they are coming from down -- MR. KING: Excuse me, Mr. Little. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : They are travelling down East Mountain Road from Yesu Lane. And they are not leaves that were bagged and put out to be picked up. They're not leaves that were raked in a pile so the vacuum could come and get them. This is just happening normally and it's causing , you know, the catch basins to be, you know, blocked . So could you please reach out to DPW? Maybe they would be able with the sweeper swing by or the vac or both to eliminate this problem . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And in addition , do Froude and Brook while you're at it. Maybe they could swing by there and do the same thing, Froude and Brook. MR. KING: Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few responses from last week. A streetlight was installed at 300 block of Walsh Street after a petition was received from neighbors and subsequent approval by the city engineer , Scranton Police Department , and DPW. Special thanks to DPW for the quick review and installation . A resident of the 700 block of Orchard Street across from Whittier Elementary contact ed City Council to assist in issues on the block that include request the delivery truck to the school that delivers goods at the end of the delivery day, she's requesting that the delivery truck deliver goods at the end of the day rather than 6:30 a.m., on the weekdays . The beeping reverse warning light is loud at this time of the morning and also to address traffic and speeding down Grimes Court. Students use Grimes Court each morning to traverse to school. There was a request the city paint over the crosswalk to nowhere in front of their property that ends on the front 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 lawn. The crosswalk was placed by Scranton School District and they advised they will let the marking s wear away and not replace it. The resident s would like the city to remove it. All appropriate department s have been notified on this issue. We sent Mr. Patrick LaFrance 's claim to the city administration and LIPS Department on Wednesday , November 22nd for review and response . The city is reviewing and will advise. With respect to the 2024 budget, this Council is continuing to work on making amendments to the propose d budget by the Mayor, hoping to finalize those amendments by -- hoping by Thursday or Friday of this week so we could post the amended budget up on the website for the resident s to review. We're obvious ly hoping to reduce the propose d 3 and a half percent tax increase to at least get that to somewhat of a reasonable spot, although I realize that any increase is not -- would not be considered reasonable . But we're doing the best that we can.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 But we will try to get that amended and posted on the city website as soon as possible this week prior to hopefully passage on December 5th. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

SCHUSTER : On the question , I brought it up in caucus and in the background information it does say that there's a Lamar sign that's on this property and that the city is now going to be taking on that lease. So if we could just get a clarification on that lease from the administration , Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. KING: Did it say 750 or 775 a year? If we could just get clarification if that is, in fact, the case and the length of that and the term. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. KING: Thank you.

MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-K be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SMURL: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? On the question , this is $110,000 of city funds that will be spent doing the study about possibly moving Engine No. 10. I'd rather see $110,000 go into the redesign of Engine No. 10 in the exact spot that it sits right now rather than moving it off East Mountain . We've been through this once before where they closed Engine No. 10. There was an incredibly bad fire on Froude Avenue. Someone almost died. The house burnt to the ground. I will not be support ing this. I would rather see this funding go directly toward just redesigning Engine No. 10 in the existing footprint of where it is now so it can continue to serve the resident s of East 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 Mountain . MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'd also like to give the same sentiment . I think $110,000 could be spent maybe somewhere else. So moving forward maybe we'll have that opportunity and maybe the administration can bring us a different option. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , we're studied to death. We constantly have studies . We don't rely on the expertise within the city. I always say we probably have the best fire department in the State of Pennsylvania . I don't think we need a feasibility study. I think with in-house we need a logistics study, how to apply the $110,000 for that location and not waste it on, you know, an assessment from an outside company . So I would rather see that money spent on either expanding it, rehabbing it, or logistical ly making it work instead of giving it to another out-of-town group. So I will be voting no for this. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. Opposed?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. SMURL: No. MR. SCHUSTER : No. DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR.

MR. KING: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , you know, I'm just reiterating what I said last week. This piece of legislation never even should have came down. It violates our Administrative Code on multiple levels, period. I was recently elected to represent the voters, resident s of Scranton . I can't represent them and follow the code if I vote against it. So, I mean, I take -- like I said last week, I take this -- my role very seriously and my responsibility to uphold the Administrative Code whether I like it or not because it's the code. It's the rules that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 follow. This is nothing personal with this gentleman . But it's just, you know, multiple levels here that have not been followed with regards to the Administrative Code from here and administration . So, of course, I will be voting no. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I'd echo the same sentiment as Councilman McAndrew being consistent . This is something we both talked about with several waivers that have come down. So it's nothing different than some of those other waivers . So I will also be voting no. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR.
