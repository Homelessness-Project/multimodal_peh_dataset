KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a three comment s on Third Order items. 3-C, we have an emergency declaration from the administration for the demo of 1007 Quincy Avenue. Frank, can we reach out and get the total price of that demo plus the contract for the demo in regard to Item 3-C? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. In regard to Item 3-J, I did take a look at the Controller 's report. For some reason I missed that. It was on the agenda today. I thought it was going to be on next week. Can we also reach out to the administration and see what the list of the Mayor's dues and subscriptions are for Item 3-J? And then for Item 3-L, there was an address I put in 1102 and 1104 Dartmouth Street. I put this in a couple weeks ago. We did get a response back that I think code enforcement was working with the SPD on this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 address . There really doesn't seem to be too much of an update. So could you just check to see if there's an update on 1102-1104 Dartmouth Street, please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Any other comments on Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two quick ones. So this Sunday, February 26th, the South Scranton Neighborhood Association will be at the North Scranton VFW on Rockwell Avenue from 1 until 3:30 for hometown hero banner signup for the North Scranton initiative . I would like to applaud Mr. Bob Gattens and Tom Pattison and crew and team that actually started this in South Scranton , the Hometown Heros Banner Program . They did Minooka . They did East Mountain . They helped with the Hill and now they're helping out in North Scranton . So they've done a fantastic job. And I just wanted to make mention of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that. And then my second one -- both of these are on my phone so give me a sec here. Also up in our neck of the woods on Sunday from 6 -- it starts at 6 p.m. The doors open at 5. It's the Holy Rosary Center Basketball League fund-raising event. It's the Scranton Police versus the Scranton Fire Department . Presale game tickets will be available on Thursday , February 23rd from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Holy Rosary. Adults $5, student s are $2. Game tickets available on Friday between 6 and 7:30 p.m. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I'd also like to announce -- I know there's been quite a bit of interest . The Scranton Planning Commission will meet tomorrow evening for a work session at 5:30 and a Planning Commission meeting that begins at 6 p.m., where they'll be looking to vote on the zoning ordinance . DR. ROTHCHILD : I have an announcement to add. Councilman Smurl and myself yesterday morning went over to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Enterprise Center on Lackawanna Avenue, the Chamber of Commerce 's center. On the second floor there they have I believe it's 14 spaces, office spaces. And they've got various business es and entrepreneur s that are there. And we had the opportunity to meet with a number of them. And it was really great to see these businesse s that are here and the startups. And I think that there is a lot going for us as a city. And I did see these people here that many of them came from out of town, aren't from Scranton . Some are, but there were certainly ones from other areas and decided to bring their business and their ideas to our city. So it was really great to see the work that they're doing firsthand and to meet those people. And I'm sure Councilman Smurl felt the same way and we received a lot of information from the Chamber about it. So we'll definitely be looking forward to seeing what more they continue to do. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: First speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First thing I would like to address is the Friends of the Scranton Public Library are having their quarter ly book sale starting next Monday, February 27th and running through Sunday, March 5th. It will be on the second floor of the Marketplace at Steamtown Mall right in front of Crunch Gym. This is a real good deal. You could get children 's books, adult books, young adult books, CDs, DVDs, audio books, all one to two dollars . This includes hard cover nonfiction al books that might run 50 or $60. You could get them for two. In this day on inflation , I mean, what would you rather have three hardcover books or a dozen eggs? So this is a great thing. The profits that the friends make on these book sales go for children 's programming at the Children 's Library up the street. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And I remind everybody if you have children or grandchildren or nieces or nephews or neighbors , you know what it costs to get a library card? Nothing . It's a service we offer to the community . So if you get a chance, come over next week. It's a great deal. You won't find a better deal anywhere in town. Now, where do we stand on the audit for 2021? MR. SCHUSTER : I did get an e-mail. Mr. Voldenberg followed up with Kohanski and Company and stated that Matt Domonice {phonetic } advised the BA's office and HR Department to followup with the actuary Foster and Foster regarding the GASB-75 report. That's the only thing that I have there is that they followed up with it. And from the auditor , they said they should have the Scranton Sewer Authority audit in today or tomorrow . That was on Thursday . So that last Thursday or Friday they should have gotten the Sewer Authority audit. And they are just waiting on the OPEB report from the actuary and they should be wrapped up in a few weeks is what the e-mail says.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MS. HODOWANITZ : For those who don't know at GASB-75 is, that's government accounting standards board statement under 75 which took effect in 2018, some time ago. And it has to do with other postemployment benefits , the retirees health insurance and life insurance for retiree and their spouses . Now, since this has been in effect since 2018, they should have broken the code by now. They should have figured out a way to get this done in a more timely manner. I understand the Sewer Authority , you know, they aren't answerable to the city anymore. So they'll take their own sweet time. But GASB-75 should not be an obstacle . And they should be able to get this done, especially with Rainey and Rainey holding their hands. How are we doing on the negotiations -- the arbitration for the police and firefighter s' contracts ? MR. KING: Progress . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. It's only been 417 days since their contracts ended. I find it very interesting that we are having a Planning Commission for the Zoning Board, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 that's tomorrow . Do you have a sense of when the zoning ordinance would be put to bed? I mean, how much longer is that going to drag on; does anybody know? MR. KING: Rough timeline would have it up for a final vote here by probably mid to late April. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Also, with the audit, I haven't seen legislation come forward for the new auditor Clifton , Larson and Allen. But you already started late because you don't have the 2021 audit done. Did Kohanski give a projected date when they're going to have a draft ready? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. HODOWANITZ : No projected date? MR. SCHUSTER : No projected date. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, you know, it was due on September 3rd. Has the Mayor said anything about the penalty clause about getting our 10 percent clause back? MR. KING: Not since I spoke to her last week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, if she says no, I would like to know her reasoning because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 it is taxpayer money. And four years in a row they have not managed to get it done. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . The first thing I have here today is, you know, I'd like to speak to the residents of this city for a couple minutes here. You know election time is coming. And we really need to do something about the candidates that we have that are running for office. And we need new candidates to come forward who have never run before who may have some new ideas and bring something to the table. I'm really troubled by people who were previously elected for a position and then run for another position and they did such a terrible job in office that it was a detriment to the residents . And from lack of another candidate , they get elected and the damage they do continues on and on. I really think there needs to be a review of Act 47 in regards to the city and why it went into Act 47 and what the landscape of the city looked like when it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 went into Act 47 and what the landscape of the city looked like when it came out of Act 47 because in my own personal opinion , I think the City of Scranton came out of Act 47 much worse than it went in. In my opinion , I don't think there was any reason to have ever gone into Act 47. And I think we should know what the Pennsylvania Economy League was paid by the City of Scranton or the government in any fashion to do the work it did here. Now, my issue with ECTV hasn't been resolved yet. And it may take a little while. But, you know, I'm really concerned when a community has a government TV channel . I think Joseph Gurba would love something along that format when the government preaches to its citizens on its own stage and lacks -- and lacks the ability to allow any dissent anywhere . And when you look at the City of Scranton and you look at the neighborhoods and you see the despair and the neglect and the decay here, is it being driven by Scranton 's own government ? Is that what's destroying the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 city, the people we elect? I mean, that's something to really look at and look at very hard. I think that the residents have made a lot of mistake s. And I think the federal government has made many more. And I'd like to highlight that by the train accident in Ohio. Now, I worked with a lot of toxic chemical s at one time as a spray painter . And I was breathing fresh air from outside . But the plant that I was working in, the employee s didn't have that opportunity . So a vast majority of them came down with chemical ly induced asthma because they were breathing chemicals in the air. Now, we have a President of the United States who many say can't do his job because of his mental state and they say the same thing about the person we just elected as a Senator in Pennsylvania . And he's in a hospital with depression . And, you know, when you have a Secretary of Transportation who doesn't come to where the accident is and you've got people sick, a massive spill and animals dying and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 grown and people suffering with headaches and then you have two Governors , one in Ohio and one in Pennsylvania discussing the situation and they're going to decide that they're going to burn these chemical s and release them into atmosphere and don't go to the federal agency that has the ability to make a smart and rational decision on that, just do it as a Governor . And then what you do is create a place that's so toxic that I think in the next 10 or 15 years these people are going to die in massive numbers from the amount of toxins they've breathed in because politics was in play. And don't forget the government in play during 911 when all the firemen went there to fight a fire and they thought they were fine and then they all died of cancers and various illness es. And then the federal government didn't want to pay them. But, you know, the one thing I worry about is where we're going as a city. And like I said, I haven't been to the courthouse yet with ECTV and I don't know where that's going because I haven't had -- I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 took this Monday off to do research at the law library in Wilkes-Barre because Scranton doesn't have one. And I really feel sorry for the residents , okay, on the state of affairs of this city. And the only ones that can change that is you, the resident s. And you need new candidate s for public office who understand what the role of a public official is. It's to serve the public and to ask for audits for decades. That's only one issue, but there's a host. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I guess my first thing I'm concerned about is the sound system here. I don't know how far along that's going. Can we expect something soon? And the reason I say that, I came in late for the NDC presentation which is always a hot button of mine. And I like to hear everything that they have to say. Of course, with the gentleman 's back to me I couldn't hear 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 everything . I looked at the slide that he had up on the screen. And that was small. And I couldn't read that all of it and maybe that's my eyesight. But it just seems like it could be a better presentation as far as the sound system and the slides that are shown to the public. I'm concerned and have been concern ed about the parking downtown . I have gotten several tickets downtown . And then I realized I had to register a credit card. I guess that was best, my debit card. And I registered . I call it my fun debit card because I wouldn't put my one that I live on on a public system like that. But I did register my debit card and it does work, you know, I registered that. And when I'm downtown it does work. It's a good feature . However , as Mr. King stated, so often those kiosks are not working . And you could never -- you have to walk to a couple kiosks. And I know they said, well, just go across the street to get a kiosk that works. And so I was glad that he mentioned that tonight about the condition of the kiosks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Now, I could not hear his response as to what his response was to Mr. King's concern about the condition of the kiosks. But I hope it was that they could get them up and running a little quicker rather than having us walk across the street, especially on Washington Avenue. Traffic is pretty heavy. MR. KING: That's what he said, Miss Jeffries , yeah. MS. JEFFRIES : Is that what he said? MR. KING: He's going to check on to see how long it takes typically when one goes down. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. So that was my one concern because I do use it a lot on Washington Avenue. And then my other concern was, how do they decide where they put the kiosks? Is it a matter of just a revenue thing where they could just fill their pockets with money? Because when I see them up around the hospitals at the Moses Taylor and my mind says Mercy, but it's not the Mercy. It's Regional and, you know, the one up on (inaudible ) and I think it's just such a shame 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 that they've got those kiosks in there for people to put in for parking . And, you know, I've seen the people driving around and put the tickets on the cars, which seems so self-serving for the parking because they're getting money on it. No concern about the -- wherever it is that the person is going through that had to park their car there and didn't get back out to put money in it. So it just seems that there should be some kind of leeway, some kind of grace period, something around those kinds of buildings . And I also wondered as he was showing the slides and the money that came in from the credit cards and the coins just how much money of that is coming from the businesses . Is there any breakdown as to where does that money come from? Is it most heavy in the city? Is it most heavy around the hospitals ? Where is it coming from? I know the total figure was there. But it made me think where are they getting that money from? And, you know, I enjoyed their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 presentation and I was glad I was able to participate -- hear part of it but what I could hear from the gentleman from the back. But I'll have to listen on ECTV and pick up the rest of it. So I'm hoping you'll have a good report for us soon on the sound system in here that we could all hear what's going on as the presentation s are made. Okay, that's it for tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Mr. Voldenberg , can you reach out to ECTV and maybe I'll reach out to the Mayor too to see what we need to do to expedite getting the sound system updated ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. They have an auxiliary speaker set to go up halfway down the wall in the near future. MR. KING: They do, okay. Well, apparently they're not working because if the citizens here are struggling to still hear we're going to have to try to see what we could do to improve that. So we'll continue to make that a priority and try to get that fixed for all of you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . I'm going to throw a few quick things out there. In reference to the meter parking , two weeks ago I actually went to the courthouse to look up some information right across from the post office. And I had to go shopping for kiosks because I was only going to be in there for a few minutes. So I pulled out two quarters so I could dart in and dart right back out. The first kiosk I went to was not accepting coins. I did the whole process , went to put it in, no good. I went across the street, same exact thing, had to walk down the street and around the corner to actually find one that was accepting coins. I asked the gentleman from the park authority -- the parking group before he left, I understand that some of these kiosks are electronic . And if they go completely down they could send a signal to basically tell them that they are down because they're not pinging . If they're partially down not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 accepting coins or something like that is there any mechanism in place so that they actually call a service call because it's partially down. He said, well, I could get the app. Well, of course, I could get the app. But I don't like the tracking . I don't want to put my credit card on there. And it's not something that I consider a priority . If I'm going to be there for longer than a short period of time I have feet. I'll park outside the city and I'll walk in because it's better for my health. So I asked him that and, of course, he said he would look into it. Last week when leaving Council we got a first-hand experience of a handicapped issue in this building . Me and Mr. Schuster were leaving by the back and we went to hit the handicap button for opening the door to exit. After trying it a few times we figured out is that the handicap button for exiting the building is tied in with the security 's locking system. So once that door on the back gets locked where there's a key card necessary for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 it, it seems that the button to open the door from the inside no longer works. So if you're handicapped in the building , you're solo leaving the building and there's no one down there, congratulations . You could press it as much as you want. That door will not operate because it's been turned off by the door security . You could open it once you use a key card on the main door on the outside , but other than that you can't get out if you're handicapped . Whoever did that, good job testing . Planning Commission for tomorrow , it's very nice that on the City's website it notes that the Planning Commission meets on the fourth Thursday of every month. This month as it's been noted, the fourth Thursday of every month is occurring on Wednesday . So whoever maintains this, if they've changed the dates to Wednesday , we really shouldn 't be advertising that the meeting s are on Thursday , but Thursday comes on Wednesday . For the Planning Commission , they're also having something on their agenda for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 finances . Thankfully none of us get to see it because they don't actually publish any information . They just put the agenda up there without any detail. Last, I'd like to make a statement that we are almost at a year that Ukraine has been fighting against Russia. As of this point, 144,400 Russian soldiers have been killed in the conflict . By estimates , probably about a third of Ukrainian forces have also suffered those losses. So we're looking at this point somewhere around 200,000 to 225,000 total lives lost in this year. To put that in context , we're looking at three times the volume of every man, woman, and child in the City of Scranton being killed. It's a hard battle. And as we look forward , it's important to understand that our funding going forward to Ukraine is critical . And for those who oppose it because they don't think we should be invested in their, to back out at this point is to say that if someone stands up and they hate China -- if someone stands up for long enough against the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 US, the resolve will break and you'll back out. So backing out at this time only goes forward to reenforce to China that if they stand up against our resolve , eventually we'll back down. God bless Ukraine . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . My favorite issue, tax exempt we're at 38 percent . We've announced a tax increase for this year on property . And it's directly related to recent properties going off the tax roll. And I wish it could happen that tax exempts could team up with the city and petition the state to replace some of this money. It's -- I don't see any way forward for much of anything if we keep going. And we're probably going to be 40 percent or maybe by now -- and it just keeps getting larger and larger and falling on fewer and fewer people. We have manufacturing plants. There's a quarter of a billion dollars going to be invested in General Dynamics and the output for our artillery 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 shells will be 400 percent . Those are good things if they are going to Ukraine because I'd like to see a few of them land on the Russians myself. I'm sick and tired of seeing this, women in labor being blown to bits and hospitals and schools and you name it. I just seen a picture of a whole family, a mother and her family was just wiped out laying along the roadside . And it was pretty much a direct malicious attack. So please support Ukraine , people out there. It will just get worse if old poopski -- I mean, Putin gets his way. Apartments downtown , I said last week and we should encourage that these landlords actually have parking authority space for their tenants . Once again Friday night I went to my favorite pizza shop and rode around the block and then took a space where I'm carrying the pizza across Lackawanna Avenue. It's just not viable. And with this weather , the further you carry it the colder it gets. So we're actually parking businesses out of their business . You know, it's -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 the school taxes are going up again. And I never seen a financial advisor to the city or the school that didn't absolutely love another tax increase even though the lawsuits I read some articles on it, and it happens in other states. It happens in our state. And the people that commented on it said don't hold your breath for anything to improve . So a lot of these state legislatures , they just thumb their nose at it and, yeah, okay, we don't have to deal with it. There's no penalty for court decision in that case mostly if the judge tells you to clean up your property and you're a private citizen , possibly . But, you know, it just goes on and on and on. Most schools are underfunded. General -- or Governor Brown back in Canada cancelled a lot of taxes -- or not Canada -- Kansas. And they actually had to leave school out in March. This was a few years ago. But this is how critical taxes are. And finally I'm real tired of hearing about problems created by the withdrawn job killing federal regulations and then people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 coming in here and blaming the Democrats for all the problems . That railroad had the regulation s were revoked by the Trump administration . And that train was on fire 20 miles almost down the line. So what's wrong with the camera? I've seen it on camera. Why can't the railroad see it on camera? MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : There's a 100 cars with a liquefaction plant out in Bradford County. MR. KING: Okay. MR. DOBRZYN : -- get ready people. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. ELLMAN: Good evening . Again, I urge Council to investigate some source for property elders like myself to convey factual information of their immediate neighborhoods to the personnel that will be doing the reassessments . They're only looking for positives . I forgot what year it was when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Mr. Cordaro was in. The lady came to my house and I talked to -- my house was reassessed then. It must be like 10 years ago whenever it was. These people this -- there's no way for me to convey to them how my immediate neighborhood has declined because of really just two households that just been there for months. They have destroyed my neighborhood with the way their property -- they have nothing to lose. They don't have nothing invested like my street has in the past. These people have created poverty . I got this slumlord next door. He could care less. He'll milk that house dry. And then the people across the street, they have destroyed a beautiful piece of property . And they're still parking there. It belongs to the city. It's just impossible to tell whoever is going to reassess my house how bad things are because of, like I said, a couple weeks ago my house values will go up. The insurance will go up when the reassessment comes. And that's just a phoney like a used car lot man telling you what your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 property is worth. This is nothing but a fraudulent reassessment . It's a shame what you people are allowing to happen to the taxpayers of this city. All I could suggest if you can afford it is get a lawyer like WNEP and hope for the best. They got thousands and tens of thousands off their taxes. It was -- it's a shame that the city allows something like that, plus the other two companies that were given deductions . You know, you make heros out of the developers . They work on taxes and tax deductions . Giving the museum was great to me. It's not like it's costing anything . They're probably charging off more on their taxes than they could rent the stores for. Real quick, I want to tell you something . Sunday I was taking Rosie to church about 9:30 just down North Main Avenue. And all of a sudden, two or three cars come at me like on my lane of traffic . They were passing four or five or six people jogging , young people. Now, why was the joggers in the street? Because there was a half dozen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 vehicle s on the sidewalk and they couldn't use it. Now, why are there half dozen vehicle s on the sidewalk is being because people are renting rooms out to these transients. That's what's destroying this whole city wherever you go. There shouldn 't be a vehicle allowed on a sidewalk anywhere . They are for pedestrians . I walk every day four or five times with my puppy. It's impossible . The same people park there like I said on 57 Parker Street. But they half quit. I don't know if they moved out or what happened . But you're just waiting for someone to get run over unless you start enforcing a code that's on the books about parking on the sidewalk . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. VERCHUK : Hello. I'm Eli Verchuk from Leslie Drive once again. And just over a month ago I request ed that the Leslie Drive street sign be replaced. And they did it today. And I would just like to thank you guys and DPW. It's very nice. And all of Oakmont and East Mountain is happy to have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 sign once again. They're very pleased . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you very much for reporting that to us. That's great. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening . I think one of the things that might help in us hearing back there would be maybe to invest in a higher quality microphone for this table of the same quality of this maybe and maybe one at each end. MR. KING: Mrs. Schumacher , can you hear us better when we are up here in other words? MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, yeah. MR. KING: You can, okay. But it's during those caucus that you can't hear. MS. SCHUMACHER : Right. MR. KING: All right. MS. SCHUMACHER : Although up here some of you have a tendency , like, to look at over here to that side or not be very close to the microphone . And it would help if you guys were closer to your microphones too I think when you speak. And, you know, not put your hands in front of you between you and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 microphone . MR. SCHUSTER : I do think if we do get the type of speaker that Frank is talking that's facing the crowd it's going to be a whole different ball game because right now basically like a musician on a stage we have monitors that we can hear ourselves . So sometime s we might even tone down our voices because we hear ourselves too loud, which will bring it down to the crowd as well. So if we have some speakers that are facing the crowd it will be a big difference . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. When's that going to happen? MR. SCHUSTER : Hopefully soon. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, onto the agenda. I'm definitely in favor of 7-A. The only way I would change that would be to make it a more than a five-year term because Mr. Gattens and his committee do a really good job up there. And now back to reading my handwriting -- 5-B. This is the appointment of someone who resides in city but are not allowed to know where that is, I guess. To the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 position of director of -- yeah, I don't know what that was for. But anyway, effective February 6th, 2023, why bother? That was the beginning of this month. Why not before? I mean, what's the point in voting after it's been done and the person's been at work for almost a month? I just wonder do you know has he stopped the DPW workers from picking up the recyclables in the blue bags? Somebody was here at this podium and showing how they're going to people -- commercial businesses that they are suppose d to be getting their own private pickups. MR. SMURL: They have stopped picking up all business recyclables . MS. SCHUMACHER : Are you sure about that? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : I don't really think that's true. But I'll -- MR. SMURL: Well, they were told to. I was with Mr. Pietreface today up at Nay Aug Park and we discuss ed it. And he said it they have -- they were all told to stop picking up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 business recyclables . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, okay. I don't believe that is happening though. He might want to go out and follow them someday. Okay. And 5-E, isn't this building a private building ? Why -- why are we paying for this if it's a private building ? MR. KING: I don't believe that we are paying. I think that they've applied for a RACP. And this is just kind of like a passthrough . They have to -- if they are successful , they'll have to match that amount. DR. ROTHCHILD : Correct . We're just a conduit for these grants. And it doesn't just have to be nonprofit entities that apply for these grants. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, if I could have just a couple more seconds. I would like to ask you people you know how long it's taking to get the rights of way from the Sewer Authority . And that Meadow Brook has 48 rights of way that need to be sought. And I would think you might want to start having a periodic report from the legal department and not wait 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 until the last minute to see how many they're working off. MR. KING: Okay. We'll check on that. Thanks, Mrs. Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton City taxpayer . We've been hearing a lot tonight about parking issues, not being able to pay for parking , not being able to find parking , parking on the sidewalk . And I think it's worth considering why it is that parking is such an issue. I mean, the easy issue that is everybody in this city or almost everybody is the city is require d to own a car. There is no adequate public transit in the City of Scranton . Colts does exist, which is better than many other places can say. But Colts doesn't cut it, especially not for the city itself. The last I checked , the last bus out of the city left at 5:15, only minutes after normal business hours. And it's not doing a good job of transport ing our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 citizens where they need to go. That's why our streets are constantly filled with cars. But on top of that, there is plenty of parking in the downtown. I could think of at least five parking lots that I've never seen above one-quarter capacity . So we've dedicated all of this space to cars. We've dedicated all of this traffic to the city. We've destroyed our public transit networks . And where has it gotten us, empty blocks that aren't used that aren't taxable . They don't bring revenue . They don't benefit the citizens , people spending huge amounts of their income on automotive . And, of course, this is all started way back in the 50s. So it's about time we try rectifying that. And the first step is to revisit something that's been discuss ed quite active, like, a few years ago and merging Colts and the LCTA, the Lackawanna County -- or County Lackawanna Transit Authority and the Luzerne County Transit Authority have no reason to be two individual organization s. They hardly cross paths. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 incredibly inefficient . The bus shuffle to get from here to Wilkes-Barre or back is nonsensical . Having one single transit authority for Wyoming Valley not only makes sense in terms of finance s but also will adequately or start to adequately match the needs of the public. Most people commute to work in a personal vehicle . It's up to 89 percent of people in Scranton . I think it's 86 percent people in Wilkes-Barre. That's a lot of motor traffic that's destroying our roads that our communities now have to pay for. And the demand for parking has again levelled blocks of our city. I was at a lecture the other night on black neighborhoods in Scranton . And I notice that a good majority of them were completely levelled to make room for wider alleys or parking lots that are entirely unnecessary . Scranton is historically the Electric City, not the motor city. And even Detroit has better public transit that we do. So it's about time that we start really investing in our people and putting the citizen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 first and the car second, if not even lower on the list. There's inadequate housing in Scranton . But there's plenty of space with all of these abandoned parking lots. Our community isn't thriving the way it could if we had adequate housing if we dedicated all those lots to mixed use properties to have small businesses and give property ownership to citizens in the community . We're expecting the train from Scranton -- I'm sorry, the train from New York to Scranton . And that's probably going to come with an influx of remote workers from New York who are going to come here and find there isn't much place to live. There might be properties but there isn't a place to live. There's not much to go to. There's not much to do. And we need to -- we can fix that pretty easily by changing the way that we view our cities, view our communities and a relationship to the actual physical space of the City of Scranton . Too much of it is dedicate d to cars. Too little of it is dedicated to the people. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And this leaves us with poor dying communities who are moving out being pushed into financial ruin as we've discussed previous ly with the sheer expense of car ownership maintenance and fuelling . And it leaves the city with huge swaths of land that don't draw in any revenue to reinvest into our community . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. SCHUSTER : Excuse me, Delmar, can you please state your address for the record? MR. GUZIEWICZ : My address ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MR. GUZIEWICZ : That would be 75 Laird Street Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania , 18705. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. LITTLE: Hi. I'm Rick Little from Scranton . I first like to commend -- I hope I say his name right John Bal -- MR. KING: Basalyga . MR. LITTLE: Pardon me? MR. KING: Basalyga . John Basalyga . MR. LITTLE: Yes. The guy who runs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 the mall now and he's a developer for moving the -- giving free space for the Civil War Museum which is great that was in this building that I saw years ago. But that's exemplary . I'd liked to talk in broad strokes a little bit about a whole bunch of things. My experience , you know, one of the main reasons I moved to Scranton is because of my childhood being brought up in Wheaton, Illinois . Scranton is the county seed. And it was an all American city in 1955. And we in Wheaton, Illinois where I grew up in DuPage County was also an American city in 1967 the year before I left there to move to western New York where my parents were from. My dad was a City Council man in Wheaton, Illinois . I grew up on a street called Liberty Drive. And I'd ride my bike right down Liberty Drive and run right into the DuPage County Courthouse . And so I've always been interested in government, you know, real government , not politics but government how it works and the branches. It just blows my mind how people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 think of Republican judges and Democrat judges because that's totally against the whole idea of the judicial branch, the constitutional judicial branch probably before 1871; but, you know, it's I live in Scranton Housing Authority . And there's a lot of very bad treatment of the elderly. And I hear people talking about, oh, let's save the planet. Let's recycle . Well, half the population of downtown Scranton is the elderly. And, you know, a former Mayor of Scranton , Mayor Durkin who served from 1922 to 1926, he went onto be the head of Scranton Housing Authority for almost 50 years. And it was thought of as a place for the elderly. I never thought I would become an elderly person. But I'm there. And it's horrible . It's a (inaudible ) into itself with -- they have a lease that's 30 years old that they keep pulling out. They don't even pull it out. They just mention it, you know, because I go to get my lease. And they wouldn't give it to me because they have -- they put these people in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 without last names. It's basically a (inaudible ) under its own without police protection , without proper fire protection and most of all, without code -- without code enforcement protection . In the big picture , there's a lot of Covid fraud. Also, you know, why don't we have the recycling in Scranton House Authority ? That's one idea because that's most of the population . Why don't you make them recycle ? But, you know, this whole -- after going through the whole Covid thing and these people bursting into my door and just spreading fear all the time with the police because I realize , you know, their lawyer is the district attorney . And he has, you know, he has the magistrate judge right in his pocket. I mean, everything is illegal . I learned about this because I spent many years in New York Family Court. And, you know, there's just -- they destroyed my family. I haven't seen my kid since she was eight. She's 22 now. But, you know, this -- there's Covid fraud 360 billion . That's 35 million an hour 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 for two years. We got to the get to the bottom of how the government 's working with the fraud coming from the federal down to the county level. The county is the key to everything that you're going to see in the future. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I have a few comments . First, we've been speaking about City Hall ADA compliance and handicap accessible so -- and the city had posted out front new handicap signs with some arrows and things on them. I would just like to remind you, City Hall was placed on the registry of historic places in 1981. So when we placed the signs out the front they really took away from the appearance of City Hall. So I've been speaking with the members of Architecture 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Heritage Association in Scranton . And I received an offer from them to replace -- pay for and replace all of the existing handicap signs around City Hall, just the City Hall building . They would all be ADA compliant . But they would be historically correct to the building . So you don't just have to have white and blue signs, you know, the handicap . You can -- they could look better to fit this building . So I want to know if the city will agree on having this done. So, Frank, if you would ask Director Oleski if that would be his department and if you could help us with that to see if that could be something that they would allow the Architecture Heritage Association to do at no cost to the city. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. The second thing is the recyclables . A few weeks ago I asked the DPW not to pick up recyclable s for buildings . So since then they were most from what I've seen, they have ceased picking them up. I'd like to know if it's possible for the DPW to continue picking the recyclables up but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 at a cost to the businesses . I would just say take, for instance , our garbage fee is $300, maybe a $300 fee to pick up recyclables . We have equipment . We have the people to do it. Our DPW is more than capable of doing this. This would bring in if you multiply -- if a thousand businesses did this and you multiply that by the $300, this would be income for the city. I was also told that our tonnage of our recyclables and stuff that we receive a percentage of money towards that back. I don't know what that all entails but I will follow up on that. But it is some kind of a credit with that. So I would like to know if -- Frank, if we would send this to the Law Department and get an opinion on it because I'd really like to not downsize our DPW. And then if we cease picking all of this glass and stuff up I certainly don't want to see it winding up in the woods or other places. But right now in the City of Scranton there are no recyclable companies that I know of. So what are we going to do with this stuff? I'd rather see the money. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 I mean, if I had a business and I had recyclable s and it was $300 a year and it's just simple for the city to come and continue picking stuff up, I think that is one way of correcting them not paying for it. But I see no other way out. We can't just leave it go. Okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out tomorrow , sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And one more thing. I had sent a request into the administration to consider painting Council Chambers . If you look around at all the white dots, it's really not a good look for the city the size of Scranton after you took all the pictures of the mayors down to just have white dots all over the wall. So I sent a request in for that. And that is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : To follow up on Mr. Smurl's idea there, you know, I think it's a good thing that the city looks into the feasibility of what he was discussing with recycling . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 If we could also add to that I did get a call from the legion down in Minooka just to see what their status would be as the only legion in the City of Scranton . So if we can just add onto Mr. Smurl's request for the feasibility of that, what status the American Legion would have and how they could go about possibly getting their recycles picked up. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Other than that, I did want to ask about our pave cuts. Mr. Voldenberg , if you could reach out to the administration , DPW, whoever is handling the pave cuts at this point in time, are we currently billing the utility companies for our pave cuts and then can we request the last six months -- six months of billing including January and up to this date in February of those pave cut buildings . Also, it was raised in public comment tonight about the Meadow Brook Project . Could we reach out to the Law Department to see where they are with the securing of the rights of ways? There was 40-some. I would say high 30s into the 40s of how many rights of ways 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 there were. I know that there was only one secured as of last year. So if we could see how much they've secured to date and where they are with that project . Moving into DPW, can we also reach out for an update on Rubicon , what are the savings to the city at this point in time and have the routes for refuse collection been solidified through the Rubicon system, also, update on electric vehicle s and also an update on our six new refuse trucks, specifically the 11 yard truck and if we've received our five 20 yard trucks. But with the 11 yard truck if we're using it for route pickup and how that's working out for us. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, there are a number of things I want to bring forward tonight . First of all, I know it was on our code enforcement report that we received but the address of 417-419 Harrison Avenue, it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 been a persistent problem with them leaving their trash out for the majority of the week. And I know that they've received quality of life tickets . I'm not certain if they've been paid or not. But I think there's renters there that aren't getting the hint because I drove past tonight as I normally do going up Harrison Avenue and they had their trash out already . Trash on the Hill doesn't get picked up until Thursday morning . So that's too far in advance and not only are they putting it out, but they usually just have bags and maybe one container . And with the weather that we had earlier , the sudden storm, all the wind and rain and sleet, I'm sure that trash is gone all over the place and is no longer in those bags. So if we can please revisit that property and figure out a way to get them compliant with our garbage rules. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : And I receive d a complaint from someone regarding 1210 Vine Street and wanted to get this sent forward . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 They did send this initially into 311 and that was I think towards the end of last month. And the issue still hasn't been resolved . So it's in regards to street sign I believe a permit parking sign that is in the front of that property . They said that, you know, University of Scranton student s stole the permit parking sign off of the post in front of the address a few months ago and now there's no nearby sign so that people know that it's permit parking and so people are constantly parking there and receiving tickets or fines for parking in a permit parking spot but without a sign to designate that it's permit parking . And so I'd like to get DPW on that as quick as possible in order to have the sign placed there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I also -- this is a previous complaint for South Washington Avenue. There were trailers -- empty trailers that were being parked there. And I think it was resolved for a little while. But they started up again. I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 there was at least one parked there. So I would like to see if SPD could head down South Washington Avenue and make sure that the trailer s aren't getting parked there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to the traffic officer . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And we did get -- finally we've been receiving complaint s for a while about I believe it was the 400 of East Gibson Street behind Coopers or along the side of it where there was a vacant trailer parked there and that was finally cleared up, which I was really happy to hear. And I know there was a lot of overgrowth over the, like, warmer months onto the sidewalk there. So hopefully we can get whoever 's the property owner there to stay in compliance once the spring comes along. And I also want to revisit Burke Street and the repaving that needs to happen there. I've gone down it a number of times and sometimes I forget about the large bumps that are there. And thankfully my car is, you know, old enough that I don't care as much but someone else might that they don't want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 damage their car with those. So I know that when we initially spoke with them -- well, they would have been speaking with them for years now about this about Burke Street and the whole project . But they're going to try to get it down in the fall time. We even went out there and met with them and that didn't happen before the cold weather . And now spring is around the corner. So I want to make sure that that's on the list and that's finally going to get done. And lastly, I just wanted to touch on the recycling pickup issue at the local bars. I would also like to see us be able to resume that but, you know, at a cost so that the city is not doing it for free. I hate to see other's recyclable s just end up in the regular trash. I really would like to see them get recycle d properly. And so if this is able to offer that service , I would like to find a way that we would be able to do that. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have two. So a few weeks ago I requested some type of verification , a change in policy and something in writing from the City Treasurer regarding permanent exoneration for the example that I brought forward for a person that owns a double and lives on one side and has not rented the other side for 20 years. So we were told that a permanent exoneration for that, the owner would need to pull the power meter and confirm permanent vacancy via the city inspector . So I had a big problem with that. I never heard of it before. And we expressed -- I expressed my concerns , you know, you would have to have some power in a vacant -- you know, even if you own it and live next door to it, there's whether issues. So did we ever get any information back to them questions that I posed, any response ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Our City Treasurer advised us that the Director of Licensing and Inspection will prepare the written statement and send it to us. He's out of the office until tomorrow .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MR. MCANDREW : All right. Well, let's remind them. MR. VOLDENBERG : And I followed up with them. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. It's been a couple weeks. All right. So I also received questions and concerns from residents about the flagpole at Nay Aug Park. The flag is no longer visible because of tree growth. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please send correspondence over to Parks and Rec and have them look into correcting this? The resident s -- or at least have a look at it. The residents have said that the solution might be extending the flagpole versus, you know, trimming or cut down trees. So please have the Director of Parks and Rec do some type of assessment and get back to us. All right? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . One of the things I'd like to mention , we had an individual come up and speak tonight who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 lives in Wilkes-Barre who indicated that if people got off of the train and came to Scranton there would be nothing for them to do. Well, I grew up in Scranton and lived here my whole life. And there was nothing for to us do to when I was 15 or 20 years old. Since that time I'm going to give you a list of some of the things that you could do in the City of Scranton including we now have Rails to Trails. We have an aquarium down at the Steamtown Mall. We have Steamtown National History site since we've had trains, a trolly museum. We have a Scranton Public Library as mentioned earlier , Scranton Cultural Center where you could see all kinds of Broadway shows, Nay Aug Park with the beautiful gorge and, you know, a tree house. You could walk out and look at the gorge. That's ADA accessible , McDade Park. We have the Everhart museum. We have Montage Ski Resort, the Toyota Pavilion for concerts . We have the Yankees , the RailRiders triple A baseball . Downtown we have coffee shops. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 There's probably at least five or six of them which never existed until several years ago. We have Thai restaurant s, Japanese restaurants , Lebanese restaurants , Indian restaurants , Italian , American , Houdini Museum over in West Side. We have five colleges , including a medical college . So to say that there's nothing to do in the City of Scranton , it means that you're not trying and you're not looking . I believe there's a lot going on in the City of Scranton . And sometimes we tend to be our own worst enemy. And we, you know, it's easy. We are not perfect . We are far from it. Our goal is to try to constantly improve it. And many of the things that the citizens bring to us they point things out. And I take notes. And all of the Council individual s take notes. And we value that input and do our best to try to look into things because we can't think of everything . And I really do value the input that we get from the citizen s that come and speak here. But I want to champion for this city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 And I'm positive about the future of this city. And I think that sometimes we don't realize all the great things that happen in this city. And Mrs. Hodowanitz mention ed in the past and I couldn't agree with her more, one of the greatest things about this city are the people. And as the Race Director for the Steamtown Marathon for 25 years who meet people coming here from 40-some different states and several countries , they talk about the people how well they're treated . They feel like they're world class when they come here. And they love being in the city and they think wow, what a beautiful -- the architect ure and the way that the people treat them. So I just -- I wanted to stick up for the City of Scranton . I felt that needed to be said tonight . So that's all I got. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF SCOTT PIETREFACE , WHO RESIDES IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , TO THE POSITION OF DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 6, 2023. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , it was brought up in public comment tonight about the date here effective February 6th, but it's coming in front of Council on the 21st. I'm happy to see this is coming in front of Council . I'd also like, Frank, if you could reach out to see if our engineer and project coordinator is also going to be coming in front of Council , I would love to see the resume and engineer background for that position . I know it's something that was added to the budget this year, but I would like to see if the administration plans on bringing it before us. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree. I think that historically we've seen this happen with these position s that they come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 down to us later than after the person is actually hired and starting the position . So I would also like to see the legislation and the resumes come down sooner than that so that we could vote in advance of that person starting with the position . But I did want to welcome Mr. Pietreface to the position of DPW Director . And I really appreciated the list of accomplishments that he included . He's very detail oriented. He included every month the work that he had been doing here at DPW already in his former position . So I enjoyed seeing that and I look forward to seeing what he does as Director . MR. MCANDREW : I also have an issue with having appointments sent down to us weeks, sometimes a month or two later. It's -- it's just unsettling because we actually had to ask for it last week. It actually had to be brought up here asking for this appointment to be brought down to us. That shouldn 't be the norm and it's getting that way. So I have a concern too. MR. KING: On the question , I also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 agree with that. And I did in my meeting with the Mayor remind her that we had a memorandum of understand ing which was signed in March of 2022 that indicated that these appointment s for these supervisory positions need to be approved from Council before they begin. I understand Mr. Pietreface actually worked for DPW prior to this. But still, I would like to see us follow the proper protocol and not be doing this posthaste.
