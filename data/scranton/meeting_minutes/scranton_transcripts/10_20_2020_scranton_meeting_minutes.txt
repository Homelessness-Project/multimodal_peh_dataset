CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM KOHANSKI COMPANY , PC DATED OCTOBER 16, 2020 REGARDING CITY OF SCRANTON AUDIT UPDATE. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just want to add a comment . I also want to express my disappointment in 3-F that the audit has been -- it seems like extended or they won't be getting back to us as soon as we thought they would by the deadline that was previously given. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 So, you know, like Mr. Gaughan , I would like some answers as to why it's been extended , what the reason is for the delay and how we might be able to get that completed quicker . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I agree. Anyone -- MR. DONAHUE : I would just -- I'd like to add I agree there. I mean, this is my third year on Council . And it seems like it's just the same thing over and over again. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I think in terms of the communication between the audit company and Council it has been better in my view just because we have been getting regular updates . But I would agree that I think we definitely need the audit completed before we start talking about the budget. And I don't think, you know, mid-December is acceptable . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could follow up with Mr. Deeley and Kohanski to see if there is any way that we can get that completed before the budget, that would be great. Any other comments on Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR.

FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. We're going to start Citizens Participation today a little bit differently . We have Mr. Summa who is -- I hope I'm saying your name right -- who is the County Engineer . And we also have flashback -- I'm having flashbacks here, Joe, Joe Wechsler . I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing, right? MR. WECHSLER : All good, Bill. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. GAUGHAN : They're all good. That's good. We have Joe Wechsler here who is the Purchasing Director for Lackawanna County and actually Joe was instrumental in one piece of legislation that is on our agenda tonight dedicating a portion of Cobb Avenue adjacent to the firehouse for Mr. Tansits . And he also coordinated the event I think it was last weekend or two weekends ago for Mr. Tansits ; so that was great along with Mr. Terry Osborne . So thanks again for that, Joe. But you gentlemen are here tonight to talk about the legislation we have on our agenda making Center Street a one way from a two way. So, Mr. Summa and Mr. Wechsler , I'll turn it over to you if you just want to go through the legislation , explain it, and then we'll open it on the floor for questions . Thank you. MR. SUMMA: Joe, do you want me to summarize -- MR. WECHSLER : Since you were in charge of the design, I figure I'll just let you do your thing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. SUMMA: Sure. Sure. Okay. So for those of you that don't know me, I am Frank Summa with GPI Consulting Engineers on behalf of Lackawanna County. So Lackawanna County is requesting that the City of Scranton make the 300 block of Center Street, which is the block between Wyoming Avenue and Penn Avenue a one-way street with the direction of travel being from Penn toward Wyoming . Additionally , the county is requesting that the left turn movements coming from Center Street onto Wyoming be restricted from the hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. With the repurposing of the Globe as now the County Government Center, there is a need for vehicle s to be parked on this block of Center Street. Center Street -- it is not wide enough to accommodate two-way traffic safely. There is only 16 feet of travel width between -- designated -- currently designated parking areas and existing obstructions . Additionally , we feel that vehicles entering onto Wyoming Avenue during peak travel hours on Wyoming Avenue if that left turn movement was restricted , it would improve 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 safety conditions . There is -- there is appropriate signage and pay to parking is proposed with this request including do not enter signs at Wyoming Avenue at the Wyoming Avenue end of Center Street, one-way traffic signs at the Penn Avenue end of Center Street, white painted directional arrows on the pavement as well as a no left turn 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. sign at center of Wyoming intersection . Additionally , in combination with this request and proposal , there also is a road maintenance agreement which would state that the county would take over the maintenance associated with this block including paving, repairs, snow plowing , signing or any other maintenance related activities . Questions or -- Joe, anything to add on your end? MR. WECHSLER : Yeah, part of -- part of the reason why we were interested in this legislation is to give us control of that court because of there -- there are parking issues in that court, illegal parking happens in that court every day. As part of this plan, we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 requesting that there are four parking spots that the county can control as a municipal government similar to what Scranton City Government has in Dix Court. Those four parking spots would be utilized by either municipal vehicles or perhaps contractors that are there doing business . Prior to this, I watched the meeting with ABM and NDC. As you know, there is no really nonmetered parking on Wyoming Avenue. So we have a few county designated spots in front of the Globe Store. But otherwise Wyoming Avenue is all public metered parking . So we do require some spots in that alley or on Center Street that we could use for municipal vehicles . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. I don't really have any questions , Joe, other than, you know, I'm just looking at this two ways, really. If we don't do anything and we deny this, then the issue still exists. And I do think there is an issue when you come off -- because I took a drive by the other day. When you're coming out, people turning left, that's dangerous . I don't know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 how you get two cars down there because it's really tight. So if we don't do anything the problem still exists. This I think the county will maintain that section which is good for the City and takes that off of our plate. I'm not seeing any downside here. Does anybody have any questions ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a question . So if we give up the maintenance of this street, do we lose fuel tax revenue ? ATTY. HAYES: Liquid fuels you mean -- MR. MCANDREW : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: I don't believe we do, no. I don't think we would. MR. GAUGHAN : And if we did -- MR. SUMMA: And, Joe, maybe our county solicitor can look into that. But from my reading through of the maintenance agreement , that was not included in the standard language of the agreement . So I believe whatever was in place now, that calculation for roads owned by the City has no change with regard to this proposal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 from the documents I've reviewed. ATTY. HAYES: It's still a City road, Councilman McAndrew . It's just that they're going to maintain it. And as part of that agreement , which is important from a legal standpoint is they -- the county has agreed to indemnify the City for any claims of injury or other claims that could be brought in connection with that roadway . So I don't believe -- my opinion is that that would not reduce our calculation toward the liquid fuel reimbursement because it's still a City road. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. ATTY. HAYES: And I know that there was some questions last week as to whether this is an alley or a court. But, Mr. Summa, is it greater than 20 feet in width, the roadway ? Do you know offhand ? MR. SUMMA: It is probably slightly greater than 20 feet. The travel way would be 16 feet, including obstruction to what is your existing parking areas. So it's really a -- you would classify as a 16 foot travelway. ATTY. HAYES: Travelway , okay.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. SUMMA: Yeah, for its use right now because there is existing parking there happening right now. ATTY. HAYES: Our code defines an alley as any thoroughfare having a right-of-way width of 20 feet or less. But I think that we've been advised that this was already -- that this isn't an alley by our City Engineer . Is that correct , Lori? MS. REED: That is correct , Attorney Hayes. It is a street. ATTY. HAYES: It's a street. So the no parking prohibition on for alleys and courts under our City Code would not apply here. That was just an issue, Frank and Joe, that was raised at last week's Council meeting . MR. SUMMA: Okay. Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other questions or concerns ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I just had a real quick one. I understand , you know, the need for increased safety over at Center Street. I was just wondering if we know of any accidents , like, has there been a rash of accidents in that area along that street as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 result of the parking or pedestrian -related accident s, anything like that? MR. WECHSLER : I'm not aware of any. But it is a very congested area. So there is -- there is quite a bit of pedestrian traffic that goes through there. And I think this will kind of alleviate having to be concerned about both ways even though you should. It should take some of the pressure off of looking both ways while you go through that street. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, I was just curious . Thank you. MR. SUMMA: Just a reply from me, myself, GPI, and our representation here, I don't have any record of accident history there. ATTY. HAYES: Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: I'm aware, there was one lawsuit that the City was sued where an individual fell in that -- on that roadway on that block on Center Street. I actually defended the case for the City. And it was dismissed on summary judgment . But that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 several years ago. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thanks, Kevin. MR. SCHUSTER : So currently we're talking about four spots remaining after this occurs. How many spots are there at this point in time, do you know? MR. WECHSLER : Legal spots, there's if you were to go it, I think legally , Frank, right, there's only four spots that could be there. But right now, there's probably 15 to 20 vehicles in that alley -- in that -- I got to start calling it a street now -- on that street every day that are parked illegally . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. So at this point about 15 can park there but only four of them would be considered legal and we're going to move it to four legal spots. MR. WECHSLER : Yeah, and the four legal spots would be under the county's control . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. That answers that. How about when it comes to that timeframe 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., looking at a like a traffic pattern -- in regards to traffic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 pattern , does that become confusing in any other circumstance s that you've seen, Mr. Summa? MR. SUMMA: I'm not sure exactly -- are you asking if it's confusing for a driver who would be on Center Street trying to navigate left from Wyoming that they would have circle around the block? Is that what you're talking about? MR. SCHUSTER : That's correct . When you were talking about some of the arrows, I think you were talking about painting some of the arrows for left-hand turns, this and that. Being that it's an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. timeframe , in those hours prior to 8 a.m. or after 5 p.m., does that become confusing for anyone? MR. SUMMA: No, I wouldn't think so. The arrows I mention ed would just be to designate the proper directional traffic on Center Street. As far as the turning movement s at the end of Center Street, it would just be a standard sign that does not allow left-hand turns for a certain timeframe . So a typical driver would just be able to make a right-hand turn and the very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 next block is Lackawanna which has a stop light and they would navigate to wherever their final destination is. So I don't see that being confusing to a driver. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And any other similar circumstance you've seen in the past it hasn't been confusing as well? MR. SUMMA: No, I don't see that. I think the big concern would be cars entering into on Wyoming Avenue when it might be peak hours for Wyoming Avenue. It's just hard to make a left-hand turn. You have a lot of pedestrian traffic during that same timeframe where you have a lot people walking to and from the County Government Center. So it's just that much harder for a driver to make that left-hand maneuver and why not restrict the movement as opposed to potentially allowing a safety issue. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other questions ? MR. MCANDREW : I have one more. So if there's 15 to 20 people parking there illegally every day, so there is no enforcement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 probably because we're down an enforcement officer because of a furlough -- or not, I don't know. I'm just -- so what's to stop these people parking in the proposed four designated spots? I mean, if -- MR. WECHSLER : Councilman , one of the things is if the county maintains control , we do have sheriffs on site every day at the Government Center. So if the -- if Center Street is under the control of the county, I believe the sheriff departments can patrol there, not issue tickets but can patrol there and advise people that they're parked illegally . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MR. SUMMA: Also, I mean, the proposal and for the plans that go with it, the proposal also does include for appropriate signage to designate what is legal parking and what is not legal parking . And like Joe mentioned , that monitoring would -- enforcement would fall back on the county. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Any other questions ? MR. DONAHUE : So I do agree there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 some issues there. And I'm sure the illegal parking had something -- I believe it's civilian parking that has enforce that because ABM and NDC only enforce where there is meters downtown , I believe . So I believe it's the civilian parking enforcement that's responsible for enforcing that now. Unfortunately we had some layovers there. But still, I understand the whole safety issue with the whole alley. I have a little trouble accepting the four spots. Could you further justify that what's the need there? MR. WECHSLER : Yeah, for the most part, Councilman , these are going to be municipal vehicle s that come and go during the course of the day. It may be the Assessors Office. It may be the Sheriff 's Department . It may be a director or so that need to have access in and out of that building quickly . So that's why those four spots. I could assure you that none of these spots -- none of these vehicles that will be parking in these spots are in any of the ABM system or NDC system. The county is probably one of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 largest support ers of that system. We have fleet vehicles that we pay monthly parking rates for. We also have several of our employees also pay the monthly rate to park in the buildings . So to alleviate some of your concern , those four spots current ly right now would not be income generating vehicles for the Scranton Parking system. For the most part, they would be vehicles that are tagged with municipal license plates. And for the most part those vehicle s are not being ticketed . So they're not getting parking tickets throughout the system. So the four spots are more of convenience . Once again, very similar to what's behind City Hall where municipal employees , directors , have spots reserved in Dix Court, pretty much for the same reason. MR. DONAHUE : Joe, the county does have an agreement with ABM and NDC, a certain number of spots? MR. WECHSLER : There's no particular maximum or minimum , Councilman . But we do have -- like I said, we park fleet vehicles in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 there. CYS has a lot of vehicles that park in there that are -- those are reimburse d by the state. So there isn't an actual contract for that. But we do have quite a few, like I said, employees and county-owned vehicles that park within the system. We're anxious also to see the completion of the Electric City completion . As people may or may not know, there is an entrance from the Electric City garage onto our second floor of the county building . And actually is the -- that floor actually is the area that has most of the public offices there, Voting Registration , Assessor's Office, Controller 's Office, Treasurer 's Office. Once that garage is back in shape that people feel comfortable using it, there will be an excellent opportunity for county employees and citizen s to access the Government Center in the second floor of the Electric City Garage. MR. DONAHUE : And that's one of the reasons why I asked for the, you know, what's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 our -- what their occupancy was for monthly parking in that garage because especially because of the further -- or the previous presentation we were just given, you know, that the financial hardship s that the parking system is facing given everything going on, you know, that might be another opportunity to, you know, discuss with the county ways to work together there. MR. WECHSLER : Yeah, the one customer that did not leave during the pandemic was Lackawanna County. We paid for our vehicles through the whole -- through the whole month. We have several handicap ped employee s that parked in the Electric City. And right now they're dispersed either up to the Casey garage or up to the Medallion Garage, which is -- which is a bit of a hardship but, you know, we're dealing with it. But going forward , I would like to see a relationship between the City, NDC, ABM to make use of that second floor access into our building . MR. DONAHUE : One last thing I would ask for, Joe, could you put what you said about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 what those parking spaces would be used for into writing , just a brief explanation so we can attach it to our resolution then moving forward ? MR. WECHSLER : Yeah, we are -- one thing I could say, Councilman , is we're not going to designate them specifically like they are in the City. I think those are just designated specifically to Controller 's Office, City Clerk, whatever . We'll provide you with who we expect to use those -- use those spots. But pretty much we're going to -- the parking spots itself will be identified as municipal vehicles , county -- with county medallions because we don't -- because they'll vary during the course of the day. So maybe an assessor will be there, then maybe somebody from CYS might be there or someone from the Veteran 's Office. So I will give you list of who we think will park there. But the signs themselves will be specific to the county medallion type of system that we'll design. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. GAUGHAN : Any other questions ? Just a comment -- final comment here. First, thank you, Mr. Summa and Mr. Wechsler , for coming in and explaining that legislation . I think in looking at this, I think it's really important that we support the county as they continue to transition into the Government Center. And I think we have to remember that the county supports our downtown . And, you know, I don't -- I don't see a problem in reciprocating that support . I think it makes that street safer and makes sense to me. So thank you, gentlemen , for coming in. And we appreciate it. And we hope you have a good night and stay safe. MR. WECHSLER : Thanks again. ATTY. HAYES: Thanks, Joe. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thanks -- MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : I like hitting this delete button. MR. GAUGHAN : You know, Joe, there's a mute button too now we have. We could have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 used that a couple years ago. MR. WECHSLER : Woulda, shoulda, coulda. Thanks guys. MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus? MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, can you please read the public comment into the record? MS. REED: Yes. Thank you. The first submission from Marie Schumacher as follows : O First, clarification rquested at last week's Meeting when I asked how many open court issues against the City are there. How many outstanding lawsuits are there? And while you are at it would you see what is holding up the County Reassessment case someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 filed? O Again, it was disappointing to not find any more answers to Capital Budget questions in Third Order. When do you think the vote on this will be back on the Table? I was raised in a "a stitch in time saves nine" home" so I hope we will not push needed expense out of the 2021 Election Budget that will cost much more in future budgets . O Back again to last week when the President stated the reason for extending the Act 47 exit was to enact Payroll Prep; however PEL's endorsement of the extension dealt only with finanacial and did not deal directly with Payroll Prep. O 3A provides a tentative project schedule with which I find insensitive and makes me wonder about this Company . Selection of November /December for meeting with neighborhood groups; months when people are likely most busy with two holidays . I would ask also for identification of the "important " neighborhood group" (I believe ALL neighborhood groups should be included and how will these groups be notified ? I would suggest sufficient 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 time to give thought to the requested information . Also, is this project likely to be affected by the reduced 2021 budget expenditures ? O 3B reports the City can commit its $25,000.00 share of the cyber-attack expense , withoute engaging in the competitive bidding process . Is sufficient funding availaable in the contingency account to cover this and, if not, from what account will this money for transferred ? O 3F is most disappointing and not in compliance with City Code. Getting the Audit after the next year's budget is unacceptable and I would like to know how you are going to correct this. O The Public Notice regarding the 2021 Action Plan has me confusee . How is the public expected to comment on the programs on November 10 when the program submittal cut off is November 20? O I learned from today's Times-ribune that volunteers are being overseen by the City's Licensing , Inspection and Permits Department Deputy Director . Considering the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 decrepit condition of so much of the City I think a priority reset is in order. May I suggest OECD use some of our Federal funds to prepare a Guideline for Neighborhood Associations who want to clean-up (needs definition ) public properties and non-public properties to which they do not have title. We simply don't need to centralize such endeavors but we do need to protect those who choose to do so. O Finally , as my five minutes will soon be used, I request taxpayers be allowed more than five minutes at the 2021 Budget Hearing . Submitted by Marie Schumacher . The next submittal from Fay Franus: Council , I have to agree with city council for wanting to give the fire chief $84,000. When Captain Lucas was given $95,8000 to hold the fire chief position that was wrong from the very beginning . Captain Lucas was in a UNION. The Fire Chief is non union . When my brother -in-law Rich Pica was fire chief he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 NEVER made what he did as a union member of the department . Rightfully so! So I am hoping the Mayor is NOT trying to please the unions to get votes in an election . The unions and the University of Scranton run this city and it needs to stop now! I was told by the Mayor there is a strategy in place by Mary Jo Sheridan and Attorney OBrien. I would like to know EXACTLY what that strategy is. I understand there is an RFP out for someone to start collecting the delinquent garbage FEES. I also understand this company will buy these delinquent fees from the city and then they will go after the properties that are not paid up. That's good BUT NOT GOOD ENOUGH. If this company is only going to put liens on these delinquent properties that is not the way to go. Putting liens on properties has NOT made people pay what they have NOT paid in years. These people do not care about liens. The city has a law that they refuse to follow that I will repeat AGAIN! The administrative code states if a person does NOT pay their garbage fee the DPW does NOT have to pick up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 their garbage . I know every person who does pay their fee would like all the people in their block to pay theirs. So just passing this off to a company is not helping those who do pay. NOT unless you follow through with this law. NO need for a plastic bag excuse from council , council woman Dempsey and council passed a law saying all garbage cans must have lids. Therefor no health hazard! Also why does the Mayor allow this company who paid Mayor Courtright for their contract to collect delinquent garbage fees to continue to reap the benefits of what they take in? Considering they broke the law why is their contract still in place? That sends a bad message from the Mayor-- Pay to play and you can keep your contract ! I also understand you hired a company to take care of the parks and want them to get in touch with IMPORTANT neighborhoods . WOW!! Gee I sure wish I knew who these IMPORTANT people in these important neighborhoods are! Why would you pay a company to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 this work when you have the DPW to do this work? Especially when this city is hurting financially . Break that contract and have the DPW do this work. One more thing-your reasoning for extending the exit plan is ridiculous ! We never should have had this exit plan extended to start with!! I guess this council and the mayor love being distressed . File bankruptcy -help the people enough of distressed city.Get us out of this distressed status. What you are doing is not getting us out--it is only keeping us in. By the way I read this e-mail back--it took 4 minutes . Submitted from Fay Franus. And that is all the public comment this week. (This concludes letters as submitted to Council for public comment .) MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. I would just ask that we submit all of the question s that were posed to the administration . And, Solicitor Hayes, if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 just find out how many outstanding lawsuit s there are currently against the City. That's a question that Miss Schumacher had posed. The only other comment I want to make because both Miss Schumacher and Miss Franus had mentioned it, is in the Third Order tonight McLane Associates had provided an overview of the Parks Assessment Project , the contract that they got. So they gave us a tentative project schedule . And one of the things that both Miss Schumacher and Miss Franus said identified in there is it said, "City with some support from McLane Associates will interact with important neighborhood groups to compile a list of issues and wishes." I don't think the intent there -- in fact, I know the intent there wasn't to say that they are looking at specific neighborhood groups. They're going to interact with all neighborhood groups so that the word important there I think is being misconstrued . It's not that they're, you know, think one neighborhood group is more important than the other. I know and have been working with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 McLane Associates now for a while. And they deal with the City. They deal with all neighborhood groups. And they've been at many neighborhood meeting s. Those are the only comments I have. Anybody else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I would like to make a motion to table 5-B until we get all the information in Sixth Order, Center Street. MR. DONAHUE : 7-B. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry, 7-B. What 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 did I say, 5-B? 7-B, sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Sorry. Could you restate that, Councilman McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : I would like to table 7-B, please. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. There's a motion on the floor to table agenda Item 7-B, and there's a second. On the question ? Okay. Solicitor Hayes, it's your recommendation that we table this and bring it back next week in order to pass both 7-B and 6-A together as one kind of package . ATTY. HAYES: That's right because the 7-B -- the resolution is only going to take effect if we approve the ordinance which would convert Center Street to a one-way street during the hours indicated or a one-way street. So, yeah, my recommendation is that they be taken up -- separate items at the same meeting . I think the agreement should be -- the resolution should be taken up after the ordinance related to Center Street on the same night. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So then, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Mrs. Reed, we'll just set the guide up that way to have 7-B be brought back up after 6-A. MS. REED: Correct , once you finish the motion, yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Anybody else on the question ? All those in favor of tabling agenda Item 7-B signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and 7-B is tabled. Councilman McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Not at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I received several calls this weekend regarding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 an incident with our police department and between -- apparently 15 to 20 trucks and vehicles with Trump campaign flags were going basically to drive through Scranton from what I'm being told. They started downtown . One of the lead cars in this pack had an obscenity that was plastered in very large letters on the windshield . So as you can imagine , I had received several phone calls throughout Saturday . And the calls were not really centered around the fact that there was, you know, vehicles with Trump flags. They were centered around two things, number one, the fact that there was apparent ly two Scranton Police cars that escorted these vehicles throughout the City from down -- I think down Mulberry Street through downtown , up Pittston Avenue and then up Birney Avenue. And they had their sirens on. And the other issue was the fact that there was -- one of the cars had a large obscenity written across the front of the windshield . So I did call acting Chief Namiotka who was looking into exactly what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 happened . He did call me back which I appreciated . And he said that that probably should not have happened the fact that there was two police vehicles that escorted this political parade through the City. I did ask -- speak to the Mayor. And she said that they were investigating the incident . So I do have two questions , number one, who in the police department authorized the use of City police vehicles to escort what amounts in my estimation from what I've been told, a political parade throughout the City. And my second question would be, did the group pay for the escort? Did they pay for that police escort through the City? Who requested the escort from that group? To me, it does not seem wise -- like a wise use of taxpayer funds. And I was especially concerned when I received a call from an older gentleman who lives in Minooka who was outside playing with his grandson in his front yard and they were subject ed to the obscenity on the front of this vehicle , which is not bad enough. They were confused as to why we had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 two police vehicles with sirens escorting this parade throughout our City. It lacks common sense. I have to question why we would take two police officers off the streets , two police cars off the streets to escort between 15 and 20 pickup trucks and a car with a huge obscenity on it around the City for purely partisan political candidate in a federal election . I don't think it's right whether it was for Donald Trump, Joe Biden, whoever . So again, I received multiple calls from people who were not happy with this. And I do not blame them because I was not happy myself. Again, I was told by the Mayor that there's, you know, they are looking into it. It's I believe an internal investigation . But I would like those two questions answered because I think it's important to find out who actually authorized it, number one, and did they pay for that escort throughout the City. And I also wonder would that be a violation of the Ethics Code or the Hatch Act. I don't know. So we'll have to look into that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Second thing, I receive d a letter from OECD that was made out to the contract manager of Lackawanna County in regards to the City of Scranton 's COVID-19 expenditures . This is going to be in Third Order next week. Due to COVID-19 according to this memo, the City of Scranton had been sending commingled recycling to the Lackawanna County Recycling Center. The September invoice for this amounts to $3,997.20. So they're adding that onto the amount that was submitted that Council passed back on July 28th, 2020. Also, Council received a memo from the HR Department . I had asked about the local internship program and how this, you know, how that works, how that's been working . I do think that it's a great thing that the City has engaged with the Pennsylvania state and local internship program . It's called the SLIP Program to provide and pay for interns throughout the City. I think that's a good thing. So we were provided -- and this will be in Third Order next week -- an overview of the program . So there was several interns that -- summer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 interns that worked for the City. This memo details what department these people worked in. They were paid $10.35 an hour. They worked between 8 to 10 weeks and I think a few hours a day in nine department s with multiple interns being offered permanent employment opportunities . One of the questions that I did have that I had Miss Reed follow up with administration on was, Amber Viola, the HR Director said that three of these interns did not qualify for those program dollars from the state. But they also were paid interns . So I did ask how exactly they were paid. If they were paid from City funds, what account -- what budget account did that come out of it? So we'll be looking forward to the answers to those questions . Also, again, this will be in Third Order next week for public review. We received -- Council received a memo from the HR Department regarding an internal audit of the tax and fee status on all employees beginning December 1st, 2020. So the City's Human Resources 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Department is going to be conducting this audit to make sure that all City employee s are current on any taxes and fees, like the garbage fee, for example . Delinquencies can range from the waste and refuse bill collection , any tax debt owed to the City, rental registration as well as health insurance and workmen 's compensation bill delinquencies and any other monies related to the subjection of City collection . This is something that came up a few years ago. I think if I'm not mistaken , the newspaper may have done an analysis and found that there was several City employees that owed significant amounts in garbage fees. And at that time, I did call on the City to take some kind of action to recoup these fees because I don't -- it sends the wrong message if we have a bunch of City employees who are getting paid with City funds and then not paying the garbage fees or any other fees that the City has. So I was glad to see this memo from the HR Department . And hopefully we can collect any outstanding delinquencies . Council also received a memo or a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 statement from the Mayor, Business Administrator , Carl Deeley and Joe O'Brien the Solicitor . This will be in Third Order next week as well for the public to review. This was a statement that informed Council that the administration has rejected the two proposals received by the City for the collection marking of recyclables . And it explains their intention to issue a second RFP, which I agree with. I'm not going to read through the whole thing. But it gives historical background on -- this whole issue. I do want to read a portion of it though because I think it's important . The City received two bids for the collection of and marketing of recyclable s. The two bidders were GFL Environmental and JP Mascaro . The operator -- the current operator did not submit a bid. The City determined that both bids were nonresponsive to the terms of the RFP for the following reasons : Number one, neither GFL or Mascaro accept glass as part of the commingle . Neither GFL or Mascaro accept Christmas trees, leaves, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 bushes, branches or wood chips. And Mascaro indicated that its bid was void if it would be require d to reimburse the City for the extra cost in delivering recyclable s to a facility outside of the City. And neither company completed the required disclosure form. So the City is intending to issue a second RFP with the intent of securing services for the collection of recyclables at a reasonable cost. So this is something that we'll continue to keep an eye on. And third thing I wanted to mention was to thank the OECD Director , Eileen Cipriani . We did ask for -- asked for a flow chart of the demolition process in the City. That was an outstanding question . We receive d that from Director Cipriani . So we'll put that in Third Order if anyone from the public is interested . I've been asking now for quite some time for a breakdown of costs relating to Novembrino Splash Pad Project . Council did receive those figures . And I'll ask that that be put in Third Order as well for next week for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 public review. I'm very concerned in looking at what was provided . This project has been going on now for quite some time. And in looking at the figures that were provided , we were hit with -- the City was hit with nearly $150,000 worth of change orders -- of change work orders. Fourteen change work orders in total between three contractors . So you can see the different amounts here. I won't go through all of them. But the total base bid from Scartelli Construction was $835,000. And then there was several change orders that were put in. D & M Construction , $87,000 was that base bid. Again, there was several change orders put in. And Leber Electric , several change orders put in. So I'm going to take some time to review this document ation. And I'm sure there will be followup questions on that. I want to thank Mr. Trevisani and Mr. Sweet for coming in tonight and giving us an update on the parking system. Obviously , I'm very concerned as I think all of us are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 that the revenue is down. It's not a surprise . I think it was expected with the pandemic . One of the things that I was glad to hear was that there is no talk at this point of raising rates outside of the rate schedule . I would agree with Mr. Trevisani that would be counter productive at this point. We're going to have a difficult enough time as a City, you know, getting back on our feet in terms of downtown economic development once hopefully this pandemic subsides . So if, you know, when I did talk to Mr. Trevisani personally , I expressed a view that if we were to raise rates now, that would crush -- I think that would crush small businesses downtown . I just don't think that it can be done. So any sort of effort, any sort of investment that the City can make to help NDC out at this time I think we could do that almost as an economic development incentive for our downtown . So I don't know what that looks like, but I'm hopeful that in the new year, this pandemic turns around and our downtown gets back to where it should be. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 And the last thing I wanted to mention was as I talked about in the caucus, we did receive documentation from the administration regarding Willis Towers and the other 10 bidders . As Solicitor Hayes mentioned , we're going to review that. The administration had requested that we not make that public yet for reasons that we discussed in the caucus. And the other thing that we're waiting on is the disclosure form. So we're not going to bring that up for a vote tonight . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. CEREMONIOUSLY DEDICATING A PORTION OF COBB AVENUE ADJACENT TO THE ENGINE 10 FIRE STATION LOCATED ON EAST MOUNTAIN ROAD IN HONOR OF CHARLES J. TANSITS , JR. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ?

He's lived on East Mountain for 95 years of his life. And I think we would consider him kind of the Mayor of East Mountain . So this is a great honor for him, a great honor for a member of our greatest generation . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C.

All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR A MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION FUND GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $306,000.00 TO BE UTILIZED TO IMPLEMENT PHASE II OF THE STREET SIGN PROJECT FOR THE PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF 2,036 STREET SIGNS. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I can't tell you how pleased I am to see this legislation . As I drive throughout the City and as we know the last few years, there are a number -- and we have a number, 2036 street signs that are faded that are hard to see that don't -- that there's intersection s where there are no street signs, especially up in the Hill Section . If you're not from the Hill Section and you don't know where you're going, it's hard to get around up there because the street signs in a lot of places just don't exist. So I am really, really pleased to see this multimodal grant. And I hope that the City is successful in acquiring it. I think the one message that this will send is, it's these little things like replacing , maintaining street signs, it goes back to the broken windows theory. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 When you drive through a neighborhood and you see a street sign that's upsidedown, that's faded, it sends a message that maybe, you know, this isn't the type of neighborhood that you want to live in. These are the little things that we need to continue to keep on doing. And I'm so glad to see that the DPW Director and the Mayor and her administration are being really proactive in this. I also want to thank the members of the DPW, especially our Sign Department . When I say Sign Department , you would think we would have, you know, 20 to 30 employees . But we only have two. I think it's now it's Gene Reed and Dave Medicci {sic}. And they're doing an outstanding job with the resources that they have. And a few years ago when the City decided with the push from Council to enter into an agreement with a company to come in and give us really a great database in every neighborhood in the City on the street signs, the stop signs, the children at play signs, that was a great starting point for us. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Because now if there's a street sign that's replaced, it goes in the database. There's a record of it. And that way we can track it and 20 to 30 years from now we're not going to be in this position where we're going for a grant to replace , you know, 2000-and some street signs. So there's work to be done. There's work to still be done obviously . But I like the trajectory that we're moving in. Anyone else on the question ?

If we don't do anything and if we vote this down next week, then Center Street remains , you know, in -- I think bad condition , unsafe, dangerous . This provides us with an opportunity to make that area safer for the employee s that work down there. And it's also an opportunity to partner once again with the county. And they have partnered with us in the past in terms of the land bank among a number of other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 things.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE FOR ADOPTION -- FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 20, 2020 â€“ AN ORDINANCE â€“ APPROVING AND ACCEPTING THE CITY OF SCRANTON CAPITAL BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2021 PURSUANT TO SECTION 904 OF THE CITYâ€™S 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 HOME RULE CHARTER . MR. GAUGHAN : What's the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, I'd like to take a minute to read into the record the question s that Council -- or the answers that Council received regarding the DPW portion of the capital budget. I will say that I appreciate the level of detail that was provided this year with the capital budget. You know, it's been a little bit different than in the past. There's been much more detail provided , which I appreciate . All of the question s that were submitted by the public had been answered by the administration . I read those into the record over the last few weeks. And now this is kind of the final part of those questions . So one of the first questions was, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 are the street signs and stop signs also included in the DPW general operating budget? And the answer to that question is all relevant street signs are include d in the general budget as operating expenses under traffic maintenance . The second question was how many riding mowers are being procured in 2021? The administration responded that the goal is to provide two to three new mowers depending on the bids that are received from the supplier . There was a question about the second column of the Keyser Valley/Merrifield line item. And they asked under the DPW Engineering Department , why was that -- the word design included ? And the administration respond that was needed to include the intent of the overall scope of the project . The DPW vehicle narrative stated that vehicles were in need of replacement and fleet additions and then it provide d a list. But it failed to distinguish between which were replacement and which were addition s. The administration responded that the list is identified on the Excel sheet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 provided and include s addition s to the following items: One brush tractor , two double tab pickups, one asphalt roller, and one front end loader. There was also a comment here that there was no estimate for implementing a vehicle GPS system in 2021 despite the fact that a trial will be performed in the fourth quarter of this year. The administration did provide a cost. It is now in the capital budget as $175,000 for 2021 on line 325. A full review of all options available to the City during the trial will be explored . And just one comment on that. This is something that I pushed for after the whole gas card fiasco a year and a half ago. Every other major City, PennDOT , a lot of other, you know, if you look at the private industry , they all use GPS. And it's really making -- it will make this department I think much more efficient . It will help us save on gas, fuel costs. It will help us be more transparent with the public, especially in terms of, like, what PennDOT does when they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 have plows out, I think. The goal would be to have people go online and be able to see where the plows are and all that. So this is a really a good program . The flood control section states escrow accounts will be used for funding . Please identify the available escrow accounts and the balance in each and answer why this available funding has not been used to fix the Dewey-Jackson Street issue. The administration responded that the department was not aware of any special issues with this area other than what is being currently addressed . They also asked for a detailed accounting of any money spent within the last five years on upgrading and/or maintaining the Keyser Valley pumping station . The administration responded that $36,931.36 was spent on maintaining the station in the past five years. The administration also respond ed that the City will be issuing an RFP in the fourth quater of 2020 to determine how to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 rebuild the floodplain in the Keyser Valley area and provide an adequate pump station . There's no cost estimate s or timeline s available at this time. Let's see. The citizen complained that there was no funding for Merrifield Avenue until 2023. The Mayor and DPW are focussed on this issue. The City is issuing an RFP for an engineering study to address flooding in Keyser Valley including Merrifield Avenue. This study is the key to unlocking federal and grant funding to be able to further mitigate flooding in Keyser Valley. And I think that was all. That should answer all the question s that were posed for the capital budget. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I'd like to say on the question that I'm glad that all the taxpayer questions provided were answered before final passage because let's face it, they're the ones that are paying for this budget. So I'm glad they at least got that. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-D legally and lawfully adopted . If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . DR. ROTHCHILD : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting 's adjourned . Stay safe everyone . And I'll see everybody next week.
