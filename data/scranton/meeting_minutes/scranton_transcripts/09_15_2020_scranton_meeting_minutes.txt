FUEL CARD ANALYSIS RECEIVED FROM OFFICE OF THE CITY CONTROLLER FOR THE PERIOD JULY 24 THROUGH AUGUST 23, 2020. 3-C. MINUTES OF THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE REVIEW BOARD MEETING HELD JULY 9, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. Okay, Friends of the Poor, Family to Family and Weinberg Food Bank will be doing another COVID-19 emergency drive through food giveaway.

Food bags will be placed directly in their vehicle . Zip code, number of children , adults, elderly in household is required . I just want to say again, these three organizations have been a Godsend to many during this pandemic since March. That is all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just wanted to -- I didn't say it last week but last week we had Chief Carl Graziano retire from our Scranton Police Department . And I wanted to thank him for his service , the great work that he's done with the police department over many years. And that's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? Okay, I have two announcements . The first, there are two openings on the Ethics Board. So we are going to accept letters of interest and resumes of those residents who are interested in seeking an appointment to fill the two vacant seats on the Ethics Board. There are -- the first opening expires on August 31st, 2002. So you will fill the remainder of that term until August 31st, 2022, excuse me. And the second seat for those who are interested , you'll fill the remainder of the term which will expire on August 31st, 2021. Members shall be a citizen of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 United States, shall have been a resident of the City for at least one year prior to the appointment , shall be at least of minimum voting age at the time of appointment and shall reside in the City of Scranton throughout the term of service as a board member. Letters of interest and resumes must be received in the Office of the City Clerk no later than Monday, September 21st, 2020 at 4:30 p.m., by e-mailing lreed@scrantonpa .gov or by U.S. mail to the Office of the City Clerk, Municipal Building , 340 North Washington Avenue, Second Floor, Scranton , Pennsylvania 18503. So you have until Monday, September 21st at 4:30 p.m. I want to thank Mr. Reddick. And I know we thanked Mrs. Sheridan for their service on the board. There still remains a lot of work to be done on the Ethics Board. I am pleased that we have gotten as far as we've gotten. As anybody knows, in dealing with government and boards it sometimes is difficult to get things up and running . We're not where we want to be but we made some progress . We do need two members on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 this board. So I would encourage anybody in the City who is interested and would want to give up their time and make a commitment to the City, this board is so important . And we would really appreciate it. So we're looking for anyone who is interested to submit those resumes and letters of interest . There was an ad in the paper on September 13th and September 15th, so today, okay? The last announcement I would like to make is just to congratulate two of my good friends . And I think everyone on Council should know them and a lot of people throughout the City know them, Leo and Rita DeAngelo . They're celebrating their 70th wedding anniversary . And there was a drive by at their house this past weekend . Unfortunately I couldn't make it. But Mr. & Mrs. DeAngelo run LaSalle 's, the Image Makers over in South Scranton . They sell suits but more important ly they just extend their friendship to so many people throughout the City. I don't know anybody better than Leo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 and Rita DeAngelo . They would do anything for anyone in the community . And they're good friends of mine. I haven't seen them in a long time because of the pandemic . But I just wanted to wish them a happy 70th wedding anniversary . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following citizens : Thomas Coyne, Bev DeBaros , Patricia Nestor, Norma Jeffries , Fay Franus and Marie Schumacher . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept public comment . MR. GAUGHAN : We have a motion on the floor. On the question -- or I'm sorry, is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a second. On the question ? On the question , I'm going to ask now our City Clerk to read those comment s received from members of the public into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 record. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. The first comment is from Mr. Tom Coyne. We are looking at making the trash fee, that is not a tax, be collected as a tax. Interesting . The reason it was not a tax is because it was supposed to be only for payment of trash collection , and as of May, the city has replied to me it has no idea of the costs to collect trash, as it does not have the DPW data. Maybe if the Trash Fee was put into a separate fund, isolated from the general revenue , and used only pay for the DPW services , this isolated fund from the general fund would show the numbers better. From the newspaper “U.S. District Judge Malachy Mannion agreed with federal prosecutors that Courtright should be held responsible for more than $2.9 million in profits the former Northeast Revenue Service earned from its city contract to collect delinquent property and garbage fees.” “Ultimately , Mannion decided Courtright is on the hook for the gross profits Northeast 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Revenue Service made between 2015 through June 30, 2019, $2.9 million citing prior court rulings .” So the residents were charged 2.9 million in extra fees. Any plans on looking at how to make the citizens whole? I expect not because the city fraudulent contract , based on a bribe, will be enforced , because it is too bothersome to recover non city funds. We are now looking to transfer the trash fee (not a tax) to the county and instead of a 15% on delinquent fees, getting charged a 5% fee on everything . Why is the city incapable of conducting business itself? On a 7.8 million trash fee, 5%... is handing over 380,000 to the county vs. Just delinquent trash fees to former Northeast Revenue . Is there not a way the city could hire and collect it's own trash fees? Just the 5% or 380,000 a year, would fund that action alone. As for landlords who are not registered and not paying trash fees, why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 not... instead of not collecting the trash, have License and Inspection record the number of bags placed outside and target and collect it as illegal dumping . The City is not required to collect trash from homes than have not paid trash fees. Fine them for every bag “dumped” and have the trash collected as usual. I would restrict this rollout to people who are in a multi unit home, and have at least 2 years delinquent . The $600 + late fee and the number of bags would cover the costs of a L&E person doing targeted enforcement . The collecting protects the health and safety. The fine provides a tool beyond just collecting an overdue fee that can just be paid late. This allows a second penalty , a continuing and compounding fine for dumping , shows the landlords non compliance and further civil action by unpaid dumping fines. Violation of Section 360-11 dumping allows a $25.00 fine per occurrence . Section 360-9 even allows the city to visit the house the day prior and it is considered a violation each day the violation continues . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Section 360-12 puts the real teeth in if ignored . “upon conviction before the Magisterial District Judge, be ordered to pay a fine of not less than $150, and not more than $1,000 on each offense , or be imprisoned no more than 90 days, or both.” Onto 5.D on the agenda. The License Plate reader. I find it disingenuous that the application calls for specific information and metrics that has been intentionally not supplied . In the form questions are asked for supplying information . What are the benefits /downside (no answer) -How does it relate to city mission /priority ? - Initial cost is clear but no statement of benefits (initial and ongoing ) As the city has 2 in use already , we should have yearly metrics of number of scans, number of hits, revenue collected , type of hit (criminal activity or just a fine collecting tool) data shows in other states that hits are in the 0.01% range, (mostly emissions and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 registration violations ) so 99.99% of data collected is tracking and surveillance of innocent people. -Data retention policy. § How long it is stored? (Some states store it for 48 hours, others indefinitely ) §Is the data like some other states, scrubbed removing the plates of all non hit/target plates? - Is the City is required as part of the grant, to upload/share the data, and even if not required , does the city upload the data to other parties outside the Scranton Police Department (including other agencies ) - If the funds require data sharing , can and will the local government , scrub the data prior to upload or are they required to supply the untouched files. First I am always disturbed by mass surveillance of citizens without cause. License plate readers have exploited a loophole in the law, since the plate is visible in public it is not private and most police and government have been moving to third party purchasing of data, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 to avoid the issue of government surveillance and illegal tracking . The same spurious argument applied elsewhere , used in a similar context , is the equal of defending stalking as you are visible in public, so I have a right to follow you everywhere you go and record everything you do. (This is not by a single drive by but collected aggregate data) Automatic license plate readers have the potential to create permanent records of virtually everywhere any of us has driven, radically transforming the consequences of leaving home to pursue private life, and opening up many opportunities for abuse. The tracking of people's location constitutes a significant invasion of privacy , which can reveal many things about their lives, such as what friends , doctors , protests , political events, or churches a person may visit. In our society , it is a core principle that the government does not invade people's privacy and collect information about citizens ' innocent activities just in case they do something wrong. Clear regulations must be put in place to keep the government from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 tracking our movements on a massive scale. I recommend reviewing the following ACLU PDF, prior to considering approval and holding off on this until a proper public forum (not online) can be done to review the desires of the community . Ps://www.aclu.org/files/assets/ 071613-aclu-alprreport -opt-v05.pdf. Data collections without regulation is not ethical , it is unwarranted . To install a GPS on a car, police have to obtain a warrant and have reasonable cause; this is a cash grab and building a database to collect information without warrant on people's movements . (GPS without warrant ) The quote “Those who would give up essential Liberty , to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.” Was said by Ben Franklin and still applies today. What you may not know is this quote was spoken, in the Pennsylvania General Assembly . Thank you Mr. Thomas Coyne. Additional comment submitted by Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Thomas Coyne: Last week it was stated that I had no questions on my submissions . This was not correct . Let me put forth this in just a question format. Amanda Hallock was hired as information technology manager . I stated the importance of IT management and function . This included operations and planning and security . The IT Management is just as important as the Fire and Police Chief position . The IT head should be the interface between departments , data security and integrity , moving forward direction , and finances . 1. What are the qualifications and skills Amanda Hallock brings to the office of IT Management ? 2. Why is this position not vetted by city council ? 3. In review of the public postings from Amanda Hallock , the main experience is public policy and community development . a. What specific work has she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 performed in an IT infrastructure ? b. In the month she has been in place, what has she identified as areas of weakness ? c. Does she have experience in both firewall security , penetration testing , data recovery and storage , multiple operating systems , Security control skills to craft and push out policy restrictions on City owned equipment , and if a policy control based VPN is set up for the city workers ? d. Instead of buying and licensing more third party apps and software , does she or her department have the ability to craft a access database or hire/evaluate a third party application builder to instead of getting locked into licensing and systems that will have support expire, crafting a in house solution owned by the city to resolve the interconnection going forward ? e. Is it reasonable to purchase surface pro pad/computers at 3 times the cost of smaller laptop systems that are able to have better security controls installed ? I understand for L&I, having a pen type pad 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 system may be reasonable but for general use is triple the cost reasonable ? In December of 2019, I put forth the risks to the City of Scranton , Specifically the risks of Ransomware and Data backup. One of the exiting Council Members took this seriously , and inquired . No feedback was ever provided and it was pushed off as even talking about it may risk the city security . I let that go as it was being “looked into.” The fact is, Penetration testing , data backup and retention , policy and procedure , when devoid of specific code details .. offers a place to review and discuss security measures , but not a breaching point. When someone wants to hit you with malware , ransomware , data incursion .. they do not ask.. they scan and test vulnerabilities . They use social engineering and zero day exploits , even if patched , expecting people to be lazy and slow in updating systems . My question from 9/1 is based on my December 2019 interaction with Council . 1. What has Scranton done since December 2019 to mitigate risks, as it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 warned of ransomware and Operating System end of support issues, a full 9 months prior? 2. Why was a Third Party required ? 3. Does the Scranton IT staff have the skills to monitor and prevent incursions without a third party? 4. What is the cost for the third party evaluation and support ? 5. If there is going to be an interactive link between County taxing services and City Services ? And since County employee /IT/ security policy is beyond the scope of the City, how is the City planning on connecting but isolating the data systems ? I asked back in December or January of 2020, what was the cost for both Recycling and trash disposal per ton. I was given a reply from Council after reviewing contracts it was something around $47 a ton for trash/landfill and $0.00 for all recycling . In the last meeting in July, there was a statement by the city that even in getting charged $40/ton for comingled recycling is cheaper then disposing it in the landfill . I believe a statement was made we are paying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 around $67/ton for Landfill fees. 1. When did the landfill fee increase ? Or did I hear things? 2. What are the other cities/county/municipalities paying, as the landfill contract requires Scranton to be provided the lowest per ton fee based on ALL other contracted Municipalities ? In the Year of 2020 as COVID-19 hit and prior, it was clear that the budget was not reasonable . With the pending litigation , just adding to the risks. 1. What has City Council Identified in the 2020 budget that can be removed ? 2. Is there a plan to put a hold on future funding for Scranton Tomorrow , at least until budget and disruptions are resolved ? We have already supplied $100,000 in April when Scranton employees were furloughed . Scranton Tomorrow has listed $500,000 in revenue surplus , and it has an employee cost a year of $100,000. Will City Council and the Mayor's office suspend the remaining $125,000 payment this year and next years $225,000 until the city is under a better footing as Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Tomorrow is not in need at this point? Or at least reduce the contribution by the city, only paying ½ the Scranton Tomorrow payroll in 2021. ($50,000) 3. The Tree program is a nice feel good, but is it reasonable to put out money to trees when we are scrambling for essential services funding ? 4. Both Fire and Police bargaining contracts end in the end of December 2020. As it also hits during Budget. a. What has been done for upcoming contract negotiations ? b. Do you plan to change the way benefits , including pensions going forward are handled under the contract , as PEL and I have stated, the Benefits and pension now exceed 100% of payroll and are growing at 4-7% a year alone, independent of pay increases ? c. Has the Mayors office and City Council been reviewing the former bargaining agreement ? And if so, when did the evaluation of the pending of the collective bargaining agreement start? Last in closing , the start of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 budget reflects purchases including for DPW trucks. The Standard truck as listed at $225,000 price tag is all well and good, But as I have noted, new technology has been on the market including trucks with regenerative hybrid braking systems . Though it may not seem a lot it increases fuel efficiency from 4 mpg to about 6 mpg. The Second Benefit is Trash Trucks go through brake pads and disks/drums on an average of every 60-90 days. A regenerative hybrid braking systems , due to its functions , requires a brake/disk change every 4 years or so. In 4 years, the new system requires one brake maintenance and materials , and the non requires 5 a year average or 20 service /brake pads/disk/drums. The cost increases from $225,000 to about $450,000 a truck but the city can recoup about 50% from Federal grants including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. 1. In purchasing new large item equipment , such as DPW trucks, had anyone evaluated new types of vehicles and grants/money available based on them to reduce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 costs? 2. What is the cost of maintenance , downtime , and its impact on having extra trucks to cover for ones out of service ? Thank you. Thomas Coyne The second submission is from Miss Bev DeBaros . Dear Council ~ will all of our polling places be ready for in person voting? Will that info be available well before election day? That was really inconvenient to be told we had to go to the Globe Building . About recycling plastics ~ Which numbered items, indicated in the triangle , are we supposed to recycle ? Thank you, Bev DeBaros . Number three submitted by Patricia Nestor regarding the Mayor's volunteer Corp. - Cleaning up parks. - Helping people. - Doing things in an organized 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 manner. - Park ambassadors . - Making this political with the mayor's branding on everything . - She's not well liked and people are not going to give her free advertising . - Change the name to “Scranton Volunteer Corp.” - Better yet would be to work through already established neighborhood associations . - The “park ambassadors ” could stop at parks in their neighborhood before monthly meetings for assessment and take pictures to be included in group meetings . - Increase and strengthen neighborhood associations . - Each neighborhood association should have a Facebook /social media group with information about where/when meetings . - Meeting minutes and videos available for people who can't make it to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 meetings . That would be me. ?? My disabilities keep me from going, but I am still interested . Other people can't go because of work, kids, etc. That's all. I'm bring this up because our mayor loves marketing , playing with hashtags , graphics , branding . My son is 22 and has no problem spending a nice day indoors . I wouldn't unplug him and send him to the park wearing a t-shirt with her branding and give her free political advertisement . Nope. Nope. Nope. This is about cleaning up the parks. This is about cleaning up Scranton . This isn't about her. Remove her branding , please. Additional comment by Patricia Nestor: Does anyone watch Colombo on MeTv, Sunday nights? I feel like him, “Oh yeah, one more thing....” The mayor did city hall pop ups all over the city. I haven’t been to any, but the LIP’s were involved . They should give out applications for people to license their dogs since they are out at parks and places dogs go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 walking . If the whole process was online, they could do it right there with a credit/debit card. Online you can print out an application and send in the mail, but you can’t just do the process online. A lot of people don’t have printers or are perpetually out of ink. You’re missing out on revenue ! I think $35 per dog a year is way too high though. Areas around Scranton are $5-$10. People would be more willing to pay that instead of being a scofflaw . Have a good night. Patricia Nestor The number four comment is from Norma Jeffries regarding NDC presentation in January 2020 parking at Kiosk System. On page 12 of the presentation made by NDC/ABM it list the following features of the Smart Meter Parking System: State of the art technology . ·Touch screen capability . ·Coins, credit cards and mobile payment .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 ·Ease to use and maintain . (Guess it should be Ease of use and maintain ) ·Enhanced enforcement (pay be plate) (Guess that should read pay by plate) My concerns : 1) I received a meter violation which cost me $35 which is the new rate for 2020. However , why the $3.00 processing fee. On page 16, Under column 2020 New Rate for Meter Overtime , it states $35.00. No mention is made of the processing fee. Shouldn 't the processing fee be the cost of doing business and why should we be charged that additional fee? 2) As listed above, Page 12 states that coins can be used in the meters. That has not been the case with me. The meters on Washington Ave, require the use of a credit card. It would not take my quarters . Again on page 16 under On Street Parking , the fee is $1.50 for up to an hour, which seems excessive when you are just going into a facility to pick up lunch! Hopefully an adjustment can be made to these rates since so many restaurants in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 city offer curbside pickup. Respectfully Submitted Norma Jeffries Comment number five submitted by Fay Franus. 1. Mr. Gaughan last weeks meeting you stated that ECTV received money from Comcast but that was a grant not money given to ECTV from the Comcast Franchise Fee that comes into the city four times a year, which is a considerable amount. Have you gone back to the controller and asked him to tell you how much money ECTV has received from the Comcast Franchise Fee each year? If so what did he say? If you did not ask will you do so this week for sure? 2. Mr. Gaughan have you asked anyone WHY Scranton Tomorrow has received money from the Comcast Franchise Fee and how much have they received ? 3. Could council please get an accounting of how Scranton Tomorrow spends all of the thousands of dollars the city has given 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 them plus any money they received from the Comcast Franchise Fee and the money the University of Scranton has directed to them in lieu of taxes. Comment on question three, It is quite possible that when money is given to a city in lieu of taxes it MUST go into the operating budget not be dictated to the city as to where they want their money to go as did the University of Scranton when they stated half of their money they gave was to go to Scranton Tomorrow . So I suggest you check with your lawyers to examine that law and make sure if and when the University gives money again in lieu of taxes it goes into the operating budget. I know I have addressed these questions previously but I have not received any replies to any of them -thus I must ask again? Also if council decides to have people come into a caucus to go over the rules on collecting rental registration fees and what happens to the buildings if they do not pay please make sure you ask them to answers to questions you can present to them before they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 come in. This way it won't be another time when they say "We will check into that and get back to you" We need to know state laws in regards to many questions you may ask. Submitted by Fay Franus And the last comment was submitted by Marie Schumacher as follows : - Does the City have a policy on use of gas cars? - Did the CIty check with all CIty-based institutions of higher learning to inquire whether or not they required students and those accompanying them on moving in to prove they were COVID-19 negative within five days of going on campus? If so, what were the answers ? - Soon we will return to Council Chamber for Meetings , 2021 Budget Hearings and Other Special Events. Has Council replaced the podium and Visitor Table microphones so all may hear? If not, please get this done before the Budget Hearings begin. Thank you. - Cold Chain (Gress went from a PA company to a Delaware Corporation . Does this impact the CIty revenue in any way?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 - I hope you read Joan Hodowanitz 's letter-to-the-editor in last Sunday's Times and will ensure City's labor contracts are put on the website . - Boscov's will be holding their Friends Helping Friends next month (14 & 15 October ). Please encourage non-profits to register and come out to shop and save on their purchases and raise funds for the non-profit they mention during check out. Again submitted by Marie Schumacher . And that concludes the submitted comment s, Councilman Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just want to check through really quick. Some of the answers to these that I know offhand and then the rest we'll submit to the administration to get answered hopefully prior to next week. So the first from Mr. Coyne, he asked about agenda Item 5-D, the license plate reader legislation . What are the benefits and the downside? There is a pretty extensive program there that I'm not going to go through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 the whole thing that explains the purpose for the police department going through this legislation . So I think that would answer what are the benefits to that program . There's -- Mr. Coyne raises other issues and points here and question s about how the City would be able to upload and share the data and data sharing regarding this program . I don't know the answers to those. But certainly inquire with the police department . Bev DeBaros submitted a couple questions , will all of our polling places be ready for in-person voting? I believe that they will be. But that would be a question for the Lackawanna County Department of Elections . I think there was an issue for the primary -- one or two issues. I think they've been taken care of. The question about the recycling , which numbered items indicate d in the triangle are we supposed to recycle ? Kyle, do you know that off the top of your head? I can't -- I'm drawing a blank. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, actually I was searching for it when I saw that come in today. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 I have it somewhere . I just don't know exactly which ones they are. I believe it's one through three. But I'm not positive . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So we'll follow up for Bev DeBaros on that. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Gaughan -- MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : I did send an e-mail over to Mrs. DeBaros before the meeting of the polling places and the changes in location . MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, okay. Great. Thank you. Okay, that takes care of that. Patricia Nestor, there's really no questions in here just comment s. But the one comment about making the meeting minutes and videos available for people who can't make it to the -- I'm assuming to the Council meeting s. Our meeting are posted on YouTube . So if you go to YouTube and type in ECTV Scranton , you could find I think every Council meeting going back to at least 2016 or 2015. And they're also televised live on YouTube and then live on ECTV. The minutes are located on Scranton pa.gov and all of the public comment s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 are entered into the official record. Miss Franus's questions . So the question about ECTV receiving money from Comcast , so I did send the -- I believe I sent the franchise agreement that was passed I believe back in 2015 to Miss Franus. ECTV does receive grant money from that agreement . They do not -- they don't receive anything else but that. So the question about that was grant money not given to ECTV from the Comcast franchise fee that comes into the City four times a year. If you look at the agreement , it's delineated right there what money ECTV gets and the disbursement s. So I might have misspoke a week or two ago. And Controller Murray sent me further information . The payment -- the last payment to ECTV from the Comcast grant and the Comcast agreement was actually February 10th, 2020. And that's listed as the third disbursement . She also asked why anyone -- can anyone answer why Scranton Tomorrow has received money from the Comcast franchise fee and how much have they received ? They do not receive any money from the Comcast franchise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 fee agreement . It's only ECTV. Scranton Tomorrow does not receive any funding . Could we get an accounting of how Scranton Tomorrow spends all the thousands of dollars the City's given them? That is detailed in the budget. So any time that the City, as far as I know, gave any money or allocated any money to Scranton Tomorrow , that was detailed in the budget narrative . We can follow up with Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow for a more detailed accounting of that. But I think the details are in the budget. And again, they don't receive any money from the Comcast franchise fee. Then there's another question from Miss Franus about the pilot payments so the money that the City gets, for example , from the University of Scranton in lieu of taxes and that it must go into the operating budget, not to be dictate d to the City by the University of Scranton . A few years ago was actually -- I think this was a good idea. Instead of the University just giving the City a blank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 check -- or not a blank check, but giving the City a check in lieu of taxes to go into the operating budget, it was decided between the City and the university here's what we're going to spend that money on. So if you're giving us a check for $250,000 in lieu of taxes, rather than it just go into the budget, we're going to spend it on parks. We're going to spend it on -- I can't remember off the top of my head what it's been spent on. But it's for a specific use. So it doesn't just go into the operating budget. There's a rhyme and a reason for that. And I think I answered most of the questions there. And Mrs. Jeffries 's questions , I don't know off the top of my head. But we'll follow up with NDC and ABM to take care of that. And Miss Schumacher , does the City have a policy on use of gas cars? I think it's gas cards, not gas cars. I don't know for sure if that's a typo. But there is a policy for that. There was one created by Mayor Evans. And I think it was tweaked by this administration . And we can get Miss Schumacher 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 a copy of that policy. Also, asked a question about when we eventually return to Council Chambers , did we replace the podium and visitor table microphones so all may hear. We were looking at the acoustic s of Council Chambers . As everyone knows, it's a little awkward in there when you're listening to somebody at the podium. Once the pandemic happened , that project had stalled . So we did not take that up again yet. But we will hopefully prior to getting back into Council Chambers . But Mrs. Reed and I and the rest of Council will have a conversation about that. Then there's other questions here I'm not positive of the answer. So we'll follow up. Anybody else on the question ? All those in favor of accepting public comment , signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 ayes have it and the motion to accept public comment passes. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. As Chairman of the Public Safety Committee , I would like to wish Sergeant Steve Marino of the Scranton Police Department , wish him, you know, best wishes on his retirement from law enforcement for a total of 39 years. That's awesome . Thank you, sir, for your service . I would also like to wish again Chief Carl Graziano , you know, a class act of the City on his endeavors . I know he's not quite retiring yet. But I'd like to thank him for his devoted service to the City. I would also like to congratulate interim Chief Namiotka -- I hope I'm pronouncing his name correctly on his new position and looking forward to working with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 him and best of luck. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just want to make one comment on a piece of legislation that we have on our agenda for tonight and that's 5-E, which will designate a loading and unloading zone in front of the postal service office that's on Lackawanna Avenue at the Steamtown building . And that was something that started back in July. One of the workers came to me and explained that they were having an issue -- an issue of safety where they did have -- they were suppose d to have a loading zone but people were often parking in it and so then they were forced to have to double park in order to, you know, make their deliver ies to that office or pickups. And there is three different times of day that you'll see there in that legislation that's when they have their loading and unloading times. So the sign would be a bit more specific and detailed and hopefully 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 more obvious to people so that they avoid parking during those times to make their jobs and lives a little bit easier at the post office. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I just have two comments just to -- really just two questions for the administration if Mrs. Reed could pass them along. One is, could we get a -- from the administration a timeline on when the McLane and Associates Park Assessment will be completed ? And also, would we be able to ask the administration for the update on their internal assessment of LIPS Department that was suppose d to be done in place of Barry Isett and Associates coming in and doing the LIPS assessment ? And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman Donahue . All right. Thank you, everyone . I just have a few comments . As I mention ed in the caucus if anybody was here for that, the RFP that many people are interested 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 in for the deal with the -- really take a look from an engineering perspective at the Keyser Valley stormwater runoff issues. That is going to be coming out soon from what I understand in talking with the DPW Director and the Law Department . I did meet with the DPW Director out in Fawnwood with neighbors who live on Whitetail Drive about some flooding issues. So that is an issue that is being looked at and hopefully will be addressed soon because there's a lot of issues out there with that and people's homes who are getting damaged . The second thing I wanted to mention was just in terms of requests that I receive d, 528 Birch Street, this is a vacant lot that's been overgrown now for quite some time. Neighbors have complain ed to me. There's been no action just yet as far as I could see. So we did send that into the Licensing and Inspections Department . Also several issues in South Side from a resident , 1603 Pittston Avenue, a roof collapsed next to 430 Pittston Avenue; 2208 Pittston Avenue there's issues and the 2900 block of Cedar 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Avenue. So we did send that -- I think this is the second time that we sent those to the Licensing and Inspections Department . I also met this weekend with several residents in 900 block of Prescott Avenue. They're having issues with the blight and issues with the Hindu temple up at 933 Prescott Avenue. So I did take down notes about the situation and forwarded those to the Mayor and requested a meeting with the License and Inspections Director and the City Planner . I won't go through all the issues because there is just too many to go through tonight . But I did put those in writing . And hopefully we'll get that meeting soon and the residents can move forward with their lives because it's being interrupted daily because of those issues. Also, Mrs. Reed, I'd like to know if we could get from the administration a status of the Novembrino Pool Complex Project. I'd like to see at this point a total cost of the project to date verse what the original budget was for that project . I'd also like to know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 how many change orders have been issued by the contract or and what the total amount of the change orders were. So I'd like details on that. Also, I do know that the administration has an internship program in the City which I think is fantastic . I would like to know if the City is fronting the cost at all or any costs associated with the internship program . It's my understanding that most of the cost is being covered by I think the state but I'm not positive . So if we can forward that question onto the Mayor just on how that program works and how it's funded. We have been asking for an update on the sale of receivable s and when that RFP will go out. That is roughly a million and a half dollars at stake in the budget. Councilman Donahue and I have been told that that is going out hopefully soon. I just still want to say for the record that I'm concerned to say the least. I hope that this works out, but I feel like we may have waited too long. I hope that I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 wrong on that. But I think that we're cutting it really, really close. If somehow the deal falls through , the RFP doesn't go out or it goes out and it doesn't materialize for whatever reason, that's a million and half hole in the budget along with the other issues that we have. So that's a concern of mine. Also, I asked within the last few weeks for an update on the Sign Program . A few years ago Council had approved a contract with KS Engineering . And I know Mrs. Jeffries is always interested in this. So hopefully she's watching . And at that time the rational e behind entering into a contract with this company was so that they would go around the City and they would create a database of all of the signs in the City, stop signs, children at play signs, street signs, so on and so forth. They have the technology to do it. So we really bought that technology . And I had asked for an update on the data that we had received so far from that program , how many signs have been replaced, how many signs are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 still outstanding that need to be replaced. And Director Preambo sent me that data today. I looked through it. It's the latest data -- field data that was recorded from the DPW staff. So I just wanted to update everyone . Currently since this program was launched , 337 existing signs have been replaced throughout the City, 12 existing signs were removed , 2000 -- there are 2,040 signs that are considered in poor condition that need to be replaced. So these are stop signs, street signs and other signs throughout the City. So there remains a lot of work to be done. Director Preambo reported to me that the DPW is proceed ing with a multimodal transportation grant opportunity through DCED to secure funding to contract the remaining signs requiring replacement . So at this point they're exploring funding avenues while the department maintains the in-house initiative to reduce the balance that's remaining. And just so everyone knows, we only have two employees in that sign department . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 And they do a very, very good job. And they have made a dent in this on top of everything else that they do and that are responsible for. But there does remain the issue that there are quite a few signs in neighborhood s throughout the City which are faded, which are, you know, poor, which are not reflective at night. So those do have to be replaced. And I was happy to hear that there's a process and program in place to do that. And that's all I have this week. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 4, 2020, ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CONSOLIDATED SUBMISSION FOR COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO BE FUNDED UNDER THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT (CDBG) PROGRAM , HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP (HOME) PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANTS (ESG) PROGRAM FOR THE FIVE YEAR CONSOLIDATED PLAN, ANALYSIS OF IMPEDIMENTS TO FAIR HOUSING CHOICE, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 AND ANNUAL ACTION PLAN FOR THE PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2020.” BY AMENDING THE 2020 ACTION PLAN BY PROGRAMMING $1,649,621 IN CDBG-CV FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY THE CARES ACT AND PROGRAMMING $1,435,629 (ROUND #1 $813,478 AND ROUND #2 $622,150) IN ESG-CV FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE BY THE CARES ACT. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. On the question ? On the question , this is obviously very important funding that the City is receiving from the federal government through the CARES Act. I went through and looked at this legislation , and there was a few things that I just want to point out. Exhibit A in the legislation , it looks like it's missing a second page. It's hard to tell but the two pages don't jibe together . Then there's another letter where it doesn't look like the first and second page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 match up. So it's probably just an error, a clerical error on the administration 's part. But I just wanted to try clear that up. The figures in the spreadsheet , we received this before for whatever reason and maybe it was a scanning issue. I don't know. I'm going to discuss this with Mrs. Reed. It's very hard to read some of the figures and some of the words and statements on the spreadsheet. So I would ask before final passage that we receive a spreadsheet that is legible that we could read. I also wanted to know if there's a deadline on when this money has to be spent. So is there a timing -- because in the past, I know there's been timeliness issues with different funding . So I'm wondering if there is any timeline on this. And also, I would like to know who's in charge of administering the ESG Program at this point. I have to say that I'm a little concerned . I do know in talking with the administration in the past few months that for whatever reason they eliminated position of emergency solutions grant public service specialist in OECD. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 And it's my understand ing that that person was in charge of administering program s that you would see on your spreadsheet . Now that we're getting a very large amount of money from the federal government , what individual in OECD is going to be administering this program ? That would be a concern of mine since the ESG and public service specialist position has been eliminated . And I'd also like to get a further explanation as to, you know, now that employee s are back in City Hall or working from home or whatever on why exactly that position was eliminated and who is going to be taking up this work now. And that's all I have on 5-B. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 NO. 4, 2020, ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CONSOLIDATED SUBMISSION FOR COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO BE FUNDED UNDER THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT (CDBG) PROGRAM , HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP (HOME) PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANTS (ESG) PROGRAM FOR THE FIVE YEAR CONSOLIDATED PLAN, ANALYSIS OF IMPEDIMENTS TO FAIR HOUSING CHOICE, AND ANNUAL ACTION PLAN FOR THE PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2020.” BY AMENDING THE 2020 ACTION PLAN BY UTILIZING EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ($80,000.00) UNDER CDBG. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, was there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question ? On the question , this was a request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 from UNC to move this money from the Project Hope, the camp that they have which is an outstanding program ; but unfortunately , because of the pandemic they had to cancel that this year. So they're going to move this money to UNC Certified Housing Counsellor which makes sense to me. The only comment that I would have on this is that just like in 5-B, the spreadsheet s that were provided were very difficult to read. So before final passage , Mrs. Reed, if we could get spreadsheet s that are legible , I would appreciate that. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , Bill, can we add to your request about is there a counsellor already present or will they be hiring a counsellor ? And then this money, will that be funding that position for one year? MR. GAUGHAN : I believe that this is just for the -- I think it's just for the program . But we can double-check on that. I'm not positive . But I think it's just to fund 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the Housing Counselling Program but -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that was a little unclear there from the information that came along with that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, yeah, we can double-check before next week. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT AND, IF SUCCESSFUL , A GRANT AGREEMENT , AND ACCEPT FUNDS RELATED THERETO THROUGH THE BJA FY 18 EDWARD BYRNE JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT (“JAG”) PROGRAM -LOCAL SOLICITATION IN THE AMOUNT OF $18,638.00 TO PURCHASE AN AUTOMATED LICENSE PLATE READER (ALPR). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I think Mr. Coyne had a couple of good questions about this including some of the, you know, the past usages of this device and whether -- I know this is grant money here. But maybe purchases were made in the past. And does the usage of this type of machine , I guess, pay for itself? Is it worth the purchase I guess is what I'm trying to say. MR. GAUGHAN : I believe it is just because if you look at two things. We already have two that the police department uses. And I think any time that you can multiply manpower with a, you know, with a data gathering tool like this in terms of the license plate reader, I think that's a good thing. In the backup it states that the license plate reader will be used in investigation , location of suspects , wanted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 persons and to me, most important ly amber alerts. I think Mr. Coyne's questions we can definitely inquire with the police department . But I'm going to be in favor of this legislation . I think again, any time you can multiply -- put a multiplier out there in terms of eyes on the street with some of the things that we have going on in the City, I think that's a good thing. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'd just like to add, like you said, we do already have two of these. This would just be an additional , a third one. In my past conversation s with SPD, it seems like this has been a really helpful and effective tool for them and a way that they've been able to find suspects , you know. I don't believe it's being used for any other type of invasion of privacy . If I did, I would not be in favor of this. But I do feel comfortable because the use has been beneficial to date.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON , UPON THE OFFER OF CONDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT TO THE SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO ALLOW PARTICIPATION IN THE ACT 120 PROGRAM , APPLICANTS WHO ACCEPT SAID OFFER WILL REIMBURSE THE CITY OF SCRANTON ON A PRO-RATA BASIS IF THE EMPLOYEE TERMINATES EMPLOYMENT WITH THE CITY OF SCRANTON PRIOR TO THREE YEARS. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this was a suggestion made by Councilman McAndrew and myself to the Mayor when we had first heard the news that the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 was going to be picking up the cost of training -- Act 120 training for potential incoming police officers . So Councilman McAndrew and I had asked several questions of the Mayor. I just want to check through some of them. So one of the questions was, was there enough money in the police department budget to afford taking this cost on. And we did receive a response from the administration . They said that we -- yes, as we have been and currently are budgeted for 147 police officers in which any new hires regardless of whether they're the police academy or not would count towards the authorized 147. In addition , the City will be reimbursed from the state 45 percent of the new officer 's salary while he or she is attending 919 hours of training at the police academy . There could potentially be overtime accrued while an officer is in training instead of being on the road. However , that cost depends upon several factors to include the time of year and how many non-Act 120 certified officers are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 hired and in training at the same time. They do not believe that any overtime would exceed 45 percent of each of the new officer 's salaries while he or she is in the academy . We also asked what the cost -- total cost would be per individual to include the class, books, exam, etc. The current police academy tuition is $8,500. This includes tuition , supplies , and books. The City will -- would be reimbursed $6,375 of that tuition for each new officer attending the academy . This difference could marginally add to the police training budget absent a mass exodus from the department and considering that Act 120 certified officer s could possibly also be hired at the same time as noncertified officer s. It is not expected that the City would send more than a few officer s to the police academy each year. You know, I'm going to be in favor of this because of that. According to the administration , most of the cost of this would be picked up by the state -- I believe by the state. So 45 percent of the new officers ' 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 salary while she's or he's attending the training at the police academy and most of the cost of the tuition , the books, the class. So I do think that this makes sense in terms of expanding our base and expanding the opportunity to get more qualified applicant s into the police department . And I want to thank Councilman McAndrew for helping me with this and making that suggestion that if we're going to pay for someone to take the classes and pay for their books and their tuition that they're not going to turn around -- get hired by the City and then turn around in a year, take a job offer someplace else. If they do that according to this legislation , they're going to have to pay the City back fully within the first year and then it's on a decreasing scale from then on out. So anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : So I just have one, I guess, question on that. So they don't technically become City employees until they actually graduate from the academy , correct ? MR. GAUGHAN : I think they're -- I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 think they're City employees as -- I think they're hired. You could hire the employee and then they could take the class. That's my understanding of it. Solicitor Hayes, would you know that off the top of your head? ATTY. HAYES: Typically the way it normally -- I previously served as the Solicitor to the Civil Service Commission . And the way it was traditionally arranged that was a new entry level patrol applicant couldn't even apply unless they had the Act 120 certification . So in other words, you weren't eligible unless you had the Act 120 certification . This changes that. And I don't know for certain as to when -- as to when they would become employees . But I could get between now and next week, I will try to get clarification on that issue. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you because , I mean, I agree with the, you know, thought behind this 100 percent . My only concern is, you know, if they become employees and they get hurt at the academy , would they qualify for a disability pension ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 ATTY. HAYES: I know for the firefighters to go to the fire training at Harrisburg Area Community College , my understanding is that they are employees when they go there and that is if they get injured , they are covered by available programs for employees , injured employees . So I will research that issue and report back to you certainly before next week. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Good question . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, my understanding is they are hired first. The way I read it they're hired first. And then they receive the certification : I'll be a yes for this only because our concerns and questions were addressed . And they were incorporate d into the process . Along with President Gaughan we really, you know, talked about this and made sure that this is done right and the City benefits instead of losing. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? All right. All those in favor of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR.

MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , just looking through this legislation the Cedar Avenue -- what has taken place on Cedar Avenue over the last of decade or so in terms of the redevelopment there has been really outstanding . This project will connect the Cedar Avenue corridor with our downtown . Right now if you're, you know, walking or biking or running as we see more and more throughout the City, you try to get from South Side to downtown or any other part of the City, at times it's difficult . If you look in the backup or anyone is interest ed in the public in looking at some of the drawing s and the graphic s that what they're planning on doing, this project would transform that whole area down by the Iron Works, Cedar Avenue to downtown . It would make such a huge difference in my opinion . And as I was talking to somebody the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 other day, we're seeing more and more because of the Lackawanna Heritage Valley authorities who work on the trail, more biking, more running , more walking especially with pandemic it seems like everyone is out that the weather is nice. So this program would be a huge benefit to the businesses downtown , the businesses in that Cedar Avenue corridor , the people living in South Side and in the downtown , overall it's a great project .

GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, was there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. On the question ? On question , I just want to say briefly that as everybody knows, Nay Aug Park is a major asset that we have in the City. And I have to give another plug to the Scranton Recreation Board, to our Parks and Recreation Department for the work -- all the work that they've done up at Nay Aug Park. I'm up there quite often with my children and my wife just, you know, walking through the park using the playground when the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 weather is nice, using the Davis trail quite often as well. These wooden observation decks and the safety rails are in desperate need of repair. So I'm glad to see that the administration and the Recreation Authority Board by providing a match here is really being proactive in trying to keep this park where it needs to be. And there is so many other improvements going on up there. It's really nice to see that we're keeping our assets and our parks up to where they need to be. Anyone else on the question ?

MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-L be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I have a few questions about this one as well. So this legislation we're demolishing the City properties first, so Weston Field bathhouse , Penn Ridge Pool Complex and Connell Park bathhouse, the concession stand and the announcer tower. So what I would like to know is -- and I'm sorry if I missed this because I gave this a quick glance, what is the plan moving forward now since we're demolish ing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 bathhouse at Connell Park, the concession stand, the announcer tower, is there anything going up in place of that after we demolish it? What's the plan there? On page 15, I believe in looking at it that the timeline is off. It says the demolition will begin in June of 2020. I'm assuming that's 2021. I don't know. But the timeline seems to be way off there. I did talk to Mrs. Reed about that if we can get an updated timeline . And the other question I had, the private properties on here, I'll use one as an example that I've gotten so many calls about is 2939 Birney Avenue. That is a property that -- like all the other ones listed that has to come down as soon as possible . So I understand and I agree with them going for this grant money, but a question I have is, why can't we use the money that's already been budgeted for demolition ? I checked with Controller Murray, there is $145,000 that we already have in the 2020 budget for demolition at least for the private contract properties on here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 I know that might not cover all of them. But we can pick off maybe some of the ones that are in worse condition to try to get that done this year right away with 2939 Birney Avenue being one of those that I think should come down immediately . So, two questions , do we plan on using this funding ? How much money do we have total in our demolition budget even from years prior? I know this is a question that's come up -- came up before in terms of, you know, having money that's been left over even in the OECD budget. So I'd like those questions answered prior to final passage of this legislation . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-M.

At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-M be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , these three properties here, I would imagine that the homeowners are in favor of this. Do we know if there's -- well, can we request information to see if there is any other properties or structure s that are in the floodplain in that area? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, certainly . MR. SCHUSTER : And then if there is any future plans to, you know, spread this out into a larger area or if it's just going to be contained within those properties . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Good questions . Anyone else? I just had two question s on this. It says in the legislation that eventually it's the City's goal to rebuild the floodplain and an adequate pump station for this area. So my question there would be, you know, what does this look like? What would the plan for that be? What does that entail besides going for the grant money which I agree with and acquiring and demolishing these properties ? So I know from a few years ago the administration answered this question but it's escaping me. We did have money in either the 2018 or 2019 budget for the Keyser Valley Pumping Station. So my question is, what -- I know there's been money spent there. I believe there's been money put in there. What else has to be done to bring that pumping station into an adequate status, you know, what is that going to cost? And what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 is the -- do they have a timeline yet for that? Those are the questions that I would have.

If you look through this legislation , first of all, the work that they've already done for the youth in our community is really -- it's just outstanding that they would put in their own time, their own effort, take away from their own families to go out and provide an area for the youth of West Scranton and our City to have a place to go and play basketball , to have a place to go after school to do educational activities , help with homework , a game room, things like that. There's really not a lot of areas for children to do that like there used to be years and years ago in the City.

And in addition , we are allowing for additional time for transition in the event that the parties determine d that we were going to terminate this agreement . Specifically , there was a 30-day notice proposed . Council went back and asked for 60 days. And that was agreed to by the parties . So again, the revisions are outlined in the memo that is in Third Order, very, very minor changes . MR. GAUGHAN : Good. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion to amend Item 7-A signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A as amended . MR. DONAHUE : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , bottom line, I've talked about this now for the past two weeks and the past few years. This is a good deal for the City of Scranton and the taxpayers in the City of Scranton . I think last week I mentioned in working with NRS, the City got I think 85 cents on every dollar that was collected . With the county, I think it works out to like 95 cents for every dollar that's collect ed. So it's clear that this is a good deal. The other thing that I'm really hopeful for in having a meeting today with members of the administration , Solicitor Hayes, and the county is that we're eventually going -- hopefully be able to have the county collect our delinquent refuse fees. Again, it will end up being a savings , an overall savings for the taxpayers and more revenue in our coffers , which is sorely needed. And we won't have to reply hopefully on a private company like we have in the past. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, this is great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 that Tax Claim Bureau is going to replace NRS, first of all. I'm with you, Billy. This is long overdue . I'm also thrilled to hear tonight that everybody seems to keep working towards this goal quicker than we might have thought maybe a week or two ago. So I agree with Solicitor Hayes and thank him for being part of this process . And, you know, I agree with him that, you know, this is a very viable option that I want to see sooner than later. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please, Miss Carrera . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR.
