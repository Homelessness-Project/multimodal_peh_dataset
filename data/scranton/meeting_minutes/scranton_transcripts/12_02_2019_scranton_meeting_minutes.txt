CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 public comment on agenda items or matters of general concern : Joan Hodowanitz Dave Dobrzyn .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comment s? MR. PERRY: I have nothing at this time. MR. ROGAN: Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Thank you. No motions , one quick comment . Joan, I would just like to address your issue regarding whether we're going to go to December 16th with meeting s. As I said in caucus, I certainly have absolutely no objection to going until December 16th. However , this will be my first year voting on the taxing legislation and also voting on the budget. So I did discuss with our solicitor whether there were any adverse repercussion s or any legal implications I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 should be aware of if we didn't vote on them or we didn't have all of the reading s associated with them. And, in fact, he wisely said and it makes sense to me that he felt the taxing legislation should be voted on at the same time as the budget which I have to say does make some sense to me. And since the budget has to be voted on by December 15th and we're probably going to do it next week on December 9th, it does make some sense to me that we would do the same thing with the taxing legislation . I just wanted to make that clear. If there is any other issues or business that mandate us to be here until December 16th, I'm more than happy to do it. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just to pick up on that and I actually was planning on mention ing that at the meeting tonight . We did just discuss it. In the past, Council always does recess at the time of the budget being passed in past years. I know we looked back last year we were actually done a week sooner, the year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 before around the same time of the Sewer Authority Sale. Because we delayed the budget a week we're actually meeting a week later than we have last year. And the other comment about, you know, Council 's accessibility , the vast majority of the requests at least I know that I get come from going to the grocery store, Facebook page, e-mail. We always do get people at the podium that are looking for help here and there. But Council 's always accessible whether we're meeting or not. And even more so than us, our office is staffed by three great people that do a great job. So they're available during business hours every day. Just one other item I want to mention , I know I brought this up in caucus. We did receive a letter from Attorney Minora regarding the Council Solicitorship . And I do want to read it and give some comment . It says, Gentlemen , please accept this as my resignation from the position of Council Solicitor effective January 6th, 2020. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 If I could be any assistance to the incoming solicitor , please do not hesitate to call. Thank you for allowing me to be a service to this city. It's been my honor and privilege . I would just like to thank Attorney Minora for his service to Council over of the last six years. We've gotten a lot done from where the City is then to now nobody could -- we're definitely in better shape now than we were six years ago. And a couple key points I do want to mention and I know Attorney Minora wouldn't bring these up himself because he's a very modest guy. One thing about Attorney Minora that I'd really like to commend him for is there were many times over the last six years when he had an opportunity to get other fees on top of his salary as Council Solicitor and every time he turned those down. And they were large fees. Previous solicitors City and Council solicitors have accepted fees. I know there was an issue at the school district as well on bond fees, the Sewer Authority deal, you know, many times he was asked and always declined and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 did his review on Council as part of his salary. So I want to commend him for that. And I do think that that sets a standard for the next Council Solicitor that they should be limited to just their salary and also our City Solicitor as well. Our current City Solicitor has not accepted any fees on top of her salary and previous City Solicitors in years past have. So I think that's a good practice moving forward . Also want to note that Attorney Minora wrote the new ethics law that I know we've talked about quite a bit over the last year. I know he put a lot of work and effort into that. And one item that I specifically want to thank him for is obtaining the state police report on the double pensions . I know it was not an easy task getting a state investigative agency to release a report to a noninvestigative body. So I want to thank you for all your service and for all of those items and sad to see you go but we'll thank you for your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 service . ATTY. MINORA: Thank you. MR. PERRY: We were lucky to have you, Amil. Thank you. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Thank you, Amil. MR. ROGAN: We did discuss prior to the meeting in caucus, obviously there will be a vacancy in Council 's office for solicitor position . So we agreed to put an advertisement in the newspaper . Any other attorney s living in the City of Scranton that are interest ed in applying shall do so by sending a letter of interest and a resume to the City Council office. The deadline for submission we agreed would be the 13th of this month. So there's a little bit of time and there will be an ad in the newspaper going in as well. But I do want to announce that at the meeting as well. That is all for tonight . MS. REED: 5-B.
