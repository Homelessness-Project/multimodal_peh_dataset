CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED JULY 20, 2023 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR JANUARY THROUGH JUNE 2023. 3.G. AGENDA FOR THE SCRANTON CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING TO BE HELD ON JULY 26, 2023. MR. MCANDREW : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I just have one comment on the Item 3-E. This is the overtime report from the City Controller . As I said last week, it appears that our June and July overtime from the refuse department has been up. Taking notice of June it's over $40,000 which -- or I'm sorry, as of July it's over $40,000.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 So it's definitely an anomaly as this is $20,000 more than -- this has been per month over the last three years. That's all. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few of them. So there's a couple of events coming up this weekend . And then there's some things going on in August and we won't be here for the month of August since we'll be on break. This weekend will be St. Joe's Center Summer Festival . And that's going to be at Marywood . That will be Friday through Sunday, Friday 4 to 10, Saturday 4 to 10 and Sunday 12 to 7. And then there will be the Craft Fair taking place at Nay Aug. They are going to start off the morning with a 5K race. You could walk or run with that race. So if you want to sign up there is still time to be able to do that. They are going to have volleyball. There's going to be a craft fair. There's going to be activities all day long at Nay Aug Park that day. And on Sunday, August, 6th will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 the Waldorf Park German Day. And that's always a great event to look forward to. So if you want to head over for some German food and music and a great time, that's going to be on Sunday, August 6th. It's $8 at the door. Children under 12 for free. And there is also going to be -- I think it's their first year of doing it but there's going to be a Latino Fiesta at Nay Aug Park on Saturday , August 5th. And that's going to be from 12 to 7. And they'll have food vendors there and a lot of things going on then too. That's all that I have. MR. MCANDREW : Anybody else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have one. The second round of the hometown heros banners are going up in North Scranton . There's going to be applications on August 6 at the VFW on Rockwell Avenue from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I have a quick one. So all of you know what the Victor Alfieri Society is or at least most of us from West Side. They are not going to have a luncheon for August, which is unfortunate . But this Thursday , July 27th from 11:30 a.m. to 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 p.m., they'll have their lunch which will be chicken parmesan or pasta and meatballs or half and half. Price for members , $12. Price for nonmembers , $14. And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. MCANDREW : Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton , well, since this is the last meeting until September 5th I thought I'd talk about some things going on in August as Dr. Rothchild did. The Friends of the Scranton Public Library will be holding their next book sale, August 28 which is a Monday through Sunday, September 3rd. It's at the Marketplace at Steamtown on the second floor. It's a great way to buy books at a reasonable price, one or two dollars . Childrens books are as cheap as a quarter . So please keep that in mind. And speaking of events supported by the library , the Children 's library is a great place to take your kids during the summer. A lot of times, you know, people say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 there's nothing for children to do. Well, let me run down some of the events for August. August 1st, Tuesday , 10:30 a.m., a visit from the Rail Riders and one of their players will be reading to the children . They ask that you call to let them know you are coming, 348-3000, extension 3015. But if you forget, come anyway. No child will be turned away. Then on Tuesday , August 8th at 6 p.m., Here Comes a Fire Truck, a visit from the Scranton Fire Department . And they'll get to explore a real fire engine and the firemen will share some of their stories and teach the kids how to stay safe. So if you hear the air horn going off, that's the kids playing with it. And on August 13th at 2 p.m., they are bringing in a juggler , Rob Smith with all of his amazing tricks. He will juggle five balls, clubs, fire torches , rings, and knives. That will be fun. And then finally on Wednesday , August 16 at 6 p.m., a visit from the Scranton Police dog, the K9 Unit. And you know how kids love dogs. And the police will talk to them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 about the things they go through to protect the children and their families . Now, keep in mind that you want to talk about hometown heros, police and firefighters are right in the front lines. And it's great that they mix with the children and the children learn to respect and know what these men and women can do for them. So this is a great thing. All of these events are free, okay? And kudos to the fire department and the police department for participating in events like this. I think it's wonderful . Do we have an update on the police union arbitration ? Anything moving on that? MR. MCANDREW : We do not. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. How about the pocket park on Wyoming Avenue? I walk past it every day. I haven't seen much movement . MR. MCANDREW : No, we haven't received an update either on that since the last one. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yep, but I will say I was greatly impressed to see in the paper the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 RFP for the audio visual services and meeting space enhancement . I assume that means this place? That will be wonderful . I hope somebody answers the RFP and gets selected and I hope you can adjust the acoustic s, especially for the public caucuses because we cannot hear you from the back and that will be great. And Scranton considers consultant to address gang issue. I think it's great to be paying attention to issues like this. But I think I would turn to people like the police chief and his officers for guidance on the best way to crack this puzzle. I don't know if consultants are the way to go or ask Chief Carroll and his people how to wrap our arms around this to get ahead of the power curve. I'm sure he would have some great ideas. Thank you and have a wonderful August. And I hope when you come back on September 5th, you got all the answers like the status of the audit, the status of the pocket park, the status of the police union arbitration and all the other events that have been hanging in the wind. Have a great day.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Joan. Next up, Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I want to thank Dr. Rothchild for bringing up the activity that is going to be going on at Nay Aug Park on Saturday . But I would like to expand a little bit on that because I'm just so well-involved with it with the meetings , okay? I did bring some fliers down to City Hall. And I want to thank you, Frank, for putting the fliers up. And it is Butterfly Effect Family Fund Day and Fundraiser at Nay Aug Park on July 29. And it starts at 9:00 like Dr. Rothchild said with the race that starts at 9:00. And there's vendors that are going to be there and cheering squad and jugglers and things. So we've been sharing this on Facebook among ourselves and with others. And one of the things that I received back, I received some comments back that they asked me what did that mean. What did it mean that it was an all inclusive playground? So, you know, we get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 into our own little worlds that we don't think that there's others out there that cannot do what we can do that we take for granted. So I looked it up and I would like to read this to everyone that an inclusive playground helps children of all backgrounds and abilities feel a sense of belonging by ensuring every child can fully engage with the equipment without limitation . An inclusive playground in which is play for everyone by providing a variety of sensory experiences that children of all ages can enjoy. So we're just looking forward to that on Saturday to come out if you see this flyer hanging around the city, you know, just make sure you come up to Nay Aug and help us out. The second thing that I wanted to talk about tonight was the conversation that we've had about the neutral gender restrooms . According to Google, the mandate for neutral gender restrooms is not a federal or state regulation . It is an employer regulation . Therefore , if I am reading this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 correctly the change was determined by the administration . I have no issues with the neutral gender restrooms . However , I do have a problem with how it's maintained . And I speak for each of us who use the public restroom s and raising two sons we know -- I'm not going to go into the details of that, but raising two sons we know what that can be any of us who have had sons. So my thing tonight rather than the neutral gender restrooms is the cleanliness of it, the cleanliness that we all have to use those restrooms . So I just ask and think as we use them that we think about others as we come out of them that we leave it in a respect able condition so that we all do what we have to do without having to worry and be disgust ed with the restrooms . And then the third thing I wanted to talk about was Dr. Rothchild . Over the past months references have been made regarding Dr. Rothchild using the title of doctor in her name. Each time it is mentioned I get such an uneasy feeling . Why would the use of doctor cause such a concern to anyone?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 When you Google the use of the doctor title, it is quite clear that the use of doctor is permissible . Dr. Rothchild is a doctor of physical therapy which she has addressed on numerous occasions . At no time has Dr. Rothchild represent ed herself as anything other than a doctor of physical education -- physical therapy . A doctor of physical therapy cannot prescribe medicine or appear to write prescriptions , which Dr. Rothchild has said from her seat. A lot of studying went into Dr. Rothchild obtaining her degree. And under no circumstances would she put herself in jeopardy to use something that was not appropriate . She graduate d from the University of Scranton which is very accredited school throughout the nation. So why would she put the University of Scranton in jeopardy by using something that is not permitted . And I do -- I do take the opportunity -- I had to take the opportunity to address this issue because as I sit there I kept thinking , well, then I'm condoning what's being said if I don't say something . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 If I don't say something I agree with the people that get up here and pass false information . So I went through it. And I'm thinking and thinking about what does it mean to condone something . Condone something means that I agree with what the person is saying and I do not agree. So as I looked, I came across this statement by Dr. Martin Luther King. And it said in the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends . I consider Dr. Rothchild a neighbor and a friend and I could no longer remain silent. So tonight I'm saying, Dr. Rothchild , congratulations and you use doctor whenever you want to. Council , enjoy your August off. And Lord willing we'll all gather again here in August -- September . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you, Norma. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Norma. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . I'm happy to see this wall is finally painted. They took the picture s down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 of all the mayors years ago and all you saw was the white spots that were filled in. Now it's finally painted. It only took I don't know how many years, but it's done. I wanted to be here last week but I couldn't make it unfortunately because I read in the paper now we hired a firm from Philadelphia to do a study on Nay Aug Park for the pool. Are we that inept in this city that we can't do anything without hiring people to do a study? Can't we just hire -- put bids out to hire a pool company ? Tell them what you want and they will put a pool in. Why do we have to spend thousand s and thousands of dollars on studies like we did on that ridiculous walkability study. I just don't know why we -- don't we have qualified people in this city that could do stuff like that? It just blows my mind. I mean, we just got out of distressed status and we're throwing away money like it's growing on trees. It's ridiculous . You're just filling people's pockets with money and the rest of the people in Scranton are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 taxed to death. Speaking of the walkability study, two weeks ago, Mr. Smurl, you said you don't shop downtown because you're afraid you will get hit by a car. Well, there's walk and don't walk signs that help you walk across the street. Do you think putting up stop signs is going to make it safer? If you believe that, I have some swap land in Arizona for sale. Next thing, I read in the paper we have the paving list and I was told that North Rebecca Avenue was on that list but I didn't see it. So is our street going to be paved or isn't it going to be paved? No answer? MR. MCANDREW : We'll inquire . We'll double check. Mr. Voldenberg , take care of that, will you please? Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Was that on a separate list? MR. VOLDENBERG : There are two lists available . I'll check them both. MR. SPINDLER : Because my corner with all the rain we had lately that keeps deteriorating more and more. And I keep 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 getting -- you can't walk down my front steps or you'll have wet feet. It's a couple inches on the bottom of my steps. That's every time it rains. And in the winter I have a skating rink. So if this isn't fixed soon, before you know it the snow will be flying. It's ridiculous . All they have to do is -- they don't have to wait until the paving gets done. Just temporarily come up and put something there, whatever . That's the way things are done in this city. Next thing, two weeks ago Mr. Argenta spoke about some bridges that are in real disrepair . And the one he spoke about I go by almost every day because I live in Tripp Park, the railroad bridge on Main Avenue. I brought this to up to Council years ago. The beams are so old they are rusted. There is actually holes rusted through the beams. I brought this up years ago that to me that doesn't seem safe. You got these bridges that the trains go over and these trains weigh tons and thousands of tons or whatever and there is holes in the beams and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 nothing was done then so we'll see if anything is done now. MR. MCANDREW : I'll report out in Fifth Order on that. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. That's all I have. Have a good vacation . Like as the old song goes, see you in September . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . All right. I didn't think I would get here today so I'm not really too prepared so bear with me. But one of the things I wanted to -- first, before I forget is to wish you all a wonderful vacation . Now second, Nay Aug Park there's movies going on up there now for the kids. And most people weren't aware of it, even the direct neighbor s and everything . When I talked to Bob about it today it's on the board -- the flashing sign up there. But he said that was actually the city's project . So I think maybe the city needs to advertise it more and get a schedule out there or which movies and what time and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 when they're going to be. Okay, the cards I gave you were from a man that I had met at an event that I was at with Mom's Demand Action. It was like a health fair last week. And he was doing the CPR and the NARCAN and the defibrillator demonstrations . And I was over there learning from him. And we got to talking and he lives in West Scranton , I believe . And he has -- he's a pool and park consultant and he does lifeguard -- he's a certificate d lifeguard trainer . So and he's a Scranton resident . So I asked him for his cards to give to you, okay. Now, I couldn't make last week's meeting but I did watch it on television . And I want to address some of the things but one of the things I wanted to address , Norma addressed anyway. So I'm just going to put a little bit of a spin on them. First of all, the bathroom situation with the neutral gender bathroom I almost find it funny. But it's -- the bathroom out here it's just a singular bathroom with no urinal or anything and the door locks, so I don't know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 what Mr. Bolus was talking about at all about people waiting outside your stall there. So that's number one. I was just so mad when I was watching it on TV. First of all, again, like Dr. Rothchild , doctor, I mean, Mr. Bolus is -- I'm sorry, I hope he's watching . I'm hoping he's hearing me. He's not only a bigot but he's an ill-informed person. Anybody with a doctorate is a doctor. A physician 's assistant can't do prescription -- or can do prescription s, I'm sorry. A physicians 's assistan t can write prescription s and she's not a doctor. I mean, I don't know why he does this every single time he comes. But it just makes me furious . There's doctors of philosophy . There's doctors of religion . There's doctors of physical therapy . And there's doctors that are MDs and ODs. So it has no bearing at City Council to begin with. Nobody's job has a bearing at City Council except the job at City Council . So that's number one. The other thing I want to address to him is when he said how he was a Catholic and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the University of Scranton was not following the Catholic doctrine so they should be paying taxes because they -- they have programs for the LGBTQ, well, thank you University of Scranton for keeping your education educational . And thank you for keeping politics and religious separate because that is who our country was founded on separation of church and state and thank you for standing behind our LGBTQ. I just want to say to Mr. Bolus if you're watching , be careful who you hate because it may turn out to be somebody you love. And thank you and have a wonderful vacation and thank you for bearing with me all of these -- whole season. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Doris. Okay. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, hello Council . You know, we need more Norma Jeffries . She's always so informative . Like, I didn't know about Miss Rothchild . Congratulations . That is a wonderful achievement . Is it -- I certainly advocate education . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 I found a number if anybody is interested about the eagle if you want to complain or congratulate or anything . The conservation people have a toll free number and you could talk for one minute. If anyone would like to write it down it's 703-358-1980. I phoned in. I didn't use any bad language or nothing . But I phoned in what I thought about the whole situation that -- that happened . Last week there was some conversation about the refuse trucks coming and going to the landfill and how long it took. One reason they get overloaded is unscrupulous management of properties dump all of this furniture and bedding and housecleaning on the street for them to pick up. These gentlemen shouldn 't have to be liable for all of this instead of the owners of the property renting a dumpster . This week across from me a block up is a ton of stuff sitting on the street. They didn't pick it up today. And around the corner just like on city block from them somebody dumped a load of old couches and stuff that been outside someplace for years. It's just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 trash. I don't know what to do about it. But it's -- one thing, the owners of the property just have to clean it up, not the city and the taxpayers . This seems to be a practice , especially around the college . I know almost everybody has gone to the hospital or someplace and seen when the students leave it's bad around there. There is just furniture and junk all over the place. And these property owners should have to do it, not the taxpayers . But that leaves a question , who do you phone when you have a problem ? We don't have any code office. We don't have any traffic office. Across the street from my house is a big empty lot when they tore down a house last year or the year before. The weeds are taller than I am. It's a city property . The code officer I don't guess he ever comes down Main Avenue, Mr. Sunday, except he manages to see a case of water on my porch. But he doesn't see a -- I'm talking about a load up the street from me he doesn't see all of these abandon ed cars around my house 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 that they say they addressed . He hasn't done nothing about a swimming pool. And there's a lot of little children in my neighborhood . There's nothing around the pool on (inaudible ) street. There's a junk car on the street five years, five years and it's still sitting there. This is your Mr. Oleski. And traffic , they need some stop signs along North Main to impede the speeding cars. A man was slaughtered in front of my house. What more proof do you need than that? I hope you all have a nice vacation . My finances are where I'm not going no place though I was invited to Paris and Rome my ex -- boys I used to play golf with. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Quickly , would you please give the address to Mr. Voldenberg ? I know you brought this up once before. But there's pool without a fence around it, right, near you? There's a swimming pool with no fence in the yard around it? MR. ELLMAN: I just can't hear you. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry. So you mentioned this morn than once. You said that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 near you near where you live there's a swimming pool with no fence around the yard. MR. ELLMAN: Oh, yeah. MR. MCANDREW : So can you please -- MR. ELLMAN: I just seen it. It's still there. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me. Excuse me. Thank you. I could take care of myself. I'm just asking for the address of the home that doesn't have the fence. Can you get that to Miss Carrera or call when you get it? Thank you. Dakota Cartier . Could you please state your name and where you live? MR. CARTIER : All right. My name is Dakota Cartier . And I live in Lackawanna County. MR. MCANDREW : No, are you a city resident ? MR. CARTIER : Yeah, I'm a city resident , Scranton . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. MR. CARTIER : So I came up here today I just found out that this meeting was going on. But the Lord said that there's nothing wrong with a wise Council . So I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 wanted to skate a couple things and ask some question s on behalf of the homeless portion of the population out here. So there has been the past couple weeks some running s of officers coming and kicking people off private property which is private property I get that. But there have been statements from these officers talking about that there is going to be people that are along the river that live in tents and stuff, they are going to be pretty soon be asked to leave and they're going to be given two days to go with -- and if they don't listen, like, they are just going to rip their stuff up and throw it in dumpsters . And my problem with that is that I understand that it's part of the water department 's property , and up there is the railroad tracks and then you have the heritage trail and everything . But for the most part, there is not much public property that these people could really go to that they could actually reside at. And the places out here like that offer help like CIC and the shelter and like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Friends of the Poor and everything , it's just very, very hard when you have only room for 20 people that are men and six females and in the midst of that you only get 30 days. If you are a resident and then you can't stay there for 90 days. And then, you know, these program s that they offer you have to be homeless for a year and like this and that and the other third and you don't get in sometimes for two years. And, you know, they're saying they're offering all of this stuff but there is such an elongated time for helping these people and there is, like, no housing and considering the way that inflation is happened, there is all of this -- them losing people with housing because there is not funding and everything . And I understand these things are happening. But my biggest question and concern is, what do these people do in the midst of this where they honestly really don't have anywhere to go except down by the river and there is of -- space that provides some nature and shelter for people. I just was really wondering because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 it's a very big concern and to put them in places like Lackawanna County which is over full to start with, you know, there is not program -- programs in there, like, once you are homeless -- and I personally know once you are homeless in the system over there, like, you go get lost in translation until way down the road they find a spot open somewhere for you. And that is also an overflow with rehabs and everything is there is a lot of overflow with all of that right now and there is a problem going on with people needing new places. So I was just wondering if there is any type of counsel I can get from you guys of anyway to go about this or if there is any other -- other ways that you guys could help? MR. SCHUSTER : So you listed the CIC and the shelter and the Friends of the Poor. Are these agencies helping to gain employment , to again apartments , anything like that? MR. CARTIER : Well, we have CIC. There is places that are like the mission and UNC and Friends of the Poor and also there is places that they could go to like Outreach and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Career Link and stuff. But even doing that it's very, very, very complicated and I personally know to get employment , maintain yourself to be hygenicatively correct and everything to go in and continue our employment and to also get residency here is kind of hard right now. And, you know, there's a lot of help that is needed and there's not a lot of help out there for people. MR. SCHUSTER : So are these groups and are these services helping to point you in that direction to gain employment , to gain shelter ? MR. CARTIER : No, see, I have employment . And I was in jail for like 11 months and then they finally got me into a program that only houses about 16 resident s. And like, you know, but, you know, then the turnover rate on that is on the person when they are able to get out and everything and move on from there. But the point is, is these places, these organizations are supposed to be helping in ways and that's the reason why some homeless 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 people can be treated the way they are being treated . But also at the same time too, the current fact is that there are a lot of times when people have money to go and do stuff and start paying their first month and stuff. And as for security there's a lot of oh, we don't have help with security right now or anything like that. And there is a lot of -- there's a lot of help that's not being done. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you for your sharing your story and helping us so we're aware of this, but your time is up. Thank you again. We've exhausted the sign-in sheet. Would anybody else like to speak? One of you can, yeah. MR. MARQUIS : So my name is -- I got to back up a little. My name is Ed Marquis {phonetic }. I'm a local musician as well as a community activist . I've worked with all different kinds of organizations . I've worked with the NAACP. I've attended many different City Council meeting s all over Luzerne County to, you know, discuss issues within a community within a county. I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 this is Lackawanna County. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, are you a resident of Scranton though? MR. MARQUIS : Yes, I am. I'm getting to that. I'm getting to that, sir. I'm getting to that, sir. So what I'm speaking on as far as Lackawanna County, I came here to back up my buddy Dakota because what he's saying is true. The police officers on the streets , they treat us like we're nothing , do you understand ? They're very disrespectful . That is what I want to say. They're very disrespectful . They don't want to hear us out. When they look at us, they judge us. But this is what I want to do. I want to bring someone -- am I too loud? Can I back up a little bit because I feel like my voice is like loud. MR. MCANDREW : Normally it's an issue but today it isn't with acoustics . MR. MARQUIS : Right. Right. You know what I'm saying? So I'm here just to bring some solutions ; do you understand ? Where it starts is with the police officers and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 everybody judging us. That starts with us having problems , you know, like addiction problem s and stuff like that. That's part of the main reason and Dakota could probably vouch for this, that's part of the main reason why they are kicking us out of the pavilion . If we had a rehabilitation center in this city, not travelling an hour away, not travelling two hours away. Do you understand ? If we have rehabilitation in this city, that would help these homeless people get clean. That's part of the solution . Two, we need more space in the shelter . Do you understand what I'm saying? There's not enough space in that shelter . You got like 10, 15 men all sleeping on top of each other. So that's on problem in itself too. But this problem is outside of Lackawanna County. This problem is, you know, it's part of the problem in the country . It's a part of the problem in the country because people are moving from ghetto areas like, New York, New Jersey, Philly. And they are coming into cities like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 this trying to escape poverty . But then when we come here, we walk right back into it. Do you want to know why? Because they keep trying to tell us that we ain't got enough resources . We ain't got this. We ain't got that. Well, listen to the people because the people are the ones who have the solution s to bring more resources . Do you understand ? And don't judge a book by its cover because the messenger -- it says this in the Bible. The messenger , God can use anybody . God can use a homeless man off the streets. I'm homeless right now. Do you understand ? But I have a lot of influence . So another thing I want to say is I have been all over -- and I'm not making this about myself. But just to let you guys know that I'm serious about my work, I've been all over the news stations . I've been all over the newspapers . So I'm very well known within the Luzerne County. Do you understand , because I voice my opinion very well. Now I can help get some resources out here. But I need you guys to work with me as a City Council to make it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 happen for these people because what's going to happen is, if you guys don't listen to the homeless people, it's not just going to be three homeless people in this crowd. It's going to be like dozens of us coming up here to City Council . And a lot of them are angry and upset, you want to know why? Because the police officer s have no respect for them. And they fed up. I'm telling you. So I'm just here to spread light on that and bring some solution s. If you guys ever want to contact me and we work together , we could talk after the City Council ; but that's all I got to say. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Would anyone else like to speak? ELAINE: Elaine (inaudible ) and I'm a Scranton resident . In 2019, both the City of Scranton and Lackawanna County McDade Park closed their pools. Two weeks ago, McDade Park opened their new splash pad. I was to see it. It's very impressive . It's more of the type that is at Montage Mountain . It has a lot of different things that dump water. And in a couple weeks they're going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 to open their pool. City of Scranton wants to do another study when they've done one just a year ago, and they have done nothing to replace their pool. And I want to know why the city is not using the ARPA, the plan funding for a pool at Nay Aug? I saw in the paper today that they are using some of that funding to resurface playgrounds, playgrounds in the city. So maybe Mr. Smurl can answer. Why is it not using the ARPA funding for the Nay Aug pool? MR. SMURL: You're asking me why they are not using ARPA money for the pool? Well, what we were told in the beginning was low income areas, they consider Nay Aug Park a high income area. So it wasn't suppose d to be spent into that. But the pool is being funded in different ways. So the pool is happening . It's just not using ARPA money. Although we do have access to ARPA money we can -- Council as a group can take 7 million dollars if we want and put it right into Nay Aug Pool tomorrow . But why would we do that when we have funding available to us to do -- to take a different path and use that money for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 something else? ELAINE: I believe that Nay Aug may be considered a high income when the city -- the entire city is like 23 or something like that percentage poverty . MR. MCANDREW : Elaine, I'll answer your question . So we were initially told by administration that ARPA funds cannot be used on lost revenue track to fund the pool. We were told that. But then when ARPA came -- Anser came in, the group that handles , I asked that question could we have used and they told me yes. So we could have used it. We were told we couldn't. That's the simple answer to your question . ELAINE: So why are you not using it? Is all the 63 million gone? I only seen a few listed in the project s they were describe d as being funded and so forth. MR. MCANDREW : No, that's -- not all the money is gone, no. To simply answer your question , we could have used it. We were told we couldn't. MR. SCHUSTER : I think to speak -- I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 think to bridge the gap between Mr. McAndrew and Mr. Smurl is funds have been earmarked for certain projects . They had to be earmarked by a certain deadline . But there was a little bit of confusion in the beginning like Mr. McAndrew said. But also like Mr. Smurl said, there is a possibility for us to use that, so it's still something that is still on the table. ELAINE: To follow up with the last two speakers I have been doing some research what the ARPA funding can be used for and one of the things was for affordable housing . And if you have been following the -- any of the housing listings for about the past two, three years, the prices of property have gone up about 50 percent in the city. And now that the city is finally doing their tax reassessment , I'm concern ed that more people are -- especiall y older people are going to get pushed out of their property . And the city has, like, no, really, like, low income. It has, like, you know, like, public housing . But the city, you know, as opposed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 to other cities have say condos, you know, it's kind of a step between apartment s and a house. And they're generally more affordable than houses are in this city. This has really no -- there's a few I guess like two places in the entire city that has condos. And you see a lot of developers now that are putting what they call luxury apartments , remaking like buildings downtown or the Parodi building . They call it luxury apartments . Really it's just a regular apartment . They are granite counter top and call it luxury apartments . But they are very expensive apartments and the city has no -- MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Elaine. But I'm sorry your time is. ELAINE: Well, I just want to know if that is being address ed in any ways, any of the funding being considered for affordable housing . Is that even an issue that this city has considered ? DR. ROTHCHILD : There are various housing programs through the Office of Economic and Community Development . And then we also partner ed with NeighborWorks . So there is some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 program s through them too. There is first buyer home program s. There is program s out there for older adults looking to rehab their houses. So there are various programs . But we do need to do a better job of creating more affordable housing in the city because it is definitely a problem . ELAINE: And especially with the way that the prices have gone up. Thank you very much. MR. SCHUSTER : I think another thing would be to upkeep some of the homes, rental properties that are already out there. ELAINE: I wanted ask you what the city plans to do anything about the seniors that are going to have their price -- property taxes shoot up. The city has claimed when they finally approved the -- I'm not sure if it's actually the city or county that approved it, but to do the tax reassessments that they said they're going to have programs to help seniors stay in their homes but I have not heard anything -- any programs being developed . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Well, as we near our little month long break here I wanted to take a look back and I'm slightly concerned when I take a look at things like 8-B, the overtime reporting how good things gets moved forward and then it goes into the back room where there is an executive session and a discussion between the administration and this body and then it sits there and it dies because someone in a decision making meeting that wasn't open to the public decided that for whatever reason it's not to move forward . I don't understand that. Usually when there's a meeting that's for decisions , it's suppose d to be public. It's not suppose d to be secret and hidden. We're suppose d to hear it and understand how it impacts the city. I don't know why overtime is such a big thing that we need to hide and not document overtime like that's a good thing. Now moving onto 6-A, the legislation on burning . I've looked at it. I've reviewed it. Beforehand we had Dr. Rothchild step forward when this came forward and said she understands why this shouldn 't be because protests are organic in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 nature. They happen. They don't have two days advance d notice. Mr. McAndrew stepped forward and said he remembers a time in the 60s when burning bras were part of the national protest for women's rights. Back when our country was first set out, the British flag was burned as part of our independence and the birth of our country . You may not like burning flags or burning objects in protest . But there's a long history of them being allowed . But there is also conflict with restrictions on how that can be done and restrictions on First Amendment rights of having to step up beforehand and be allowed by a government to have your -- the First Amendment rights. I also called forth about a month ago there was a mention of this in executive session 3202 -- 2022 CV 01172 was brought up on record. There was an executive session because of a legal issue with burning or the burn ordinance . Well, burn ordinance I went over to the Globe Store, the old Globe Store and checked in civil and I could not find it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Now, the reason I couldn't find it because it wasn't to deal with the burn ordinance . It was in federal court to deal with the flag burning that happened in front of the courthouse . For some reason this has been hidden and put away. And it seems that the Law Department is putting forth laws rather than City Council . The executive session is usually done because there is something in process . Well, the case that wasn't mention ed was withdrawn on 3/16 of 2003 by the parties . This is not a court settlement . This is an agreement behind doors here at City Hall. I don't know the full scope of it or the pressure on it, but this after being voted down not only has it come back up; but for some reason tonight here it's even fast track to keep people from looking at it. There is absolutely no reason to fast track it other than it doesn't want to be under observation . I went down to the federal court and I pulled the documentation from the courthouse -- from the federal building . I understand this gentleman has done this in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 number of different communities with burning Trump flags or other protests . It has updated the laws. Has this body had a chance to intervene in the laws to look at what was -- has our City Council 's legal staff, did he have interactions in this to design this law that comes before the body? It smells of a back room deal and I'm not really sure that executive session for a case that was already withdrawn was even proper. Something is wrong with this right from ground zero. And when it goes through tonight it's going to be an unfortunate thing. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . 70 million dollars , imagine what we could do in each individual neighborhood by developing neighbor impact teams where every neighborhood is represent ed as to the needs of the specific neighborhood , 70 million dollars . Imagine the difference that we could make with 70 million dollars if it was spent properly , imagine , 70 million dollars . Imagine if we had representatives from the fire, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 police, code enforcement departments come into each neighborhood and make educated decisions with each neighborhood deciding what desperately needs to be done to improve the neighborhood and maintain our property value, imagine . Imagine what can be done. Imagine if rather than one person making decisions on how to spend money it was the city as a whole working together . Imagine if we put the money to good use. Look at the city of Pittston . Every single dime that they acquire is invested into their city and the city shows. There are no two page mayor spreads in their local newspaper . Their mayor needs no publicity. His work speaks for itself. Imagine what would happen in Scranton if Scranton did that, 70 million dollars . Imagine what we could do. Look at Mr. John Basalyga what he's doing with his own money. Every property that he touches enhances the neighborhood and enhances the city. Imagine where would he direct revitalization , 70 million dollars . What if we did that in every neighborhood with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 this 70 million dollars ? Imagine if every citizen in Scranton had the ability to state what was wrong in their neighborhood and ways they thought we would change and make improvements in their individual neighborhoods where they pay taxes, the investors in the city, imagine . Imagine if politics did not come into play. Imagine what a difference we could make in Scranton from someone who was actually born and raised here and actually cares about the city. Where as in the future imagine what we can do with that 70 million dollars , just imagine . Imagine if 1 million dollars if it wasn't spent to tell us how to run the DPW, imagine . Imagine if people actually did their jobs and were competent people and we hired competent people to head of each department . Imagine that 70 million dollars was put to good use as opposed to being squandered away by that one person. Imagine not worrying about which flag to fly or what to do with bathroom s and who to use them. Imagine if you made decisions and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 you fought to change things that would be there for a lifetime . Instead in Scranton we have three Council people that are single-handedly destroying this city. You're a different branch of government . You're doing someone else's agenda. For example , the parking garage for Geisinger , imagine if you three made hard decisions to not follow someone else's agenda and you actually made the tough decision s for the generations to come in the City of Scranton , imagine that. How are we making out with the porta lavs down at Weston Field? Do we have porta sinks yet? And are any of those bathrooms porta lavs? Are they neutral gender? How about the bridge report? Do we have a bridge report yet? MR. MCANDREW : I'll speak to that in Fifth Order. MR. ARGENTA : Appreciate that. Do we have porta lavs for the porta -- the porta sinks for the porta lavs at Weston? And whatever happened to shower before you enter the pool and shower after you leave the pool? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Can we do that at Weston Field? I'll give you this real quick. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. ARGENTA : This happens to be the park at the North Scranton Little League that after today's article it would have you think that it was the Taj Mahal and the jewel of the city. There has been no work done in that park for the last two months. And the permit says $27,400. The article in the paper says it was $40,000. Thank you for your time. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Would anyone else like to speak? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , East Mountain of Scranton . A couple of things to think about over the month off. The Serrenti place, we don't have any feedback on what's really happening there and I think we should. Now I know, Mr. McAndrew , you were up there in January when they were getting what was it a -- immersive simulation system. MR. MCANDREW : I was not. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. The paper said you were. It's was on Milo -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 multiple interactive learning objective. But anyway, that was to come in. And it said the training system would be available for other police agencies in the region as well. And that was by the police chief. And earlier the Mayor has said what was in -- in support of the Serrenti that it would be open for the area and a lot of activity there was going to be seen and there would be some revenue . Now, have we had any revenue come in for what's done at Serrenti ? MR. SCHUSTER : That I don't know of, there is -- three weeks ago I asked for an update on the Serrenti Center. I know in the capital budget there is either 250,000 or $350,000 that should be spent there or allocated to be spent there in the 2023 year. So if we could ask someone to come in. It's been quite some time since we got an update on that. The last time someone was here in person I feel like Eileen Cipriani let us know that some of the grant funding had stalled. And that's my recollection . So it's about time that we do hear an update on the Serrenti Center.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MS. SCHUMACHER : I think it should be on a regular basis. We shouldn 't have to request from this the podium. Okay, and then stormwater , are we just kicking that can down -- downstream again or do we have a goal for when we are going to actually do something about stormwater or wait for an authority to be made with other communities ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, we had an update. I think you were here. We're waiting for the other municipalities to either get on board or not before we move forward . MS. SCHUMACHER : Is there a deadline for that? MR. MCANDREW : I'm not aware of a deadline . We'll get you the deadline . We'll try to find that for you. Mr. Voldenberg , check on that, will you please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And I thought too on 3-E, what kind of action is going to be taken by what's on the overtime ? And who's in charge of doing that? Is it the administration ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. SCHUSTER : If it's the overtime that I spoke of it would be the refuse coordinator who would be in charge of that overtime . That's the meeting that we've been looking forward to to get an update on how that's going. As you could see, those overtime costs monthly are going up. So there is definitely some changes that have occurred there. And I'm very curious to hear what's going on. MS. SCHUMACHER : So are a lot of taxpayers , yes. And the Harrison Avenue bridge area, I believe it's another government agency that has that from the time when you are going east on there between the first building and the bridge, it's very frequently over -- well over the 6 inches of being cut. And whose responsibility is that and why is that allowed and then, you know, Joe Schmo and their home gets a ticket for having lawn over 6 inches. DR. ROTHCHILD : That's PennDOT 's responsibility and I brought that forward to them numerous times. It's supposed to be on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 their regular maintenance list. However , we usually have to put forward a complaint before it will get cleared out and then it takes some time for them to do that. So I did notice as well that it's creeping up again. So we will reach out to them again to get out there to clear it. MS. SCHUMACHER : And what about that building , the first building when you're going to the east -- oh, I'm sorry I'm out of time. DR. ROTHCHILD : That first building I know what you are talking about. There was a condemnation of one of the apartments in that building , not the entire building . But I think that since has been rectified or reversed because the signage is no longer posted. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. I'd just like to say, I think enforce ment, we've got to start doing enforcement on the codes. That wall down in front of the Radison which looked like it was going to fall into the street of course did because nothing was done about it. And now we've lost part of a lane down there on one of the main streets . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Enforcement has to be given more -- just time. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , Scranton . Last week I saw a little light coming from up there. Mr. Smurl, I did appreciate the fact that you pointed out that homeless people are people. And we have a lot of problems in our country . Our jobs were handed out years ago. And most of the politicians address it but not everybody can be a rocket scientist or an aviation engineer or whatever . So that being said, I was a union steward over 250 people. And when I see somebody I -- that's homeless , I start thinking , gee, you know, that looks a lot like somebody whose job was just handed out years ago with an excuse like you could go to school or do something -- pays the bills while you go to school. We really need to pay more attention to fellow Americans and bring them up. Dr. Rothchild , I sympathize with you with a lot of the gut you take. I don't see -- I would have my head examined if I started getting obsessed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 with how to go to the bathroom . I mean, that's possibly a sign of onset dementia . And anyway, minimum wage, you're never going to get $15 an hour minimum wage in the near future. And but I know people -- I see people walking to work at stores that I shop with up in South Side. And the one person I talk to she's 42 years old. She's a widow. They gave her a whole quarter so she makes 7.50 an hour now. Things are really looking up. You know, it's amazing . The reason these people are walking to work is because they are 23 years old and might have to borrow mom and dad's car to just get there and mom and dad might need their car. They are still living at home. They can't get their life started , can't get married , can't afford housing . And it's just one big problem . Anyway, a railroad out in Bradford County there is LPG plant compressing gas to liquid petroleum gas. Its permit has been renewed . In about three years you might have 100 cars, each one -- each 12 cars is the same explosive force as the Hiroshima bomb. And we also have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 smaller cars shipped past the U to Tobyhanna . I seen them up there on one of my rail excursions . And to get down to the new downtown , I don't see it as a working situation . It's just -- I have read and reread the articles in the paper. And I might attend a meeting , but it would be just to critique it. I think we should have more stop signs and stop lights like we have up in -- last week I went to Jefferson Avenue via Linden Street. And I sat there for a little while at a red light and then the walk sign came on. And it's no left turn or no turn on red. It's a right turn that you could make, sorry about that. But people need more time to get across the street. There's three people that I know of lost their lives at Wyoming and Lackawanna . And they all may have been buses that hit them. And if you really think of driving a bus with all those doors in the way and the A-pillar in the way and the visibility , you're up off the road so you won't see some little short person trying to sneak across there. So hopefully we'll abandon that plan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 and thank you and have a good night and a nice little vacation . MR. MCANDREW : Thanks, Dave. Okay. Anybody else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5 A. MOTIONS . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Just one comment . This weekend we had a crew downtown . We were cleaning the downtown up. And, Mr. Voldenberg , I forgot to forward this to you. On the Courthouse Square they put all their garbage out. I believe the people told me they put it out on Friday but it's not picked up on Monday. Will you inquire and see it that's true? And if they can maybe put it out on Monday because it winds up all over the courthouse . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I do have a few. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 have two addresses if I could give you, Frank, to send over to code enforce ment. It's the rear 835 Beech Street is one. And the other one is 539-541 North Garfield . And I could send you some more details on those later on tonight . MR. VOLDENBERG : Thanks. MR. SCHUSTER : I plan on speaking to this one in Seventh Order. However , today at 3:47 I got a response to my request from last week. So we do have a study on the agenda tonight in Seventh Order for final passage . It's give or take $70,000 study. This was taken from some money that was dedicated towards mental health originally . I would like to have seen that money going into the mental health area as it was originally allocated for. But what I found out through the backup information was that this company had done a similar study the previous year. In August of '22 this study was presented to the city. And I made a request if I could see this study. It took some time to get back to me. The administration actually spoke to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 newspaper several times rather than respond ing to my request . But I did get an answer today at 3:47 and it stated that in the best interest of public safety the Muflehun report is available for viewing at City Hall by a member of City Council upon request . Please call the City Law Department to arrange for a review of same during the same business hours and it gave a phone number for me to call to review the document . I would like to make a motion tonight that the City Law Department release a copy of the Muflehun initial assessment report from August of '22. If I could get a second on that? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : So this would be a motion for the Law Department to release a copy of this report to City Council . MR. MCANDREW : All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. Opposed ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. KING: No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : 2-2 motion passes. Oh, no, three. MR. SCHUSTER : 3-2, passes. MR. MCANDREW : Just hoping I guess. All right anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : So I also had a request in. There was a group Bread Basket of NEPA that received according to the Controller 's report they receive d a piece of money that was allocated to community centers . So to start, there's several community centers located in and around Scranton -- well, in Scranton . These centers are city properties that are run by volunteer groups and neighborhood associations . These groups in turn maintain that city property . So the work that they do on these properties is work that city employees don't have to do and it's a service for the city. So I commend anyone that is part of a neighborhood association or anyone that helps to maintain a community center in the city. Last week when inquiring about this allocation , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 a nonprofit received money from the community center line item in the 2023 budget. So this funding was intended to assist community centers with building repairs and other needs that they had. Although this group does provide a service , I do think it's a mistake that we've been redirecting this money. OECD has redirected this money away from community centers and possibly their operating expenditures . So last week I did ask for a request of the justification for this. I just received the MOU with the group. So, Frank, could we send out another request for justification of why a nonprofit was given money from the community center line item? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. That is all. MR. MCANDREW : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few. Once again this week we've been receiving complaints about the garbage pickup being off or people not receiving the pickup. And last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 week I inquired about it. I've been told that they were aware of the issue and fixing it. But it doesn't seem to be fixed just yet. So I still have concerns and so there is the thought that this might have to do with the Rubicon implementation . And I understand with the implementation of new program s that there can be some growing pains associated with that and errors and things that need to be corrected . But it's like the same streets that are still not being picked up. And that's what I'm not understanding why it's not corrected yet. So we received another e-mail about 1700, 1800, 1900 blocks of Clearview Street. And then I know Councilman Smurl also mentioned some others that was not picked up and then there were other places today that I saw that haven't been picked up yet like driving along Moosic Street. So just would like to get a better update of what is happening with the garbage pickup and, you know, why streets are being missed still and if that's going to become timely again because we're not back until 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 September . Suppose dly Rubicon is going to be coming in at that point. But I would like to not wait until then for this to be resolved . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll inquire , Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I had also received a complaint from 733 Brook Street. And it was someone had receive d a violation letter of something on their property . And they had some questions about the letter and the complaint and they contacted a couple different people in code enforce ment. They still have not receive d a response . So I'm going to forward that e-mail because I would like to get them a response so they could -- so it could be clarified on the issue. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll clarify that. DR. ROTHCHILD : They also did mention that when they went to the website to the appeals page that the link was broken for it and not working . So if we could have IT work on repairing that link so people could properly access the appeals . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And Councilman Smurl and I both met with Chief Carroll earlier . And we had a good conversation , a good starting point to address the issue of the homeless population within the City of Scranton . And, you know, I certainly do feel for the people who are homeless and we're not unique in this problem in our city. It's a problem throughout the country . And I don't know that anyone has, you know, figured out the best way to solve it. But it doesn't mean that we can't do anything either. I, you know, do certainly agree that the police should be respectful of people when in the community and the homeless community Chief Carroll did assure us that they are being respectful in handling it in the best possible way that they are not targeting people but they are just working to address when crimes or complaint s are brought to them. And it -- drug prevention and trespassing , you know, people are on private property . So those issues they are working to address and not, you know, they're not going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 just kick people out of their tents or take away their things. So that was what we were informed of earlier . And so I hope that, you know, is what continues to happen moving forward . And I know that the -- we are pretty limited in the shelter s and some of the resources that we have. So I do agree that we need more shelters and we need more opportunities to help get people out of being homeless and interested in seeing what way we could help as a city to do that. I don't have a clear answer on that tonight or the best solution for it. But it is certainly a priority of mine. And I really appreciate the people who came here tonight to voice their concerns . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Well, Mr. King is on the phone. Mr. King, I mean, I'm going to be reading his responses that he normally does in Fifth Order because it's just going to be a lot easier. But in addition to that, Mr. King, do you have any comment s that you would like to say or motions ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. KING: No, nothing at this time. I appreciate you making the comments for me. MR. MCANDREW : No problem . No problem , Billy. All right. So these are answers to question s that were posed last week or the week before. So for Joan Hodowanitz regarding the $1,500 professional services expenditure for the Law Department , Deputy Solicitor Andrew Cutillo was reimburse d for membership in the Public Rights Project Affirmative Leaders Fellowship 2023. This is an approved expense per the City Controller . Then Council meeting on July 18th Mr. Leonard Srebro of North Dewey Avenue visited Council Chambers again and voiced his concerns related to the flooding to his neighboring properties during heavy rains. He advised that the flooding is now worse due to additional runoff. He had great praise for Steve Teaman and his crew with DPW that visited the property that cleared the drainage . He emphasized that this is quick and thorough action by Steve and team was the first time in over 10 years that the city had worked, opened the pipe completely . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 So it hasn't been 10 years because we got a response that DPW has done a lot of work with this section . The DPW employee has met with the resident and has pictures and a map of the potential issue. DPW has plans to camera the lines this weekend 7/28 to pinpoint the elbow that was installed without engineering approval . Once DPW can locate the position of the issue, DPW can recommend a permanent fix. DPW and engineering will lead to determine whose property the elbow is located on and inquire the proper permits and engineering for the fix. So that's an answer to that one. Mrs. Schumacher , she had concerns about the City Hall front steps repair project . So this project is slated to go out to bid before July ends so to answer your question . The concrete barrier at Biden Street interchange, following up with PennDOT for a date when the concrete barrier at Jefferson Avenue and Biden Street will be updated. The interchange is presently one lane due to the mural update project taking place this week. Meadow Brook flood project , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 so Council asked for a resident 's request for an update on the RFP for legal appraisal services related to securing the property of 44 right of away agreement s. So the answer we received the proposals from prospective vendors have been submitted . No contract has been awarded yet. Mr. Virgil Argenta on the Theodore Street Railway Bridge, Reilly Associates , the City Engineer , advised the PennDOT District Bridge Engineer has advised that they are working with Norfolk Southern Regional Railway Bridge Supervisor and they completed a bridge condition assessment and an action plan for the span. So we're waiting to hear on that. May the public schedule a tour of the Public Safety Building at Serrenti Center? Council is awaiting an answer and specifics from the Fire Chief. Somebody asked about trash pickup at the St. Ann's Novena. DPW confirm ed that there is no trash pickup by the department for St. Ann's Street Novena. So, in fact, they have a private hauler. The DPW is not picking up the garbage . So someone asked about that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 Scranton Police Department Staffing , Council President Bill King asked if the SPD may confirm that adequate staffing levels are evident of the police force. Has SPD been short staffed at any time in the recent past? The question was posed by a city resident . The response is, the City of Scranton Police Department has had and continues to have adequate shift staffing . Weston Field Bathhouse , Council has asked if OECD Department advise status on the repair, renovation , repair project proposed for Weston Field Bathhouse recently inspected for the deterioration realized at the building . Parks and Rec have referred all questions to OECD. So the response we got is a comprehensive Weston Field strategy is being developed . Code Enforcement Inspections and Revenue , OpenGov Report for Code Enforcement is in Third Order on this evening 's meeting Agenda. Listing of City Vehicles , the city resident Mr. Virgil Argenta asked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 Council for a listing of all city owned vehicles . As previously shared, please have Mr. Argenta -- this is the response we got. Have Mr. Argenta complete a Right to Know request for this information . Well, we talked about this earlier , Mr. Voldenberg . Even though Mr. Argenta asked for it -- and I get that that a resident has to do a Right to Know. But in turn, President King asked for the list. MR. VOLDENBERG : So that's correct . MR. MCANDREW : So he doesn't need a Right to Know. So can you remind the legal department that that request came from the President ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll revisit it tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Any additional questions posed by Mr. Argenta are pending a response from the City Administration . John Thomas, the former Plotkin Building , the Plotkin building on Penn Avenue and Linden Street was sold to DFM, Incorporated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 in 2022 for $425,000. No plans are in process at present . However , Mr. Don Mammano of DFM Properties advised he would like to develop a mixed use of shops and apartments for the property . So that's an answer to that question . Code Enforcement Electric Vehicle Fleet, Councilman Tom Schuster asked the following questions : Has any maintenance been necessary to the electric vehicles to date? How long does an average battery charge last on the vehicles based on their performance to date? Our response from administration was, the electric vehicles have not required maintenance . Charges last approximately two weeks or 200-250 miles. Last week this was my request , Councilman Mark McAndrew asked per resident 's requests that the administration please advise an update from OECD and City Engineer on the rehabilitation of Oakmont Park as it relates to the recently approved contract . Mr. McAndrew stated the neighbors to the park were advised that the work would start 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 in Summer. Please be advised -- the answer we got -- that the playground equipment is ordered for Oakmont and an engineer is completing project design. The project was tentatively scheduled for fall installation pending equipment delivery . General contractor 's contract has not been awarded for this park. And Weston -- 1310 N Washington Avenue rescind permit parking on the block. A petition to rescind permit parking in the 1300 Block of North Washington Avenue was mailed. The petitioner will visit all households on the block for signatures . The subsequent study will be handled the Scranton Police Department Traffic Division . 6-B, Intergovernmental Agreement of Cooperation with the city and the Scranton School District , Councilman Mark McAndrew had additional questions on this legislation asking into which entity's pension plan the employee will be enrolled in. So the employee will be enrolled in the City's pension plan instead of the District 's. All right. So this is also speaking to Mr. Schuster . So the Muflehun initial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 assessment report of 2022, August of 2022 that you requested over a week ago, right, you know, your e-mail is from July 18th actually so -- so the response that we got from -- Councilman asked to see this, wants us to vote on another study but won't show us a study from last year. This is absurd, absurd. So what you have to do is in the best interest of public safety, the Muflehun report is available for viewing at City Hall by a member of City Council upon request . Please call the City Law Department , blah, blah, blah, blah. So we got this while everybody was on the way to the meeting with nobody in the building to view it before we take a final vote. That sounds like it's intentional to me, sorry. All right. Rubicon , Council President Bill King and Council respectfully ask that administration please include Council on the response to Controller Murray's queries related to the contract with Rubicon . E-mail is attached to assist. The administration has received this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 request and will respond in the near future. So another waiting game there. So all I have to report out is -- and it's some good news and bad news for the people at Weston Field that swim there. It's unfortunate so -- when we were -- when the new parks director was introduced as a hire or to be voted on for us, you know, they wanted a waiver for him we said no or I did -- no, I think we all did that because he promised to move in the city, whatever . But between the first vote and the second final vote I asked the question because this was concern for the lovely ladies that swim and don't get consistent hours there because of the lack of lifeguards . So I posed a question to the new parks director . And it's in an e-mail. I have it here. And the question was, you know, will you get certified too because the office is there so in the winter months when we lose all the students that are lifeguard s, you know, that if there is any interruption with that maybe you could fill in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 And he said, I'll be getting certified to become a lifeguard . This will occur when my lifeguards all become certified . I will be taking the course with them. The date is to be determined but should be within the next two weeks. That was in June. All right? So I'm happy to -- the good news is they have 25 certified lifeguards in this program and four of them are still in process . But like I said, we're going to lose half of them or more -- we lose almost all of them when these student s go back to school. The bad news is, when we asked this question again last week, the new parks director said no he will not be getting certified . He is going to focus on the parks. So I took him on his word. That's why I gave him a final vote. But it's unfortunate . And I'm very upset about that. And that is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 80, 2023 – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING THE CITY’S OPEN BURN 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 PROHIBITION TO EXPLICITLY ALLOW AN EXCEPTION FOR PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS . MR. MCANDREW : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , I did some research on this and I read where the United States Supreme Court had ruled that flag burning constitutes a form of symbolic speech that is protected by our First Amendment . I don't agree with that. But that's their ruling. I would not ever burn a flag. But if we do not amend this ordinance to comply with the Supreme Court ruling, it could put the city and our residents -- we could be liable for a lawsuit such as the one that the city of Cleveland had to -- they agreed to pay Gregory Johnson $225,000 to settle a claim that officer s retaliated against him for an exercise of free expression which was burning a flag at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 protest . So my -- I would be voting in favor of this because I don't see any reason for us to expose ourself to any liability . MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question , we got some sort of an answer. I think I asked to justify this ordinance . And the answer that I got although they said it was trying to shore up the legislation so that we were in compliance , I really didn't feel that the answer, I guess, I wasn't satisfied with the answer. So I will be voting no. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , as was mentioned earlier , I did express concerns with this legislation previously . So I voted no for it in reference to burning flags for protest s and how protests sometimes happen without that notice. And we did receive additional information from the Law Department that I really would have preferred to have prior to that vote because that would have changed my vote which is, you know, one of the reasons 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 that I will be voting on it today. And I do agree that it would put us at a liability based on the legal advice that we have been given and that we were informed that, you know, it would be a specific time having it at like specific places that -- or I'm sorry, specific time that this could take place. And additionally it also has to deal with public safety. So there have been other times there is ceremonies where the flags are burned and the fire department is notified and a firefighter would go to that to just make sure that everyone is safe while that's taking place and that no one is harmed with that burning . So, you know, I feel like for me the public safety piece is important and makes more sense as to why this was brought forward . So that's all I have to say on that. MR. MCANDREW : Anybody else? MR. KING: On the question , based on the information we received from our Assistant City Solicitor , I will be voting in favor of this this evening . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. On the question , so this has been brought forth to us twice. I don't like how it came down the second time. I can't speak too much about why because it was a discussion in the back room. All right. But my opinion hasn't changed from the first time it was introduced to the second time it was introduced. I would never burn a flag. Are you kidding me? But I don't believe -- I think this puts us more at liability making someone make a reservation , fill out forms to protest to burn something , maybe not the American flag, maybe another flag, whatever . So I think -- I don't agree with the legal department saying that this makes it better for freedom of speech. I disagree . I think -- I can't vote yes for this because I worry about legal ramifications down the road. So with that, I'm definitely voting no again. I'm sticking to my no. Okay, all those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 MR. MCANDREW : Opposed? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. The ayes have it and so moved. MR. SMURL: I make a motion to suspend the rules to move Item 6-A to Seventh Order for final passage . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 280, 2023 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH MUFLEHUN TO PERFORM COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. MCANDREW : As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-J -- K, oh, I'm sorry, Jesus, I'm sorry. All right. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-K. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , so what I've gotten out of this after I read I guess it's about 170 pages long but most of it was about the bidding. But this is basically an analysis to advise the city and OECD and police department on gang activity in our city and how to deal with it and its long-term effects it will have on our city. From everything I've learned about this and speaking with the Chief Carroll today, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 it seems that the last resort seems to be to throw everything onto the lap of the police department . Our police officers are not counsellors . And they are not therapists and nor are they trained to handle this type of therapy that these people may need. Our police department has done a great job to date. But it should not be all of their responsibility all the time. So I hope this analysis is going to identify what organizations that are available , what help is available and really what pieces are we missing to complete this and make us maybe pursue a better way to inform our children . It seems our kids today even before they reach middle school are already involved in gang activity . So we need to do better at reaching them before they actually get involved with gangs. So I believe this analysis would provide us with this information . So I will be in favor of this resolution . MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so I brought it up when this was originally in Fifth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 Order. So with the ARPA money $500,000 was allocated for mental health services . $100,000 was directed towards this project I guess, if you will. And it's going to be about $70,000 of that hundred thousand that's going to be spent. Now, I am under the impression that the motion to receive a copy of this company 's initial report passed. Am I correct on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : Correct . MR. SCHUSTER : So that study came out to the city in August of '22. I looked at there was a house subcommittee that spoke to this group and they went onto say that this study was provided to the city and that they work with the city to codevelop the plan that came out of this study. This was news to me as I only saw it last week. But with that being said that we have requested this document , I would like to make a motion to table to fully review this study before we move with spending this $70,000 of mental health funding on this threat assessment . So I make a motion to table. MR. MCANDREW : Second. On the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 question ? All those in favor of tabling say aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. Those that don't? MR. SMURL: No. MR. KING: No. DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Well, I'm just going to say that's a mistake . This was a perfect opportunity to take a look at this company 's work to see if it was something that we wanted to move forward with. So I feel sorry that we lost out on a total review of this company 's services . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so anybody else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , this piece of legislation this was part of the conversation that we had with Chief Carroll earlier . And I believe (inaudible ) in citizen 's participation tonight to is to -- you know, what he thought about this or what they could be doing better to address crime in the city and gang activity .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 And he believes that this is one of the ways that they could do that in that this would be helpful and resourceful to them and to the police department . I think it's easy to just say, well, why can't they just do, you know, do the work and why do we need a contractor . But sometimes it's just not possible with the -- maybe the capacity that you have or needing some further expertise on it. So I'm in favor of this contract . I think that if we want to work on crime in the city I think this is one step and one way that we could be able to do that and I'm supportive of it. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , it was mentioned tonight in public comment that government should be conduct ed in public and not in secret. I did request this document over a week ago. It has not been provided to me. I guess it appears that others have met to review the document . It was said that it was 170 pages. I'm not sure if all of those pages have been reviewed . But again, I would like to say I would have liked to have reviewed this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 company 's work prior to me agreeing to this contract . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so on the question , how are we suppose d to make an informed decision on a new contract with this company when they won't show us what they did a year ago, their performance , what they actually did? How do we make an informed decision based on information they won't give us? Secondly, I have an issue with that, of course. But secondly , we have a very competent , professional police department , one of the best -- one of the best in the Commonwealth , right, bar none. Right, so -- and also in addition to that during the primary election the Times posed question s to candidate s and said, you know, what's the biggest issue facing the city. So I was, like, you know, blight and crime at this time. And, you know, what would you do to try to rectify it? So my response was, okay, there's gang activity . We all know it's here. My response was we need the police department and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 the State Police to develop a task force, work in tandem to address the gang issue and the increased crime. I don't need to throw money at another consultant from Washington . Now they're calling it an analysis . Everything else was called study. So studies keep coming down. So they don't want to use the word study anymore but that money could be spent somewhere else. And since they would not allow us to see their past performance last year on their other analysis , the study, I took a peak at the company , right? Their focus -- and it's scary. I didn't see the word gang mentioned anywhere in any of the work they do. What I did see was their focus is domestic terrorism , extremist behavior . I don't think that's a problem here. There is a problem with gangs. I believe the police in tandem with the task force with the State Police with laser beam focus could handle this here. I want to rely on expertise within the area. Every time a problem , we have to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 consultant s. We have to get studies . We have to set all of this work out to other states, other cities, other -- pretty soon it will be countries . So with that said I'm definitely voting no for this. Okay. MR. KING: On the question , I will be support ing this evening because our police chief absolutely supports this. And I have the utmost faith in our police chief. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Roll call, please. MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , also with my request for that initial report were -- assessment was I wanted to see some of the recommendation s that came out of that. What happens here and what was in the backup documentation is they are going to make recommendations . Most of these recommendations are probably going to be with outside agencies that are not under the city's purview . They're agencies that are not employed by the city. So I would have liked to have seen some of the examples of these recommendations to see if these are things that could have been done and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 could have been followed through on. My fear here is that we spend money on a project that we cannot enforce the recommendations . But I just wanted to see examples of previous recommendations . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes.
