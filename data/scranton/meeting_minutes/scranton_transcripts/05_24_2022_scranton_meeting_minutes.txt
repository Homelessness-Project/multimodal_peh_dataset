And then we'll ask that the Business Administrator and the head of the DPW union come up and join us for that one. DR. ROTHCHILD : Scranton City Proclamation Recognizing May 28th, 2022, as Menstrual Awareness Day. WHEREAS , Menstrual Hygiene Day is an annual international health campaign to address the widespread stigma and shame surrounding menstruation and menstrual hygiene by ensuring access to factual information thereon , addressing the negative social norms around the issue, and ensuring universal access to hygienic products ; and WHEREAS , national studies report that 2 in 5 people in the United States suffer from Period Poverty , which is the lack of access to menstrual supplies and factual information due to financial restraints . The lack of menstrual hygiene can lead to serious health risks; and WHEREAS , in Pennsylvania , 1 in 6 menstruators between the ages of 12 and 44 live below the federal poverty level, and therefore 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 likely experience period poverty ; studies report that 4 in 5 have either missed class or knew someone who has because they were unable to access menstrual supplies ; and. WHEREAS , menstruators struggling with period poverty face significant obstacles to managing menstruation in a safe & dignified manner. The lack of menstrual hygiene can lead to serious health risks when they wear period products for longer than the recommended time frame or use substitutes such as socks, toilet paper, & old rags; and has been shown to directly affect menstruating youth's potential to succeed in school; and WHEREAS , period poverty is an educational , safety, public health, and behavioral health issue, but most importantly a basic human rights issue; and addressing access to period products for all people can lead to improved health, and economic opportunity for individuals and communities to thrive and reach their full potential ; and WHEREAS , local, state, and federal policies can exacerbate period poverty and equitable access to period products by imposing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 sales taxes on menstrual products , not providing products in institutions such as prisons and jails, exempting menstrual products from public health benefits and poverty programs , & not making products available in public restrooms , public schools , & homeless shelters ; and WHEREAS , the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated period poverty as it has forced millions of people out of work & worsened socio-economic & health challenges of those struggling with period poverty ; access to menstrual products is essential to the health, mental, & economic well-being of individuals facing period poverty in overcoming and recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic ; and WHEREAS , Scranton is proud to have trusted community -based organizations and advocates , including The Catherine McAuley Center, that recognize the importance of normalizing menstruation while bringing awareness to the issue of period poverty ; and WHEREAS , this day is designated to recognize the importance of addressing period poverty , to promote health equity across the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 city and ensure the health and well-being of all people who menstruate , to thank organizations committed to resolving this fundamental issue in our state, and to encourage Scrantonians to support this important work by donating to product drives and organizations that collect and distribute menstrual health products for those experiencing period poverty ; and NOW, THEREFORE , the Mayor of Scranton and the City Council do hereby proclaim May 28th, 2022, as Menstrual Health Awareness Day in Scranton .

DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have announcements at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Friday, May 27th, 5 to 8 p.m., on the street in front of the Scranton Public Library will be the 11th annual Swingin on Vine fund-raiser. It will be outside . There will be live music by Picture Perfect and the Raging Hormones . It costs $20 to buy a ticket in advance and $25 at the door. But for that money, you get to eat all the cookout style food you could get, beer, wine and/or Margarita 's. And it's a perfect opportunity to party. Even if it rains, we'll go inside the library and continue partying . But the thing is, if you like me live downtown, you don't have to worry about a DUI. You just low crawl home at the end of the night. So that's where I will be. I saw the negotiations for the labor contracts , the update in the Third Order. And I was surprised 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 at the number of meeting s, not that many considering we're 20, 21 weeks into the year. But about half of the meeting s that were scheduled were actually cancelled , which is surprising . One thing you got to keep in mind, here we are in late in May and not too far down the road we should begin the planning process for next year's budget. And it will be helpful to know where you stand in terms of these contracts . By the way, the Clerical Union contract is still not on the website . So hopefully that will be corrected . I saw in the Controller 's report that the Ufberg Law Firm under HR picked up another $46,401.88, which they added to their 97,000 and change for a total of $143,799.07. And the meter is still running . Although next week, May 31st is the opening of the RFQ for the -- another special labor counsel . So I don't know what that's all about, whether we're going to replace the Ufberg firm or have a second firm. I don't know. But we got an awful lot of the lawyers in this City apparently . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Now 5-C, the contract of PFM to provide financial advisory services for the City of Scranton for the next four years. I'm not quite sure how this is necessary since the City's hired their own financial director . But assuming that it is, the one thing that surprised me is, it's a four-year contract . But there was no stated cap on how much the firm might be paid. So I would have expected not to exceed 100,000 or a hundred million dollars or something . I would be curious as to whether there's an intent to cap the amount of money on those four years how that will go. And I see we're hiring another assistant attorney in the Law Department . So now we'll have I guess two full-time solicit ors and four part-timers. So they have a full slate. And other than that I don't have much more. I just hope that we don't drag out these contract negotiations very long because it would be nice to have that decided before you present the budget to the people. And if this goes to arbitration , it's not going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 good for the City. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Marie Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes, Marie Schumacher . May I give you some printed stuff? Thank you. Yes, I am here tonight to speak -- I have a very bad feeling about this -- these test strips as you'll see on the one -- on the top one -- the one that has all the print. It is not necessarily good. There are limitations specific for testing the pills. And if you have been following it, most of the deaths have been because people -- young people up to age 25 are mostly buying these pills online that have fentanyl in them. And as this thing calls it, they have a chocolate chip effect, which is you cannot test a portion of the pill and be sure that the rest of the tablet or batch is free of fentanyl . You must dissolve everything that is to be consumed prior to testing because uneven mixing, the common problem in illicit pills, you cannot test one pill from a batch and assume that the other pills in the same batch do not contain fentanyl . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 So, yeah, will it save some lives, yes. But are we just doing it so we feel good that we saved some lives or are we causing maybe some deaths because again, somebody buys a bottle of pills and they do a test -- if you notice as well on the opposite side of the second thing what you have to do to test the pill. I just wonder how many people that buy these drugs will take the time to go through the trouble of doing this and then get a negative and then take another pill from the bottle and be going feet first. And initially I thought it was bad because what it's doing is maybe saving their life, but if you are assuming it was 100 percent , you say, oh, yeah, this -- whatever it is, I'm going to take is good. So I could take this. And then they go out on the street or go places and, you know, kill people who are not using them in some ways and maybe now even themselves. I think -- I just get the feeling this is a make us feel good thing. But I think that's not the right answer. I think we have to do something more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to keep people not just to get 100 percent cocaine but to get them off the cocaine . And I'm not sure how we do that. But I really do have a terrible feeling that if this happens , it's going to be really bad. So I would ask you that you table this until we find out if this is just really a feel good thing and turns out to be a bad decision because people will either not test correctly because it is a difficult thing or -- and they may not -- it may not have the affect we think it will have. So I just think we should think about it a little bit more. Table it until you do some more research and see if this is really what you want to do. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And just to clarify , we're not doing this ourselves. We're just supporting a House and Senate bill that takes the strips off of a drug paraphernalia list. We're not -- MS. SCHUMACHER : I understand that but that's -- then it become a law. MR. DONAHUE : But right now, yeah, but currently if you are to have fentanyl test 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 strips, you know, and nothing else, you could still be arrested, you know, for drug paraphernalia . So it's just taking them off the paraphernalia list. MS. SCHUMACHER : I don't know if that's a good thing to do because of the way they could be misused . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Fentanyl is very nasty. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . Since my last mistake in 1959 to last week, I believe I have been mistake free. But I did overlook your taking care of a couple of my complaints . Is there a mistake forgiveness ? MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . We all make them. MR. ELLMAN: -- nobody seems to pay any attention to citations anyway. Council and the Licensing Bureau need some absolute power. I was told you can't even go into someone 's house when it's getting remodeled to see if they got permits and all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 And again, this reassessment seems to threaten so many people. As I always say if three or four or five people a week I talk to at the grocery store, apparently they're low income seniors and minorities who worry because when I sign my petitions in South Side and West Side, I ran into people that are absolutely suffering financially and try to hold onto their properties . And now we have these two commissioners Debbie and Jerry doing their utmost to rid the City. These are the people that will be the first to lose the most precious things they ever have, their homes. And Debbie has the audacity to say she feels for people. She doesn't. She doesn't feel for nothing . They both have two jobs and one of them is sponging off the taxpayer s that they despise . One of the results of giving so many grants and loan forgiveness and they're being passed around so free. The older properties are vacant. And they're the ones that are being -- the taxes are being paid on. And then we have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 promises by a bunch of phoney LLCs and developers , housing for seniors . They want 12, 1,500 which is twice much as most seniors that need the property have. So, of course, like the property on Dixon, they were promised for seniors and it just doesn't venture out that way. They are very expensive apartments . You know, I wonder if I want to build a 64 million dollar hotel somewhere if Wolf would give me a 24 million dollar grant. This is asinine . These people, they want all of this money they don't have to build expensive projects . It seems like they ought to be able to have a budget like I have and most people in this City go by. To change the subject , I was in Wilkes-Barre this morning . I stopped for some coffee and donuts, Rosie and me. They charge 1.65 a donut. Who ever heard of something like that? I spent over $6 in a donut shop on two jelly donuts and two drinks. I don't know who you could blame but that's ridiculous . I could have went to McDonalds or somewhere and had a lunch for less 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 money. And I thank you for your help in trying to clean up my neighborhood because it is really going to pot bad and the Licensing Bureau doesn't seem capable of doing it. Thank you all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. Well, I think the first thing I'll start with is 7-A. I think Marie is absolutely right. Fentanyl is a very large problem with an awful lot of people dying from it. And if you don't know how to use the test strip and if you don't know what you're playing with, it is drug paraphernalia because if you don't know how to use it and you use it and you're dead, it wasn't anything that was going to help you. And the Congress and the Senate, whether it's in the State of Pennsylvania or federally , the answer to fentanyl is to tell the Chinese to stop making it and pumping it into our country because a lot of people are -- young people are dying experimenting 13, 14 years old trying one pill and ending up dead. Reassessment , we don't need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 reassessment . We need to change the way taxes are collect ed or paid. We need to move away from property based tax. It can't work. Too complex a society to fund off of property tax. And 8-A, you know, I have a question on that. And that is in this 8-A, is there provisions for industrial development ? MR. DONAHUE : There are. There's industrial zones that are allowed in certain areas. MR. MORGAN: Okay. But what kind of industrial zones are you talking about? Are you talking about light manufacturing , medium manufacturing , heavy manufacturing ? MR. DONAHUE : There's zones -- there's zones for all three. MR. MORGAN: Okay. I just -- I just think we need to be careful . I mean, is this going to follow the framework of SAPA in any way? MR. DONAHUE : It's a part of SAPA but it has -- it's its own city ordinance . MR. MORGAN: No, I understand . MR. DONAHUE : It was developed in a regional way but we're not adding or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 subtracting anything we didn't already have permitted uses for. MR. MORGAN: Okay. Now, the last thing I have here tonight is that I think it's time to finally get moving here on the Home Rule Charter but not only the City but the county also. And I think it's important for the residents to realize that we have to change the way our government functions . It's not anti Democrat or anti Republican situation . I don't understand why the Council was against putting it on the ballot. I don't understand why the Mayor was against putting it on the ballot because I think the residents of the City and the resident s of the county have a right to self-determination . And since the charters were created by them, I can't understand why local government would be opposed to them amending it. And I can't understand why the Council and the Mayor and the county wouldn't want to allow the residents to change their charters to make their lives better and to control the government that all of these elected official s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 work in. So next week when I come to the Council meeting , I'm going to give people a phone number and ask them to get involved and begin the process of changing their city and their county because we can't continue on the course we're on. The City came out of distress and in my opinion , it's in worse shape than when it went in. And the county just trying to put more tax on the resident s is absolutely ridiculous . So something really has to change. And it's up to the people here to finally determine that they want to make that change. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . Congratulations for your victory last week. I'm always mentioning compensation for tax exempt institutions 501C3 and C4s. But due to recent developments politically , I think it's high time that if they want to be -- don't want to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 nonpartisan, they want to run a 501C3 or C4, they should not be allowed . I'm a little tired of people using it with an extreme political agenda and anti family planning and so forth. It's really gotten to a point where I deeply resent them. And hospitals and so forth, we could use a little compensation due to the fact that we have most of the hospitals except for the new one opening up and I compliment Lehigh for that. PA state constitution changes will probably appear on the ballot. And I'll mention this again in the coming months. Hopefully vote them down. It's an attempt by the PA legislature to strip the Governor of power. The Governor lost the power with the pandemic to insist on masking and many other things. And we have a lot of people really throwing monkey wrenches into the government, 192 Republicans voted against money to obtain infant formula . You know that we have a crisis. How can you claim to be pro-life if you don't even want to see the baby fed. For shame. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Televangelist in Tennessee , he's calling it a christian insurgency and calls them satanist . Gee thanks. I'm glad I'm not on your side anyway. There's nuclear disarmament . And in Russian , he has resigned over President Putin's saber rattling . And it just goes on and on and on. One hundred thirty-five Republicans voted against certificating Joe Biden. Barry Laudermilk from Georgia hosted a tour on 1/5/20 the day before the insurrection despite the COVID ban. He was not supposed to -- then he denied doing it. And he also filed charges against the persons that observed him doing it. And they had possibly MAGA hats on. So these are the kind people we have in government. And our old Treasury Secretary Mr. Kushner , the son-in-law of the former president got 3 billion dollars from (inaudible ) somewhere in early January of 2021. So gee, must be nice. Why? And we have -- and including Pennsylvania and our Governor 400 Republicans running on overturn ing elections in the state -- some in the State of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Pennsylvania . And it's really a shame. I hope things change in the future. I'm reasonably happy with the way things are going in Scranton . And by the way, Ufberg law office, I sat on the opposite side of the table of them years ago. And they were the most antiunion lawyers in town. So they probably still have my face on their dartboard. I got a guaranteed 40 hour week. Have a good one. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Just wanted to come up here and make a statement quickly from listening to what was spoken before this Council in this very section . Often times when we look at it, we hear of the non-profits not paying taxes. But the non-profits of 38 percent of them not paying in are having devastating effect on the tax base and the burdens for the people in this City. What's not talked about which was slightly inferred was what is the complete tax burden? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 When you look at the non-profits , when you look at the tax abatement s for builders of the 10-year tax abatement fees, when you look at all of the exceptions putting in for taxes for new construction and non-profits , what's total amount of money percentage wise that's being forgiven , not just for the non-profits because that's one part of the cake. When you look at a 17-story structure , well, maybe future money it impacts the tax base right now when you go forward and you give tax abasements . I'm just curious how much in total if you add together all of the non-profits and all of the 10 year tax abatement s for new construction , how much of the pie that would constitute rather than just looking at the non-profits alone. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. KING: I know we recognize d the DPW this evening . And I would just like to take a moment to recognize them again. You know, we've been talking about some of the infrastructure and some of the paving that's been going on. We had serious concern on Cherry Street. There is basically a spring underneath the road and with my job, I went to Harrisburg yesterday morning and noticed the bottom part of Cherry Street all the marking s, all of -- I guess all of the pipes, all of the manhole covers were painted. And I thought , oh, it looks like they are getting ready to mill the street. And when I got back from Harrisburg , the street was milled all way up to 13, 14, and 1500 block of Cherry. As was expected , then, you know, I started to wonder are they going to address the concerns with that water. It's constant and in the winter it's absolutely -- it's almost impassable . It's brutal. And those people have been dealing with that for many, many years. And, you know, I had reached out to DPW and to Larry West and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 some others. And low and behold, first -- I don't want to say first thing this morning . Around noon I met with Larry West there, Steve Teaman{phonetic }, Chris Jenkins from DPW along with Barry Isett who is doing the paving. And they -- and several of the neighbors who live right in that general area. And they put together a plan to address the infrastructure issues with the drainage and the problem with that spring. And I think they came up with a solution that will hopefully resolve it because to truly go over and just pave over something like that would literally be a waste of thousands of dollars . I applaud DPW for making sure and they did the same thing over on Mountain Lake Road to make sure that the areas where the infrastructure needs to be taken care of underneath before you go and pave these roads. And I applaud them for listening and getting up there because my Facebook page was lighting up like a Christmas tree last night with people thinking that they were just going to pave over it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 And that wasn't the case. They had planned and they came up and they were, in fact, it's going to -- they are actually going to start paving 13, 1400 tomorrow up to a point. But the DPW is going to be here first thing in the morning addressing those issues with the drain. So I applaud their efforts for that and thank them. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I had several complaints mostly for code enforce ment, some things that still haven't been addressed mostly within the Hill Section that I'll be circling back with Mr. Voldenberg and with that department on. So I'll send him a list that we'll go through all of those here tonight . The other thing I wanted to mention , I know that Mr. Donahue had at the very beginning of the meeting but I did want to mention that my heartfelt sympathies are with the community in Texas -- the Uvalde -- I'm not sure how to pronounce the township 's name but city in Texas where the elementary school there was a horrific shooting today.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 I think reports are still coming out possibly 14 student s and one teacher dead. And it's just very sad for me and I have a daughter and think about her going to school in the future and do you even want to send your children to school now a days. And so it's really heartbreaking . And so I just wanted to mention -- make sure to mention something about that tonight at the meeting . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a few. So Council office received a call from a neighbor of 932 Capouse Avenue, 934 Capouse Avenue, and 212 Ash Street regarding trash and garbage issues in the rear of all these three properties and Roche Court. The gentleman claimed two of the properties changed hands recently . But the problem remains with the tenants of these building s. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I know you received the same e-mail. But could you please make Code Enforcement aware of this situation to visit Roche Court behind each of those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 properties to review and if necessary , cite the owners of these properties ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I have, sir. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : And then I have another one here. So last week, Mr. Coyne had a fantastic idea. While we're waiting for the pool to be built, you know, it's not going to be any time soon. He suggested like they do in other cities to utilize the fire hydrant s for the kids when it's very hot. But and, you know, like I said, I thought it was a great idea. I said let's look into it. So here's the answer I got from -- I contacted the chief -- Fire Chief. And he also agreed, you know, it sounds like a great idea during peaking times there are many issues that would need to be investigated before consideration . The city has over 1400 hydrant s that serve our community , which no longer are owned or maintain by the City of Scranton which I didn't know. So somewhere in the mid 1990s while the city owned the hydrant s and was responsible for their annual maintenance and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 testing , approximate ly 450 hydrants were out of order -- I'm sorry, out of service due to maintenance issues. So he wasn't sure when the City relinquished the hydrants to the water company . But I believe it was in the late 90s or early 2000s. Pennsylvania American Water is now the owner and is responsible for the maintenance of our hydrant system. So historically if any entities uses a hydrant for any other purpose other than emergency response , the water company places a meter on it and then bills the City for consumption . The other issue becomes the hydrant valve system's damaged during the opening and closing of the hydrant and will prevent the hydrant from shutting off and require immediate attention from Pennsylvania American Water to shut off this hydrant and make repairs. So -- and also there is liability issues obviously , you know, we don't own them anymore. So great idea. But unfortunately , we're not allowed to do it or can't do it for obvious reasons . Keep the good ideas coming. All right. Next, so also, Mr. Voldenberg , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 could you please contact Code Enforcement ? We're getting a lot of complaints about the Washburn Street cemetery . The sidewalk s are a disaster . Someone 's going to get hurt. I don't know if they are suppose d to maintain it, but I know part of it is, you know, the City could go out and make sure they are taken care of. So if you could please have them send somebody out for that. What else do I have here? So also, someone reached out to me about the skate park in West Scranton on Jackson Street. I know in years past, there was a lot of volunteer s that actually took care and maintained this area. But, you know, some are getting older, some don't have the time or ability to do it anymore. And it is a city park. And they're all important , and especially if you -- the one you live closest to is most important to you. So these complaint s are from West Side resident s. So if you could please inquire with the Parks and Recs what type of schedule is this park on to be maintained if you could look into that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. MCANDREW : And then I talked a little about this in caucus. So Mr. Schuster or Councilman Schuster couldn't be here tonight . It's his son's preschool graduation which is pretty cool. But he's been inquiring for weeks about the billing labor. And we can't get any responses back. And, oh, we have to redact or not redact or we can't provide it. And I know that Solicitor Gallagher has been working on it. I know you had a little correspondence today. Can you please just report out or update us where we're at with this because it's been weeks. And it's a simple ask. I don't understand all of these hurdles if you could provide us with a little update. ATTY. GALLAGHER : -- labor billing and he provided -- City Solicitor 's office provided the billing to Council Chambers two to three weeks ago I believe it was. I had a chance to review it. And then I discussed with him that it was going to go into Third Order. And he had some concerns regarding attorney /client privilege and work product . And I, you know, he and I disagree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 on what should be redacted , if anything . Obviously I don't think anyone's -- any employee 's name should be included in it. But the invoices in and of itself I don't believe there was any legal strategy or memorandum of anything regarding any legal strategy or conclusion of any meeting or disciplinary action for lack thereof any more examples I have. So he and I -- I have another e-mail out to him today to discuss what the City wants to redact. And I should have something back from him probably tomorrow because he's pretty responsive . So I think we'll get to the finish line. It's just taking a little longer than we thought . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you, Solicitor Gallagher . You know, while you're at it, the new -- the extra 40 grand just came across our desk here. Can you inquire as well about that amount and what the billing was for? We just want to get to the bottom of -- as part of the negotiations , we want to see what's being spent. So, you know, add that to the list, the 40 grand.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 ATTY. GALLAGHER : Absolutely . MR. MCANDREW : And I have two more. Let me pull them up here on my iPad. I don't want to miss these concerns for the residents . I actually got them today so -- one of them today. So a gentleman from South Side had four complaints all in South Side, Jackson Motors. He's down on Cedar Avenue, junk cars and soon to be overgrown with weeds with the warm weather . 426 Fig Street, the house is empty. And from what I was told, the owner couldn't pay his mortgage . The yard is a mess. It will only get worse as summer goes on. Plus, and an empty house is a target for arson. In 2009 and again in 2010, two abandoned houses across the alley from me were torched and caused damage to the front of his house. 2018 Cedar Avenue, there was a fire there last year and nothing has been done since and Pittston Avenue and O'Hara Street, the building that was used to house Blinker 's gas station . So I will forward this e-mail to you, Mr. Voldenberg . I just wanted to go on record and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 put it out there. As soon as the meeting's over I will give you that one. Here's another one that I already forwarded to you. So this is Luzerne Street, right, we've been talking about issues with trucks on Railroad Avenue. There's an ordinance against it. They were taking care of it for a while. Then there was a police officer that retired and they were suppose d to replace that with someone who was trained or had somebody trained to do the weights and measures . So these large trucks continue to run up and down these roads on Railroad and adjoining roads. So, you know, please check on that. See the status of that. There's picture s out -- I think I forwarded them to you. But in addition to that, there is the bridge at Luzerne towards the bottom of Railroad . It's a disaster . I see the pictures here. There is furniture on the bridge. There's debris. And I know the railroad owns it. And I don't know what type of agreement or what -- if you could please find out who is responsible for what. Maybe we need to put the railroad 's feet to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 fire and just clarify who's responsible for what, what part of it or around it or next to it if you could please do that for me, Mr. Voldenberg , I would greatly appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : I think that's it or at least I hope it is. I hope I didn't miss any. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I just have a couple things tonight . First, Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to send along to DPW I got some complaint s about the 400 block of Beech Street. It just needs some patching if we could send that along. Also, last week we got an e-mail regarding fire coverage in Minooka -- the Minooka section that is served by Engine 2. The resident states that -- I mean, they list a couple instances of Engine 2 reporting to scenes outside of City limits. A couple instances that were mentioned here was on one on January 6th, Engine 2 was dispatch ed to 3622 Birney Avenue in Moosic. And so for 30 minutes there was no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 coverage in Minooka in the upper South Side region. On 2/16/2022, Engine 2 was dispatched to 100 South Main Street in Old Forge for 2 hours and 10 minutes there was no coverage in Minooka in the upper South Side region. On 5/11/22, Engine 2 was relocated to Green Wood Fire Station while their crews operated on a brush fire. While the engine operated out of Moosic, they were dispatch ed to 500 Brown Avenue in Duryea on a rescue call. They remained out of the coverage area for 1 hour and 21 minutes . At that time, they were relieved by another Scranton Engine 9 staffed with three Scranton firefighter s on overtime who are paid to staff Moosic's firehouse . This cost the Scranton taxpayer s approximately $450 plus fuel costs. So I have a couple questions to pass along to the Fire Chief. One, how many times this year have fire personnel assisted surrounding communities ? Two, do we call in personnel for overtime to backfill for personnel that are respond ing outside of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 City? And three, do these municipalities reimburse the City for costs incurred ? I'm all right with having our professional Fire Department assist. But I also think that we should be reimbursed for that assistance . The citizens of this -- taxpayer s of this City pay for a professional fire department and everything that goes with it. Many outside communities besides Dunmore do not. So I think if we're going to be responding to calls outside the City, we need to be reimbursed for the cost incurred , not only in sending our personnel there but also for any overtime that's incurred with backfilling into those houses. And that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION - AN ORDINANCE - CLOSING CERTAIN PORTIONS OF CENTER STREET AND LEE COURT TO VEHICULAR TRAFFIC TO DEVELOP A PEDESTRIAN “LIVING ALLEY” TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DOWNTOWN AND ENCOURAGE PUBLIC HEALTH THROUGH PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. DR.

MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple questions . So I'm familiar with PFM being a former school director . And I know that they assisted the City in the past. So this is a new contract . It's a four-year contract with the potential for a four-year renewal which I read in the backup. My question is, where do they go? I have -- I need to know did they -- did our agreement or arrangement with them cease when we exited Act 47? I know that for the most part it says in the backup that, you know, they helped us with TANs. And I know that, but do we need a four-year contract to do that? And like Miss Hodowanitz said, is there a cap to this the amount that we're going to spend on them? What is their scope of work? Are they going to hang around and help us out with a TAN or are they going to be providing a lot more services than we're aware because , you know, oh, we kind of need them because we exited Act 47. But we do have a finance director. We have PEL that is probably coming back. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 I'd like them questions answered or clarified why they're coming back, why was the pause of the relationship with them, when did that end and is it starting up again? Or is it more than just a TAN? How much work are they going to do for us and what is it really going cost? So if you could please send them questions before we vote on this for final passage . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. KING: As Vice Chairman for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I just have a concern or a just a little -- I don't understand . So last week this was introduced. And it's introduced because we want to help -- and I get that. This is a new process . There's a waiver for penalties for one month which I'm okay with because , you know, not everybody is going to be acclimated with it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 But then I find out the next day or two days later that bills were actually mailed out then. So is this waiver because they weren't mailed out or is this to help the citizen s or both? I mean, of course, I'm going to vote yes for it. But I found it -- I raised my eyebrow I should say when I heard about this because we had, you know, that was extended to get the Payroll Prep Tax right and get it up and running and make sure it was right. And we had a lot of time to do this. And it looks like that we didn't get it right. That's just my opinion . That is all I have on on the question . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ?
