CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY CONTROLLER , JOHN J. MURRAY DATED APRIL 1, 2022 REGARDING LIQUID FUELS REPORT FOR THE MONTHS JANUARY , FEBRUARY AND MARCH OF 2022. 3-D. S&P GLOBAL RATINGS REVISED OUTLOOK ON SCRANTON ’S GENERAL OBLIGATION DEBT. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? I just have one I think regarding 3-D, which is the S & P global ratings . It was good news that we got last week that we were raised from BB standard to BB positive . And we're one step away from being investment grade which hasn't happened in quite some time in the City. So I think that is important to point out that there is some good news there. Does anyone else have any comments on Third Order items? Received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 So this Sunday, April 10th for autism awareness , there will be a fundraiser for the Northeast Regional Autism Center. And it's called Pizza by Pappas. All right. So it's simple. Just come in to call and buy a pizza. Every pizza purchased will have 50 percent of the sales price donated on behalf of the Northeast Regional Autism Center at Friendship House. Past events have raised over $95,000. This is a great event. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Any other Council members have announcements at this time? MR. KING: Just real briefly . I want to congratulate all those runners that competed this past weekend in the Scranton Half Marathon . They had close to 900 runners and another 100 walkers. It was a great event. You know, it was pouring rain in the beginning but it was great participation . And I think it was a huge success . So that's it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Any other Council members have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one. I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 wanted to have announced in case anyone hasn't heard, the second booster shots for the COVID 19 vaccination s is available now to people over the age of 50 or for immunocompromised people of any age. That's it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Any other Council members have any announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list this evening is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . During the caucus I heard you ask about the status of the union negotiations for their new contracts and pleased to see that there are talks going on. But I would remind you that this is day 95 of the year 2022. And 26 percent of the year is gone. I don't know how long it's going to be before they either sign a contract or go to arbitration and have a decision made. But I'm sure if there are pay raises that are not reflected in the budget, they will be retroactive to January 1st of 2022. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 With regard to 5-C, the agreement with American Asphalt Paving for the upcoming year, I was looking at the OECD backup. And they have a line that says financial impact funding through CDBG 848,000. And then the last page of their summary they showed bids from the various companies . And the low bid was American Asphalt Paving for $1,954,420.56. But I didn't see any explanation of how you get from 848,000 to 1.9 million . If perhaps you could address that when you get to the legislation because that is 1 million dollars , you know, who is paying that? Is that coming out of the capital budget? Is that coming out of the general funds? Is that another grant? I'm just kind of curious because it wasn't clear in the OECD backup. And 3-D, the S & P correspondence on the upgrade to the general obligation debt rating for Scranton . I too thought that was good news, but you have to read the document careful ly because they caution that they're still going to be watching how we manage our finances 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 making sure that we can close the gap in our revenue and expenditures . And they had a couple of interesting things that they are saying, one in three chance they'll raise the rating over the next two years. One of the things that they're hoping we can improve our revenue s in liquidity without Pennsylvania Act 47 financial oversight , of course, we're out of that. But maybe not quite because we're trying to bring in Jerry Cross as an advisor to help us navigate our way out. I don't know. You know, I mean, I don't know what we're trying to do whether we're really out or we're in. They're also pointing out some of the problem s that Scranton has as a City are relatively lower wealth and income ratios or high fixed costs. Those remain as credit pressures . If over the next two years the City is able to navigate its challenges in aligning revenue and expenditures without the assistance of the Commonwealth 's fiscal oversight, again, the reference to PEL, our assessment of its credit quality would likely improve to investment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 grade. But we view the City's social risks as elevated because of the weak sociodemographic profile . So basically we have a lot to do over the long-term in terms of bringing in business , raising salaries . There's a lot to do. So it's great that our general obligation debt rating has taken a turn for the better. But they caution in this document that they will watch us and they'll watch us closely because we could slip into trouble very easily. Things that you don't plan on like pandemics , other things can happen. So anyway, that's all I have for tonight . And I'll be listening for your explanation on the American Asphalt Paving issue. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here tonight is that I'd like to note the passing Andy Speraglia {phonetic .} He came here to Council for a very long time, probably was more knowledgeable than any City employee about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 where the City was financial ly or the authorities . And then after an extended period of time he stopped coming here because the City wasn't making any progress in making the lives of Scrantonians better. And he didn't want to spend his last years here at a Council that wasn't going to do the things necessary to turn this City around. The other thing I have is talking about a bond rating, the last thing this City should ever do is borrow any more money. We all know that the City is full of nothing more than generally speaking the working poor. And they just can't handle all this debt that the City might want to pile on them. And after the 30 years of the PEL's involvement , I can't see anything good that's come of it. The City could have cut its own budget and saved all of its own assets. I just think that we've picked very poor leadership in this City. And I'd like to include the Scranton School District in that because for 30-plus years, they knew that was the Titanic that was rolling upside down and people just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 kept brushing it aside. But the most important thing I came here to say is that the elections are coming again. And I just hope that Scrantonians -- and I wish my voice could carry across this whole country so that the people could know that we have to remove Democrats from public office everywhere no matter where they are. We have to elect independent s. We don't have to vote Republicans in. But we just -- the Democrats are destroying our country whether it's the border 2.1 million people crossing our border in Texas or a debt or a president the other day that the Democratic party put up who's talked about the USS Delaware . And he stood -- he was standing there and they said for everybody to sit down until the president left. He went to sit down. He's just not in control of himself . He's just -- and everyone knows it. And if it wasn't for a military man standing by who grabbed the arm of his wife to usher her off the stage, he followed her off the stage. It's just really pathetic where we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 are as a country and now all politics go from the bottom up. And even our Council members here in the Scranton School District , if they're Democrats , they're going to support what the Democratic party wants. And I think the American people have had enough of the Democrats . These aren't the Kennedys . There aren't old-time Democrats . Even Democrats in Washington are calling to clean the Democratic party up. It's really amazing what they've done to our country . They're just flaying the whole country to waste. We're finally finding out in Washington they're having hearings that our military has been stripped . And the reason we can't send aid to Ukraine is because quite honestly we don't have it. There's a lot things we don't have in this country because the Democrats have been misleading people for a very long time. So I'm asking anybody here locally to put your name on the ballot as independent . Call the Voter Registration Office. They'll explain how you can do it. It's not very difficult . But I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 asking everyone not to vote for one, not one single Democrat and think about it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . First off, I'd like to thank Jessica . I haven't been here for quite a while but you did announce the Christmas Day dinner that I was holding . And after 28 years of doing it, it was still a tremendous success even though we were handicapped . I want to thank you personally for doing that. DR. ROTHCHILD : My pleasure . I'm glad it was successful . MR. BOLUS: The understanding we got to get here, I've been involved with the trucker convoys across the country . I'm one of the leaders of them and saw what's going on all over the country . What Biden's done to this country , I can't even put it in words, the fuel, the cost of operation that affects each and every one of us not just an individual group. You know, one thing people have to understand , government works for the people, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 not the people working for government . You know, when government gets involved literally everything goes to hell when it's all over with. You know, I saw Nay Aug Recreation Authority give away all of those parking spaces that I fought and filed a lawsuit over. Yet Council looked the other way and allowed the Recreation Authority to give away literally all those cars that are parked up there for Geisinger for like a hundred thousand dollars a year. You could you have got enough money out of a company that throws millions and millions of dollars around and paid for your pool and put it the way it should be. But yet, government got involved and said let them do what they're doing rather than get rid of the Recreation Authority and put it back in the hands of the people in the City. I want to also bring out against Bill Gaughan , I filed a federal lawsuit against him for the violation of the Rules of Council against me. And that is still an ongoing suit because again, we're here. We don't work for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 government . Government works for us. And it's got to come to an end. I'm suing the State of Pennsylvania to remove Biden signs off Interstate 81. We'd like to see the signs removed in Scranton . I know you all play the political game and think Joe Biden is the best thing that ever hit our community . He's actually the worst thing. He's an absolute fool and he's made us all look like idiots. It's a man you can't respect for what he's doing, including his own son. Yet you honor him and discredit our own people who pay taxes in this City and put his signs up and remove them. I'm asking you people to vote for a referendum and we the people decide what signs go up in the City of Scranton , not five Council men and the Mayor. You took the voice away from the people and that's going to come out to haunt you later on down the road because we are fighting it. And those signs have to go. Respect the people here. Joe Biden doesn't earn respect . He demanded it and you see the fool he made out of us.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 If you left Putin alone, they probably wouldn't have went in and did the damage that's being done right now. He kept taunting them and they're paying the price being executed and murdered because this idiot couldn't keep his mouth shut. He's not a tough guy. He's the weakest one in the world and you're honoring him. The other thing that I want to see here and, Kyle, I'm going to ask that you as the Council President , you're running for state representative that actually you step down from City Council while you're in the running because decisions you made here -- and I'm going to ask a straight upfront question . If you're elected as a state representative , are you going to treat the people the same way we're being treated here putting Biden signs up, voting for things and taking away the voice of the people? MR. DONAHUE : This isn't the -- this is the forum to discuss City business . This isn't a forum to discuss anything else. MR. BOLUS: It's a public forum and we have the right. You're running as a public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 official . MR. DONAHUE : If you want to talk to me after, I'll talk to you after the meeting about any -- MR. BOLUS: Well, I asked you the question . I think you just answered my question . MR. DONAHUE : This is a forum to discuss City business . If you want to talk afterwards about any other outside -- MR. BOLUS: Yeah, well, this is the forum that we're here that you're using this forum to benefit yourself . Your opponents should have the same opportunity and should use it because I brought that -- when I ran many years ago to allow candidate s to come here and speak. And they should take advantage of it and give them the equal time that you're getting here. But I was just concerned how you're going to do representing the people if you are elected and allowing the Biden signs up because you all took the voice of the people away. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 good evening . Next on the list, Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , I read an article over in Germany -- that happened from Germany which caught my attention which is pointing to the COVID vaccine . A gentleman over there had taken -- going out and received multiple COVID shots so that he could effectively get multiple COVID vaccination cards and sell them. The gentleman in question over a short period of time took 90 COVID vaccines . Now, of course, he's being prosecuted for it for using false names and everything else and using them to try to defraud and give out vaccine cards to people who did not get vaccines for money. But it does go to show a point that even with 90 injections in a short period of time, this man is healthy . He's walking around. And he has no major medical side effects from it. That's not saying that there isn't side effects and adverse reactions . But it does speak to a person who took 90 times in a three month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 period what normal people would be -- 45 times what a normal person would be exposed to and walked away actually looking for more injections so that he could sell more cards. That goes to take -- hopefully that takes away some of the fear and resistance that one or two shots is going to kill you, it's going to cause major injuries and deaths and heart problems . There are complications . But this man after taking 90 is a good example that even overdosed in it, it is not lethal. Moving on, Chad Doherty . I understand that he was arrested for -- the Scranton Police Officer was arrested for drunk driving . He admitted when he was pulled over that he would not pass the drunk driving exam up in Dunmore . His blood alcohol content was 2.75 or over three times the legal limit. Is this man not only suspend ed but suspended without pay because if he is suspended with pay, that is an absolute travesty . He has violated his shield. He has violated his oath. And he's drunk driving which is in contrast to everything that the law and a oath of office should stand for. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 I understand that he has a legal right to fight this in court and go for his innocence with an attorney . But that does not -- should not allow him to continue to collect pay during that period of time. He's going to get paid retroactively if he wins anyway. So why not take it away from him now as a punishment and it may be. I don't know what the situation is because a lot of times this isn't discussed . But it's a serious issue when someone is driving around at three times the legal limit. I looked at the funds that you talked about last week. I would like City Council to push forward for the nonprofits from the American 's fund. I would really like you to push forward as fast as possible since nonprofits are included in there, food banks. There is a critical need now with hunger in this City with increased prices for food to cut some of that money out for those nonprofit s and not hold it and get it out to those organizations who provided food all through this COVID impact as well as now the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 continual financial burden of increased prices. We need to take care of our population and this is an opportunity to get our foot forward , stand out there and support the groups who support the people in this City. We have the money. It's sitting there. Some of it should go right off the top as soon as possible . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Have a good night. Next on the list is Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Last week when I was watching Council , Mr. Donahue , I was very pleased to see that you read a letter from a person that wrote in saying they appreciated the work that the DPW did on Boulevard Avenue. But what really stuck out to me was Mr. King when he had anything to say in motions , he said nothing . Now, people should be aware that Mr. King is the liaison between the DPW and City Council . And he sat there and said nothing . Then when I got home after what you said Mr. Donahue about the recycling on Saturday at Scranton High School, my neighbors 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 happened to call me and said they went there and they said it was wonderful . I know you didn't do this intentionally but it should have been mentioned because I didn't know myself. The DPW, the DPW alone were the ones that organized that Recycling Program at Scranton High School that was very successful . Nobody else has ever done that in the DPW before. So I really think that they should have got credit. And, Mr. King, I think you should have been aware of that. And I think you should have said something about it. And I do think what you're not saying is intention al unlike Mr. Donahue . Now, the other things I want to bring up, Mr. McAndrew and Mr. Schuster , I absolutely feel you are obstructionist s for the City. You go out of your way to tear everything apart that the City administration is doing and the Mayor any chance you get, same with the DPW. And I'm going to point out some of these things tonight . I want the people at home to know what you're doing. I don't know why you're doing it. But you're doing it deliberately to spread misinformation to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 people believe what you say is possibly true and it isn't. So I would like you to clear things up when you find out the facts about what you're speaking of to state the facts to the people because right how you're implying that the City and the DPW are not doing their work. And that's wrong. You're the examples . Mr. McAndrew , you keep going week after week saying you want to know who the person was that dropped the ball on Knowles Insurance for the City. That is not important . If you read the paper and you listened to what the Mayor said, she said it doesn't matter who did it. She took care of it. Everything is straightened out. The work is done. But you can't let it go. You have to keep on hammering and hammering asking Mr. Voldenberg to find out who is the person that dropped the ball. Why would you do this, I have no idea, just to make the Mayor look bad. And then Clearview Street, the DPW something to do with a truck I guess from way back. But you keep asking Mr. Voldenberg to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 find out about Clearview Street to make the DPW look bad. I would like you to tell the people when you find anything out what the truth is on that because what you're imply is they didn't do their job. And I don't believe that's true. Do you remember Lenny Srebro? He would come here for years complain ing because the water was getting in his basement . Did you ever do anything about it? No. But you know what, for years he came here. Dennis Gallagher was the DPW Director . He did nothing . All of a sudden, Mr. Preambo and his crew, they hired an engineer and they went there. They put a new pipe in. And now Mr. Srebro's property is fine. Everything is fixed finally . Nothing was ever done under Danny Gallagher except raise the taxes for the people from his gas card fiasco. So and then I'm finding out when I go to my daughter 's house on West Mountain Road, DPW is trimming all the trees. Nobody gives any credit to them. Nobody even seems to know what they're doing. If I didn't go out every day and see this myself -- and then on Clover Field, they cut all the trees there, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 North Scranton -- North South Road. And nobody is saying anything . I just think the misinformation you have is terrible . And I think you better get your act together and stop going after the Mayor and stop going after DPW. And when you find out the information you keep asking for, let the people know the truth, not the lies that you're implying. You are absolutely against the City. You shouldn 't even be on Council . And as far as you, Mr. King, you should get your act together and find out what the DPW is doing. Dr. Rothchild , she's always talking about OECD. She's always informing the people what's going on there. But you certainly don't. I think between you and Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew , you better stop doing this. It's not fair. It's not right. And it has to stop. And if you have anything to say to me in motions about this, I'll be back next week if what you're saying is more lies. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Miss Franus. Next up is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I'm sorry, Council , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 thought Marie was going to speak. I mess up like always. Council , in today's extreme leftist liberal excuse for our local newspaper , the editor once again 100 percent outdid themselves in the deliberate misleading opinion article devoid of the actual facts of the subject matter the Title 42 policies . I know most of you should be familiar . This denied the sick disease to the world entry into what once was America . We need this more now than they did Ellis Island years ago. This little article that was in the paper last week states that the border cities are waiting for influx of 1.7 million illegals . These people were expelled because of severe sickness and health problems . May 23rd they are going to be allowed to come in. Can you just imagine the impact this is going to have on our social and medical enterprises in this country ? Right now Americans don't get healthcare they need. And this administration is -- they're throwing the average American under the bus for illegals . It's just senseless . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 These people will never assimilate to being Americans . They want America to look like the countries they come from. Almost every night on television there's ads for donations needed for our veterans for housing wheelchairs and so forth. This is absolutely disgusting, people. This is terrible . These people shouldn 't ever be in want for anything , them and their families , especially the families where there was a loss of leadership from them. And I've been to the hospital -- the Veteran 's Hospital . Some of you all need to go and see money that's needed over there is being spent on hotels for illegal s, food and clothes and all for illegals . We already have 2 million coming in, then 1.7 sick ones coming in and there is 20 million that are already been here. There is something wrong here people, something drastically wrong. And it's our president . In my opinion any Jew and any Italian that votes Democrat just needs their head examined with a Congress of anti-Semite anti-American people that are dragging the president around by his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 nose. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good even Council , Dave Dobrzyn resident . With some of the stuff we heard about the president , I'd like to remind everybody that our last president emboldened and befriended none other than that commie rat Poopski. And I have some news for him. He thinks he's an orthodox christian , well, if he ever told Jesus his problems , Jesus would probably slap him in the face and tell him to go to hell as far as I'm concerned . So here's a to-do list. (Inaudible ) tanks of Russian origin, antiaircraft long range, surface to air missiles -- surface to surface missiles long range, ATVs, and all the ordinates they need for ATVs for fast raids, and recording equipment and possibly DVDs to be smuggled into Russia so somebody could see the truth. Now, if you want to call your Congress men -- and this number you will get the Congress man you ask for. And Matt Cartwright , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 I did manage to talk to them, 1-202-225-3121. They will ask you who you wish to speak to. And as far as Joe Biden, well, he's not as fast as what he used to be. But I think a lot people that come in here better consider what Trump's plans were for social security . We're going to have about 15,000 people roaming around town homeless or retirees because he was out to destroy it. And I forgot my reading glasses tonight . So next, vaccinations . Somebody was here speaking tonight riding around in a truck protesting about antivax and antimask. Well, I have three comorbidities so I'll keep this mask on. Thank you. I don't want to breathe the same air as they do. And I'd love to hear the Lung Association come in. They were complaining about people smoking cigarettes 50 feet away from somebody else years ago. How about discussing all the problems that people have with their lungs and along COVID after they contract it. It's totally legal no matter what. You could go roaming around even though you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 know you're not vaxed or whatever and not -- refusing to wear masks. And then, you know, that's freedom . Freedom , oh, gee, I'm so overjoyed for that freedom . And voting rights, the federal judge in Wisconsin overturned collection boxes for mail-in ballots . You have to drop them in the mail. And it just keeps going on and on one state after another . And it is in Pennsylvania too. So it is an issue here. So we better stand our ground with voting rights. If you -- you don't have the right to vote, you're nothing but a slave. You're a slave to the people that have that right. They could do whatever they want and vote whatever way they want and ill-advised way they want. And, you know, if it don't work out for you, isn't that just too bad. And as far as the school district , I'd like to remind everybody that we were shorted by a Republican Governor by 30 million dollars a year by -- they were suppose d to replace it because of low incomes in the area and also the City. We get nothing or very little from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 the state or we get to compete for it. Isn't that wonderful . My life isn't a football game and neither is yours. Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. You too. That exhausts our sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening, Marie Schumacher . I would like to suggest you people need to get together and come up with some -- what the priorities are for this City, like the top three. I really would like to have each of you put your top three down and pick them up and see how much they correlate and how much they don't. I just about came unglued when I brought the paper in this morning and looked at the front page. And we're going to go -- our priorities are just so far apart from what's needed and what is fluff. And, I mean, art is nice. I don't know anything about the office. It's not anything that has to do with the show itself. However , I do come out of the mall on the North Washington side. And you look up at that wall and it's terrible . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 And it's a long red light. And then you go around the corner to come over the Spruce Street bridge and what do you have? You have that terrible wall that if it doesn't fall down from the cracks -- let alone just the way it looks and get painted . I mean, the fact that we would do that kind of a thing on a building . I know the building -- the owner might like it. I don't know. But that wall really needs help. And I think we should start spending our money on what our top priorities are and stop what I would say wasting money. I thought , you know, I thought downtown was improving . And all I do is drive through it. But I did go to the hearing on the bus contract at the school board which was 10 hours of sadness . But I walked from the Lackawanna Avenue -- I cross Lackawanna Avenue by the Dry Goods. You look at the Dry Goods, you know, while you're walking and it looks totally empty except for some scaffolding that's being put up on one floor. Then you go next door and you've got the always busy not really Lewis and Reilly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 store. I used to buy shoes there. And it's not only empty, but they have stuff -- well, one day I was there and they had nothing but pallets stacked up in front of it. But they have curtains of some kind so you can't see how bad it is inside because it looks like it's being used for storage . And stuff is just laying against the thing -- the window and it just looks terrible . And then you go next door and finally there's a building , a bank on one side and jeweler on the other side. And it's a little encouraging . And then you go next door and there's a big building that is available for corporate headquarters or anything else I would imagine . And it's got shrubs in front. And some of the shrubs are dead, some are half dead, some are alive. And there's weeds this tall standing up from them. It looks terrible . Then there's an opening . And then you go -- you look down there and there's pallets and there's a wooden horse, just junk thrown in there. It doesn't look good either. Then you go by and another nice building across the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 street Noteology and then another a couple -- more empty building s. And then you get to the court and cross the court and you look down the street and -- the court and there's all kinds of stuff there. There's cardboard boxes and all kinds of stuff, just litter. And then you go by FNCB and then you go by Rite Aid. And there's a big pile of dog poop in the middle of the sidewalk . There was also -- that was also there when I came back except it was a lot flatter. But then you go back down Wyoming Avenue and you've got empty building , empty building , the county government , three more empty buildings that don't look very inviting . And then there's a bank that is available for purchase . It is very depressing . And I think we have to start doing something else because what we're doing is not working I don't think. My time is up. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few quick comments . I appreciate Mrs. Franus mentioning the DPW again this evening . I would like to mention that I've been here three months and at least twice publicly I have praised the DPW for the work that they've done after storms and various other times. I distinct ly remember the weekend of the parade and the work that they did setting up the City and cleaning afterwards . And that's a matter of public record. Obviously our City Council President praised our DPW. Perhaps , I should have jumped on and praised them as well that evening . But to think or say that I don't appreciate our DPW, our Scranton Police Department , our Fire Department is nothing but a misnomer . I ran for City Council because I believe in the City. I'm here to support the City and do what I can to make the City a better place. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Recently -- I'm constantly in contact with Mr. Preambo . I met with him for over an hour and a half down at the DPW. I recently reached out to him about I had a citizen have a concern and Mr. Preambo and DPW addressed that concern , did a great job. And I got a great text from that citizen or individual and I forward ed it to Mr. Preambo and told him to make sure he shared that with the staff at the DPW. So to think that I don't support or I don't appreciate what our DPW does for the City is just wrong because I truly do appreciate and I continue to work with DPW and support everything that they do. So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. All right. So we received an e-mail the other day. And it's the 500 block of Myrtle Street and also receive d a picture along with it. I think we all got it. I don't know if you saw it. There's a boat that's been sitting there on a trailer for a couple years. And there's a lot of rubbish around it. So can we please send some correspondence over to LIPS Department ? You got the e-mail. Forward it to them so they could see if they could take care of this issue, Mr. Voldenberg . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : That was sent, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Secondly, the old CVS building over on Main Avenue in West Side, I know that they applied for a liquor license . I know that's an issue with some folks and they are working on that, the residents . But we had a couple complaint s by the residents that came to me and said that, you know, they're calling places. They don't know who the owner is but there's issues when there was snow and ice. That's over with. It was never taken care of.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 But now there's a bunch of broken beer bottles. So can you please find out who the actual owner is now? I know it's out of CVS's hands. Maybe, you know, they need to be contacted about being a good neighbor there until, you know, whatever they do with the building . There is still some issues with rubbish and broken beer bottles. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then, okay, let's talk about Clearview Street since it came up. So Clearview Street about a year and a half ago -- I'm not a DPW basher. I love what they do. I support what they do. I don't like words being put in my mouth. That's why I'm talking about it. I'm going to clear it up right now. So the incident that happened was a garbage truck was going up the street and a hose with hydraulic fluid on the truck burst and sprayed the houses and yards. So with that said, it was an issue. There's no resolve yet. I will report out I'm finally getting some headway with the new assistant -- or the acting solicitor . He got back in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 speedy fashion , which I'm thrilled . He got me some information . I want more on behalf of the residents because , you know, if this happened in front of Miss Franus's house, I would be here doing the same thing for her. We work at the pleasure of the taxpayer , all taxpayers . And this is no means an attack on DPW. This was a hose that burst on a truck. But these resident s want some resolve and that's why I keep bringing it up. All right. I'll be happy to report out when I get more information . I've only got a little bit. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just briefly , I did pass along some quality of life issues to Mr. Voldenberg today that will be on our list last week -- list in our agenda next week. A couple other issues that were brought to my attention in the past week, one was regarding parking on the 700 block of Prescott and also on Pine Street by the Dollar store. A resident reached out and said that other residents are using cones and garbage cans to save parking places every day. They have attached photos. Some places have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 apartment s with six or more cars. There is only so much parking . And then the ones that put cans in the street or parking cones in spots, that is illegal . And they go onto say it's frustrating since they are handicap ped and struggling with the City to get handicap ped parking because they have a garage. Mr. Voldenberg , will you please reach out to the police department on this issue? I'll give you this e-mail after the meeting tonight . DR. ROTHCHILD : Pardon me, Councilman Donahue , that's the street that we've previous ly reached out to SPD about three times now. And we have yet to receive any response . MR. DONAHUE : I do vaguely remember that now because this is from the end of March too. So let's get an update. DR. ROTHCHILD : Three times and we haven't received an update yet or, you know, whether or not the properties have been ticketed, whoever is placing them. I pass by it every single day. So we definitely need to get this taken care of. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I agree. Thank you. Also, another issue regarding a water issue at Hill Top Manner in South Side, the resident states that whether they have severe rain or not there is a -- there is drainage from a section of the Hill Top apartments which is basically a hose out of a basement window that dumps enormous amounts of water onto South Webster Avenue and then down Campbell Street. And they go onto say in the course of the flow, some comes into the home yards and down the hill into backyard s on Campbell Street. They've reached out to the manager of the Hill Top apartment s. And after looking into the situation , says there is nothing they could do to fix the problem . The reasoning they gave was, old building , old pipes and it needs to be drained . So, Mr. Voldenberg , would we also be able to reach out to someone with the Housing Authority to look into this issue? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Just regarding -- and just briefly regarding the caucus we had before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Chief Judge came in to give us another presentation regarding SAFER grants, I've said this over and over again; but when you look at compare -- when you look at Scranton and compares to other comparable cities especially on budget line items, we overspend on police and fire and we underspend on everything else. I understand , you know, part of where the Chief's coming from in terms of overtime costs. But again, that is a management issue. So again, I was against this back in December . And I'm still going to be against this for the basic reason that there's too many unknown s. There's too many ifs. We're adding legacy costs. The numbers are based off the current CBA and not any renegotiated CBA that is currently in negotiations . Also, you know, even Chief Judge said if we kept the 10 additional firefighter s on at year four without receiving an additional grant and without furloughing any of them, that would be over a million dollars a year. And, I mean, that money could be better spent in code enforce ment, in paving our streets , upgrading our parks. So I just want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 to reiterate that I, you know, although I appreciate , you know, the Chief's position , I am still firmly against accepting any SAFER grant money in terms of adding 10 firefighter s. And that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AMENDING RES. NO. 229, 2021 ENTITLED “RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE CITY OF SCRANTON APPLICATION FOR A PEER GRANT FROM THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND (TPL) IN THE AMOUNT OF $10,000.00 FOR A PARKS/TRAILS ACCESSIBILITY STUDY AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, COORDINATE AND DISBURSE THE GRANT FUNDS AS APPROPRIATE ” TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 believe that the study would be worthwhile . Of course, we have the study about the parks and updates that are needed there. But this is going to help with the accessibility to the parks, so how we get there. And I know even from my own experience , I live by Nay Aug. Walking down my street East Gibson to the park, it is very -- it should be walkable . But it's not because there are no sidewalks for part of the way. So then you're walking in the street. And I don't feel comfortable pushing a stroller or walking my dogs in the middle of the street just to get down to the park. So I find myself driving down there, which is not what we want. We have neighborhood s with a lot of parks in them and we need them to be accessible for people to just be able to walk to. So I'm in full support of this study. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 DR.
