Next Monday, April 29, at 5:15 council will hold a public caucus with the city's recycling coordinator to discuss the city's recycling program and recent development s and changes to recycling made at the county level. There has been a lot of questions about it and to be honest a lot of confusion so they will be in here and hopefully clear a lot of that up for us. Thank you. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER.

PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments today? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly , one thing I didn't get to in our caucus I didn't get to ask Northeast Revenue , Ms. Reed, would you be able to follow-up with them and see if they could send us a breakdown of their interest and costs that they charge. The city gets the face value and the penalty , but then they collect -- also collect interest and costs on their end so just a breakdown of that. And, also, we got an update on the street sign management system that the company came in, drove streets and they are waiting for the data to be put into an online system so the city could review to go through and start getting the street signs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 changed out with the right reflexcivity, and that's all I have this evening . MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comments tonight ? MR. EVANS: Yeah, I'd like to comment briefly on NRS. NRS is the agency that collects the refuse fees for the City of Scranton so we met with them early this evening . Now, it was somewhat informative but it has not changed my mind that the whole process is broken and has been broken ever since we went to a refuse fee instead of keeping the cost embedded into our tax base as it always was prior to that, so I want to preface my remarks by saying that I'm not going to discuss the $300 fee that's currently in litigation , I'm not going to discuss if it's fair, if it's accurate , should it be more or should it be less, I'm going to talk about the process of collecting the fee. Like many of our fees and taxes, like the rental registration fee and the business privilege and mercantile tax, the refuse fee has been another example of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 historically having a poor collection response . Currently the collection rate, as we heard tonight , is approximately 75 percent . Our delinquent tax collection rate for property is around 90 percent . It seems that we are continuously chasing our tail trying to find ways to increase the collection rates and we never quite seem to keep pace as to what they actually should be, but there is something fundamentally wrong when the tax or fee is not collect ed at the rate it was designed for, either through a lack of competence , poor systems or maybe it was just a bad idea in the first place. I happen to think the refuse fee and the business privilege and mercantile tax are both bad ideas. Over the years, I think that line of thinking has been proven out over and over and over again. Now, we have plans to fix a ladder by replacing the business and privilege tax and the mercantile tax with a payroll tax hopefully by 2020. It's a broader and more fairer distribution of that revenue and far more collectible , but how do we fix the idea 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 or the collection of the refuse fee that has been broken for decades . Whenever 25 of those that should be paying are not paying the fee at all. We continue to try to mend a broken system and never achieve the results we expect. And let's not forget all of those efforts to collect this fee comes with an expense . The expense related to its general collection which includes the mailing of the bills or receiving payments at city hall. We have the expense related to the collection of the delinquencies and we have the expenses related to a poor performing recycling program because those that actually do recycle do so because they think it's the right thing. There is no incentive whatsoever for the citizens of Scranton to recycle . So what do we do? Well, first of all, we have to recognize that when something is not working as intended you make changes . The status quo is not working . So what are the options? Well, besides keeping the status quo, here are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 several options I think we might be able to address the situation or at least look at. Number one, should we fully embed the entire $300 trash fee back into the property tax bill? This should eliminate some of the expenses mentioned involved and increase the collection rate to parallel the collection rate of 90 percent on delinquent property. With this option, the city has the ultimate tool. You don't pay your taxes, you could lose your property . Number two, we could partially embed an amount in the property tax bill that could account for a baseline that would safely cover some of the expense related to trash collection while also shifting to a modest per bag fee expecting increased recycling and reduced expenses to make up the difference . This could be called a hybrid plan. And, three, we could go to a slightly higher per bag fee than option two and not embed anything additional in the tax base and save to increase recycling as well as reduce expenses to balance what is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 needed. So as I mention ed earlier , we could just stay the course and chase delinquencies and complain about the $300 fee and go around and around with the same issue year in and year out. I guess what I'd like to know is really what the majority of citizens want. We hear from citizens every week and we have a clear of what some of the citizens want, we need to know more. We need to know what people are thinking so I'd like to see a greater response on what they really want us to do with this issue. That's an opinion I think needs to go away, but I'm not endorsing any of those options at this particular moment, but what I am endorsing is a change from a broken system to a system that is more cost effective that works for all of us and is more inherently fair across the board. So hopefully we should all be interested in hearing from the public as to what they might prefer. I'm certainly interested in hearing other ideas on this issue that we may not even have thought of, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 but most of all we need to talk about this, to come together on a plan, come together on a strategy , to move forward in a world where we don't have $16 million owed to the city. We need to keep repairing -- we have to stop repeating the current mode of operation and process over and over and over again and expecting a different result. That's the definition of insanity . So we need to move ahead, come together , come up with a plan, come up with a strategy and work together to solve this thing, but I do know one thing the current process , the current systems , the current concept doesn't work. That's all I have for tonight . MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , motions or comments tonight ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Just to address I know -- I think the gentleman left, Mr. Ackerman , regarding the swimming pool at Nay Aug Park. City council , we don't have any authority over Nay Aug Park. That is the Recreation Authority so even if the majority of council were against closing that pool we really don't have any say in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that. That I think -- I don't know if they have to take a vote at the Recreation Authority , I wasn't here two or three weeks ago when Mr. Gattens and another gentleman came in -- MR. PERRY: Yeah, Mr. Gaughan , they said it was a unanimous vote. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, so there was a vote and it was unanimous , thank you, but we don't have any control over that, but I do understand his comment s. I did talk to Mr. Gattens about this. You know, the more I talk to people about this issue it would be my hope, and I don't know if it's possible , to hold off on filling in the pool until you can get funds for a splash park or whatever they want to do only because I think he is -- he has a good point in that when they do fill that pool in there is going to be a huge overcrowding issue in the smaller pool, so I think he brought up some very good points tonight . Mrs. Reed, if we could send correspondence , I know we did months and months ago but I talked to a gentleman that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 lives on Linwood Avenue, we also received an e-mail from Mr. Welby from Marty Flynn's office about this issue, but this family that lives on Linwood Avenue is having some serious storm water runoff issues. It's gotten to the point now where it's literally washing away his home and his driveway so they are afraid they are going to lose the bottom portion of their house after speaking with him this afternoon , so if we could send a correspondence to the DPW just asking them if they would address that issue. The gentleman that I talked to used to work for PennDOT . It's his belief that it wouldn't be that big of a deal to fix it. They might have to add in pipes or something to that effect so if we can send that I would appreciate it. Also, the street sweeping schedule , I know I mention ed it last week, I'll mention it again. North Scranton area, Greenbush Street to Market Street April 29 to May 3 and Market Street to Ravine Street May 6 to May 10. Last week I mentioned about alternate side of the street parking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 so that the street sweepers could actually sweep the streets . As I mention ed last week, it's very difficult to have an efficient street sweeping program when you don't have a plan like that in place because when people are parked in front of their homes it's impossible to actually get to the curb. So we didn't receive a response . I doubt that anything is going to be done this year, but moving forward as I mentioned last week, and I actually got some responses from people who watched the meeting last week who agreed, it makes no sense to have a street sweeping program without some type of alternate side of the street parking whether it's, you know, on a trial basis, tried in the neighbor hood, I don't know, but there are many cities throughout Pennsylvania and throughout the United States that successfully have an alternate side of the street program for their street sweeping operation . Also, I received a note from a gentleman , something interesting that I want to bring up, and I want to forward this to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the mayor and the administration . There was a -- mayors throughout the area, and this actually goes along with earth day and the two people that spoke earlier , the articles from the Pocono Record, and it says, "Mayors Commit to Future of Solar Energy" and I think down in Stroudsburg the mayor was able to acquire through an LSA grant a solar powdered trash compactor . This comes from Waste Management , it's solar powdered , it helps keep public spaces clean and it can reduce trash collection s by up to 80 percent . But I think a few weeks ago when they had the conversation about renovating city hall, I really think we need to move in the direction of having a major citywide green initiative to reduce costs and to become more efficient . One of the ways we can do that is looking at our DPW and some of the aspects there. So, Mrs. Reed, I would like to forward this article and there is actually two articles here to the mayor and the DPW director to see if they would be interested 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 in doing that. Also, sent a letter last week to the mayor about the Ethics Board. I think all five members of council objected to the mayor's pick, although , we didn't vote on it the mayor sent us a little, Dennis D'Agostine , who is the chaplain for the Fire Department . Unfortunately , I'm sure Mr. D'Agostine would have did a great job, wasn't questioning that last week, but it does violate , as our solicitor pointed out in a letter to the city solicitor , it violates the ethics legislation that you cannot be on the Ethics Board if you are a member of any city committee . I did pose a letter to the mayor though last week simply asking if he is advertising for these positions for the two picks that he has and is he publically soliciting resumes and applications . We are going on weeks now with -- we have our two picks, the city control ler has a pick, we are still waiting on the mayor. So, you know, unless the mayor is advertising for these positions and soliciting these resumes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 and application s as council did I think it's going to be difficult to find two people. I think you should open it up publically and then see who submits a resume and application . I think that only makes sense. On the public caucus, I think it was underwhelming myself. I do appreciate the city solicitor coming and Mr. Beck and the representatives from NRS. As I mention ed in the caucus, if I don't pay my Comcast bill they shut my cable off. If they don't put a lien on my house then I still get to watch TV. If i don't pay my electric bill, they shut my lights off. If I don't pay my gas bill they shut my heat off. So at what point, and I posed this in the caucus, at what point, like, what is the incentive for anyone to pay this trash fee? 75 percent of the civic minded people in this city are paying $300 and you have a quarter of the population who is kind of thumbing their noses. Now, I know that there are some cases where people fall on hard times, they can't come up with the money, that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 understandable , but if you go through that list, as Mr. Evans pointed out, and you see out-of-town landlords like the one from New York who owes 120 some thousand dollars how are they allowed to still do business in this city? So, again, if I'm Jane Smith and I'm 80 years old and I'm paying $300 a year and I look at this list of people who are not paying why should I pay? Put a lien on my house. Big deal. There has to be something else. One of the of the ideas that was brought up was not picking up the garbage . I don't think that's a terrible idea. As I mentioned last week when Mrs. Franus brought it up, I would need to see a detailed plan from the administration on how they would enforce that. Will there be garbage all over the place? I don't know, but I'll tell you what, it's an incentive for people to pay the fee if you are not going to get your garbage picked up. The city has to get serious about this. So I would, Mrs. Reed, to send a letter to the mayor because I think we need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 leadership on this issue from Mayor Courtright on, number one, whether or not he is going to reevaluate the contract with NRS and whether we are going to continue with NRS. The contract re-ups every year. They've had is since 2012. I mean, when is that going to give? You know, we are questioning it tonight but is that just going to continue to have the refuse, they have the tax delinquent real estate taxes and they have the rental registration , so that's a concern . The other thing I would like to know from the mayor is and, you know, the administration here tonight answered it, you know, somewhat, what is the plan? Are we just going to continue to lien properties and as Councilman Evans said run in circles and just keep doing the same thing over and over again? Because if we do that it's a slap in the face to all of the 75 percent of the people like Mr. Spindler and Mrs. Schumacher and others who pay the $300 every year. So I am more than willing and I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 my colleagues are more than willing to working tonight with the mayor and administration but something has to change and I think the first thing we should do is reevaluate the contract with NRS. One of the things I brought up tonight , questions I brought up was whether or not we can bring it inhouse and take out the middleman . In other words, why can't the Treasury Department do that work? If we have to hire two or three more people let's see a plan from the mayor and maybe that's an alternative that we go with. I mean, what's the incentive for NRS to collect the trash fee? They just sit back, I had this conversation with Councilman Donahue today and they tack on penalties and interest and that's it and they wait. Maybe they pay, maybe they don't, but again, there is no, no, no, incentive . If you can't pay a $300 fine garbage fee and you owe $40,000 lien my house. What do I care for if you lien my house? I'm probably not going to sell it anyway? So I think that's what people on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the street and the city are saying. At least that's what they're saying to me and I'm sure to some of my colleagues . So is this a complex problem ? Yes. When the newspaper did an analysis , when the fee went from 178 to 300 that's when the delinquencies went up so I think that has a part of it, too, and of course the lawsuit has come into play as well. But we do need leadership from the administration and I do think that something has got to give and we need to change because if we are not going to enforce it and we are not going to take it serious then Mrs. Hodowanitz brought up a great point, when the storm water fee comes why pay that. Why pay it? I mean, you are going to put a lien on my house? Big deal. So we have got to get serious about it. Otherwise , we are going to run in circles and, you know, it's not fair to the 75 percent that pay it. That's my spiel for this week. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . Yeah, I have a couple of things, the first thing Mr. Spindler brought up that missing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 curbing on Dorothy Street if we could have Director Gallagher take a look at it, I'm not sure, I'm not really familiar with that cut out that you are speaking of, but I'm sure it's there if you can just take a drive-by or send somebody up there and see if it's an easy fix or just putting in some asphalt curbing and just easing that little ponding issue and flooding over there that would be fantastic. As far as the garbage , I'm going to echo what everybody said up here already , but I'll give you some of my personal opinions , maybe go a little bit deeper on that. I want to thank the city treasurer and solicitor and Northeast Revenue Service for coming in today, but, you know, this issue there is two problems right now what's going on. It's trying to collect what hasn't been collected already and how are we going to get better and collecting in the future. You know, we are at that zero point in the graph right now where we have a lot of catching up to do and if we don't fix our problem we are never going to get better at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 it in the future. I believe it was Mr. Evans talking about embedding that into the property tax. That is something I am absolutely 100 percent for. There is a couple of different ways to go about it. I think we talked about the hybrid program a little bit, I think that would just put more undo pressure to go buy bags and to put those out. While that would help generate recycling in the area, one of the better programs or better part of the programs that we have in the City of Scranton with our garbage collection is we can pretty much put out whatever we want, the garbage men will take it. That's a luxury that we have. We are paying for it right now, but it's a luxury that we have and if we can get more people to pay that same piece of the pie instead of having less pay more mentality like sometimes the City of Scranton has we would be much, much better off and that's something I would like to see is it getting embedded into the property tax where it has more teeth because right now this lien system is a joke. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 just on there and it's forgotten about and that's it. And I have no faith in the lien system. We brought this up during the caucus. If does protect our interest but what interest ? It doesn't protect our interest this year, it doesn't protect it next year, it protects them down the road when all else fails and the roof falls in and they sell their house or pass away or whatever then that money once the property changes hands then we'll recoup some of that. Where we will be then? What other issues will we have? You know, right now we have roads that need to be paved and we have a building that needs to be repaired and we have things to do and we need some more -- we need some harder and faster answers for this. Something I'm for of going back I brought up, I know, Mr. Spindler , you and I are kind on the opposite sides of the fence on this, but I think we need to get some of these people who owe some big bills to start paying, start getting on a monthly program 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 and if they are on that monthly program I'm willing to negotiate with them on what bad debt they have that might be alleviated . We are not talking about somebody that owes $500 or $600, but if someone owes our city $60,000 I'm willing to take $45,000 off of them instead of just letting that collect and collect and collect because to me that's ghost money. You know, that's bad debt, that's money -- how are we going to get that? So if there is the way to find it that's what I would like to do. You know, and I think Mr. Gaughan touched on this, I lost my confidence in Northeast Revenue . I am not saying they are not a competent company , they are not the best that we can do for a city. We are the customer . They are not the customer , we are the customer . I think we should be auditioning people to do this. There are other companies that do this. If they were a credit card company they would out of business because they are not doing enough to protect their interests so I would like to see bids opened up. This is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 year-by-year contract which gets renewed year by year and I think we should take a serious look. I think inhouse is an excellent idea. I think Mr. Beck should be -- he should be in on this. He should put together his ideas of what it would take for our department to do it inhouse as well as we can find third party people that -- people that are more successful in doing this and let's hear from them, have them sit down, what are some actions? When are the last time you had debts this far back and this tough to collect what did you do and what is your record and how did it outcome and how it did it benefit your customer ? You know, let's ask those questions , let's get different people in here, let's get them bidding on themselves to get our services because that's what we have right now. We have a great service and that is our garbage fee and they should be fighting to get it not be complacent and not doing they should be doing and that's not collecting the fee. I'll get off my soapbox there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 I try to keep personal and business aside, but I'll do a little personal tonight . Tonight is my wife's birthday and I just want to say happy birthday to her. As most of you know, she was in the fight of her life last year and this is her very first birthday after ringing the bell at the cancer center and this is her first year that she is actually having a birthday that she is cancer free and I'm just so proud of her, all of the hard work she did. It was a struggle for her and God bless here she is stronger than I could ever hope to be and I just want to -- you know, she watches every Monday, you know, sometimes watches and I come home -- "Why do you go back every Monday? You get yelled at all of the time." And it's because we love it. We love to help and sometimes we take our licks but that's fine, that's what city government is and we do our very best I can tell you that, and I just want to tell you, Lori, I love you and thank you for everything and I'll see you soon. That's all I have tonight .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MS. REED: 5-B.
