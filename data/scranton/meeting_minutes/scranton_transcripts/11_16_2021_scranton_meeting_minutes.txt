MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. We going to read the proclamation now into the record to honor Mr. Castaldi who as everyone here knows is a legend, not just in Minooka but especially Minooka , but in the City of Scranton .

And St. Francis of Assisi said one time: Men lose all the material things they leave behind them in this world, but they carry with them the reward of their charity and the alms they give. For these, they will receive from the Lord and the reward and recompense they deserve . And you deserve a lot. Thank you. Thank you everyone . (Work session continues .)

DONAHUE : First on the sign-in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 sheet is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . What's the status of the 2020 audit? MR. DONAHUE : We still have not receive d it. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I learned today that the police, fire, and DPW union contracts are still in negotiation and possibility that they may not be resolved by the end of the year when they expire and then go into arbitration , which leads me to my unhappy conclusion that we're trying to prepare a 2022 operating budget without a benefit of an audit and also without firm numbers for future union contract s when you must keep in mind that the majority of the operating budget is personnel costs. So I don't know how you get there from here. Another comment is, I downloaded the document and printed it out this morning , didn't have much time to look at it because I focused on PEL. But in my opinion , no insult intended, this document is not ready for prime time. There are numerous -- and from just an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 hour or two of casual glancing through it, numerous errors. It screams for footnoting to explain obvious issues. Previous budgets had gone department by department explaining changes in funding and changes in revenue or expenses or staffing . This doesn't do that. There is at the end a list of the 13 proposed hires and a short description of what -- why they're being hired. What you really need is a fully documented job description . One of the position s, archivist in the clerk's office and it consists of four words, modernize city document procedures or processes , you know, I mean, so you're going to pay somebody nearly $37,000. Are they going to digitize records? Are they going to retrieve information from the basement , subbasement ? What are they going to do? Why do we need them? You know, we're trying to commit to hire people and I don't know that we have a firm vision of what they're going to do. And there should also be measurable standard s that they meet. You want them to digitize records . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 How many do they do in a month or in a week, so on and so forth. I was a little disappoint ed. I was also disappointed that I was the only member of the public I think that went to the PEL caucus this afternoon . And I hope people take the time to download the PEL document . It's 20-some pages. The good news is we're coming out of distressed City status most likely. PEL has recommended that. The bad news is, you know, we shouldn 't be popping champagne corks quite yet. You have a situation where City expenditure s are increasing more than 2 percent every year. But we don't have an equivalent increase in revenues . Even if the county approves reassessment , reassessment won't take effect for another five-plus years. So Mr. Cross has recommended that between 2024 and 2026, we increase property tax millage by 20.6 percent just to keep our heads above water. So, you know, we may be out of distress ed status but, you know, we certainly aren't on very firm ground five years down the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 road. With regard to 5-C, the Rubicon Global contract , if you can find out, it will be nice to know exactly how much money this contract is going to save the City. They talk about making you now having faster more efficient recycling management . How does that translate into dollars ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. And that's something I'm sure we'll touch on at Thursday 's work session with the DPW Director and Parks directors. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Next up is Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . I'm going to bring up something first off here. And I want to read it out a little. It's the Rules of Council : No person including members of Council shall use their time during citizens participation to personally insult or attack any individual , name calling , profanity , racial or ethnic slurs or any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose in attempt of conducting official business shall not be permitted including 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 freedom of speech. I'm going to read an order that was back in '04 before the Court before Judge Mazzoni . It was filed. And basically it's a complaint and petition challenging the City of Scranton Resolution No. 80, 2002 passed on July 22, 2002, which in part amended Article 5 entitled Regulations in Council . In essence , regulation number 80 amended Article V, Section 180 to limit citizen participation , exclusively on items contained on Council 's agenda for the meeting . In regard to the petition for temporary injunctive relief, a hearing was conduct ed on August 9th, 2002. By order dated September 9th, 2002, this Court granted Bolus and others preliminary injunctive relief. This Court preliminarily enjoined the Defendant s from making the new resolution further ordered. The parameters of public participation and any and/or comment shall continue to be guided by the Pennsylvania Sunshine Act 65 BS, 701, Article 5, Section 1B of the City Rules of Council meetings and the City's Home Rule Charter . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 In other -- the captioned matter is still pending . There was other things that were filed. What this brings up is what happened with Mr. Morgan here last week. Gaughan went on an attack on him while he was here participating in citizens participation . What it means when we come here for centuries , this is what forums were for, for the debate to be able to speak, put your message out what you feel or somebody should feel. You should not be curtailed or criticized or name calling as Mr. Gaughan has done to me. And there's a federal suit against him. Mr. Morgan last week came here and was ruled out of order. How are you ruled out of order when you're here addressing Council on issues that you feel are there and you're being dictate d to that you want to say you shouldn 't say. So that's the issue I wanted to bring up tonight . The other part is, you need to remove the Biden signs. It's an embarrassment to all of us. They should have never been there. He has a street in Green 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Ridge. That was more than sufficient . You need to go back to where we were. Keep in mind, Joe Biden has blood on his hands. He was involved in murdering men, women, seven children by incinerating them and then lying about it. It's an embarrassment . I mean, it's pathetic . This should be put on a referendum and let the people vote for the street signs. We should have a say on this, not five Council members and the Mayor. This is our City. You people are employed by us to follow our will as well and to do what you did here is wrong. You did hurt people financially on Spruce Street. It's made a laughingstock of us as people across the interstates that aren't from this area and see what's going on. He left billions of dollars there so they could shoot our people and kill them. He killed 13 of my fellow veterans. Many were maimed, came home for life but you don't hear a word about it. So this is the guy you're honoring and it can't be. And one of the other issues I had here is with Jessica here. I've asked that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 she put behind her name by law identifying her as a physical therapist . She could call herself doctor. ATTY. HAYES: (Inaudible .) MR. BOLUS: Pardon? ATTY. HAYES: -- personally attacking . MR. BOLUS: I'm not attacking . I'm simply saying something -- ATTY. HAYES: I find it interesting that the one Council person you always target is a female. MR. BOLUS: Attorney Hayes -- Attorney Hayes, I have a right to speak. I brought this up in the past Jessica is naming herself as doctor. I have every right to (inaudible ) -- physicians or MDs, surgeon s. Alls I simply ask that she identify herself as a plastic surgeon , a surgeon , whatever she may be. She's a physical therapist . ATTY. HAYES: She's earned the right to call herself doctor. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. ATTY. HAYES: She has every right to be called a doctor. She's recognized as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 doctor in her field. MR. BOLUS: Mr. Hayes, I recognize her as a doctor. She could be called a doctor. I'm simply bringing up the issue -- ATTY. HAYES: You need new material . MR. BOLUS: -- that she needs to identify herself what type of doctor she is by law. You're an attorney . You should know that. ATTY. HAYES: You're out of order. MR. BOLUS: Thank you, gentlemen . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next up is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council . You know, I did pull up that case that Mr. Bolus is talking about. I stopped there. But I just -- I'd just like to say here tonight that, you know, the First Amendment states that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech. Now, those laws cover state government and local government . And the sad part is that when you have hired a solicitor who doesn't understand the rights of citizens in this chamber , you have a real problem on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 your hands and when you have a Council President or Council members in general that didn't object to the actions of the President and you don't understand what freedom of speech is and what rights every American has, we have a real very serious problem here. You know, tonight I sat and I listened to the Mayor talk about some things. And one thing came to my -- the forefront of my thought s when she brought up the Scranton Redevelopment Authority . Study that some day and see what they did to the -- I guess, you know, people of colors, neighborhood s in this City. They ripped them all down and used the power of government to cause, in my opinion , great harm to residents of this City because what it did was, it destroyed their neighborhood s. You know, we have to be very careful the power that we harness in the name of government because government is a very dangerous animal and can be used as a weapon. Now, it's time for the resident s of this City to understand one thing because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 somebody brought up the PEL. This City was never designed to come out of distressed intact, in my opinion . Okay, it was designed to come out of distressed bankrupt , devoid of all its assets just like it has. And the only solution for the residents of this City is to rewrite the Home Rule Charter so that the City can't make a budget without an audit; so that what the government can do and what it can't do, okay. We talk about all these quality of life and everything else. Look it, people have to be able to afford to live here. And the residents of this City have to realize that they have an obligation to participate and not to allow government to dictate to them how they're going to live their life in every aspect. They've got to not be servants of government . They have to be free people. You know, when we look at our government , our government wasn't given to us by the British or by the Greeks or Romans. That's not where our government came from. It came from the people that were here when our ancestors landed here.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Look at Massachusetts and look at how the son of the Governor of Massachusetts , Hooker, created Connecticut and look at how the founder s of this nation looked at the Native Americans who really set this country on its feet. It didn't come from Greece or Rome because the people who came from Europe had no idea what freedom even was. They were serfs to the king, okay? And that's why when you look at our form of government, the people voted for it. It wasn't given to us by our government because we learned something from the Native American s who walked this land before our ancestors came here. And it's time to really reflect on that as a free people. And the people in this City have to realize one thing. We have to write a new charter . And we have to create a government that represent s us, the people. And it's good to talk about money. And it's good to talk about borrowing . But look it, it hasn't worked. And the government itself, the Council members and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Mayor should support this and not force people to go out and get signature s because as the people that are running this government, you should want to include people in the restructuring of this government so that this City can begin to grow again. Okay, we -- you can't just bring poverty here and think you're going to create paradise . The people have to feel they're part of the system and they have to contribute and you have to help. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next up is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council , Ronnie Ellman. I'm going to forego my usual unpleasant remarks tonight . I want to talk about a real dangerous part of my neighborhood from about Parker Street to the Toyota dealer. North Main Avenue is a racetrack. There's cars 24/7 going 60, 80 miles an hour and that's no exaggeration . On the corner of Wells, there's a slight curve. They put in probably half a dozen telephone poles on that very corner cars are going so fast. One of them went through two or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 three yards and hit a house a couple years ago. When you're on my side of the street at Wells, the School bus picks up a bunch of little kids, children . Last year I don't know what they did. They tore up the whole street. They told me they're putting a pipe under the North Main to the other side. But they tore up a sidewalk which, you know, a sidewalk 6 inches or so. Now it's just a little place they paved and cars go down it often. I'm talking about where the sidewalk is and the children are there. There needs to be a stop sign at the corner of Wells. Across the street's a big parking lot from the tent factory. But there's going to be another injury or something there the way the children cross the street. They run like hell from the other side of the street. On one side of the street where the curve is, sometimes the cars they're going so fast they clip a good section . You could see tire marks probably 2 feet off the road onto the sidewalk. There used to be a sign there. They knocked it down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 last year. Right across the street was where Mr. Minicozzi was killed last month by a speeding car. I don't know why there's no charges . He was standing about 2 feet from the sidewalk . And there's marks. There's orange marks there where he was standing . The car that hit him never put on its brakes. Its front wheel was just inches from the sidewalk . He got hit in the, like, inside the headlight . The car didn't stop until it got almost a couple hundred feet up the street. I've talked to people about the speeding cars. They told me this is a county road. I phoned the county. They said the City is responsible . This isn't a police matter. I've seen plenty of police cars, you know. It just needs to have some stop signs there because it's a danger waiting to happen. The children , they just don't seem to observe traffic laws like they should be taught at school or something . And then we got all of these immature imbeciles on their trail bikes and quads all hours of the day and night. And most of them don't have any lights.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 I see them go by the house when I'm walking my dog 11:00, 11:30, they're shooting up and down the street. We're going to have another tragedy before long. But the intersection of Wells, something got to be done because the kids are all over the street in the morning . And it seems like the driver mentality just don't care. They don't slow down. A couple weeks ago when they were tearing a house down, there was a man directing traffic . There had to be a half dozen people standing around watching . There's a car come through there 60, 70 miles an hour and it hit a cat with all of these people, you know. They just -- the driver just didn't care about anybody . Well, let's do something about the speeding cars. It's not the police. We need an unmarked car to do something . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Mr. Voldenberg , can we check with the police department to see if they could take a look at that section of Main Avenue? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Specifically the corner of Wells and Main. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . Today, I wasn't able to get through to anybody , but I did call Mayor Page's office about these televisions because it's going to become -- it's going to become an issue eventually . Start walking around the courts. I take my doggy through the courts so he's not on somebody 's front lawn leaving a few gifts. And they're starting to pile up. Every block has one. You know, maybe if we get our Christmas gifts it will be two for every block. And it will just go on and on. And another thing I noticed with recycling is that very few people are recycling cardboard in town. Maybe we could try and do something to encourage people. Cardboard could be ground up and bleached and turned into paper, you know? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 But about a week or so ago I saw it must have been eight or nine boxes significant size sitting there waiting to be hauled off for the trash. It doesn't make any sense. Okay, on infrastructure , call your Congress men and our internet and telecom and so forth, television costs about $240 a month for kind of a so-so line up. You don't even get HBO or anything like that. And here we're talking about handing 65 billion dollars to the telecom industries so they could get internet out to the country . I would think that maybe with all the money they charge me, they could be possibly require d to do it instead of -- I'm not against it; but I certainly could use a lot less of a price. It's way in excess of my property taxes every year by 250 percent , you know. So anyway, on a lot of this green new deal type stuff, Michael Moore put out a film last year. It was called planet of the humans. And you can get it online. So it's interesting to check it out where some of these things may not be the great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 success that -- they may be more energy in than out of windmills and stuff like that. It's just something to compare . And when we talk about taxes, once again I'm a drummer boy here, 30 percent , 36 percent tax exempt. And I often sit down there and I think, well, gee, if we had half of that, what would that do for swimming pools at Nay Aug to repair them. A lot of these issues around town are just a total lack of infrastructure . It's just a lack of money. Joan scared the daylights out of me here 20 percent in five years. I mean, nobody gets 20 percent increase in anything . And it's just a shame, for instance , one nonprofit here. Final things if you go up to the top of Linden Street there is a yard that they were storing some old stuff. Now it looks like it's totally defunct . I was through there. And there's nothing going on but a bunch of old concrete blocks and stuff laying around in a totally dishevelled array. It's why does somebody like that have a nonprofit status in the first place if they're doing nothing with it? They should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 at least fork over with some of the taxes because we do need them and people start to lose their houses when they can't pay that anymore. And that's not right after a whole life of work. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , first I have an issue with 5-C, the Rubicon contract . The data collect ed by Rubicon is not the City's property at the end per the contract . It is considered proprietary information . The data should be owned by the City and Rubicon be granted rights to use it. With ownership not with the City, it ties the City's hands to migrate to another vendor using the data collect ed and already paid for or use the data to create a City-owned app. In 5-C attachment page three, the cover sheet states, please refer to the comparison rubric. But none is attached . They go as far to show how evaluation scores are compiled in the document but they do not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 provide that data as part of the review for Council 's approval . This is yet another example of the executive bidding , reviewing and picking and not presenting comparison data for a fair and impartial independent review by City Council and the public. We are presented only the data in favor of the preferred choice and not the whole data for informed consent. On the PEL report, it's nice in the budget we are seeing a zero increase for 2022. As the hope is for pending tax change to increase revenue , a county assessment change in property tax to level the unfair burden by some municipalities by increasing it upwards for everyone , that is, except for the wealthy who could build and dispose of buildings and apartments that they could live in after 10 years and have no taxes. We have a zero -- we have a zero percent increase this year. But as noted, PEL marks a five year expected increase need of 20.6 percent . I can't see how the two balance each other. In relation to the non union pay increases on page 74, Social Security this year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 made a stunning cost of living jump 5.9 percent . The average was 1.65 percent prior to that. 5.9 may seem a lot, but this year's budget proposes an average City non union worker get an average increase of 17.5 percent this year. I have no idea what the assistant City Tax Collector did for 10,000. But what more do we expect from them with a 350 percent tax pay increase ? Worker's Compensation Program Manager is up for 22.3 percent increase . Even the new transformation specialist position gets an 8.5 percent increase . I would like to see if any position in the City is left unfilled. The money should not be allowed to transfer about to others as an excuse it has been budgeted for that section . It should be mandated that all unfulfill ed payroll position s in the budget shall have the unused payroll funds from the open positions required to be only assigned and paying back to City obligations and bonds. The raise was quoted as in part to put the City on more balanced economic footing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 for hiring people who would bring value to the City. The problem is, this budget does not evaluate bringing people to the City. What this does, it gives a large increase to everyone whether they're qualified or not because they haven't been assessed whether or not they actually could do their job, whether or not they are qualified for their job, whether they have the experience for the job. And without that -- raise does not help future people get in here. And the last thing is, the sheet that I presented is from page 74. And like a number of the document s that were presented to you and this was almost in the last of the documents from the budget. The column I put in there was increase percent because all of that is math but it gives a clarity to how much the difference is between what it was and what it is in a percentage wise. I don't understand why that clarity cannot be presented to members of Council so they could make an informed choice. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 would just like to say as soon as I got the salary adjustment , the first thing I did was do exactly what you provided to us. MR. SCHUSTER : I will say I did the same. MR. COYNE: And it should have been done for you. And that's what an IT person does, gives a spreadsheet and it's a formula and it's done. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Miss Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I want to thank Mr. Voldenberg if I pronounced your name correctly -- MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MS. JEFFRIES : -- for putting the list of the work sessions in the paper and the program tonight . And I know that it was in the paper and everything . But it's good to see it in one spot (inaudible ) of the paper. However , as I sat there tonight and I listened to all the discussion about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 budget with the Mayor and Miss Cipriani and I thought , I can't hear. And I know that there's an acoustics problem in here. So, you know, to think that we sit here and listen and see the backs of their heads and we can't understand or hear what they're saying, so we have to depend on the paper tomorrow to what's in the paper as to what was said tonight . I don't think it's fair to us as we give up our time on this chilly cold night to come out here and sit. So I'm sitting here and I'm thinking , it's a simple fix, rearrange the room. Is there anything wrong with rearranging this room to put that table over there and have the two gentlemen there sit facing you because if the sound is coming this way and you could hear them and we can hear them, do they need this big table like this? I don't know. But it seems like a simple fix to rearrange the room since it would be much more cost effective to rearrange the furniture rather than putting in a new acoustic s system. So, you know, tomorrow morning my paper will be delivered to my door and I will be looking at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 page three I think is where they put the City Council notes to decipher and to read what was said here tonight . And like I said, as we sat here and listened on this chilly night where we could have sat home and listened to Council on ECTV, we chose to come out here. And I for one did not and could not understand a lot of what was going on. I went online. I didn't print the budget. But I did look at some of the things. But what I read I couldn't understand as to whether they were discussing what my concerns were. So that's all I have to say tonight . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And we are working on, you know, with the speaker s and the acoustics . The problem with the set up is the microphone s are set up there and there is no way of changing that. That's even a more expensive fix than just the acoustics . MS. JEFFRIES : Just a little desk here will work. They don't have to sit at the thing is what I was thinking . Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. But that is something that is going to go into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 budget for next year. So hopefully , you know, in January and February -- in January or February we get this all figured out in here. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. That sounds promising . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? ATTY. HAYES: Mr. Donahue ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: Before you move onto Fifth Order, can I state something first? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: With regard to citizens participation tonight , I would like to say that I think it speaks volumes that on the two instances that Bob Bolus decided to use his time addressing Council to levy personal attacks against the sole female member of Council were at meetings where that member of Council was not present to defend herself if she chose to. We know that public official s subject themselves to public criticism . However , I know I speak for Council when I say that we hope that Mr. Bolus's personal attacks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 of Dr. Rothchild will not have a chilling affect on others watching this meeting from seeking public office. They should consider the source of those attacks. And they could start by doing a search of our county's criminal docket if they want to consider that source. But I just think it's important that we, you know, we address this ongoing obsession that Mr. Bolus seems to have one with one of our members . So I just wanted to state that for the record. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I was actually going to address that in Fifth Order. But I could address it now. You know, I think Mr. Bolus's comments were ignorant . We're not -- we call doctors doctors because they are doctors of medicine . A doctorate means you achieve d a certain level of education in your field. There's doctors of education . First lady of the United States is Dr. Jill Biden. She's a doctor of education . There's doctors of English literature . There's doctors of political science . You could go down the list. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 title is -- reflects the level of education that that person achieved and Dr. Rothchild more than earned that title. And that's all I have to say on that. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any comment s or motions tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, just two. First, I did speak with Larry West some time ago and we spoke about the Scranton Fire Department retirees . So I'm going to ask -- I'll send an e-mail over to you, Mr. Voldenberg , about the retirees seeing which ones are at the cusp of possible retirement or eligible for retirement to give us a little background information for when we decide on how we will vote on the SAFER Grant. The other one is 1829 Rear Cedar Avenue. It's a request that I put in for the last two weeks. I've been told nothing at this point in time has been done there so just restating that address and I'll send that over as well. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 have any comment s or motions tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Just briefly , just to touch on some of what Miss Hodowanitz brought up, we are looking at the audit and looking at ways where we could strength en the contract moving forward in terms of timing, I agree that we should have it already . I'm hoping that we have it by Thanksgiving . I'm being overly optimistic . But I'm hoping we have it by then as we move into passing our budget. In terms of the CBAs, I agree that, you know, we don't have them in the budget because you can't put them in the budget. We're legally required to pass our budget by December 15th. And we have to do it that way. I agree that it doesn't put us in the greatest position . And it might not make our budget even close to being balance d, but it's something we need to figure out because we have legal requirement s that we have to meet that aren't necessarily have to be met by the administration and the bargaining units in terms of negotiations . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 On the archivist , I agree that, you know, it's something that we need to move towards . But I think the first step there is bringing in a company to do -- to back load and to digitally archive everything going back. The City has certain requirements on how it keeps its records . Some things have to kept for life. Some things only have to be kept for 30 years, 20 years. So I think we really need a company to sit there and go through all of the paper we have in the basement and across the alley to really do a deep dive and then get into an archivist to keep it going moving forward . But that's all I have for Fifth Order. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF A TAX AND REVENUE ANTICIPATION NOTE, SERIES OF 2022 IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $10,000,000.00; PROVIDING FOR THE DATED DATE, INTEREST RATE, MATURITY DATE, REDEMPTION PROVISIONS , PAYMENT , AND PLACE OF PAYMENT IN RESPECT OF THE NOTE; ACCEPTING THE PROPOSAL ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT “B” FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION NAMED THEREIN FOR THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 PURCHASE OF THE NOTE; NAMING A SINKING FUND DEPOSITARY /PAYING AGENT; AUTHORIZING THE PROPER OFFICERS OF THE CITY TO EXECUTE AND DELIVER THE NOTE AND CERTAIN OTHER DOCUMENTS AND CERTIFICATES IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ; AUTHORIZING AND DIRECTING THE PREPARATION , CERTIFICATION AND FILING OF THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA ; SETTING FORTH A FORM OF THE NOTE. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , I think the most important part about this is the fact that the interest rate is below 1 percent . There's a big difference in a 5 percent interest rate in terms of our TAN compared to a interest rate under 1 percent , especially when it covers one year. So I think that's an important point to make. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR.

MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I think there's going to be several question s that need to be brought up regarding this. I'll speak with Mr. Hayes about it before we get to final passage . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I agree. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 think we, you know, we need some more detail on this. And I will reach out to Tom Preambo to make sure he provides more detail when he comes in for his budget work session on Thursday . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D. APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2022 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2022 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2022. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , I think as we move through this process we go through our work sessions , there will be some amendments and additions , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 subtractions , whatever you want to call it from this budget. But I think, you know, we're going to introduce it tonight and then we'll move through that process . And by December 15th we have to pass the budget. So we will pass a budget. But this is the beginning of the process . And we'll work through it with the administration and amongst ourselves and get to a spot where we get this budget passed by December 15th. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – ACCEPTING A DONATION IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($1000.00) TO THE SCRANTON FIRE DEPARTMENT TO BE PLACED IN THE SPECIAL CITY SERVICES ACCOUNT AS NOTED. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. MR.

The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-F. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY /FEMA TO ACCEPT THE STAFFING FOR ADEQUATE FIRE AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE (SAFER) GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $2,596,047.50 TO BE UTILIZED BY THE SCRANTON FIRE DEPARTMENT . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SCHUSTER : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 going to vote to move this forward ; but like I said, I spoke with the administration about a list of retiree s that might help us to see what this is going to look like moving into the future to see if we can work through attrition to fill these positions and not see this money, you know, being added to the budget moving forward . MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I have significant reservations about this just because of the total cost that it adds to the City's legacy costs in year four. And it's my understanding that it can't be done through attrition . So we have 138 firefighter s today. We need to have -- if we accept this for 10 position s, we're going to have to have 148 positions for three years no matter what. We could have 35 firefighters retire during that time period and we still have to stay at that 148. And then when the grant runs out, it becomes either do you furlough those ten or do you keep them on? And I think that especially given, you know, what we have on our agenda 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 from PEL in terms of their calculations going out, that's very concerning to me. But we'll work through it. I believe the Fire Chief and the Police Chief are in next Tuesday for their work session -- budget work session . So I'm sure that will be a topic then. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so I'm definitely moving this forward . I posed a couple questions to Mr. West and Mayor Cognetti with regards to previous Safe Grants why was one sent back. So I'd like to see if three becomes six become nine. I'd like to see this grant every three years. And I want to know why it hasn't. I was told that it was sent back one year. And I was also told that it was never renewed . So why wasn't it renewed? I know grants are tricky. I know if you don't send it on time you don't get it. I know if you don't fill it out correct ly you don't get it. So my biggest question is, let's talk about moving this forward . Let's talk about having three years becoming nine years becoming -- or six years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 becoming nine years and why not? So I'm also waiting for more information . But I definitely want to move this forward . MR. DONAHUE : All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.
