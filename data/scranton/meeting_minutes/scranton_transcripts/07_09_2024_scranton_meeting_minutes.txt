Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. There will be a motion this evening to suspend the rules and move Item 5-B to Sixth and Seventh Order for a final vote. This ordinance is a governmental agreement and memorandum of understanding between the City of Scranton and the Borough of Moosic. Also, there will be a motion to suspend the rules to move Item 5-J to Seventh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 Order for a final vote after it's introduced in Fifth Order. This resolution is proposed revision of the sewage facilities plan at the Scranton Primary Health at 923 Wyoming Avenue. Anyone who would like to speak on these pieces of legislation may do so in Fourth Order during Citizens Participation . Dispense with the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON JULY 2, 2024, REGARDING UPDATED PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX COLLECTIONS AS OF JUNE 25, 2024. 3-B. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED JULY 5, 2024 FROM THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REGARDING BUDGET TRANSFER RELATED TO FIRE DEPARTMENT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES . MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So the Scranton Police Department is now offering T-shirt sales in conjunction with their upcoming National Night Out celebration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 which is schedule d in August. So you could get your T-shirts starting actually yesterday . Shirts are available at Scranton Police headquarters during normal business hours. They have sizes available are small through 3X and they are $20. And they're a pretty sharp looking shirt. So that is all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have one. Last Saturday I had an opportunity to participate in the cleanup over at the Washburn Street Cemetery . And I just want to announce that there's going to be another cleanup on July 20th. I wanted to thank several of the groups that came out. Mr. Smurl was in attendance that day, but the Black Sheep of West Scranton and the AOH Division 4 and Bogies for Burkey also participated in that cleanup. But the next cleanup will be July 20th from 8 a.m. until noon. And I encourage any and all residents to attend that cleanup . We got I'd say about halfway through the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 cemetery with the rest to go. MR. SMURL: We did the low part. The high stuff is yet to come. Yeah, we got a lot done. It's starting to look well. MR. KING: Just briefly , my family and I were away last week. So I felt bad I was not able to show my respect for former Mayor James Connors . He was a friend. I've known him a long, long time. And I just want to express my condolences to Susie and the entire Connors family. I think everyone has their own unique little stories about Mayor Connors and the affect he had on our city. He was a great public servant and he will be dearly missed. The other thing I would like to add is on Sunday I had the opportunity to walk around Nay Aug Park a couple miles. I think it's important to acknowledge the work that's being done up there by the Scranton Municipal Rec Authority , all the volunteer s that go up there constantly to improve that park. I know recently we had roads paved up there, pathways paved. There is tons of new benches throughout Nay Aug Park. The bandstand 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that is outstanding , lots of plants, vegetation planted around Nay Aug and the idea of that coal mine tour now. The only piece that is missing is the pool. And, you know, we're going to be passing some legislation on that this evening so we could get that project started . And we'll get a pool back up at Nay Aug Park and restore that place back to its grandeur . But I have to tell you that I was very impressed as I walked that park with all the tremendous work and a lot of the volunteer work, probably the majority is volunteer work. So kudos to all the people who spend a tremendous amount of time dedicate d to improving our Nay Aug Park. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. I just want to say thank you to one of the people that come up to the parks and clean up on the Washburn Cemetery on Saturday . Brian Johnson , one of my good friends and he was with us Saturday . When he got home he actually had a heatstroke and fell on his porch. I think he's doing okay now. But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 want to thank him and recognize him for all the work he's done and volunteers every week with us. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I was very impressed by the caucus with Clifton , Larson and Allen. I have a loop recorder implanted in my chest. And it was going, beep, beep, beep that we're going to have the first on-time audit in over 20 years. But that's not just due to the current auditor that you had. That's the hard work of Matt Domines '. And I'm telling you when he walks out the door, you are going to be hard pressed to find someone with half his brain. So you ought to keep him as long as you can. Do you know what Friday is, July 12th? It's the ninth anniversary of the death of Patrolman John Wilding. And I hope everybody pauses and remembers this man -- this young man with a wife and two little boys who gave his life for this city, a very special 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 person. In terms of the collective bargaining agreements , the police contract is going on 346 days; firefighters , 462 days and counting. But if you see a first responder , a police officer , a firefighter , just say thank you for the job you do because their jobs are very, very dangerous as losing Patrolman Wilding should remind us all. The stormwater update, there was a press release . And, you know, two months from today is September 9th, the first anniversary of the flood. And so it's good news that we passed the first hurdle to get the 2.7 million dollars to buy out those 18 homes and 3 vacant lots. But it's something I want you to keep in mind for future natural disasters . These homeowners , most of these people if not all of them have been paying property taxes faithfully for years. And the city really should be taking care of its citizens when the citizens suffer through no fault of their own. So I hope that we don't let up going forward with getting them taken care of because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 it's important . Speaking of the Nay Aug pool and the multistate contract that's in tonight 's legislation , I notice that the projected completion date was September 17th, 2025, which means that swimming will occur at the earliest in 2026. And I hope that we don't see any people trying to swim in the gorge again and having a fatality or a serious injury. That's a long time to have to wait. I also notice that one of the other bidders was Dominick Scartelli . Is this the same Scartelli organization that's involved in the lawsuit with the Serrenti Center? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, guess what, their name pops up again D and M Construction is the contractor for the Weston Field pool, which is also on tonight 's legislation . And they were one of the other bidders again. I found that very amusing . Apparently it doesn't bother them to be sued and countersuing ; and, yeah, if there's money to be made, I guess you make a bid. But I didn't see in the backup was a completion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 date for the Weston Field pool if you could find that out. The Gerrity gift cards, $5,000, I thought that was a really nice piece of legislation , 200 $25 gift cards. Apparently Code Enforcement is going to be choosing , you know, these homeowners each quarter . What is the basis by which they are choosing theses lucky winners of these gift cards because there is certainly more than 200 homeowners who are keeping up their properties ? MR. SMURL: So there are -- there are. And this is just the beginning . We actually spoke of this at the South Side Residence Association meeting last year when the Mayor had come. And the idea is to -- we're not going to give it to the wealthiest house. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, tell me later. I only have a few seconds. MR. SMURL: I will. MS. HODOWANITZ : The ESRI contract . I didn't understand that at all. I read it and read it until I went blind. Please tell me during Fifth Order what is the city's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 geospacial strategy . I never heard of such a thing. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . I want to talk about something I haven't brought up in a long time, dangerous dog legislation . I know I spoke to the Mayor I think it was last year. And she agreed that the legislation that was passed should be tweaked . And I know Council was suppose d to have a meeting with her. Has anything happened ? Does anybody know? MR. MCANDREW : Not that I'm aware of to be honest with you. MR. SPINDLER : Because she agreed with me that the legislation has to be tweaked. It's not strong enough. And I've been here many times and spoke about it. Moving on, it was brought to my attention that Euclid Avenue, the part that runs through the Village of Tripp Park Development was paved recently . So it's only a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 couple blocks from my house. So I went and looked the other day. And it was paved but they left two blocks out which weren't paved. I don't know why. MR. SCHUSTER : It seemed like if they went another 40 feet or 70 feet it would have alleviated any kind of potholes on that street. MR. SPINDLER : From Dickens to Court Street it's not too bad. But from Court Street to whatever the next block is, is terrible . It's like driving on a washboard . Why that wasn't paved, I don't -- they did the whole thing right through the development but two blocks they didn't do. Like I said, that one block is terrible . I don't know what to tell you. Maybe it has to do with the Mayor lives further up, maybe that's why they did that and not the first part. Well, I guess she lives there part time because the other time she lives in Clarks Summit. Moving on again, hole on Dorothy Street is still there. And the corner where I live it's -- in October it will be three years and nothing 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 been done since they told me it's going to get fixed. Maybe if Tom Preambo was still in charge of DPW, all these things would get done. And the last couple weeks, my garbage has been a day late also getting picked up. It was suppose d to be picked up this month. Last week on Monday it was picked up Tuesday . The holiday was Thursday . So DPW is in a shambles . The Mayor should call Tom Preambo and beg him to come back and run DPW because he did a great job. Now the department is a mess. There's so many things wrong with it. I heard from a good source our Fire Chief is running it. I never heard of such a ridiculous thing in my life. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . Last week when I was up here and tonight I would like to really see this happen out of one of you at least to make a motion to change the expressway to Mayor Jim Connors . That's who we should be honoring on the expressway . He's a Scranton resident , a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 lifelong resident . He's not a part time phoney who was here and lives in Delaware and right now is embarrassing us worldwide . So please respect and honor those that made the city what it is today. Twelve years of his labors went into this city. And each and every one of us owe that to Jimmy. At least make a motion whether you approve it or you don't, but at least do what's right for a change and put all the political crap behind us and make a motion tonight to change the expressway for Jimmy. We owe him that. And I would like to see it done. He was not only a good Mayor, he was a damn good friend of mine also and everybody else here. His door was always open. So let's not just shut the door on him. Let's honor him like what we did with McDade on the expressway and you know what he was and we still named an expressway for him. So let's do what's right. I have a petition going to change the sign on 81 for PennDOT to get rid of Biden sign and just call it Scranton next exit. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Okay, we're an embarrassment . We're all being embarrass ed by him. Everybody that goes down that interstate. And every day we see it. It turns our stomach to see what he's done to this country and done to the people and lie that one of our military , our fellow vets died on his watch. He didn't know what happened in Afghanistan ? And he was too busy looking at his watch. We got to honor those that deserve to be honored and respect ed. There is no respect . So we have a petition doing that. Now, the homes are being demolished here in the city for the flood. Why don't we in the city when they are all torn down make a deal with one of the modular companies and put up all new modulars there and either give them back to the people whose homes were torn down or rent them out, become a landlord . Look what's going on in this city with everybody renting this, renting that. And we're just giving it away. We'll not only create income but we'll have people occupied . And we have the resources to do it. There's all kind of state 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and federal money to do it. And I would strongly say -- suggest let's do that. Let's not leave a blighted area there. When everything is gone, it's going to look like hell. The other part is, I have all of those disinfectant wipes that we've been donating out. And anybody that wants them, if I may, Mr. President , give a phone number? MR. SMURL: Sure. MR. BOLUS: It's 570-346-7659 and it's Bolus Truck Parts, one of my companies . And all of these wipes are available for them. The other thing is, I see the lights are all out here. If Bill Gaughan was sitting here tonight , he would be spastic . We'd have to probably put him in therapy because he wants to spend thousands in the county to make his little lights blink. So maybe we get his little lights blinking . I don't want to put him in therapy because his lights aren't working . And why aren't we flying the Ukraine and Israel flags in here if you don't want to put them outside ? Let's honor those that are being murdered and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 butchered and everything and respect them for what's going on. We owe it to them under that flag as an American . Okay, why are we hiding our heads in the sand? We need to step up and respect those. We're not Palestinians . And we're sure in the hell not Hamas Palestinians . And we are not a bunch of idiots running around destroying our statues, our culture and spray painting and everybody else and protest ing. And then we put them back in college and our money pays for them. So we got to get all of that done. And one last thing, I know Jessica isn't here tonight . I go for physical therapy . I tore an Achilles tendon. And there is nothing greater than a physical therapist . And she's highly recommended . And I don't know why she doesn't respect all of her fellow representatives that are physical therapist and put behind her name that she's a physical therapist . That's a misrepresentation . She could call herself doctor. But please, Mr. President , make a motion to respect all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 physical therapists that she represents and honor them while she's sitting here and she should do that out of respect to all her fellow people. She's highly recommended . And she's well known and nobody had a bad thing to say about her as a physical therapist . She should be honored and proud to represent them. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mark Scaringi. MR. SCARINGI : A pleasant good evening , Council . Usually I come here with a suit and tie. Now I come with a T-shirt. MR. SMURL: Can you speak up a little bit? I can't hear you. MR. SCARINGI : I said usually I come here with a suit and tie. And now I come here with T-shirt. And that's because it's like 94 degrees out there. So if I had a suit like -- I would need an ambulance . So I just wanted to follow up from last week, Council . I wanted to know if legislation passes for the -- excuse me, can you stop pounding your feet on the floor? All right. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Oh, man, here we go. All right. So I wanted to know if legislation passes when the legislation of marijuana happens , can we activate cannabis lounges here in Scranton just like in Las Vegas? MR. SMURL: Please address Council . Don't look back there. MR. SCARINGI : What the City Council in Las Vegas did, they incorporated cannabis lounges so tourists and people could go to this lounge and enjoy cannabis . And so I wanted to know this thing is really soon going to go recreational . I talked to that Emily Kinkead . I spoke to her and I said when are we going to go recreation al? And she said soon. But she said you can't disobey federal law with marijuana . Let me just tell you a quick comment on when we go recreatio nal, Council , because the federal government doesn't activate the currency system, everything is in cash. And so when you could go to Las Vegas they make the delivery and they get held up and they have to pay over the cash and the weed at the same time. That's because it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 deregulat ed and it's not decriminalized here. Be very careful , Council , when we go to recreation al, you're going to open up a Pandora 's box and you wish you never did. MR. SMURL: Please address Council . MR. SCARINGI : And a final thought about this Biden -- and then I'll leave. Yesterday a children 's hospital was bombed by Putin's missiles and many children were killed and injured . Before the start of this war I told Biden in emails messages and (inaudible ) messages and he did not listen to me. I said you go there with the maximum amount of force right on the Ukrainian border and you say to Putin, you lay one foot in Ukraine and we'll bomb you right off the planet. It's like two cougars in the jungle looking at each other. And that would have saved all kinds of lives. But those baby face advisors know nothing , absolutely nothing that Sullivan and Blinkin . And now children are dead in Ukraine . That is all, Council . MR. SMURL: Mark. MR. CORDELLI : Good evening , Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 President , everyone . I hope everyone is well. Mark Cordelli , Lackawanna County representing the Commission ers, on behalf of the Commissioners , want to say hello and also make everyone aware of some of the events that are going on throughout Lackawanna County.

This July 26th and 27th, the 3 on 3 basketball tournament the Commissioners are bringing back resurrecting something that Covid unfortunately took away from us.

This is a fabulous program . There are two sessions . The first session starts August 4th through the 9th of August, 10 a.m. to 2. There is lots of information and literature in here. So I won't go through all that information just right there. And last but not least, our Recycling Department , we dare you to take on our challenge , recycling challenge . We have one year to gather-- this is Lackawanna County 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 but also municipalities are able to join in and do this as well. We have one year to gather a thousand pounds of plastic . And they list specific plastics on here that they are looking to gather and obtain. The program is partnered with Next Trix {phonetic } organization . You'll achieve a thousand pounds and the municipality will get a plastic bench that you could display proudly wherever you'd like. That's all I have. I will stay here if anyone has any questions afterward s with regards to Lackawanna County. So thank you so much for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for our sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council , Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . Mr. Smurl, please feel free to interrupt me and correct me with anything I say that is not accurate because you will know. I want to discuss the light show at Nay Aug Park. I'm not a board member up there or anything like that. I'm just a volunteer up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 there. And I go there all the time and volunteer during that light show a lot. And I read in the paper and I saw the ads in the legal. And I was wondering why the city would be paying somebody to do all of that when all of this past years when it's been a beautiful light show, there was a couple of DPW workers I believe and volunteers setting it up and taking it down and putting it away and screwing light bulbs in and things like that. I took part in that. So I thought why are we spending money where we don't have to. I mean, if it ends up that later on volunteers can't do it, then put it out to bid. And my next question is going to be if the city is taking over the light show if that is their intention to do that at the park, are they going to be responsible for signing up all the volunteer s for the collections ? And who is going to take care of the broken wires off and on? I know Mr. Smurl will know because he's repaired them and Sam has repaired them and different people in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 middle of the light show when they have it. So that is basically all I really wanted to know. And I know the money raised for the light show as of now supports the park, the Recreation Authority 's activities and things that the park needs. That's not provided by the city. So what's going to happen? Is Nay Aug Recreation going to lose that money or is it just that the -- I don't understand the whole thing. The only thing I thought of was maybe the union didn't want any workers to come up there. But I don't know if that's true. That's a guess. So I really don't know. And I just think it's sad when you're spending money when you don't have to. That brings me to the consultant things. Maybe I'm wrong, but hiring consultants for every single thing like the walkability study and things like that, to me, they are charging a lot of money. I know when I worked for 30 years at the same warehouse , the company brought in consultant s to see how we could be more efficient . And all the consultant s did was walk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 around and ask all of us what we needed to be more efficient . So they could have saved themselves like $10,000 or whatever they paid just by maybe calling all the employees together and asking them. So I don't think you need a consultant for everything that you're doing. I think that sometime s you could just ask the people involved what's the best way to go. Now, before I run out of time I just wanted to also ask if anything was going on with my 421 Colfax Avenue if it was put back on the list or anything because two kids up there last week I think I messaged people here on the Council almost got really hurt there. There is new tenants in that house and the little kids were trying to lift that sidewalk -- the slate part, not those big concrete parts. I ran out of my car to go up there and stop them just when the older sister came out and caught it. He almost dropped the whole thing on his foot. And another kid later on was riding those little electric scooters things on the sidewalk . He's not old enough to ride in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 street. And he went to go around into the grass and there is another piece of cement in the grass there and he went flying right off the curb into the street. Thank God nothing was coming. So I know -- whose responsibility it is to even if they just remove those pieces. I'm not asking them to put a whole sidewalk in if it's not the city's responsibility but to send someone up just even to move the slate pieces so people -- it will be all dirt and people could just go over it. And then, of course, my last but not least is the curb cut has not been done on Olive Street and Colfax. I believe they might have done it up at the other curb but haven't cut that. And that gives me 27 seconds to say thank you for listening and have a good evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Doris. Mr. Voldenberg , I thought we got a response they were going to look at the sidewalk s or do something with the sidewalks up there. Will you recheck on that? That's the abandoned house that was on the demolition list and now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 it's off the demolition list. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's right. It's not on the demolition list. Code enforcement and DPW were advised about the sidewalks but I'll follow up. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Now, it seems that some of the stuff I was going to talk about is already discussed so I'll briefly go over that. But, first of all, I was handed this a few minutes ago. And it reminded me the city had an inquiry over the files that were left back outside of the -- personnel files that were left outside of this building . I understand they hired an attorney and we're wondering if we could get an update on where that stands at this point? MR. SMURL: I will ask. MR. COYNE: Thank you. From the article , it looked like Licensing and Inspection was going to be handing out those Gerrity gift cards just by the way the article was written . If that's not true that is perfectly fine. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 But I look at them and I go, you're looking to give gift cards to people who have perfectly manicure d and groomed lawns. So the people who are most likely in need who have a lesser groomed property get nothing . I question the involvement of a department that's rife with favoritism, protectionism . It's been caught collect ing recyclables in dumpsters in parks and at the University of Scranton on paid city time for personal profit who is now the judge of who gets free money. Is there going to be an audit and a showing of who receive s these free cards? Free food gift cards should have been handed out to a food shelter or for the homeless , the people who actually need them. You want Licensing and Inspection to hand out gift cards, then do contract work with lawn care landscaper s who will donate a set number of cleanup , mowing, landscaping as one time for those gifts for people whose properties are becoming derelict who actually need help, not the people who could hire a landscaper to manicure their lawn and to do it for them so they get a bonus card for having the money to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 have someone else do it. I think it's completely unfair and the people who actually need help, the seniors who can't get out because it's 90 degrees to do that lawn care maybe something to help them would be more beneficial than a gift card for Licensing and Inspection rather than a ticket on the door. Has anyone yet changed the financial interest forms to reflect a spouse or partner as required yet on the forms? Onto disabled parking , it's on the agenda tonight . Again, it's listed as changing the fine from $55 to $50 which is going in the wrong direction . Second, don't use the card plate, use the handicap tag number on it. It's numbered . They have a car -- if they have a car in the shop or having their family transport them around, they could use it on whatever car they are in for that space. Tying it to a car, if that car is in the shop means they cannot use their space. The handicap tags have physical numbers on them and the spaces should be restricted to that, not a car. There's absolutely no reason for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 ladder system on these fine systems . It should not be a first, second, or third offense . You park in the spot, you get a ticket. You get towed. That's what other cities do. And the fine up there are 125 to $250 for the first time you get picked up. If you are not back there in time they hook up the car and then you get towing and storage fees from the towing company and you wind up with a 300 to $500 bill to get your car back. Once you do that once, you are not going to do it again. Three years ago I brought that forth in front of this body. But it seems that last week, everyone in the Council got (inaudible ) and patted on the back for that same suggestion . It's not a new idea. I just find it disingenuous that the citizen s here who interact and give ideas when things actually come, City Council pats themselves on the back and never refers to people in this body who brought forth the original idea to say nice job. Thank you for bringing it forward . We're moving forward with you for the city. But that doesn't happen. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Last, we have a park director who seems -- a director it seems refuses to get lifeguard training , refuses to move into the city, unable to secure park centers and assure they are locked who is unable to evaluate the safety and put a plan in motion on pools before they had closed for the summer who cannot lock park facilities . And now we have a planned outside contractor to put up Christmas lights in Nay Aug Park that have been installed for years because the park director can't even run a park. Maybe we need to get rid of the park director and just pay an outside contractor . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. COYNE: -- because nothing is happening that way. Thank you very much and have a great night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MS. CUSICK: Good evening , Council . My name is Amy Cusick. I'm a West Scranton resident and President of Chris's Miracles From Heaven. First and foremost , I just want to thank City Council for all of your help and cooperation in the Washburn Street cleanup. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 also want to thank the Northeast Pennsylvania Bikers for Justice , the Black Sheep of West Scranton , West Scranton Neighbors Association , Bogies for Burkey, AOH Division four Scranton , Make a Wish Foundation , and NeighborWorks Northeastern Pennsylvania for all of their help in making the Washburn Street Cemetery what it should be. With that being said, I'll just give you guys a brief update. Last Saturday we had 60 volunteer s in over 90 degree weather . On behalf of all of us at Chris's Miracles From Heaven we wish the best and if there is anything we can do, do please let us know. I just wanted to revisit my last visit here. I know we were asking for some answers about, you know, was the owner ever cited, was he ever fined. I just wanted to see if we had any resolution as far as that is concerned . As I stated, it's not just the Scranton community . I am now being contact ed -- this week I was contact ed by a lady from Colorado who saw our stories on the news and in the newspaper s. And unfortunately they are asking me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 question s that I'm coming here to ask you. And I don't have no answers to give them. So I just wanted to follow up and see where we stand with all of that and just thank you guys for your time. One more thing before I go, I was actually introduced to another agency from the West Scranton -- I'm sorry, West Scranton Youth Center. It is opening up on Washburn Street. They are also having a block party on July 20th from one to four for the residents to come out and take a tour of the facility . They are going to have music, arts, and I believe wrestling there as well. So if we can all just check those out as well. That's all. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So, Amy, we did get a couple answers on the citations . So in 2018, a formal citation was issued through the county court system. And no ruling was made by the magistrate because they were given time to correct it in 2018. I believe they did correct the issue. It's been the worst in the last two years. Last year a quality of life 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 violation was issued in May of 2022. That was issued but it was never followed up with the city through the magistrate . And then there was -- they issued a most recent violation on Monday the 8th which was yesterday . So I planned on Fifth Order to ask what the resolution of that is and await to hear what comes out of that. MS. CUSICK: Okay. Thanks so much, Council . We appreciate your help. MR. SCHUSTER : You're welcome . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer and so forth. You know, I keep hearing about blight and people coming up here with blight. And then the next thing you know, they're complaining about Code Enforcement . You know, and sometimes it's the same people. What I see, the city that greatly improved and a lot of people trying to make the best out of who and what they could do. And, you know, it's -- decide what you want to complain about. And another thing, many times people are coming up here and calling about corruption . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 I don't see any corruption going on. I might disagree with the idea that somebody has, but I don't think it's corrupt . It just is. I got a little overboard with the streetscape deal. Well, guess what? A candidate for Council came in here and -- at the podium and he thought $7.25 an hour was a good pay. So guess what, you don't have anything to worry about as far as my vote. You'll get it as long as you don't say something like that. And as far as the expressway or anything , I felt that we should have got a banner up or something in honor of Joe Biden. And I felt it was overboard. But, you know, overboard is being obsessed with something forever . It's just kind of silly. Now, on our national level, homelessness is now illegal thanks to the Supreme Court. So they could put you in jail. And your cost, 25, $30,000 a year and maybe even make work over in the Recycling Center or something . And back in the day in Georgia when we had a depression , you could -- the average 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 sentence for vagrancy was three years and you stood a 27 percent chance of never walking out of that prison alive. So some people have some funny ideas in this country . And it's a shame they do because they have everything , everything in their life that they have no right to complain . It was disclosed I think yesterday on one of my tireless and obsessive news cast. I guess that's my obsession . Trump was on the phone to Putin a day or two before the invasion of Ukraine . So let's not worry about a Ukrainian flag. Just get them what they need. And there is good things that happened to the Scranton area. The ammunition plant is raising its production 400 percent by a year from now. So hopefully they will get to where they need to be, all of those bombs and, you know, talk about embarrassments , we have forest fires. And our former president was talking the fires to the president of Finland. And the president of Finland told him that we rake the leaves. And he actually took that serious . I mean, come on. And as far as the Democrat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 whiners and bed wetters, wise up, wise up. You got Joe and that's it. You run with him. And the suggestion for Republicans that caught my eye in the past, General Eisenhower was one of my favorite presidents in the 20th century . And I got my eye on General Milley. Republicans , please, reform your party and stop being an avenue for constant malice and mistreatment of everybody else. Thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm here tonight for three reasons . And the first one is because I knew there was air conditioning in here. So I'm soaking up the cold air for as long as I can. I have a few things. One, is the status of the contract s that I believe it was June of last year reviewing the tax exempt properties . Where does that stand? MR. SMURL: It is still ongoing . MS. SCHUMACHER : What was the length of the contract because that's a year already gone. Do we -- MR. SMURL: I'm not sure what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 total life of the HUP contract was. But it is actually still active. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, maybe you could get -- MR. SMURL: I do have more information . I will get what they gave us and have Frank get it to you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, I would appreciate that, yes, thank you. Now on this -- who does the work, DPW or contracted ? MR. SMURL: On what? MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. SMURL: The work for where? MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, right now for the decoration s, the Christmas decoration s. MR. SMURL: Parks and Recreation put those up, the decoration s. They put them up. MS. SCHUMACHER : And I think that -- so it was never budgeted then. MR. SMURL: In Parks and Recreation , no, it was not. MS. SCHUMACHER : So it's not -- there is no budget for them. Are they planning if this goes through to transfer some budget from someplace else to pay for this if they go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 ahead with it? MR. SMURL: I'm not sure of the total idea of what they're asking for, Marie. I believe it's to erect and to remove all of the decoration s. The Recreation Authority will still run the light show. They will still do the volunteers and all of that. I don't know all the details about this contract as of yet. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. What about walkability ? There for a while it appeared we were going to go gung-ho into the walkability . And I haven't seen any changes in a lot of the -- I know that a lot of the traffic signal changes are not working . And does anybody ever check those and get them fixed? MR. SMURL: You mean the button? You push the button and it makes -- yes, I believe the city did ask for a list. And I believe we were given that -- the list from Joan. So I hope they're working on them. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Yeah, I'll ask Joan then -- MR. SMURL: Yeah, she provided the city with a list.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MS. SCHUMACHER : Like how many of them have changed because I know she walks a lot in the city. MR. SMURL: Yeah, she had the list. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, so anything else going to happen with the walkability ? MR. SMURL: Well, it is still in progress . I know there are other things that have to happen first. We have to put conduits throughout the entire downtown to run all of the underground wiring and stuff. A lot of the stuff is old. But everything that is above ground now, those old poles that are really in rough condition , all the wiring has to go underground. So that's the first step and I believe that is going to be part of one of our agenda items tonight . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening, Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to talk about ultimate disrespect and betrayal. This past Saturday I was at the Washburn Street Cemetery along with Council President Smurl, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Councilman Schuster and many other people. We worked very hard in a short period of time. We got a lot done. There's so much more to do. All right. I'm going to say a name that this body cannot say -- Dominick Graziano . He's the owner of the cemetery . He should be ashamed of himself . There are so many veterans that are there, a ton of purple heart this past Saturday . You know, we were pushing through the cemetery and you really couldn't even read the names because there was so much to do and we were overwhelmed . I'm sure both of you felt the same way. And for somebody just to have a blatant discard towards a family for a loved one that passed away really hurts. I feel that firsthand . Thankfully my son is laid to rest in a beautiful cemetery up on Davis Street. I'm also going to speak about our current Mayor in the same sentence , disrespect betrayal . You know, when you have a park system through the county, McDade Park that has to shut down because there is so many kids that want to swim, it really hurts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 You know, we grew up having memories of pools. And for Nay Aug not to be opened until September of next year, that's going to be like 7 years. An 11 year old will become an adult before they could experience that pool once again. It's shameful on so many levels. Something that ended up in Sunday's paper concerned our safety, police department calls going up, frequency of the calls, nature of the calls. One thing that didn't hit the people on Sunday because unfortunately the Scranton Times is yesterday 's news tomorrow . There was a 20-year-old autistic kid that was assaulted and hit in the back of the head with the butt of a gun, all right, a little bit after 11. It was I guess an isolated innocent . There was a BOLO out for an orange vehicle , Jersey plates. You know, calls like this are never ending. Virgil Argenta didn't get a chance to speak tonight because he's down in South Carolina down at Myrtle Beach visiting his son who is a third generation police officer . He's down there because the test that we have is not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 in conformance with state standards . You know, the State Police have a test. But apparently with our test and all the money that we spent on it trying to recruit good applicants , we have 130 of them. Do you know how many are left? There's three steps left. There's 10. We'll be lucky if five shake out from that, 5 or 6 out of 130. I wish the Mayor would quit breaking things, all right? We're down to like a half a pool. It seems like she's trying to tank our city for some reason. It's not right. You know, I brought up several different things in front of this body like pavement and the pave cuts and the way that the utilities go about filling them. Why don't one of you perhaps have Mr. Voldenberg send the ordinance to the utilities so they could confirm with our standards . You know, we're putting money into things that we shouldn 't that are causing all of these problems with our streets . One of the biggest -- two of the biggest things, safety and infrastructure . People are afraid to even sit on their porch. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 You know, I brought up a curfew. Wilkes-Barre has had theirs in place for almost two years now. We have one of the best attorneys in the county that could actually take a look at Wilkes-Barre's curfew and see if it conforms with our standards . You know, deterrence is a huge thing. Also huge for us is our kids' future. And together with our railway system coming through and our Congress men saying that it's going to turn around in '28, I hope this body could turn around too because the Mayor is doing nothing for this city. And it's up to each one of you to do much better than her. You know, this time December 31st, 2022, you're fired. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . I know that it gets frustrating at times, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 know, we don't have, you know, we're down to one pool I think at this time up at Weston Park -- Weston Field. I think it's important to note though that a lot of these things have been left to go or rot for years. But there are plans in place. Connell Park pool is going to be replaced. The Weston Field pool is going to be replaced. And there's going to be a skate park put down there. We just had Oakmont Park was just transformed up in East Mountain . The work is present ly being done on Robinson Park on East Mountain . I have been watching the progress of that work right at Mountain Lake. It's going to be tremendous when that's done. Nay Aug, granted, the timeline is going to take a while. But the point is, it's a work in progress . And it is going to take some time, but I think there is a focus on trying improve parks in the city. I've seen a lot of paving and a lot of streets improved in the city recently . We've improved our finances . We're now BBB plus S and P rating. Two years ago, two and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 half years ago we were financially distress ed for 30 years. So and I understand we have a big city. There's lots of problem s. I'm not going to deny that. But there will always be problems no doubt. I thing we're blessed. We have on outstanding professional police department , outstanding professional fire department . We do need to replace some of our department heads that have been sitting there without leadership. That needs to be addressed . So I know that there are issues. I know that there are problems . But there are some good things happening in the city as well. And I think it would be disingenuous to not point out some of those great things that are happening. The infrastructure , all the work that's being done with the stormwater situation for East Mountain and the Keyser Valley and Minooka , all of those plans are in place. So I just feel it's important to point out some of the positive things that are happening in our city. So that's all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. So last week I posed a question about Ryerson Avenue and the impact when the Meadow Brook Flood Project starts. There was some questions . There was a lot of vehicle s that are on Ryerson Avenue and they are not going to be able to park on Ryerson once that work starts. So the question was, currently on Ryerson Avenue, there's 22 vehicle s. They use that street to park. From my understand ing there is going to be no parking on that street for at least 18 months was the timeline for that project . So the answer that we got was, the city is investigating adding parking on the north side of Delaware Avenue by making the street a one way from Washington Avenue to Penn Avenue and potentially having parking permits for the Ryerson resident s. The total duration of the project is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 18 months. But it will limit -- we're going to limit the contractor 's time to have Ryerson closed to a much shorter duration than that 18 months. But that's still being determined . They're going to continue to work with the city on accommodating those Ryerson Avenue residents . And I'll get that out to them as well. A few times I asked for updates on some of the FEMA project s in the city. We had flooding in 2018. We had 53 project s that were to be completed . We did have a timeline and a deadline for those. And we got several extensions on that. So about two months ago we were given the update that of the 53 project s, 25 of them were completed . So I just wanted to follow up with an update on this. Can we, Frank, can we ask the administration to provide an update are we running on time, will all project s be complete d by that last deadline we received , have we complete d all of those 25 projects ? And if we have not, do we feel that another deadline will be granted ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Can we also ask -- I know we got an answer on this last week. But we just can ask who is the person that is approving expenditure s at DPW? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that. MR. SCHUSTER : I sent an e-mail over about some storm sewers. I got somewhat of an update on the traffic light on the North Main Avenue. So we had some issues that came up with the traffic light on North Main Avenue and the expressway . The issue with the light I was told was fixed. And from my understanding there was two issues. There was a (inaudible ) shade along with a major portion of the box that needed to be replaced . The city DPW contractor made the repair but they had to drive a long distance on Saturday to get the parts. So these lights were installed less than six months ago. So my question is, Mr. Voldenberg , is the city -- is it the city's responsibility to fix this part and take on the cost or should PennDOT or the contractor be responsible for this if the administration can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 clarify who responsible for that fix on that light? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out. MR. SCHUSTER : I had a few other things, but that's all for tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do have a couple. So first off, I also take issue with having an outside firm or group handling the Christmas decoration s at Nay Aug Park. I don't know if you remember last year, but the Mayor got an assistant park director in the budget. I believe he should be tasked with that responsibility . My opinion , but, you know, if it's not broke why are we trying to fix it and throw money at it? So we'll have to see what it's going to cost. It's going to have to come to us anyway when the bidding process is over. So we'll see what happens there. Also, there's been a few complaints about tractors , you know, the part of the tractor -trailer that are being parked all over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 the city. I know you sent inquiry to the proper departments . But I just actually got another text right now. But I got calls last week. So there seems to be more parked everywhere throughout the city. So can you ask for an update with regards to what action is being taken or, you know, how it's going to be enforced , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . We had a large number of them removed from the South Scranton area recently . But I'll get a better fix on them. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then I also receive d a text -- let me see -- from a gentleman that said, you know, because we want to give some kudos out to DPW. The storms recently are ridiculous again. And he said, you know, I just want to let DPW know that there were two huge trees were hanging over the road really low into the power lines causing this huge safety issue in this gentleman 's neighbor hood. He said he called DPW yesterday around noon and they had a crew out here this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 morning on the hottest day of the year and cut them back to make them safe. He said -- he just wanted to, you know, relay that to, you know, me and then make sure DPW is, you know, recognize d for that. That is all I have right now. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . The Washburn Street Cemetery , this has been a headache for many, many years. I've looked back almost 30 years back and there doesn't seem to be a cure for it. I understand we could write citations daily. I think the problem is even if it goes to the magistrate and it's sent forward after that, they basically write a warrant and then what happens , we don't know unless they get pulled over for a violation or something , how do you find these people. And from what I'm told, there is no money there anyway to take from these people or whoever is running this. I did read some things that he had spoken with the Scranton Times, a Chris Kelly article I believe it was he hasn't got any money to do anything in the Washburn Street park. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 I don't know what the answer is. But we could write violations every day. But unfortunately , I don't believe that's the answer. I don't have the answer. But going after somebody that doesn't have anything , I don't know how we're going to do that. And I certainly don't want the city to take over a cemetery for cutting and stuff. So thank God there is people going out and doing it. I know in April -- another article , April of '93 there were over 200 people went out to that cemetery and they cleaned it. And there are a lot of city employees went out and cleaned that entire cemetery up. So this is an ongoing problem for 30 years from what I've seen. But hopefully we could figure something out to help with that. And there are other cemeteries that are taken care of by that person but they are not in good shape either. The cards, the gift cards, the $25 gift cards, first of all, I want to thank Gerrity 's Supermarket who is donating $5,000 worth of gift cards. This came about months ago, quite a few months ago at a neighborhood 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 meeting. And the Mayor had brought it. And the idea of this is they pick houses in the neighborhoods . And they pick the houses -- not the house that are taken care of by landscaper s or by, you know, professio nal yard care people. These are people that show incentive in their neighborhood and keep their properties and help their neighbor s and keeping everything clean. I don't know the exact details of the whole -- of the entire way they are going to do this program . But it's in the works. And it is a good idea. And there is always something we could do to appreciate our neighbor s that are taking care of their properties even if they aren't the richest people there. That is not what this is for. This is to thank the people that are actually doing it and helping their neighbor s and helping us keep our neighborhood s clean. And again, thank Gerrity 's for the $5,000 in gift cards. The Christmas lights when the -- went into the paper for an RFP, I was just as surprised as everyone . I didn't know that was coming. I had no idea. I did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 ask what it was for. I was told it is just to get an idea and if anybody would be interested in giving us a price on erecting them and taking them down. And they do need a lot of work. They do need a lot of maintenance . But we do also need a place to store them. Putting them in trailers pretty much destroys that equipment . We're slamming them in trailers every year. It's not safe for either parks workers or anyone to be doing that type of work. They get cut constantly on those things. There's a lot of work that needs to be done. Now, I'm not looking to get rid of this at all. I know it's going to go back up again this year. I don't know if parks is going to do it. But they are looking for a price right now. And that's as far as I know what's going on with that. One more thing, Mr. Voldenberg , I sent a message . The bottom of Richter Avenue by the pumps station where the baseball field is, somebody just dumped a pile of truck tires there if we could send that to DPW. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: And I believe that is all -- oh, an update from the attorney on the (inaudible .) And that is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

It's the beginning of getting a pool back up in Nay Aug Park which is -- I know it's not going to be completed until September of 2025, but we got to get started somewhere somehow . So I'm happy that this is happening finally . MR. SMURL: I also -- of course, I'm excited about Nay Aug Park. But the reason there are a lot of other things that have to be done at the park before we could actually start construction of the pools. There are pickleball courts going in. There's another playground up higher going in. There are multipurpose courts going in and among other things. But the main thing is the stormwater . Everything up there has to be caught now and taken down. And it's going to be -- that entire place has to be all piped underground to take care of all of the stormwater and naturally the waste water and the water and sewer supply. So that is a huge part before we could even touch starting the pool. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 hopefully -- I'm hoping that will be done this fall.

MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , a piece of this money to be allocated is the amount of $582,522.50. It's going to be reallocated to -- well, it was originally earmarked for auditing of ARPA funds. So if we could just ask before this comes into Seventh Order -- I'm trying to think about it because of the way it's worded in here. But do we no longer need this large amount of money for auditing of ARPA funds? I know we're moving that over to software for the police department . But if we could just get the reasoning of why it's -- we're reallocating such a large of money that was dedicate d to be audited . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 MR. SMURL: Okay. And I also -- I looked at this a number of times. A lot of this transfer and stuff, there's a lot of crosswalks being done. And this also includes some of the conduit wiring in the ground. And the software , it is actually for police, fire, DPW, LIPS and the entire city to try to tie everything back together . We could go over this more during the week. I did see somewhere in there, Tom, that it said they had enough money for the budget. But I didn't -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, it said they had enough money I think in the general . That's why I was slowly processing through that. I was trying to think of where it came from. But they did state that they had money for the auditing . I just wanted to know because it's such a large number just to get that clarified . MR. SMURL: Yeah, I did see it too. MR. SCHUSTER : And the things it's being allocated for I think are much needed. Recently I've had a lot of complaint s about the crosswalk s on Main Avenue in particular . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 I know one of those areas that we got a complaint about, there was a woman that was killed in the area last year.

SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so I had several questions I asked last week. We do have a city planner. We do have an assistant city planner . We have a zoning officer . I just wanted to clarify the duties of this contractor before we moved ahead with this legislation . I want a definitive answer on how many hours they would be working . So it is eight hours a month they will be working . But the answer I got was that Woodland Design Associates will assist the city's zoning officer in review of zoning aspects of the new ordinance , permit application s, zoning variance applications , subdivisions , land development plans. They will also assist the zoning officer to evaluate potential zoning violations and assist with preparing zoning violation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 notices . Woodland Design will also assist the city planner on as needed basis to review planning aspects of land development , subdivision s, flood plan permits, variance application s, occupancy of city rights of way, and define roles of the city planner , City Planning Commission . During collaboration with the city they're going to work on subdivision land development ordinance . All right. So that was the answer I did receive . So when it comes to this -- they are going to be working on a new subdivision and land development ordinance with city planning , with the City Planner and also with zoning. I was hoping to see that they were going to be helping with, you know, looking at those gaps that we've, you know, identified in the zoning ordinance . Did we get any kind of answer as to whether they would be -- MR. SMURL: At the meeting I had with the Mayor and Eileen Cipriani , I had asked if we would be able to speak with them on the concern s of the zoning when they came here for -- in caucus. And they said, yes, they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 would probably be able to give us advice on them too. My main concern was 600 square foot and, you know, and a bunch of things like that same as the zoning board members have the same thing. So as long as we have access to that and this is what they special ize in, I was okay with it. MR. SCHUSTER : They said they may be able to though. So we didn't get a definitive answer as to if they are going to definitively work with them to fix those, right. MR. SMURL: No, I believe they were going to wait for us to send it as an amendment to the zoning ordinance . MR. SCHUSTER : And then they would be able to review it. MR. SMURL: Yes. But I believe they are waiting for us to do that first. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Did we get anymore on what the subdivision and land development ordinance is going to be? MR. SMURL: That I didn't. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. All right. With that being said, I don't like to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 contractors . A lot of the early language here seems like it's helping the zoning officer with interpreting the ordinance and helping them with zoning violation s. But, you know, seeing that they are going to be working to develop a new ordinance and to update it, I would be in favor of this. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , this is another consultant , another helper, another assistant . It doesn't stop. I know it's 20 grand max. But, you know, 20 and there's one that was 40. And there's one that is 100. This money adds up. I believe that, you know, the people that work in this department are very capable and knowledgeable of zoning. They were part of coming up with the new zoning ordinance . And now they need help to understand it or decipher it? I'm sorry, because you know once we get this consultant , this consultant doesn't go away, folks. That's what happened . They stay and at the cost of the taxpayer s. So I'll be voting no for this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 MR. SCHUSTER : Before we move ahead with this, I would really like to make a motion to table this so we could get a definitive answer as to what this new ordinance that would be crafted is going to look like, what it makes up, what's incorporated into this ordinance . You know, looking at the consultant piece, that is how I feel about consultants , especially like I said with the early answer this seems like they're going to be helping the zoning officer to complete his job which seems they would be job duties of the zoning officer . But I really would like to make a motion to table this to see if we can get some more information on what we're looking to do with this new land development ordinance . MR. SMURL: Okay. So we have a motion to table. MR. SCHUSTER : Motion to table. MR. KING: I'll second that. MR. SMURL: We have motion to table and second. So do we want to do a roll call on this or do all in favor of the motion signify by saying aye? MR. KING: It should be a roll call. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 MR. SMURL: Roll call. All right. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : To table? MR. MCANDREW : No to table. I was a no for the -- I'm no to table. Thank you. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. So 3-1, motion is tabled. MR. SCHUSTER : And with that being said if we could get a definitive answer on whether they would be helping to update the 2023 zoning ordinance . MR. KING: I would like to support this. I think it is appropriate we get some more answers on this before final -- any final approval . MR. SMURL: Okay. MR.

MR. SMURL: What is the recommendation of the Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. KING: As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-F. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-F legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : EIGHTH ORDER. No business at this time. MR. MCANDREW : I'd like to speak before we adjourn. I just want to refer back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 to 6-A. And so I have -- I wasn't here last week when this was introduced. But I have in the past stated that some of our best ideas come from our resident s during public comment . And I've said that more than once and given credit where credit is due. So this piece of legislation or the amendment of the reserved parking program was brought to our attention by Mr. Coyne and also another resident that had -- was experiencing issues in front of her own property . So I give credit where credit is due. I wasn't here last week. But, you know, when this was brought forth to me, of course, I gave it to our Solicitor to do the research and go through the proper steps and procedure . So I really didn't get to speak to it. But I don't know if all of my colleagues are in favor, but I believe that the sign itself should have on it -- the signs aren't made yet. We have time to make sure that we, you know, dot our I's and cross our T's. But I believe the sign should have on it vehicle will be towed should appear on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 the sign because what might happen is, okay -- and the fine, I'm not happy reducing the fine. I think, you know, this disable d people have, you know, have to deal with a lot of stuff and throughout their day. And reducing the fine isn't much of a deterrent . But my issue is and others are, okay, what if somebody parks there for, okay, not an hour, five hours or a weekend or days? This happens all throughout the city where people will park a car and they're gone. So this poor resident would have to deal with that. So I know the key to all of this is going to enforcement with our fantastic police department . But I just believe that the towing piece of it should appear on the sign as an initial deterrent . You know, I guess -- and we could talk about the rest of the enforcement saying, you know, it's 50 whatever it's going to be $50 instead of 55. But, okay, $50 the first hour. After that it's towed. So I would like to see that communicated to administration . I don't know if my colleague s are in agreement . But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 just think we have to get it right. It has to be clear so it's a great understanding for the whole city what could happen or actually should happen. MR. KING: Mr. McAndrew , that's in Sixth Order, right? We just moved it to Seventh Order. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, it just left six, yeah. MR. KING: It will be a new ordinance so maybe we could put that request in too maybe for an amendment that would include that I think would be appropriate . MR. MCANDREW : Just have administration do it by next week, please. MR. SMURL: Yes. ATTY. GILBRIDE : So under the state the law that provides for this type of ordinance within the localities , the law provides that in order for towing to be open, there has to be a sign that says this vehicle will be towed. I've already been in discussion s with the legal department with regard to the -- how this will go forward from here once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 you pass it -- assuming you pass it. And they assure me that, in fact, particularly with regard to this new program of reserved handicap parking , the signs that will go will have the license plate number as is provided under the legislation as well as the -- you will be towed on the sign. MR. MCANDREW : That will appear on the sign? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yeah. And that is provide d for under the state authorization legislation . MR. SCHUSTER : We did have a little bit of a discussion about that on the question last week. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Well, thanks for the clarity . I just want to make sure it happens . MR. SMURL: Very good. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : All right. MR. SMURL: All right? MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SMURL: If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 MR.
