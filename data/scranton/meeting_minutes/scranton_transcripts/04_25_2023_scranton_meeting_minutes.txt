If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements this evening ? MR. MCANDREW : I have two quick ones. So this Thursday , April 27th from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., the Victor Alfieri Society will have their monthly luncheon. It's on North Main Avenue in West Side. And the menu consists of minestra or pasta and meatballs or half and half. The price is $12 for members , $14 for nonmembers . And also, St. Joseph's Center Baby and Children 's Pantry wish list, it's the Nay Aug Park collection . They're looking for diaper sizes 4, 5 and 6, pull-ups, 3T, 4T, 5T, baby bath towels and washcloths, baby bottles , baby wash, baby lotion, etc. They also need some formula , fruits and vegetables . No clothing at this time. I think they have enough. So they want you to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 focus on this. And it's May 6th and 7th from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. You could drop off at the community room which is the old concession stand if you're not aware. And you enter Nay Aug from Olive Street. And it's sponsored by the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority . And that is all I have. MR. KING: Anyone else have any announcements ? I think it's important to announce that the Sprucin ’ Up Scranton initiative that the City of Scranton has just recently announced . There's going to be cleanups for the month of May starting May 5th continuing all Fridays in May. The dates and times and locations are as follows : May 5th they're going to do Connor's Park in South Scranton from 9 to 1 p.m.; on May 12th in North Scranton they're going to do Weston Park from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.; on May 19th in West Scranton , they're going to do Novembrino Park from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m.; and on May 26th in East Scranton , Nay Aug Park Community Room from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. That's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Do we have a date for a public caucus on the 2021 audit? MR. KING: I don't at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : And has the Mayor made the decision on implementing the 10 percent penalty clause? MR. KING: If she has, she hasn't informed me yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : She's been busy. She had to go to Ireland . Why hasn't the legislation come up yet for the new auditor ? MR. KING: I think we asked that question last week. Did we get an answer on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : The BA's Office advised we should have it by the end of the month. MS. HODOWANITZ : This month or next month? MR. VOLDENBERG : This month, Joan. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. And the DPW contract seven-plus months is still not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 on the website . Any status on that or are the lawyers still dotting the I's and crossing the T's? MR. KING: Did we get any updates on that yet, Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : As of yesterday , the deputy solicitor was going to make a phone call to the labor counsel . I haven't heard back as of today. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Speaking of the labor counsel , I see in the Controller 's Report that last month we paid Ufberg our labor counsel $84,355.36. Now he's been working on labor contracts for the police and fire since November of 2021. You might want to ask what the running tally is because the meter is still running . It's going to be a bit of a bill. And let's see what else? Oh, yes, I see that Mr. West is leaving us. And they're looking for a new Business Administrator . I would suggest that we some have somebody right in-house that is well qualified and that's our finance manager Matthew Domines '. Matt spent a couple years of working 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 for PEL as a project manager and finance analyst . He knows all about municipal operation s and budgets and special fund budgets and budgetary performance , especially he's been upstairs for, what, more than a year? He has his law degree. He's well informed . Every time I attend a pension board meeting , there he is asking pertinent questions and taking copious notes. I think he would be a perfect fit. Failing him, maybe you could get Dave Bulzoni to do another act here. Have we ever gotten an explanation of what happened with the keygate incident how a man got ahold of the keys to City Hall? MR. KING: No, I believe he was in two other buildings before he arrived here. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, he was in the Forum. He was in the Scranton Public Library . MR. KING: And the Cultural Center I believe as well. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. KING: And then he -- I think that an office may have been left open. I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 not sure if that's where it occurred or not. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I mean, the public can't get in, except he -- I should talk to him and figure out how he got in because I can't get in. Speaking of getting in, you know, there's a sign on the back door here that the public enters, no food or drink in Council Chambers and three explanation points. But yet, you all have bottles of water which brings me to the all gender bathroom . Now, last week remember we were here for, what, five hours? And at one point in time I had to go use the all gender bathroom . And I'm telling you, I will never go in that all gender bathroom again because guess what, the seat was up and somebody -- I don't think it was a woman had piddled all over the porcelain and the floor. Now, if the administration wants an all gender bathroom , they need to drop the other shoe and find a way to keep it clean and present able for public use. I don't know. It's one thing to be politically correct . It's another thing to be clean and hygienic . And I don't know -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 ladies, I'm going to hold it until I go home. MR. KING: Mrs. Hodowanitz , please address Council . I'm sorry. Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm telling you, I'm going to hold it until I go home because I'm not going in there again until you tell me it's clean and present able. It was before it became all gender. So all you guys, your mothers didn't teach you very well. That's all I have for tonight . MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Last week when I was in the bathroom a guy walked in. Suppose a woman was sitting on the seat -- toilet? That should be eliminated . Enough. Mr. King, you did you find out what I asked you last week about at 1420 Mylert Avenue, the State Police and the Scranton Police raided a building owned by the City of Scranton rented out to a bikers' gang for drugs, prostitution ? MR. KING: Frank, were we able to get the information on that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. KING: I'm asking Mr. Voldenberg if we were able to get information on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I reached out. And we are awaiting on the report. I believe it's a restrictive report involving the State Police. So I'm awaiting the report. MS. FRANUS: Well, many people in City Hall certainly know about it. So you're either part of the coverup or you should certainly -- Mr. King, you could have asked the Mayor and found out the answer to that in three seconds , just like you could have asked her if she going to give the penalty for the audit. It's going to take you three months to ask her a yes or no question . Okay, now as far as the zoning vote, isn't it very convenient that you want to have this -- possibly after the election ? Let me tell you, Jessica Rothchild , Smurl should never be elected to City Council again. Joseph Matyjevich I believe is running for Council and two Republicans . Vote for them. Do not vote for Jessica or Smurl. They are not for the people. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 They are for Geisinger . So if you are keeping this vote to keep it after the election, it speaks volumes . So we'll find out, won't we. You haven't taken care of these people at all. Now, Mr. Schuster , did you find out about the overtime for DPW for three months, $191,000? MR. SCHUSTER : I did not. The information that we got was what the administration sent down to us so -- MS. FRANUS: It hasn't been sent down to you because they don't want you to know they have no reasons . MR. KING: We got an e-mail today actually . MS. FRANUS: Pardon me? MR. KING: We received an e-mail today outlining what they -- by month, didn't we, Frank? It listed by month what they utilized overtime for. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did. We receive d it today. And I could provide it to Miss Franus. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MS. FRANUS: Now, let me ask you this. Have you paid attention to your water bill at all, Council , seeing as Council voted for the Sewer Authority to be sold to the water company . Do you pay attention to your water bills at all? Do you? MR. KING: Yeah. MS. FRANUS: That was a question . Anybody want to answer that? MR. KING: Yes, we do. We pay attention . MS. FRANUS: And what do you think about it? MR. KING: I don't particularly care for it. MS. FRANUS: Well, you voted for it. You voted for the sale. Have you considered contacting the PUC? MR. KING: I voted for the sale? MS. FRANUS: This Council . Council is responsible . MR. KING: Okay. MS. FRANUS: Council . You're part of Council . MR. KING: I know that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MS. FRANUS: So I'm asking you since it bothers you, Mr. King, have you or any other Council members written a letter to the PUC complain ing about the rates? MR. KING: No. MS. FRANUS: The rates were suppose d to be for everybody in Pennsylvania , most of Pennsylvania . But yet the PUC ruled on it. They said only Scranton and Dunmore have to pay the rates, nobody else, just Scranton and Dunmore . A friend of mine, a woman, she has a husband and a small child. Her bill was $280, $280 because of the high rates. But yet, you won't write a letter to the PUC complaining to take care of the people. Will you do that? Will you all write a letter to the PUC complaining to take care -- to take care of the resident s and ask them why it's only Scranton and Dunmore ? Yes, no? MR. KING: I will, yeah. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm happy to -- MR. KING: I have no problem doing that. MS. FRANUS: Okay. Well, next week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 I'll ask you if you did it. Okay, another thing you're going to have Rubicon come in here possibly next week. They were already here. The people you need to bring in is Scott Pietreface the Director and Chris Smith the Supervisor of DPW. They're the ones that are not using Rubicon . Rubicon showed them what to do. They just don't want to. At 6:00 in the morning Mr. Pietreface and Mr. Smith should have every route wrote on every truck before they leave that building . Every route should be in every truck showing where they're going to be all day long. That's the purpose of Rubicon to make sure they work all day long from 6 to 2, half hour for lunch. But they don't want to because the union guys don't want it. So the Director and the Supervisor don't want to go against the union. So I'm sure that Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew are going to say to Rubicon next week, how come you're not saving the city money? It's not them. It's the Director and the Supervisor and the union guys. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 God knows the people in Scranton want them to work all day. But that's not happening . So I'll be waiting for answers next week. And please do not vote for Jessica Rothchild or Smurl. He is there for a reason. The Mayor got him appoint ed to this Council for a reason to do her bidding . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Charles Cortese . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , will you confirm that caucus next week? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we haven't, not for next week. They have yet to give us a date. MR. SCHUSTER : When they come in, will Scott and Chris also be invited? MR. VOLDENBERG : They will be, the Director and the Supervisor . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. CORTESE : Good evening , Council members . My name is Charles Cortese , Wheeler Avenue. A question asked last week was how would anyone in Council Chambers like to have a 100 foot high parking garage in your backyard . All anyone heard was crickets , just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 silence spoke volumes indicating your approval by all in attendance. All we heard from Geisinger spokesperson was that they cannot proceed with any studies or planning until they get the zoning approved. That was Geisinger 's well rehearsed and synchronized battle cry. If any of the studies were to be nonconclusive then Geisinger CMC -- excuse me. If the zoning is approve d and the traffic study indicate s that the streets around Geisinger CMC cannot support the traffic , then what? Will Geisinger request a right of eminent domain from the government or its agent to expropriate private property around the hospital for the use and destroy additional properties which equates to additional tax loss to the city? If any of the other studies were to be nonconclusive , Geisinger CMC can proceed because they have the approved zoning ordinance in their back pocket to do as they wish now and any time in the future. Geisinger spokesperson put on a tremendous show with fancy graphs and charts.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 They danced all around the meaningful questions asked by you Council members . Their dog and pony show signified nothing . Their attempt to intimidate us with the horror stories was not successful . All hospitals have their share of horror stories . After all, hospital s are for the sick and injured , not a hotel for the healthy and the well. Geisinger spokesperson last week was non-sympathetic to the psychological stress this proposed garage will have on the residents of the Nay Aug area community . Let us not be intimidate d by Geisinger . They tried to inform us with all sorts of statistics which can be manipulated to convey a distorted or biased message . They will and have used a citywide influence and threats to expand elsewhere as a means to proceed with the ill-conceived parking expansion . Geisinger spokesperson and employees who spoke to Council and champion ed their cause never mention ed that we, the Nay Aug area community , never opposed to the expansion . But we were against a 100 foot high parking garage.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I firmly believe that omission was intention al to enforce Council decision on the zoning ordinance . I have stated emphatically that we are not against the hospital 's expansion but are against the 100 foot high parking structure in our residential neighborhood . As I have said many times to Council , parking garages can be built with future expansion in their design without destroying the existing structure . This is called engineering . Let Geisinger ask for a variance for expansion if warranted . All we are asking for is a compromise to reduce the height of the garage from 100 feet to 45 feet. It is only a 55 foot reduction . It is not like we're asking the sun to rise in the west and set in the east or for the river to run upstream . Council members , now is the time in front of your voting members of your community to show them where your priorities are. Are they with the taxpaying resident s and the citizens of Scranton ? Do not abandon us for Geisinger to build a 100 foot high wall for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 preconceived concept of future influx of patient s without the consider ation of a compromise . Each vote you cast for Geisinger to proceed with this 100 foot high monstrous garage is the sound of the pulling of the funeral bells for the death of the historical Nay Aug community . Be the great progress ive Scranton Council members that has the wisdom of Solomon to reach a compromise that would be agreeable to all concerned . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Cortese . Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And sometimes I come up here a little bit hesitant to speak about what I'm going to speak about but I'm going to speak. Number one, I wanted to thank Mr. Smurl and his team that cleared the lot that I had issues with. And I had asked his team to clear the lot at Colfax and Gibson Street. When I left for church on Sunday morning they were there. I leave for church at 9:00 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 they were there cleaning . When I came back from church which was about quarter of 12, and there was even more people there than were there in the morning and they were doing quite a job. So I do thank that team. And it makes me know that things can change if you ask. The second thing I wanted to talk about was the Shade Tree Commission and as you all know I'm a member of that commission as well. And we're going to be honoring the Scranton frontline responders who were so critical during the COVID-19 who took care of the community during that stressful time. And we're going to have a celebration to honor them on Friday, April the 28th at 11:00 at the Novembrino splash pad. And we're just looking to thank them for their services . We will be present ing a plaque that has been engraved with their name -- not their name but some words that we put together . And that will be installed there as well as well as some trees that are going to be planted there in their honor. So we're hoping that, you know, people can come and honor them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 There will be representatives from Geisinger there as well as regional because those are the Scranton hospitals . And they will be there as well as other elected official s we're hoping that we invited to that presentation . So that's my second thing I wanted to talk about. And then the third thing that I want to talk about was last week. And I think most of you knew I was upset about the way that you voted last week on Resolution 7-C 221, 2023 and that it was ratified and approved with your outstand ing question s. And I didn't think that was very fair to me and to the general public who heard Mr. McAndrew identify excellent questions , how would the homes be identified as to which homes will be tested for lead, is it a voluntary program , what happens with the results from that study? And my questions were, who will pay for the removal of the lead in these homes? And will children be tested if lead is identified in the homes as well as pets? Also, I did go and pull the resolution on that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 particular -- 75 pages so I couldn't print it all. But I did print out those things that were -- I thought were critical to your decisions to make on this. And I'm going read one of the pages. It's on page 21 of the resolution : "Lead is naturally occurring metal that can cause negative health effects . People are exposed to lead by breathing in lead dust, eating lead chips and ingesting contaminated food and water. Children younger than six years are more likely to be exposed to lead dust due to their hand to mouth behavior . Because of their developing nervous systems , children younger than six years old are particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead exposure since lead is easy absorbed in the nervous system. Even low levels of lead in the blood can cause developmental delays, difficulty learning , behavioral issues and neurological damage. The effects of lead poisoning can be permanent and disabling . The City of Scranton is interested in undertaking lead-based 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 inspections , risk management and targeted single family occupied dwelling units. That really blew my mind when it said single family -- build before 1978 and in which a child under the age of six years of age as well as pregnant ladies. I didn't realize that pregnant ladies are also affected by this lead. The city also plans to undertake a targeted outreach campaign to educate resident s on the risks of exposure to lead. And this RFP does not cover the remediation service s. So those things are what's going to happen with the results according to this is not covered. Let me just finish my last sentence . And my question tonight is, were the questions address ed? Can the answers be read so that I as well as the general public can know and be educated on how lead can affect our children ? Anything when it comes to children I'm going to jump right on the bandwagon. And so when you voted last week, I just -- I just was just taken back that you would handle it so loosely when there is so many critical effects with lead poisoning and the unanswered questions . That's all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . MR. MCANDREW : Norma, I have the answers to your questions . I'll report out in Fifth Order. MS. JEFFRIES : You're going to report on them. MR. MCANDREW : In Fifth Order I'll read you the answers of the questions I posed. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it because I just think that the public needs to know. MR. MCANDREW : I agree. MR. KING: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident . You guys have a tough decision to make tonight . I don't envy you. But I could sympathize with both parties in this instance . I think there should be compromises made. The people that live in this area have a good argument . But I know firsthand that the CMC has a good argument too for expansion . Approximately a year and a half ago, my mother-in-law who was fighting blood cancer was taken to CMC ER with Covid. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 It was about 8:00 at night. She was out in the hallway in a bed as was said last week it happens to a lot of people until like almost eight in morning . She was like 12 hours in the hallway . And she has since passed. But that's just one example . And approximately about a month ago, my wife had a little accident in the house. She tripped over our dog's bone and fell and she had a glass in her hand, broke the glass, cut her thumb and cut a tendon in her thumb. So we went up there. I rushed her up. If you saw the blood on the floor you would think there was a murder in the house. But they took her in quick but they just wrapped it up, sent us back to the waiting room. We waited about five hours until she could get a room. And finally long story short, the doctor came and stitched it up. They took x-rays. They said your tendon might be cut. So two weeks later she needed surgery . But she's healing now. But we waited from 10:00 at night until 5 in the morning . They're understaffed. They don't have enough 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 beds. So I could see their argument to that point. They definitely need expansion . So I hope there could be a compromise . But I wouldn't want to be in your guy's shoes. Next thing, subject I talked about here before. All of these shooting s in our country , the last week was terrible . I'm sure everybody heard it on the news this young African American gentleman went to a wrong house and he got shot looking for his brother . Same thing last week, a women turned around in somebody 's driveway and shot her. It's unbelievable . Then a couple of days later in North Carolina , this young father was playing with a six-year-old daughter basketball and the ball went in the neighbor 's yard. He went in the house and shot them. It's out of control . Thank God the girl just got grazed on her cheek. I just heard on the news today the father got released from the hospital today. But these shootings are just out of control . Something has to be done. Our President is for gun control . The Republicans won't pass it. As long as they are tied with the NRA, we're never going to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 gun control . That's it. I talked about this last year. When we first bought our house we had coal heat. We no longer have coal heat. And I had ash cans. When I did yard work I put all of this stuff from the yard work in the ash cans and put it out in the yard. Last year a garbage man took all my ash cans. They were beat up a little bit. But they had no right to take them. Now, I did yard work the other day. I had to put all the stuff in garbage bags. So I think DPW owes me a couple containers . I said this last year and I never heard a word. So maybe I'll just go down and ask for a couple containers . I don't think that was right that they took those ash cans and nothing was done about it. Lastly, is there any word for what's going to happen on our corner where I live, any update on that? MR. KING: Did you get any update on that, Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet. I could follow up with the DPW Director tomorrow . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. KING: If you would, I appreciate that. MR. SPINDLER : I have to go down there and see if I could get containers , maybe I'll look into that myself. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Kathleen McDowell . MS. MCDOWELL : Hi, my name's Kathleen McDowell . I own a property at 1119 Jackson Street. On January 21 this year I got a letter of condemnation from the City of Scranton saying that my apartment was vacant and abandoned which it is not. I for a week called code enforcement , sent a letter to Dr. Rothchild and finally the next week got a call back asking if I could meet them at the property , which I did. I let two code enforcement officers go in, take pictures , look at the property and see that I was only painting , tiling the bathroom. I wasn't doing anything that I shouldn 't be doing. I had an electrician scheduled to come in February that is licensed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 with the City of Scranton . And after that I called back because nobody called me back again for another week. And finally I think it was Andrew Sunday called me back, told me they were sticking with the condemnation . When I asked under what grounds they said, well, you don't have any utilities on. I did have electric heat. But when the city condemned my building , they pulled my electric meter without my consent , which happened to be the week before the coldest day of the year here in Scranton when it was 8 below zero. They did allow me to go in and winterize my property . Thank you. Since then, they made me pay a $250 fee to have NAIC I think is how it's spelled come in and do an actual inspection of the property . I allowed them to do that also. They said I had to have the fire chief come. I let the fire chief come. To this day I have not gotten one return phone call from Tom Oleski after at least 25 phone calls, at least 13 e-mails. I have hired an attorney who has sent him a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 written letter, no response . So I'm asking here today what is the next step since no one will call me and tell me what I'm suppose d to do? I'm a widow. I'm 60 years old. I am doing the work myself so it is not a process where I'm having somebody that I could afford to spend $10,000 for somebody to come in and paint for me when I'm quite able to do it myself. But now I can't get the electrician in because the building is condemned and nobody from code enforcement will call me back. And now we are three months later. MR. MCANDREW : I inquired about this on your behalf to Mr. Walker. And, Mr. Voldenberg , we received two e-mails, one -- the latest one says from Mrs. Cipriani she will follow up and that was two weeks ago. So could you follow up again and inquire again what does Mrs. McDowell actually need to do because you're getting no direction . MS. MCDOWELL : None. I have actually called and begged somebody to give me -- tell me what to do next -- MR. MCANDREW : You shouldn 't have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 do that any longer. MS. MCDOWELL : -- what is the next step? Exactly . I pay my taxes. I would like to know what is the next step and what constitute s a condemnation in this city? what -- because I'm working on my -- and that was the other thing. When I went to the City Hall and I asked code enforcement why they condemned it, the next person told me, well, somebody complained that I was working on the building . Then it's not abandoned or vacant, is it, if you're working on it. So you're lying. Let's face the truth here and tell me where are you (inaudible ) us for money because honestly I paid the one fee. And the next thing they said, well, it's a $10,000 bond that you have to put up to the City to continue working . I'm not paying a $10,000 bond. I'm not doing anything I'm not suppose d to be doing. What constitutes a condemnation and where could I see those records ? Where in the city, tell me. I will go there. I have done a lot of research . I will go there tomorrow and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 read them. MR. MCANDREW : Well, let's see if we can get them. I'll get them for you. Okay, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Let's get some answers because obviously you haven't gotten any. MS. MCDOWELL : Obviously , because who's going to pay the rent that I haven't gotten for three months now? DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree that you deserve a call back. MS. MCDOWELL : One phone call back is all you got to do. Just tell me where I go. DR. ROTHCHILD : I will make sure that it does. And, you know, and all of your research the fact that you haven't been able to find what constitutes a condemnation , we need to have that on the website and we need to have that posted so other people do know what their rights are. MS. MCDOWELL : And who will put the meter back on my building ? Is that going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the City's responsibility since you pulled it off? DR. ROTHCHILD : I'll find out about that as well. MR. MCANDREW : We'll get those answers , I promise . MR. SCHUSTER : Hang on one second. Mr. Voldenberg , do we have Mrs. McDowell 's contact number? MS. MCDOWELL : Everybody has my contact number but I'll give it gladly again. What are the qualifications for your code enforcement officer to literally walk down the street and condemn a property ? What are his qualifications ? I met the young man who wrote the letter. So I would just like to know what his qualification s were for doing that. What do you have to possess to be a code enforcement officer that could condemn a property in this city? MR. MCANDREW : There is a certification process . MS. MCDOWELL : There is. He is certified , okay.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. MCANDREW : I believe so. DR. ROTHCHILD : I believe there's a certain -- when they're hired there's a certain grace period that they have initially to be able to prepare and take the certification test that the city then pays for and then they are required to pass that test. They might get two tries. And if they don't, then they lose employment or they could, you know, get another -- find another position within the city. MS. MCDOWELL : Okay. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. McDowell . We'll try to get those answers for you. MS. MCDOWELL : I appreciate that. MR. SCHUSTER : If you could leave your number with Allison . MS. MCDOWELL : Sure. MR. KING: Tyler Day. MR. DAY: Good evening , Members of Council , President King. Unfortunately , I wasn't able to be here last week because of work. I did watch the presentation from Geisinger and the public comments after on the YouTube channel . And I wanted to voice my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 opinions in support of my neighbors in the Hill Section . I want to voice my opposition to the high rise parking garage that's looking to be built on Colfax. I certainly understand the public's frustration with the hospital right now. And I'm not too happy with them myself. CMC though, they are a hospital and they are a business . And right now they are acting in their self-interest . This is why we elect city leaders. We have the expectation that our city leaders , City Council , the Mayor will act in the best interest of the residents and will represent the interest of the residents in situations like this. Instead , whether it's tonight , two weeks from now, two months from now, it does look that Council is prepared to side with Geisinger . And the one thing that frustrates me is that no matter what resolution you come to, whether it's the 100 feet or 40 feet, it's still going to be a lose-lose for the residents of the Hill. They will still have a giant parking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 monstrosity across from their house. The homes that were on Colfax that are no longer there no matter what happens , they are off the tax rolls. And our elected officials should not put us in a situation where the best outcome is a lose-lose. But local elections have consequences and this is where we're at. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Day. Chuck Wasko. MR. WASKO: Good evening , Council . I know I'm not supposed to have this, right? I apologize . I'm a Scranton resident my whole life. And I'm here tonight because I wanted to speak about the Geisinger situation . And I want to propose something to you gentlemen that if they want to come here and build and interrupt these lives of these people that live here in the city, why don't we put a pool in? I would like to ask each one you guys that are on Council and women, what your thought s are on a pool in this city. Mr. Smurl, what would you say? MR. SMURL: My thought s on a pool in the city? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. WASKO: Yeah, what I'm concerned is I work with juvenile s. I'm a drug and alcohol counsellor . And I think that there's not enough for the juvenile s to do in this area. MR. SMURL: Absolutely . I'm for a splash pad, enlarging the bathhouse and a swimmable pool. MR. WASKO: Because at one time we used to have one in each section of the Scranton area. So we do not have one. So you're for the pool. Mr. Schuster , how about you? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm also for a pool. I've expressed it several times. MR. WASKO: I'm aware of that and I appreciate it. MR. SCHUSTER : I would be for a pool. I would think about a splash pad. And I would like to look at the bathhouse to see what we can do there, whether it needs to be enlarge d or not because it was built in I think 2004. So it's pretty new. MR. WASKO: Can we all agree they really tore down that Nay Aug pool pretty 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 quick? Sad, isn't it? Mr. King, how about you? MR. KING: 100 percent for a pool. MR. WASKO: Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Absolutely . MR. WASKO: Miss Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree as well. I always have and I've been on record saying that we need a pool. MR. WASKO: What can we do to bring that to the city then besides having Weston Field? Can we ask Geisinger to maybe, like, beautify the park and build a pool for us? I think it's a great idea. I mean, you know, it's -- and I get it, gentlemen , ladies, I know it's a hard decision because business is business . But for the taxes that we pay, we should get something for it. So let's make a pool. Let's build a pool in this city and give something for the juveniles to do in this area because a splash park is not cutting it. Second, I would like to know the young lady that's trying to fix up her property , here's my question . Mr. Smurl, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 are familiar with myself because I have a half of a double. And the other half was condemned for years. And nobody from the city seemed to care what I went through . The same person's house is now on a condemnation but he's not taking care of it. So my question is, what is it -- what quantifies -- what constitute s a condemned house which I know we're going to get the answers ; and what are we doing with the demolition properties that have been on demolition list for years? Does the individual that owns the house pay for the demolition or does the city get grants? I'm very curious . MR. SMURL: The $10,000 bond was for -- suppose d to be for the demolition of the house if you could get that from the people. But there's a lot of information on the City's website about the Uniform Construction Code. If you look up -- just go on Scranton 's website and you look up Uniform Construction Code, it will tell you in detail what the rules are and how it's to be done. The problem with the housing and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 all of that -- I'm taking up your time. Is that okay? MR. WASKO: Yeah. MR. SMURL: Okay. The problem with demolition is, the boards, we can condemn houses. We can put them on the condemnation list. We can put them on the demolition list. Then they take them to Central Court. And then they seem to get kicked back to the city two to three times, prime example the house in Green Ridge. That's coming back again. I put that on the demolition list probably eight years ago. And it's still coming back to haunt us. So the judges that keep sending these things back and the -- your local enforcement , there's nothing more we can do. You write the citation s. They don't pay them. You send it to be a demolition , they appeal it in court. It gets sent back 10 times. MR. WASKO: I understand that. But here's my question . Do we have a program that's in place that we can maybe put in to help rehabilitate some of these house and help the citizen s? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. SMURL: There's money for first time home buyers. There is money to rehabilitate stuff. But if they're condemn ed or they're under demolition order, nobody wants to buy it. MR. WASKO: Well, I'm trying to say, like, this young lady is trying to fix hers. So I'm just thinking -- MR. SMURL: I understand that. MR. WASKO: You know, but, I mean, as far as that is concern ed, like, I would like to see if a house is condemned or demolished that maybe the city could assist in rehabilitating and in giving so much time to -- MR. SMURL: There are grants for purchasing homes in the city, first time home buyers and there's other programs . I really don't know what happened with this house if there was somebody there and it was condemned while somebody was there, I think we have a problem there. MR. WASKO: Well, I'm stuck with a situation of having half a double and the other side is not taken care of. And I feel like -- MR. SMURL: It goes back and forth.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. WASKO: Yeah, and it's frustrating on my end because I'm trying to pay my taxes and do the right thing and the other side is dilapidate d and my value gets depreciated and then everyone else's does too. MR. SMURL: And send a letter to the judge that keeps sending it back on the city to decide. We decided. MR. WASKO: I have one other thing too I wanted to talk about. The splash parks, when we have those, do we have to have somebody there to pay to watch the kids? MR. KING: I believe they have people there, yeah. MR. WASKO: Yeah, but is it necessary ? MR. SMURL: I believe you need somebody on site at all times, yes. Yes. MR. WASKO: And I understand that. But I guess what I'm getting at is, I would really love to see a pool in this area for the kids, the juvenile s and something for them to do. MR. KING: Entire Council is in support of that. Thank you, Mr. Wasko. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. WASKO: Thank you. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I'm sorry, Council , I'm not used to so many people. It's hard for me to get up here after so many beautiful , intelligent comments tonight . But, of course, we don't know how you guys are going to vote really. These people are all talking -- they're speaking after they're locking the gate after the horse is out. That should have been -- all this conversation could have and should have been going on when house after house was in the paper on Colfax being bought up by this atrocious situation . But I saw something in the paper the other day last week. It said Geisinger claimed that they're losing millions of dollars . Didn't you all see it? Well, how can they have millions of dollars in a building fund and millions of dollars to buy houses and pay for all of the expense of lawyers and so forth and lose millions of dollars ? To me, this is their Achilles heel. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 There is something wrong with their financial being. I think it ought to be investigated by the state from top to bottom. I don't think they could explain all of this to my satisfaction because I did try to find out a little bit. You don't get nowhere on the phone. But like I said, I think this is their Achilles heel and it ought to be investigated by the state immediately . To change the subject , I'm in Mr. Ware's district . If I get a ticket or something , I don't know how I could go before him. And Miss Hayes is over the department that absolutely caused all my problems and she never lifted a finger to address anything that I've brought before you people. I said that Oleski waived -- I showed you pictures , waived dozens of tax forms on the houses. And it's not up to him to do that. Miss Hayes come to my house last week asking to vote for her. And I let her talk to Roseann. Then she went next door. On next door's porch is the couch that I got fined for. And still how can she run for an office 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 when she's not taking care of the least bit small bit of business concerning my one block? I'm not trying to get her to take up my whole neighborhood . I haven't decided what to do yet about -- I got -- Mr. Ware fined me. Mr. Sunday lied in court, refuses to come in here and make any -- confront me. Anyway, I said outside the lesser of two evils is still evil. So I don't know which one I'll vote for. To show you I'm being fair about it, Roseann put a sign in the yard and plans to vote for Miss Hayes. So -- so goes it. And again, try to investigate Geisinger 's finances because there's something going on that's real large here that they are trying to avoid further investigation of. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Dave Rinaldi . MR. RINALDI : Good evening , Council . It's been a long road to get here. Anyway, I have some comments . One, I wanted to talk about the caucus that you had with Geisinger . I thought that several Council people had some very good questions that, of course, were not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 answered . I have to say I was a little disappointed . They continually say that they had conversations with the neighborhood and no one seems to know what they were. I've asked that question numerous times. I certainly was disappoint ed. And I don't mean to pick on you, Dr. Rothchild , but you've been to the meeting s of the neighborhood association . And you know that they have express ed to you the fact that there has not been any communication . So there was misrepresentations there. And as a result of that what I want to do and I -- this came to me and I hear you don't have anything for your caucus next week. I would like to request that Council caucus with our neighborhood association . We'll pick some representative s and they'll sit at the table and they'll proceed to give you their unified thoughts on this and their plans. One of the things I think we could do is I know myself I could give you an alternate development plan for that area which will make everything better, cost Geisinger more but they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 are a billion dollar corporation . So I'm asking you to keep the ordinance on the table and schedule us for a caucus before the meeting next week. With that said, I also want to make a comment about the representative from the 114th Legislative District from Pennsylvania . Now, just to show you what kind of inside baseball is being played here, I walked in with her last week. I went up to sign in. And there were several names on there. But hers was first. Someone signed her in. That was set up. Now think about this. Probably the greatest gerrymandering that ever happened was putting Waverly with Green Ridge. It happened the last time. We have the establishment Democrats , the original ones that moved to Waverly and the ones in Green Ridge. She came here that representative and said she represents the people of Scranton . Well, our representative up on the hill is Kyle Donahue . You didn't see anyone else. You saw a performance art. I'm very disappoint ed in that. I'm not sure in all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 seriousness about her democratic bona fides after of that. And I know she'll be up next year. So maybe there will be someone to challenge her. Lastly, I want to say very briefly that I think it's crystal clear that this is about the people versus property . Geisinger wants to control the property . And the people that live there are just an impediment to what they want to do. The design process should have started with us all sitting down, all the stakeholders and where are the best places for what they need. But they didn't do that. They hemmed and hawed. They had a plan. They didn't show us anything . We thought that we had at least a semblance of an agreement . And then January 6th happened . Planner King changed the map, changed the map. Nobody knew it was going to happen, no input, no nothing . I asked them at the Planning Commission who did you talk to? Who told you to do that? There's no answer. I mean, we've asked Geisinger . We've asked Council , who exactly did you talk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 to? We just don't get any answers . So I'm hoping -- I'm hoping since there are -- there's going to be some discussions of some amendments that you will give the residents the courtesy of allowing them to come in as a group and caucus next Tuesday . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Rinaldi . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is I called the Mayor's office this week and asked if the Mayor was going to send up legislation and return the public component of the PEG channel public access to ECTV. And I was told that -- by Council that, well, maybe in the next week depending on how this legislation comes up for the Mayor. But, you know, I just think it's very important to return that. But the only thing I had here is we had a little discussion here about the condemned properties in the city. And I would like to say that somebody needs to look at the Department of Licensing and Inspections because what they're doing in the city is they're condemning homes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 and they're holding to the building code of today even though the houses were built in 1950. When somebody gets their home condemned , they need to immediately do an appeal to the building appeals board and forego the -- just stop the process right there because you can't hold a building to a code it was never designed to meet. And all these condemn ed properties are just a conduit to move federal money and grant money into other people's pockets . It's been going on in this city for so long. I've been coming to this Council meetings for 37 years now. I've watched all the silly corrupt politics . I've seen almost everything . And, you know, the people here have to realize one thing because I think they missed something here that's going on. This is spot zoning. The whole zoning map is being rewritten to give cover to Geisinger so they could build this addition to their hospital . And it's illegal to do spot zoning changes in Pennsylvania . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Now, I have to say that the residents of this city have done themselves no favor over my whole lifetime because they have never had any backbone to stand up for themselves ever in my whole life. Now, when we talk about public pools, Novembrino , the Capouse Avenue pool, they were closed because of neglect by the city. Ozzie Quinn wanted to go look at what the deficiencies were long ago. What we have is corruption on level that's not just feasible to continue . You know, you look at things that have just happened in this city. You watch what the police and the firemen did to people who were getting a double pension . But when I was here when Mr. Doherty was Mayor, he wanted all the city employees to take an early retirement . He was going to double their pension . Mr. Gervasi and others from the public service unions came here. I watched them cajole people to take an early retirement . You're not going to get a deal like that again. And then I watched later employees cannibalize 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 their own former members, okay. I mean, what's going on in this city my whole lifetime has been nothing but corruption . We've listen to -- we've listened to Council talk about how, oh, a prior Council did that. No, this is a continuance . It's called possession , okay. There's a chain of possession in the city from one political group to another . And it just continues , okay, so when they want to run for public office, what do they do? Well, they back the public service unions, the fire, the police, the DPW, the non-profits . They feed them with grant money and just take care of them and then they throw the people in this city under the bus. You've seen people come to this podium over the decades complaining about problems in their neighborhood , never solved, okay. And no backbone from the Council because it's just one political hack after another . It's all pay to play politics . Now you got Mr. Gaughan talking about it when he shoved Joe Biden down everybody 's throat and every business man in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 downtown Scranton . And now the hearing s that are going on in Congress find that Chinese money came right through Joe Biden and his son from 2014, our President . This country is just corrupt from the top to the very bottom. And people want to talk about Democrat and Republicans . Look at Scranton 's public school system. It's almost a joke. And my last thing here is, Mr. King, I'm going to ask you a couple more questions about the public access channel because we haven't talked about that for a while. And I'm going to hope that the Mayor stops playing politics and returns the public access channel -- public component to it back. And I know I'm going to be in Wilkes-Barre at the law library . And I'm going to give it a couple more weeks and then I'm going to file it. You may find yourself in a courtroom with your Solicitor and the Mayor could bring hers and ECTV can bring theirs and we'll play. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Evann Xanthis . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MS. XANTHIS : Good evening , Council . My name is Evann Xanthis . I live in lower Green Ridge on Dickson Avenue. First, I have to answer Mr. Morgan. My children went through the Scranton School District . They are doing phenomenal . They went -- my son is going to graduate from Temple Med School May 5th with top honors. So Scranton School District did pretty good for them and for me and my two brothers . I recommend the Scranton School District to anybody . It is a good school district . Okay, what I came here for is Dickson Avenue. Apparently Dickson Avenue has become the land of opportunity for the developers . First we had a cement plant. And after we all got sick, the cement plant left and then a senior building went further back. Now in the parking lot for the old Eureka next to my house, they're building another senior building which to me it seems a little overkill. When they started we went to the zoning meeting . We were told, of course, it went through and they're okayed. The second 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 week they were doing construction over there, my house was shaking so much that my great grandmother 's crystal was coming out of the china closet. Call City Hall. City Hall told me they did a mining study. Well, they said there is no mines. I hate to tell them I have a mine shaft that runs under my property , comes out between my house and Sanderson . It opened up in 2010. Surface Mining from Wilkes-Barre came in and had it covered . So there are mines there, okay. I told them. I went over. I was real nice, stern. I said if my house caves in, you just bought yourself a property . So they kind of slowed up. It wasn't that bad. This morning I wake up, there's three 18 Wheelers covering my circular driveway . I couldn't get out. My front porch, you couldn't go off the front. You couldn't get out the driveway s. I'm saying to the guys, you got to move. I have to get to a doctor's appointment . Well, we have nowhere to go. I said, well, listen, that's not really my problem . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 You're in front of my house. The beeping and the noise goes on from before sunrise to at least 9, 10:00 seven days a week. So these people up near CMC, it's coming for them. It's terrible. I don't get sleep. I have circles under my eyes. This is ridiculous . We have no quality of life there. We can't sit outside because bang, bang all day long. I mean, this is a little bit ridiculous . I don't understand why this has become such an important zone for these builders . It's not just a such a great area to keep -- there's no neighborhood anymore. The neighbors are moving out. They don't want to be there. No one wants to be there now. I wish someone could just tell me with the zoning laws, were they changed to benefit developers ? Apparently . Because that's what my daughter was told today that the zoning laws changed. So in other words, homeowners have no rights. Does anybody know about the zoning? MR. KING: A lot of the zoning was changed . They added a lot more definitions I believe to try to reduce the number of appeals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 going before the Zoning Board. It just kind of more clearly identifies what is allowed and what is not permitted and what are considered special exception s which would have to go before the zoning board. MS. XANTHIS : But if I cut my grass at 7:00 in the morning , someone will call the police. But it's okay for them to be banging , clanging , beeping ? Do you know how nerve-wracking that is? Just think about this, seven days a week. It's getting to be a little bit too much. I think that whoever is doing the zoning, they're not family friendly people. They're just for the big companies . That's it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Xanthis . Is it, Krysten Xanthis ? MS. XANTHIS : Hello, Krysten , Dickson Avenue, here about the same thing. I was out at work. I came home to a construction worker. And I had said to them, listen, I have been understanding this whole time. I said, but can you please move the trucks from in front of the driveway ? He said, well, I don't have anywhere else to park. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 He said, I got a permit to close down the road if I need to. I never heard of such a permit like that before. But maybe I don't know of it. But then he goes onto tell me, well, I don't see a vehicle in your driveway so what does it matter? That's none of his business . It's my driveway . We pay the taxes. I don't understand why, you know, that's somebody 's business . You know, this city to tell you the truth, I wish all of these people in here a lot of luck because this city is going down the tubes. You know, I dealt with it when I was in school, my whole life in high school. I dealt with another problem in this city, got no help except from Mr. Voldenberg or Mr. King. You know, they are the only two people that addressed it. You know, my house is, like, you know, shaking constantly . These people here, you know, same thing is going to happen to them. Now, I look over to a building to the right of me which was originally a parking lot. Somehow a parking lot now becomes a space for a building of a big high rise which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 doesn't really add up because it was designed for parking . That's why it was called a parking lot. You know, maybe one of you people should come down there and see how we live or go up there and see how they're going to live because , you know, the city is just being taken over. There is no more neighborhood . There's nothing . I mean, all I want to do is move out of the city. But, I mean, I grew up here. I grew up in the same neighborhood since I was born. And let me tell you, it's terrible. I mean, I never got any help from City Council about a previous place that was across the street from me. There were different people here at that time on Council . You know, I had a dog that died. My grandmother died, other family members died. And, you know, right now I came home at lunch today to have an argument with the people next door because they destroyed my front lawn because they decided it's okay to park your tractor -trailer s on it and say, oh, well, we'll move it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 That was when we had snow. So you know when you go over snow when it's frozen what it does to the ground? So now my sidewalk's destroyed . He said, well, I'll fix it once spring comes. I go out there, he says to me, he said, well, he said it will even out after a while once the rain comes. That -- it's not going to even out on its own. You know, maybe one of you people should really come down there because now instead of a 30-some unit building , he's telling me it's going to be a 40-unit building . And they have no parking spots. He said they have no room. That's why they can't put their trucks in there. There's no room for parking. What are they going to do, once they get the building up, what's the building going to be there for, nothing ? I mean, I came here not that long ago with another problem . And I got to say, you know, this city, the paper, nobody helped. Nobody did anything . I mean, the only other option is certain things is the news because this city, I wish you all a lot of luck, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 know, but you're not going to get any help. It's going to be done. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Xanthis . That exhausts the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. KOLOSKI : Doris Koloski . I think you know where I live. First of all, I to want to commiserate with the people that just spoke because we do know exactly how they feel. Geisinger had let the water company construction people use the lot where the school used to be across the street from my house all the time they were putting the pipes in. And all night long, 4:00 in the morning , 3:00 in the morning , 2:00 in the morning we had backup alarms going off and trucks running in and out of there. So I do sympathize . I wish I did have the kind of money that I could have bought up the properties around my house like Mr. Smurl did around his and fixed them all up so I could control what was going on there. But I didn't have that kind of money. All right. I want to address 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 something about the emergency room at Geisinger . I do feel that they need a bigger emergency room. So do the rest of the neighbors . We're not against that. We're against the parking garage. But it's beyond me the height of the parking garage. It's beyond me why people go to emergency room -- unless they have Geisinger insurance and that's the only emergency room they could use and if they're waiting eight hours, don't take -- and go down to the Mercy's emergency room where they could get in. And I can't tell you how many people stopped me at the park where I walk two, three times a day with my dogs. And people come up to me and say they recognize me from seeing me here and speaking at Council . And they say they feel bad for me because we're fighting a losing battle because Geisinger -- the City is in Geisinger 's pocket and you can't fight the corporation . But they also say that they've had experience in the emergency room and they've left the emergency room and they've gone to Mercy emergency room and gotten in. Or they've gone up to Lehigh 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 Valley emergency room and gotten in. So the only reason I could think that I would stand in the emergency room for ten hours if I thought my leg was broken and not go to another emergency room would be if I had the kind of insurance that I could only use that emergency room. So that's a question I'd like answered. Also, the other thing that I also wonder about is, like, I know you're going to address these amendments today in Seventh Order. But I'm always curious is, we don't get to see them or quote on them now, I guess, then until next week because we don't know what they are. Nobody discussed that they were going to put any other kind of amendments in with us, you know, adding to this thing. So it's the neighbor s, again, we're left kind of out of the loop. So that's it. Okay. So I'll be done with that. And the only thing I have is a few announcement s that the Pine Brook Arts Festival at Adams School will be April 29th from noon to 4 p.m. May 4th, is a primary election 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 debate at the University of Scranton . I believe it's at 6:00. And tomorrow night there's suppose d to be meet the candidates at Jack's Draft House on Prescott Avenue. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Doris. MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I also concur with the secret amendments after public comment . I understand that in Seventh Order amendments are going to come up. But without knowing them, without having them on the agenda beforehand for anyone to take a look at it, it really denies the public the ability to make comment s on whether or not they actually think these amendments are of value and should be supported . I was a little bit disappointed that it's going to be thrown in in Seventh Order and it's still up in the air if they pass or not whether or not it will get tabled or continue to go forward as planned. We talked here and there's been talk here about CMC Geisinger and spot zoning. Well, most of the people here have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 been focused on CMC. But in looking at the paperwork , I take a look at the University of Scranton and the size of the institutional size zoning that was put out for CMC. Right now the CMC cutout is about 33 percent of the size of the entire Center City. That's just a fact. If you take a look at the cutout in the zoning map, it is approximately one third of the size -- half actually of just the Center City section . But taking Center City and their section , it's about 33 percent is zoned for Scranton -- for the University of Scranton . And in looking at that, the original document that was put across by the Planning Commission had a small cutout from it and that was provided to the University of Scranton . The University of Scranton sent its own map back with scratch outs for where it wanted the zoning changed to fit it and to fit its institutional manner. And as a matter of fact, once they did that, the University of Scranton , the zoning map mysteriously changed to exactly match what the University of Scranton had propose d it wanted for that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 section . If that's not spot zoning where a university or a business can come and say, well, we understand it's this but here's a drawing of what we want and you go, okay, we'll give them what they want. If that's not spot zoning, I'm not sure what is. It's interest ing for Mr. West leaving because I remember people got raises. And part of the raise were to get the best of the best to keep the people to attract them to positions . Obviously the money that was given out by the city as those raises, but that failed to keep people where they are suppose d to be. It just gave more people a paycheck and it didn't attract that person to stay with this body. Since the Mayor does not propose in Nay Aug Park a pool and has pulled this entire process right and left, why does this body not propose a swimming pool? The five of you can create an ordinance . You could put it forward . You could vote on it. And if the Mayor rejects it, you can veto the Mayor and push it through . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 This body is not devoid of the ability to move legislation through for the people who they represent . If the Mayor is blocking the process , you have the ability to say it's time for that to end. It's time for it to move forward . And we are going to do so independently as part of our edict and our body. Now, for this vote tonight , we've had amendments come up beforehand and they've been struck down three to two constantly . I can only see this as a method to put this past the election . There's been a constant push to not make amendments for months at this point. The only logical reason why it would be considered at the last minute is to push this beyond the electoral season because certain people will not retain office. And those people who hide behind this delay should not retain office. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. WILLIAMS : Good evening , Joann Williams . I wasn't going to speak tonight but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 listening to everybody about the spot zoning, about corruption , really, why do you run for public office, you as a City Council , Scranton School District ? Did you ever really think about that, like, why am I running ? What am I going to do in that seat? Because holding this up and taking the side of corporations is not always in the best interest . We are neighborhoods . We are the people. Our ancestors came here and wanted a future for all of us. And then someone comes in and tries to destroy a neighborhood or won't compromise or won't even have answers to your question s, they don't have no plans. You need to think. Even at the Scranton School District the board, that's another one. This is not good. This is not good. I'm reaching out to people to run for those seats who care about the people and the children , the neighborhood s that will like Lee Morgan said have a backbone . The corruption must end. And you must think about the people who have lived here all of their lives, what is best for them. You really need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 to think when you are running for office why am I running for office. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Williams . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Dave Dobrzyn . I forgot my hat. All right. All right. I intended to keep that the hospital discussion but I've been reading the paper. I hope you people read the paper too. A few years ago we were gifted with the brilliance of Henry Amoroso . And I would like to point out at this time I heard a complain t about a water bill or something and the PUC. Well, that didn't work out because the Consumer Protection Commission protected everybody throughout the state that we're already paying part of their bills. And I will also point out that not one issue -- correct me if I'm wrong someday, but not one issue that he ever brought up, sell the Sewer Authority , sell the parking garages , sell this, sell that, you know, sell it all. And not one thing has worked out for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 the City of Scranton . We're settling a lawsuit on his recommended trash increase . And if the city had done proper accounting I think we could have found that it was well worth $300 a year because when I lived up the country , I left in 2001. In Susquehanna County, it was 2.25 a bag for a flimsy little bag. And you better watch it all day in case you neighbor decides he wants to steal it and dump your garbage out on the lawn and use the bag for his. Okay. Now, the hospital , when will the facilities expand for medical facilities . I hear a lot about parking garages and stuff. And I'm kind of disappoint ed about it because I would hope that, you know, I have no right to say this in a sense that it's etched in stone. But I'd rather see a 100 high medical facility expansion than 100 foot high garage or any garage as far as that's concerned . We're going to need one but we already have one there for the patients . And the amount of years it's going to take to tear that down and then build these other garages 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 and back and forth, you're not talking any -- very much medical care for somebody that is 70 years old per se, probably will never happen. And the issue of taxes came up last week. And I deliberately skipped -- stayed home so I could watch this all night and get as many facts as I could. When are we going after the State of Pennsylvania ? It's their Constitution that requires us to accept tax exempts and so called non-profits , whatever you want to call them. That's fine by me. But they are exempt. They bankrupted our school system. They bankrupted us with lack of cash flow into the city. And it just keeps going on and on and on. It keeps going on and on forever . Every year it's more -- we went down to 33 percent and I'm hearing more like 37. And with all of this, you know, you're probably approaching 40 percent . So that means that 60 percent of the buildings in Scranton are paying the taxes for the other 40 percent . And yes, they do great things and I would have died if I didn't pay the hospital 19 years ago.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 But therein again, I seem to have been swept off the side anyway. So if they want to talk turkey, how about immediately expanding the hospital services and not the parking . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. NOLAN: Jess Nolan, 1700 block of Vine Street. I'm here again to talk about the zoning plan. I'd like suggest that we look at the numbers a little differently tonight . I'd like to suggest that instead of focusing on the height of building s we look at the overall square footage that GCMC will gain in this expansion . So these are my very rough calculations assuming institutional zoning a five story structure is erected on both blocks, that assumes one level underground , GCMC would gain approximately 235,000 square feet on the 400 block and 50,000 square feet on the 200 block for a total gain 275,000 square feet.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 I think this is actually probably an underestimate . For comparison , their major expansion in 2015 added 143,000 square feet. Now let me tell you what they were able to do with that 143,000 square feet according to the press release on their website . They added new multispecialty clinics , a state of the art 18 room intensive care unit and a new main lobby. With just 10,000 feet of space they were able to create a clinic that includes 22 state of the art examination rooms and a large registration and waiting area. One can only imagine what they could do with almost double that amount of space. Certainly this will give them plenty of room to expand their emergency room department and create private rooms and house updated imaging equipment as they have said they need to do. By my again admittedly very rough calculation s, I'm just using Google maps to measure this as the box and try to account for setbacks . The hospital is almost doubling their footprint in our neighborhood and increasing their square footage by 50 percent .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 I would say that is more than fair given that GCMC chose to pursue this expansion without a guarantee . They could have involved as others have said could have involved neighbor s in a conversation about expansion early in the process . They could have waited until zoning changes were approve d. They chose not to. Now they're saying that if the west side of the 200 block of Colfax isn't zoned civic, they won't expand at all. They will walk away from the opportunity to expand their hospital space by 50 percent . The one thing that hospital and neighborhood would seem to agree on is that the city gets to decide on zoning and the hospital will have to adjust as needed. For months they dragged their feet saying they couldn't provide any rendering s until the zoning process was complete . You heard something very similar in their presentation last week. This would seem to me to be a tacit acknowledgement by GCMC that their expansion plans are contingent upon zoning changes that were not guarantee d when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 they started purchasing properties in the summer of 2021 well before the draft of the zoning plan had even been shared widely with the public. The job of City Council is to approve a zoning plan that serves the interest of the city and its residents , not to bow to the demands and threats of powerful actors. The 45 foot height restriction provided under the institutional zone would allow GCMC to expand on the land they acquired without completely changing the residential character of those blocks. GCMC wants a civic zone. The neighborhood really wants it to stay residential . Amending the current draft of the SAPA zoning plans of the west side of the 200 block of Colfax as institutional limited to 45 feet will be a way to meet in the middle. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. O'MALLEY: Good evening , Barbara O'Malley, Wheeler Avenue, Scranton , also talking about last week's caucus. Now, last week's caucus Geisinger CMC present ed its case for hospital expansion focusing on the crisis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 in the emergency department . To be clear, absolutely no one is disputing the urgent need to address this situation . What we are disputing is whether a 100 foot garage in the middle of a residential neighborhood is necessary to expand services or if a 45 foot one will achieve the same results . There is a heightened urgency to push through this new zoning regulation . But this does not appear that immediate relief for emergency department is in sight. Councilman Smurl asked Geisinger rep Ron Beer how long the project might take. He wanted to know if it was going to take five, seven, eight years and I'm paraphr asing him. He wanted to know we were looking -- if they were looking at doubling ER sites now to prepare for some time in the future. Mr. Beer's answer was full of jargon and catch phrases references parallel process , leveraging regional assets, capabilities , on line, build out, pop up (inaudible ) off load, etc. Frankly , I was dismayed and angered by this response . I was expecting something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 concrete such as we were looking at adding a trailer or remodeling the former wound care clinic or the lobby, anything but the gobbledygook . This was one of the red flags that Joan spoke of last week. Mr. King -- Mr. King, as a school administrator , if you had student s in hallways due to lack of classroom space and you gave an answer like that, what do you think the reaction would be of the public? Gobbledygook . I also noticed when you, Mr. King, asked questions to Geisinger CMC reps you used the words assure and assurances . I don't think the answers provide d by CMC provided any assurances to this community . When Council woman Rothchild asked about a community benefit 's agreement which would assure neighbors of these basic agreed upon elements between them and Geisinger CMC, she was told that would be problematic and frankly , she was put off, another red flag. Mr. Beer described the parking garage as just and enabling projects . How do you think that sounded to the resident s whose 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 quality of life will surely be impacted to them like they are just collateral damage? Amending the zoning in the 200 block of Colfax from 100 feet to 45 feet will provide some relief to residents . After all, it's still a garage. And it might be an inconvenience to the hospital employees who will continue parking in Nay Aug, not the end of the world. But maybe it won't be because Mr. King's suggestion to look at the time 75 feet add on to the garage in the 400 block or if Geisinger CMC finds out if they could go underground or if they find other options. In other words, necessity is the mother of invention . The point is Geisinger CMC as noted is a billion dollar corporation which has the capacity and the resources to find other solutions . You, City Council members , represent Scranton residents whose pockets are getting shallower by the day. At the end of the day, a 45 foot cap on a garage will not make a difference to the actual medical space expansion at CMC. But it will be a night and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 day difference for the residents of the neighborhood , your constituents . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. O'Malley. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. MATYJEVICH : Joe Matyjevich , President of Tripp Park Civic Association , Executive Board member of the Bulls Head Weston Field Neighborhood Association . Council , I come here tonight standing with my friends in the Hill once again. Neighborhood s built this city as I said before. Neighborhood s will keep this city going. Years ago when there was problems with the noise ordinance , neighborhood s got together , bulls Head and Weston Field and the South Side Neighborhood Association Judy Gatelli . Those two groups working together rewrote the noise ordinance that we have today. I learned a few words going through school, one, few, and many. There's many people back here waiting for a few of you up there to listen to them and not give them lip service and don't worry about the one on the Hill. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 So what I ask you tonight is to put it back on the table, take the amendment that we had a few weeks back to lower the height, bring it up for a vote. Let's see where everyone stands because as I said, one, few, and many. A few of you need to push this off so the many back here suffer for the one on the Hill. I ask you again do the right thing for the people, not for the one corporation . Geisinger is not going anywhere . These people in the Hill, the many of them up there are going to suffer at the expense of one because of a few that may vote 3-2. So once again, please do the right thing. And another topic that you have on the agenda that I spoke about last week was the Environmental Advisory Council . I'm hoping that you have some amendments to that in particular to what I said last week about having a say in the number of members that are on there, three with two alternate s. I believe the City Council should take it to five, which I thought I heard was where we were going. But City Council should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 have at least two of those three. Let the Mayor have three with the advice and consent of Council . But let Council have two on that board just like they could vote to have people on the zoning board because advice and consent , it doesn't mean anything . So I ask you for two things, make that amendment to that ordinance so that you have a say so that you are not strapped in the future and listen to the people. Don't give them lip service . Pull it off the table, add the amendment to lower the garage; and let's see where the chips may fall because they deserve more than lip service . They deserve action because at the end of the day, many speaks louder than a few. Thank you very much and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you Mr. Matyjevich . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 MR. SMURL: I have one comment and it's on employees in the City of Scranton , a few concern s, DPW -- pardon me? MR. KING: Okay. I just -- go ahead, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : May I approach ? I filed a right to know regarding 501 Linden Street. We were going to open a business there and we had some issues. And I was told by the LIP Department to file a right to know on some of the issues that I had. So I had filed it. And something that stuck out to me here was a temporary solution to an unsafe sidewalk which the correspondence will show you. And it was with Jack Sweeney . And it went on and there was an application and a permit that was filed and approved . A few weeks later, LIPS Department looked at the application and said that it was missing insurance , the contractor wasn't licensed in the city, there wasn't a price of how much was going to be done or scope of what the job was going to be. I was curious how does an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 application be approved prior to being checked out. So then further on into it, the permit -- the owner of the building wrote a letter to Mr. Sweeny saying, Dear Jack, due to the economic conditions , I'm unable to find a bid that was affordable to fix my sidewalk s on Linden Street this year. Accept my apologizes . Maybe we'll try next year to receive an acceptable bid. Subway restaurant was closed and condemned for the same issue. The sidewalk is the only sidewalk in the city that I believe is still blacktop with a vault underneath it. I have personal experience because I was going to rent this building and I had issues with the utilities that were running underneath the rotted beams that hold up the sidewalks . And I was just curious to know how does the building department give out permits prior to doing an approval ? It's a little bit backwards the way it goes. And how does a building inspector who's no longer with us allow someone that knows that there's a problem to call and make his own custom agreement s with the city and if there's two sets of rules for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 the connect ed and the not connect ed? And I tried to contact LIP, the LIPS Department Cipriani and the Mayor's office numerous times on this particular property because my wife was going to open up a business in there. And it was just concerning to me that there is no dialogue , no communication with the administration . And that's not cool. Have a nice night. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : You're welcome . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, comment s. I'll continue where I left off. DPW has been down two mechanics for over two years. They are short two operators for a very long time. And the operators slowed down all of the project s they have because if we only have five operators and we need seven, we seem to be pulling from one job to the next because we can't get enough people to operate this equipment .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 We have a lot of equipment that sits down in DPW daily because we don't have enough people to operate all of this. Also, we're short a parks director . Mr. Craig Beavers , the assistant city planner is leaving the city, also Larry West will be gone shortly . This seems to me kind of concerning that many people -- I'm not sure how many are actually leaving the city. But I don't know if the problem is money or if it's residency restriction or is this normal for all cities now to loose this many people all the time. I think we should look into our hiring system and see what we need to change to do better to find some more employees to fill these spots. That's all I have for now, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Some of my comments tonight I'll leave for on the question for Sixth and Seventh order. But I would just like to say thank you to the Scranton Fire Department that put out the fire on Linden Street last night. That's all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 MR. KING: Thank you. Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, first, I wanted to bring up an issue I think we already tried to contact and ask PD about and haven't receive d a response . And that was with regards to permit parking that's in existence on the 900 block of East Gibson Street I receive d a complaint from a resident who receive d a parking ticket there. And there was someone who was just trying to visit the mitzvah which is a Jewish place of worship that's over by the Temple down there. And I was asked why it was still permit parking because there's only one house that's on that block of the street current ly. And so it doesn't seem that there is a need for permit parking on that block. And when I've driven past it because that's my street too, there is often, like, half of the block empty without cars. So I inquired about that. And since we haven't receive d a response , I wanted to bring attention to it tonight and to reach out again so we need to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 determine if that still needs to be permitted or not or if other people could park there like if they want to go to their religious place of worship , which I fully believe they should be able to do. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with the highway officer and also on the status of the ticket. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'd also like to know there were a number of PennDOT requests that I made several weeks ago. And I would like to know if we received any responses on those PennDOT requests . MR. VOLDENBERG : They were sent out. I'll follow up with PennDOT . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, please do. Thank you. And lastly, we had received an e-mail about one of the playgrounds at Nay Aug. And they had included pictures . And it's just a disgrace the status of the playground s that are there. I know we have other concern s for the park, like, trying to get a pool and there's going to be another playground that's going to be built, the butterfly playground 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 which will be handicap accessible or accessible to the children with disabilities which I am very excited for and is definitely needed. But we're not taking care of the playground s that we have there now. And I do appreciate everything that the Recreation Authority does for the park, but the city also needs to take our part in maintaining that equipment because the, I mean, the pictures , there's cracks in slides. Now, I don't -- there's two playgrounds. I don't usually take my daughter to this one. I take her to the other one in Nay Aug. And even that one is usually a bit on the dirty side. But this one is clearly falling apart and a hazard to the children who should be able to utilize it and play there. So I think we need to do everything that we can to correct this quickly before a child gets hurt. And then that's on us for not doing anything about it. So, Mr. Voldenberg , please send correspondence to the administration that we need to get the playground fixed there. There's a slide with, like, a crack 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 in it. There seems to be, you know, maybe a homeless person that took up shelter in part of the playground too. There's a number of article s of clothing and things like that. There's graffiti above one of the slides. So that's certainly not a place I would want to take my own child to and I understand why the residents wouldn't want to either. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, Doctor. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And that's all I have for Fifth Order tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple things. First, I'm going to report out on the questions we asked for Mrs. Jeffries . So the questions I did ask a couple weeks ago about the lead inspection assessment services , okay? How are the houses selected for testing , is this testing voluntary , and will remediation services be provided ? So they're the three questions I posed. And I did get the answers. So for number one, the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 Scranton is focused on single family occupied dwelling units built before 1978. That was in the legislation in which a child the under age of six years -- and we understand all that. So the city is partner ing how they're going to be chosen for assessment. The city are partnering with various nonprofit organizations to identify properties at risk. So that answers that question . And, yes, the program is voluntary . And third, as with most grants, an assessment study is key to open up funding opportunities . The city has funding budgeted in ARPA to start remediation services . By doing the assessment , the city will now be eligible to apply for funding from HUD for additional remediation services . Okay, number two, so since we're talking about Nay Aug again, I also received the e-mail with the horrendous condition of the equipment in the parks. So we don't need a consultant to tell us that. We don't need a Master Plan to tell us that that we've been waiting for. This should have been taken care of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 last year. It's May. Within a blink and it's May. So this is unacceptable . So again, please follow up with this. This is ridiculous . All right. And then in addition to that I also received an e-mail from a resident also about Nay Aug Park. What are the plans for the other side of the Kanjorski bridge? I don't think that's been clearly conveyed to us so please add that, you know, maybe a dog park, whatever . That was an idea from a resident . Like I said, most ideas from resident s are good ones. And then also, the flagpole needs to be addressed . The pole needs to be painted and the area around it could be spruced up. And he had another great suggestion . Maybe contact the Boy Scouts. It would be a great Eagle project . The flag should also be replaced. So I do remember last year -- no, it was earlier this year that some of the vegetation was blocking the view of the flag for some resident s. I thing that was taken care. So if you would just follow up with these. I'll forward the e-mail I have so it will be easier for you to do so. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : And then what else do I have? Oh, can we please make Mr. Spindler whole with them ash can containers in some way. Give him whatever he wants. All right? No, and I understand . I feel for him because that's absurd. I'm old enough to remember ash cans and how important they were. Also, about two weeks ago I was in front of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . And a concern ed resident during the meeting asked me, you know, Mark, did you hear anything about there is equipment behind the Forest Hill Cemetery located, you know, in Scranton -Dunmore line, a lot of equipment , pipes. She wanted to know if this was the start of the Meadow Brook Flood Project . Mr. Voldenberg inquired . I could report out that it's not. This is just a Dunmore project . I hope that satisfies her question . And that is all I have right now. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have some followups from last week -- some questions . As far as the DPW contract , I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 that was addressed , Miss Hodowanitz , earlier . Andrew Cutillo is going to contact the city labor counsellor for the fully executed Collective Bargaining Agreement , try to get that posted on our website . The new auditor CliftonLarsonAllen , LLP, per Matthew Domines ', City Finance Director , BA office advised Council that we'll have the contract by the end of April. Virgil Argenta , enforcement , Scranton Police Department , Scranton Fire Department were notified of the increase in homeless issues and encampments in the areas of Lackawanna River Heritage Trail, North Sixth Avenue and the McDade Express way, Silas Street in addition to other known areas and will increase visits and enforce ment in those areas. Derek Raines, DPW was schedule d to visit the 900 block of Monroe Avenue for ]preliminary work on Monday, April 24th. DPW is coordinating all roadwork with Pennsylvania American Water Company to ensure all work is done prior to the fall paving schedule . Marie Schumacher , per our city deputy solicitor , the city is putting the final 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 touches on an RFQ for legal services and appraisal services and expects to publish it shortly. Approximately 44 easements remain outstan ding. Brian Reap, Mr. Reap asked if the city follows the City of Scranton master plan. Don King, City Planner has noted that the Master Plan became the comprehensive plan under SAPA Plan under Resolution 170, November , 2014, continues in the SAPA Plan to the present day. Fay Franus, DPW overtime first quarter 2023, received a response with a recap for DPW Director regarding DPW overtime totaling $191,000 and will forward the information to her. Rubicon , DPW provided with all available caucus dates in May, will advise back to Council . And then the Mylert Avenue situation , the Scranton Police Department will advise -- I believe it was mentioned the state police were involved with that as well. Request s submitted to Mr. King via e-mail, 1500 Hertz Court ATVs speeding up and down the Court where children are playing , request for slow children at play signage in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 the court was approved by the Scranton Police Department and sent to DPW. The SPD highway unit supervisor asked that neighbor s notify Scranton Police Department dispatch when ATVs are in the area. 1407 Fig Street, pickup truck full of tree branches on a property for approximately three years. Code enforce ment will visit, cite property owner if warranted . Scranton Police Department highway officer advised vehicle is on private property cannot enforce, refers to code enforcement . As far as any amendments that will be considered tonight , I don't find it strange at all that amendments are being propose d, especially after we specifically had Geisinger come in here last week. We had a public hearing . We heard from Geisinger first time as City Council and public. We heard from many of you. And based on the input that we -- what we heard from Geisinger , based on what we heard from the citizens , some amendments had been proposed . Now, those amendments will come up in Seventh Order as they properly should.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 And they will not -- if approved , any of them, they will not be voted on this evening . It will be tabled to allow for 10 days of advertisement and to allow for the public to comment on any amendment s that are made. To me, that's following the proper procedure and allowing the public to be able to comment on any amendment s that are proposed and approved this evening . Fifth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH CHILEWSKI ENTERPRISES TO PERFORM VARIOUS PROJECTS AT NOVEMBRINO PARK, CONNORS PARK, AND NORTH SCRANTON MINI PARK. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 53, 2023 – AN ORDINANCE - ESTABLISHING AN ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON (AS AMENDED ). MR. KING: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A as amended. What is your pleasure ? MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A as amended pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I guess express ed my -- some of my dissatisfaction with this since the start. I would have like to have more of a conversation . I am glad to see that some of the amendment s are include d here that would bring me closer to proving this with a yes vote.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 Prior to final passage in Seventh Order it was brought up tonight about, you know, at this point in time we have five members that would be approved with the consent of Council . Would Council entertain making strictly Council appointment s before final passage ? I don't know if anybody here would entertain that. MR. MCANDREW : I would like to at least have two out of the five appointments or reverse , three and let the Mayor have two. I'd entertain that. MR. SCHUSTER : So, I mean, if that is something that could be entertained before final passage in Seventh Order I may be in agreement with this as it goes. As Mr. Smurl said, we're down some DPW members. We've lost the City Planner . We've lost our Parks Director . We've lost our Business Administrator . I see that the administration is failing at keeping department heads with some of the core responsibilities of the city. This board was considered by one of the public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 speaker s last night as a feel good board. That's how I'm seeing at this point in time. When the Mayor came to present , I wasn't really satisfied with any of the question s and presentation that was given. I mean, that's why I've stayed where I'm at with my opinion of this. If Council were to be more involve d as I saw some of those amendments , you know, made Council more involved . If you were to entertain the possibility of strictly Council appointment s to this I may be in favor. MR. KING: I would suggest that if we could move it to Seventh Order tonight , that would give me the opportunity to speak to the Mayor between now and next week and make these suggestions . And then, you know, whether she agrees or not I would like to at least give her the opportunity , you know, chime in on our request and then we could make that motion next week. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I mean, that's fine to get the opinion . I think when it passes in the end Council does have the final say. But, I mean, I wouldn't mind getting that -- getting that input and seeing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 where it goes. But in order for me to approve of this, I think Council would need to have strictly Council appointments to the board, at least some of them. And from my research on these boards, the agendas of this type of board from around the state have only had things like unity days, cleanups, webinars , community gardens , things like that, things that I'm already seeing occur in our city. And that's kind of where I've been at with this from the start as I see these things already occurring and don't see the need at this point in time. MR. KING: All those in favor -- MR. MCANDREW : Can I just hop back on the question ? MR. KING: Sure. MR. MCANDREW : Just to clarify , I don't want Council to have the opportunity to appoint the alternates . We, you know, we came to an agreement that it will be five person board. I think either Council gets to appoint three or two of them. So that's -- please be clear about that before next week. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 MR. KING: Thank you. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. KING: The ayes have it and so -- one opposed . The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

ROTHCHILD : I'm sorry -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25113 MR. KING: Oh, on the question . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question . Yes, so this is to change the 200 block from Civic to Town-City Institutional . So I have a number of things to -- to comment on here tonight . I've been carefully listening and weighing this decision over a year. And I just want to caveat this with what I'm about to say that the results of the zoning ordinance are of no personal interest or gain to me. No one's making this decision for me. No one is holding me hostage . I have not had my mind made up from the get-go with this decision . And I'm certainly not trying to push anything else off past the election , in fact, back in the fall time I was really pushing to get this moving and to get the finalized or the draft ordinance back to Council so that we could complete it by the end of last year. I know the turmoil that the residents have been experiencing during that time and so I wanted to see it resolved quickly because everyone has been anticipating this decision . And I've made my very best effort 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 over that time to hear both sides of the issues. And I've also spent, you know, over that past year a lot of time, a lot of energy trying to ensure a fair resolution for the neighbors . I persistent ly worked on Geisinger to have them produce sample rendering s of their planned expansion . And I've also advocated for the neighbors and their concerns that they've brought forward to me. I truly appreciate the involvement and the engagement of everyone throughout this process . And many of them have lived in the Hill for a long time, some for their entire lives. And I know that they've felt distraught over the changes to their neighborhood , specifically to Colfax Avenue over the course of that -- of recent events. And they deserve transparency , which I've always given to them and will continue to give on Council . I've talked about how I see this from Geisinger 's side as well as a healthcare provider . And I am supportive of Geisinger 's need to expand. I'm really not happy with the way 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 that they've gone about doing that and circumvented the neighbors and, you know, I think there's been a lack of transparency and openness about the plans. And last week I was really looking for some more answers and more specifics as to their plans. And I don't feel like I received adequate responses to those questions . And we did receive an e-mail following that with follow up from representative s from Geisinger and that did include some more -- some more details on it, which I'd ask that be made public and placed in Third Order for next week. And so they -- I'm not going to read all of it right now. But they had included some more details on the ED expansion , Emergency Department and how many beds would be included in there. Also the amount of inpatient beds and what they would be looking to do for programming , also, their commitment to Community Advisory Council along with -- along with a draft bylaw plan for that Council if, you know, if the neighbor s and the neighborhood association is in agreement with that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25116 They do have here -- I just want to read a couple of these lines that they are open and willing to work closely with all stakeholder s throughout the process and establishing a community agreement that helps guide the project along each stage. We're committed to building an environmentally responsible buildings that blend into the community to the greatest extent possible . So I was hoping that this community agreement would be -- would be created and agreed upon in advance of this ordinance . But I don't see that happening but it's at least nice to see that they've committed to that in what they sent to us. They also have some more come calculations on their parking and I guess there was a parking study completed in 2018. But all of this information would have been great for them to have provided last week. They also have for the land development approval process what would take place after the zoning ordinance is approved and finalized with the plans going to the City of Scranton , reviewed by the City Planning Commission , City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25117 Engineer and County Planning Commission . Plans will be available for public review during the preliminary site phase. Project studies will be conducted , presented to the city and made public. There will be several public hearing s with the Planning Commission and City Council where the public has the opportunity to voice any concern s with the proposed plans prior to approval of the last of the plans. And then the zoning -- the city zoning officer will review the plans for conformance with the zoning ordinance once the preliminary site plans are approved. The final site plans adopt the feedback and requirements go through a public review and approval process . And then they also have a breakdown . We had asked about the community benefit s, some more details on that because they had a total figure but not -- but not some more information there. So that all will be -- will be made available . And I do -- I want to make sure that we hold them accountable . I feel like that process will be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25118 way to do that. I've -- I mean, as you know, I've really been struggling with this and, you know, have had conversations with my colleagues . There was a suggestion for an amendment to take place to restrict the height of the civic zone and then there was also going to be one to change the setback for the civic zone so that it's set further back. So I've been weighing if that would be an adequate compromise . But after listening to everyone , I mean, I see that the compromise that the neighbor s are looking for is with this to be changed to the institutional zone rather than the civic zone. And I -- I mean, I just -- if I voted no on this, it would not feel right. This -- this is my, you know, the Hill is my neighborhood so it's very, you know, it's personal to me. And this has nothing to do with an election either because I'm, you know, I'm not here to be a lifetime politician or to worry about the next election . I would like to continue to serve the people of Scranton because I believe in Scranton and, you know, when we're asked why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25119 we're up here ultimate ly, like, I want to serve the people and I want to represent the people. And I want to do what's right by the people. And so, you know, I believe with this vote that -- for this amendment that I will be doing that. MR. KING: Thank you. I will say that on the motion this has not been easy for any one of us up here. This has been extremely difficult , challenging . Everyone of us is trying to balance the need to improve the medical services for the City of Scranton . Every one who has come up to speak at least the vast majority realize the need, especially now since Moses Taylor has closed their emergency room, you know, many of the hospitals in the area have closed, Carbondale and various other places. So this decision is very difficult because we're trying to address the needs of the neighbors on top of trying to address the needs of the medical , you know, the medical needs for the citizens of our city and the emergency rooms. And it really is not a great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25120 situation up there at all. So, you know, just so everyone knows, none of us has taken any of this lightly . We've listened. You know, we brought Geisinger in here. We propose d -- amendments have been proposed . And, you know, we've had to consider everything that has been present ed before us and try to do the best -- to try make the best decision that we can for the citizen s of the City of Scranton . MR. SCHUSTER : Just another one on the question just before the vote for this amendment comes out. I just -- after the presentation that came from Geisinger the other day, there was some unknown s that we've seen. I know it was brought up in Fourth Order tonight , whether , how far we can go underground, whether we could go for a variance , things like that. And I do think the 45 foot height restriction is the compromise . And I do think that with the added space, I think that Geisinger present ed with the 400 block as well as, you know, how far or not we could go underground, I think with these unknown 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25121 variables if we were to hold to the 45, we still give them the opportunity to go in front of the zoning board for a variance if they need it if other information comes to light in their process . MR. MCANDREW : I'd like to say a couple more things too. So through this whole process , I've stood with the Hill, okay? I'm a neighborhood guy my whole life. I'm a man of compromise . So the compromise you see, the 45 was not a big -- big ask. And it was a reasonable ask. So with that said, of course, I'm going to be a yes for this vote. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : And Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. Motion passes. MR. SCHUSTER : Scranton City Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25122 wishes to amend the propose d zoning ordinance as follows : Increase all setbacks under Civic Zoning from 10 feet to 15 feet. The propose d ordinance attached hereto as Exhibit A shall be amended as follows : Article 3 Section 3.4 titled District Quick Views is hereby amended as follows : All setbacks permitted under Civic Zoning designation shall be 15 feet. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , in reviewing the ordinance I had taken a look and compare d the Civic Zone to the Institutional Zone and it appeared that the Institutional Zone had some setbacks that were 15 feet, whereas all the setbacks for the Civic Zone were 10 feet. So it didn't really make sense to me as to why those setbacks would be less with a taller height of a building in a Civic Zone as opposed to Institutional , so that's why you're seeing this motion here now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25123 MR.

MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. Motion passes. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I would like to make a motion to put 7-D back off the table, sorry. MR. SCHUSTER : I feel in the beginning of the meeting we already brought it back from the table. MR. MCANDREW : We have to table it though. I would like to make a motion to table. MR. SCHUSTER : Is this a motion to table? MR. MCANDREW : Correct . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25124 MR. MCANDREW : This is to allow 10 days, you know, I think we explained that. MR. KING: Right. MR. MCANDREW : There's a reason why. MR. KING: On the question , there's been some amendment s that have been proposed and approved . This will allow at least a 10-day period for the public to comment and for us to advertise those amendment s to the zoning ordinance that have been proposed this evening and hopefully bring us back for a vote in a few weeks. So we have a motion and we have a second. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so this means it will not be on agenda for the May 2nd meeting , but it will be on the agenda for final vote on the May 9th meeting , correct ? MR. KING: I believe so. ATTY. GALLAGHER : -- that would be the earliest , not probably . That would be the earliest . MR. KING: Yeah, May 9th would be the earliest . And it's likely the May 16th meeting will be moved to May 17th due the election on the 16th. So we have a motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25125 table.

SCHUSTER : Would you allow me to speak for one moment? MR. KING: Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Mr. Voldenberg , I'm just going to make one more request . For the last few weeks we've been asking about the tents and the homeless camps. Is it possible to reach out to our public health coordinator to get an opinion on some of these camps what her opinion would be on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25126 camps in the city? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll be sure to involve her. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. MR. KING: Is that it, Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. KING: If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn . MR. KING: Meeting is adjourned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25127 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
