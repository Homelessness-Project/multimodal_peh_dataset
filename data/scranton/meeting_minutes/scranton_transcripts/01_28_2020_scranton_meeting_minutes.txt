(The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items or matters of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 general concern : Joan Hodowanitz Norma Jeffries Dave Dobrzyn Tom Coyne Marie Schumacher .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. As Chairman of Public Safety Committee , I would like to thank School Resource Officer Jill Foley and Juvenile Officer Kevin Uher for their swift actions and arrest of a juvenile in last week's multiple threats on West Scranton High School. I would also like to recognize last week one of our very own Scranton firefighter s, Chuck Bartlebaugh . While off duty and during a basketball game at Valley View, rushed to the aid of a collapsed referee in cardiac arrest and provided CPR. Great job. That's all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Andrew. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do have one comment . Last week at the meeting I had mentioned that I planned on having a meeting with OECD this past Friday as Chair of the Committee For Community Development . And I did have that meeting with Mary-Pat Ward the Director of OECD. And I will be having several other meetings individually with the program specialists through OECD. So I was able to get a great comprehensive overview from Mary-Pat of their programs and the work that they've been doing. And I look forward to serving as a liaison with that department and Council . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly . One is I was -- reviewed the contract we had with Rainey and Rainey. And when I pulled the legislation , the original bid went out for Rainey and Rainey to do audits for budget years '15 through '18. But then that was just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 amended to just be '15 and '16. And that's the only copy of a contract that I have. So, Miss Reed, would we be able to contact the Business Administrator 's office and also the Controller 's office to see if there's a current contract they're working on that we just don't have in our office? And also just to follow up on a request that both myself and Councilman Gaughan made back in September regarding Parrot Avenue. The neighbors are -- it's becoming a raceway. So would you be able to send correspondence to Chief Graziano to see if he ever looked into that? And that's all I have for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Just a few comments . Number one, Miss Schumacher had asked -- and I think Council in the past had asked that the execute d contracts be placed on the City's website . So we did send that request to the Mayor's Office. They did get back pretty quickly . And they said that that request is part of future updates to the City's website . So I think some time in the future we will be seeing that, maybe not as quickly as you would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 like. But I'm sure that's on the docket. The second thing, we did send a letter out. This was something that was asked back in 2019 in terms of the Ethics Code acknowledge ment by City employees . So we really asked two questions , has a deadline for employees to submit the acknowledgment of receipt of the Ethics Code been establish ed? Also, what action, if any, will the City take to enforce the signing of the document and what action or discipline , if any, would the City take against employees who may refuse to sign this document ? I realize that the Ethics Code is kind of in limbo. I have a meeting with members of the Ethics Board tomorrow . You know, Miss Hodowanitz mentioned that it was signed into law a year ago. You have to remember that there was several -- when this was first on the docket for Council , that's when the previous Mayor was -- his house was getting raided and that whole thing was going on with the FBI. So there was several roadblocks that were put up. So it didn't get off to the best 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 start, number one. Number two, prior to myself bringing that up and other members of Council , nothing was done with the Ethics Board. So while we haven't made the greatest amount of progress , we have made some progress . And we will get there. But it will take time. Again, one thing I learned in six years being on Council is things don't move in government as quickly as you want them to move. And it is frustrating at times. But, you know, progress will be made on that I'm very confident . And I do appreciate Mrs. Sheridan who is the new Chairwoman of the board who I think is committed to that and who is doing a pretty good job. I did mention at the beginning of the meeting that we are having the exit conference with the auditors next week, Tuesday , February 4th at 5:45 p.m. So if anyone's interested in that. I did receive a citizen 's complaint about Locust Street in West Side. And if, Mrs. Reed, if you could send that to the DPW and the administration and ask if they would consider putting that on the paving list. One of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 things this gentleman mentioned was that with all the work that Pennsylvania American Water Company is doing, they are doing work on, like, both sides of that street. But they are not hitting , obviously Locust Street and that is in really rough condition . In terms of truck traffic and the issues on Third Avenue, I know our office has been inundated with complaints . And they are legitimate complaint s. I was out there. I did actually in the last few days see the truck traffic going up and down Third Avenue. I just want everyone to know that our office did send a detailed letter to the DPW and to the City Engineer asking for their response and their review of that situation . And, Mrs. Reed, I would ask this week if you would just get in contact with Mr. Pocius and ask him if there is any progress on that. Again, I know these things take time. There are several people on that block who are not ill and not feeling well. And it's really taking a toll on them of the situation . So I would hope that we can move as quickly as possible on that. And that's all I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 have this week. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

On the question , I just want to take a second to explain this. So this is a request from our Tax Collector Bill Fox. And this legislation came down from the administration . He was proposing making all payment schedules the same. Currently the City and school district have a step-up penalty period that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 5 percent to 7 and a half percent and then 10 percent . His proposal was copying the county schedule that goes directly to 10 percent , which would put all governing bodies on the same schedule . Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : And I would just like to add that the school district already did approve this. They are just waiting on us to do that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.

CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-B legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-C. Previously tabled. MR. GAUGHAN : And just before we adjourn the meeting , I failed to mention Miss Schumacher had asked a question about the police overtime . And it is budgeted . And this year it's $700,000. Mrs. Reed, if we can ask Chief Graziano , I know we asked in the past and I honestly can't remember if he provided it or not. And he usually gets back to us fairly quickly . A large -- I don't know if a large percentage but a percentage of that amount is reimbursable to the City. So it is $700,000. But I think what we were looking for last year is what amount was reimbursed . So that $700,000 figure is not, you know, the actual amount that the City has to pay. But we will, we'll get that figure for you, okay? MR. DONAHUE : I know we've -- just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to add onto that too. I know previously we've asked for analysis on that. And we just never received that. So I think we're going to have to have a conversation with the new administration about doing an analysis of the previous contract especially going into contract negotiations next year. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting 's adjourned . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
