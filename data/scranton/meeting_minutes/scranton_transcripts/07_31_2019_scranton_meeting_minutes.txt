Bob Bolus spoke on matters of general concern . Gerard Hetman spoke on matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Les Spindler spoke on matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . Jeff Labroski {sic} spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 business and matters of general concern . Lynn Labroski {sic} spoke on matters of general concern . Paul O'Hora spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to touch on what Mr. O'Hora brought up. As the first part of my process when he came in the last time when I asked for a building maintenance plan, I've still yet to receive a building maintenance plan which makes me think that there isn't a building maintenance plan. So if we don't have a maintenance plan to take care of this building , what are we going to do just keep on jumping buildings ? It just doesn't make sense to me. Also just a couple issues on what Joan touched on with residents , you know, being frustrated with not getting a call back from the city with regards to flooding . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Again, I have those same frustrations on that issue as well because I know all of us have put in different issues with regards -- requests on different issues with regards to flooding and we haven't receive d an answer. And I'm hopeful that that will change with a new administration . And then also getting together with the school district on the payroll prep. We've already begun to start that process . But it's going to have to be more earnest in the next few weeks. At the beginning of the week I put in a couple request s to PA American Water with regard to storm drains being blocked , manhole covers, some issues with some manhole covers. I also put in a request with PPL about a telephone pole that was severed on the 1800 block of Pittston Avenue. I did that back in March or April, I believe . And it is still continuously getting worse and to the point now were there is caution tape just wrapped around it, like that's going to hold it together . But I also put one in on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And a couple new requests I have is the Minooka playground, one of the neighbors had some overgrow from the park onto their property . So, Miss Reed, would you be able to reach out to Parks and Rec and have them go assess that situation ? And I also have a -- got a complaint about road conditions on the 400 block of Beech Street if we can have DPW go and check on those two, please. And that's all I have for today. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, first I want to give my condolences to Judge Walsh's family, former Mayor of the City of Scranton . Judge Walsh based on everything I've read and people in my family who knew Judge Walsh, he had a real vision for the city. He was the epitome of honesty and integrity and what it means to be a public servant . So my thoughts and prayers go out to Judge Walsh's family at this time. I would like -- I've asked in the past for an update on the paving project in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 city. It seems to me that we are later along in the process than has been the case in the last few years. The bids will be open August 14th. So we'd like a timeline when they're going to complete this project and a paving list, what streets are going to be paved. Also I requested in the last few weeks updates on 342 Harrison Avenue, 107-109 North Sumner Ave., 950 James Ave., Division Street between Keyser and Dale, dangerous road condition s and 824 Pittston Avenue. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could please send that again. There are people who have called me on these properties who cannot get an answer from City Hall. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . I just have two quick things, something I just want to talk about a little bit in regards to 1218 Olive Place. Mrs. Reed, that letter that we intend to send to LIPS Department , can we also copy Al Lucas, the fire department ? He possibly also has information . If there is severe fire damage to that property , you know, maybe we can elevate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 that and get that taken care of sooner rather than later instead of waiting and letting it just lag. If it's really a public safety issue and they deem it is, as soon as their investigation is over then maybe we can get immediate action on that property . It sounds like they are in severe need of some help over there on Olive. And secondly , I forgot to make this announcement during announcements so I'll take the time right now to do it. This is one of my favorite events in the city all year. The Scranton Police Department 's annual National Night Out will be held again this year on Tuesday , August 6th from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., at Scranton High School. National Night Out is an annual community building event which promotes police and community partner ships to make our neighbors safer and more caring place to live. This event enhances the relation ship between neighbors and law enforcement while bringing back a sense of community . It provide s a great opportunity to bring police and neighbors together under positive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 circumstances . You know, so many times when you are dealing with police or fire, sometimes it's at the worst possible situation in your life and you are not at the best place. And, you know, it's always good to have this type of event to know that, you know, they are always on our side. There will be a lot of activities for the kids, face painting , free finger painting will be available , inflatable obstacle course, free food such as burgers , hotdogs, cupcakes , Rita's Italian Ice. Also there will be K-9 demonstrations which the kids absolutely go crazy over. The fire department 's going to have their smokehouse as well as Lackawanna County Mounted Unit. EJ the DJ will be the entertainment as well as Froggy 101. So every year it's a fantastic night. And this year it's going to be Tuesday , August 6th from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., at Scranton High School. That's all I have today. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. No business at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 SIXTH ORDER. 6-A no business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY – FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 134, 2019 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BY AND BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT AND THE BOROUGH OF DUNMORE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT A NEW USE-OF-FORCE TRAINING PROGRAM . MR. PERRY: As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I had asked the administration where this match funding is going to come out of. Chief Graziano did respond that they are taking the 48,160 match out of the 2020 police capital budget as they have plenty of time to spend the awarded grant funds. If they are able to maintain the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 same 2019 police capital budget level in 2020, they'll have sufficient funds without any increase s to cover this cost as well as the 2020 police civilian parking enforcement vehicle fleet program as they do not have to purchase bullet resistant vests next year like they had the past two years. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES – FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 135, 2019 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH TROY & BANKS, INC. FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON UTILITY AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS AUDIT SERVICES FROM APRIL 30, 2019 THROUGH MARCH 30, 2021. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. PERRY: As temporary Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I just want to say this is an interesting concept that the administration has engaged in here with the audit bringing a company in to audit our electric , gas, telecommunications services . Just looking through the backup in several of the case studies that Mr. Bulzoni and this company brought forward , just one example is the city of Buffalo who brought this company in and they ended up achieving a savings of greater than a million dollars . Some of the other cities that are referenced had more modest savings , Glen Falls in New York, $261,000 and Virginia Beach, Virginia , 16,000. So it varies depending on what they find. But I think this is a good opportunity to have another set of eyes look at these bills and see if we can find any savings. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 So I'm hopeful that that happens . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-B legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-C. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES – FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 136, 2019 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH HERBERT , ROWLAND & GRUBIC, INC. (HRG) FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON STORM WATER PROJECT ENGINEERING SERVICES . MR. PERRY: As temporary Chairperson for the Committee on Rules I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Mrs. Schumacher asked what the timeframe of this was. I said three to four months. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 might be incorrect on that. I was trying to look through the backup because I know I saw it. It is in there but I can't find it right now. There is 80 or 85 pages of backup. But when I do, I'll send you an e-mail. I think it's in the three to four month range but I could be wrong on that. Secondly , you know, we've talked now for the past few years about stormwater management and this potential stormwater authority . The city does not have a choice in this whole process . We have to -- first of all make sure the MS4 permit is submitted on time. And second of all, we're going to have to address stormwater because it's a mandate from the federal government . If we do not do this if we do not look at whether we're going to form an authority or whether we're going to bring in an inhouse of DPW, if we just let it go and, you know, people talk about the rain tax and how unfair it is. And I'm not doubting that or debating that. All I'm saying is, the city has to make sure that we're doing this the right way. If we don't do it and if we don't take it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 seriously , we're going to end up paying fines from the EPA and the federal government . So we have to do this and we have to do it the right way. I think after looking through the proposal here, this company was heavily involve d in the Wyoming Valley Sanitary Authority . I was impressed with the backup and with the proposal . And this also went through a vigorous review process from a review committee that consisted of Dave Bulzoni , John Pocius and Don King. So I'll be voting yes. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-C legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-D.

MR. PERRY: What is the recommend ation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Just to reiterate , well, what I brought up last week, again in this case we really don't -- do not have a choice. We're down four trucks at this point according to the DPW Director Mr. Bulzoni . Just again to reiterate last week, in order to fund the lease payment we're going to use the $100,000 that is in the -- that was dedicated for the ESCO lease, the Energy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Savings lease that at this point will not require funding until 2020. So thank you. MR. PERRY: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-D legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-E. PREVIOUSLY TABLED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE FOR ADOPTION FILED OF THE COUNCIL NUMBER 66 2019 CREATING AND ESTABLISHING SPECIAL CITY ESCROW ACCOUNT NUMBER AS NOTED AND TITLED RENTAL REGISTRATION TENANT ESCROW TO ACCEPT AND DISPERSE FUNDS RECEIVED FROM RENTAL PAYMENTS FROM TENANTS WHOSE LANDLORDS HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH REGISTERING THEIR RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON PURSUANT TO FILE OF THE COUNCIL NUMBER 58 2016 AS AMENDED . MR. PERRY: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. DONAHUE : As temporary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . This legislation is simply setting up the account so we can receive funds eventually when this program is put in place from the rental registration escrow. Councilman Donahue and I met with Mayor Evans yesterday . And he requested that we bring this back up for the -- because they want to get this program started . He assured us that when they are going to launch this program , he along with the City Solicitor and whoever else will make a presentation to us and keep us in the loop on exactly what this program will look like and go through the details which is what we had requested previously . They did provide us a draft document of what the letter to the landlord will look like, the letter to the tenant and the general letter that they will eventually send out. So I just want to make that point that, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Mayor Evans again assured us that they will walk us through the process . This is not something that is going to be unveiled tomorrow , this program . But it will be -- it will come -- they will come back before Council before they start this. So thank you. MR.
