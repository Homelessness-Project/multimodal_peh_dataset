MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Rogan?

MR.WECHSLER :I'llgiveyouthebad stuff. MR.ROGAN:Butonacouple ofother things,I'dalsoliketothankScranton Tomorrow forthegoodworktheyaredoing withthekickoffforthefestivities . Unfortunately I--orfortunately Iwillbe outoftown,mybrother isgraduating from Pittsburgh University thisweekend ,soI won'tbeabletoattend anyofthe festivities thisweekend,butIamlooking forwardtofuture events. Regarding themall,therehasbeena lotoftalk,andspecifically onsocial mediaandlocalblogsaboutdifferent ideas forwhatthemallcanbecome andhowthat spacecanbestbeutilized .Manyofthe ideasthatwerebrought uparegreatideas, someofthemarealittle moreoutthere, butotherthings really aregoodideasthat people inthecommunity wanttoseeandthe listgoesonandonandon,different businesses people wouldliketoseecome intothearea,different concepts .Theidea1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 ofaReading Terminal -stylevenueisone that'sverypopular butthereareothers. Regarding today'sarticle withthe mall,withthediagnose onforauction ,I thinkpartoftheproblem withthemallis AlBoscov.IthinkthatMr.Boscov cares aboutonethingandonethingonlyandthat ishisstore.That'splainasdayifyou lookatthevacancy rate.Itappears there havebeennoattempt toattract new businesses intothatmall.Ifirmly believe thatMr.Boscov istrying todevalue that property sohecanbuyitatarockbottom price.It'snotrightwhat'sbeingdone.I amveryhopeful thatinoutside investor willpurchase thatproperty anddevelop it. IfBoscov remains apartofitgreat,butwe needtomoveinadifferent direction with thisbuilding . Thecurrent concept ofmallsisnot working nationwide.It'snotaunique problem toScranton thatshopping malls aren'tdoingwell.Viewmontisthe exception .TheViewmont Mallisright outside ofthecitydoingextremely well,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 butifyoulookatshopping mallsallacross thecountry theyaresuffering andthe Steamtown MallinScranton isinevenmuch worseshapethanmanyofthemare.Walking through thatmallislikeaghosttown. Thereareveryfewstores andit'sadomino effect.Eachstorethatclosesthat'sfewer people thanarewalking therethatmightbuy something elseatanother store,andit worksinreverse .Ifanewdeveloper comes inandputsoneortwonewideasinthere, things thatarepopular ,wegetpeople back intothatbuilding thatwillshopatallthe stores intherenotjusttheonenewstore thattheyarelooking for. SoI'mencouraged bytheprogress in thisregarding themall,butI'mhopeful thatwewillseenewownership andthatthat will,youknow,thatitwon'tbeMr.Boscov calling theshotsthereanymore . Secondly ,thepension issueswere brought uptonight andIspentalittle bit oftimereading through theminutes thatwe getfromallofthepension boards,we receive fivesetsofminutes fromallofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 different pensions composite ,police,soon, butthereisafewthings thatIdidwantto read,andIwon'tmention thepeople'snames otherthantheattorney forthePension Board,andIhavebeenveryconcerned about thisissuesinceitfirstcametolightthat people werereceiving double pensions and months havegonebyandwehaven'theardany answers .

MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou.Mr.Evans.

Secondly ,whenIbecame acity councilman Iwanted togetsomerealchange done,sometangible things,andit'sjustto effect positive change whereIcouldhelp makeScranton abetter placeforresidents , taxpayer sandthebusiness community .It really wasn'tmuchmorecomplicated than thatandoverthesepastmonths working alongside thesegentlemen tomyrightIhave cometolearnthatweallsharethatcommon vision.Wesometimesdisagree onpolicies andcertain issues,butwerespect each other'sopinions andviewpoints andweall sincerely wanttomakeourcityagreat placetoliveandtoworkandweallwantto findawaytocreate thosepositive changes sooner thanlater.Wecannolonger wait forchange tocometous,wemustfindaway1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 toacttomakechange happen. SinceIjoined thecitycouncil we havebeenattheforefront ofthe discussions onpension reform,union contract s,therecovery plan,landbanks, blight,pro-business policies , pro-neighborhood policies ,taxexempt properties ,reassessment andmore.Thereis muchtoaccomplish andasweknow2015is thecritical yearinScranton 'sfuture.We should continue tostrive tobepartners withtheadministration because weknowthe mayorandhisadministration wantsmanyof thesamethings wedo,butwealsomust realize thattimeisoftheessence andwe cannolonger waitontheslow,deliberate , palatial paceofthecitygovernment . Overthenexteightmonths of governing thisyearIhopeyouwillsee-- orcontinue toseeapositive andaneven moreproactive citycouncil .That'sallI have.Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Gaughan . MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,thankyou.

Thatisapartoftherecovery planandI don'tthinkweshould waitanylonger for official action tobetaken. InlightoftheLSTincrease ,the finalcompletion of2013auditandthe recent retention ofHenryAmoroso asa consultant tothemayor,Ithinkitwouldbe appropriate torequest apublic caucus with MayorCourtright ,HenryAmoroso andBusiness Administrator DaveBulzoni togiveusan update onhowtheadministration intendsto proceed withtheplandeveloped by Mr.Amoroso andwherewearewithinthat process .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Specific questions I'dliketo address include howtheLSTrevenue will effect theplanoverall ,howtheLSTrevenue willbeallocated anddistributed ,whatare thenextfiscal priorities moving forward in the2016and2017andwhatmeasures are beingtakentoensure thatthe2014auditis submitted ontime.Wehadasimilar caucus lastyearandIthinkitwouldbehelpful to getanupdate onwherewearewithin the planandwithin thatprocess andIwould hopethatwewouldsendaletter tothe mayor,Mr.Amoroso andMr.Bulzoni asking themtocometoapublic caucus inthenear future,andthat'sisallIhavethisweek. Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou.Theaudit seemstobe--nowthatit'scompleted there arestillquestions concerning theauditand what'sgoingtohappen andinthefuture,as farastheParking Authority thereceiver doesnotrespond tothecityandthat'sa problem ,that'swheretheproblem lies.

Believe me,Ihavebeenatnumerous meetings wherethishasbeendiscussed andyetthe bondinsurers havenotresponded verywell tothecity. Asfarasthemoving forward ,yes, wehaveemployed someone tobeinvolved in auditpreparation .Partofthatemployment isatraining component thatthepeople in theBusiness Administration Officewillbe through theprocess ofpreparation be trained forthosejobs.Ithinkgetting someone intohelpwithauditpreparation is anassettothecity.Itwillhelpusto havetheauditdoneontime.Thecostfor thisauditprepisminimal whenyoulookat theoverall budget andifwecan--ifthey willhelpinhaving anauditdoneindue timeIthinkthatthatbecomes agreatasset tothecity.
