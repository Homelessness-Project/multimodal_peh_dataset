MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community . Let us also take a special moment tonight of silence for all of the people in our community , country and world who had passed away from the coronavirus . This pandemic has turned our world upside down. But we must remain hopeful and strong. We continue to pray for the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they have protection and peace. Whether we are home or abroad, surround ed by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together and in place of our anxiety , let us have hope and peace. Thank you. Miss Carrera , roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Here. Thank you, Miss Carrera . I just want to take a second before we get started with our meeting tonight . I have a proclamation to read in honor of Charles Tansits , Jr., who turned 100 years old. And I just want to -- before I read the proclamation , I just want to say a few things. I had the pleasure -- I had the honor of reading this proclamation in front of Mr. Tansits on top of East Mountain Road on Saturday in honor of his 100th birthday . And there was group there of his family and his friends and neighbors from East Mountain . And I just want to say a few things because it was, you know, one of -- it was just a really great event. Tom Brokaw a number of years coined the phrase "The greatest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 generation ." And it was those men and women who grew up during the great depression and fought in World War II that were a part of that greatest generation that Tom Brokaw talked about. And members of that generation like Mr. Tansits were known for their work ethic, their sacrifice and their honor. And they knew personal responsibility . They as President Kennedy once put it, ask not what their country could for them but what they could do for their country . And it was an absolute honor to meet Mr. Tansits , to meet his family, some of who I knew before I met Mr. Tansits this past weekend . And as I stood at the top of East Mountain Road and watched Mr. Tansits , who by the way if anybody saw him on Newswatch 16, he is in phenomenal shape for 100 years old. He had me fooled. He was surround ed by his family and his friends . And I really thought of the great challenges that we face as a country , as a city right now in the midst of this pandemic and the political chaos that's engulfing our democracy .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 As I heard, you know, heard Mr. Tansits talk and talking with his family, I thought that we really could learn something from Mr. Tansits and that greatest generation , those very few people who are still left from that generation . And one of the things we could learn is, you know, if you get knocked down you get back up. You keep moving. You stay positive . You help people. And that's really Mr. Tansits to a T. He was telling us while we were up there that he was one of the first people, one of the first families on East Mountain I think when he was five years old. He's been up there for 95 years. And it was just a really, really great event. I was so happy and I'm so glad that this Council is taking a moment here and a second to honor him with this proclamation and wish him the best and wish his family the best. So I'll take a second now and read this proclamation into the record: WHEREAS , the COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON is desirous of honoring “CHARLES J. TANSITS , JR.” as he celebrates his 100th 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Birthday ; and WHEREAS , "CHARLES " was born in Scranton on October 11, 1920 above a tailor shop on Cedar Avenue; and WHEREAS , “CHARLES” attended St. Mary's Grade School and St. Mary's High School, graduating in 1939; and WHEREAS , “CHARLES ” was drafted during World War II and proudly served with the United States Army's 80th Division , 305th Medical Battalion . His tour of duty took him through Europe and the Battle of the Bulge; and WHEREAS , “CHARLES ” was married to Eleanor Osborne Tansits from February 1947 until her passing in January 2007. Charles and Eleanor raised five wonderful children : Mariellen Kaeb, Gloria Wenze, Thomas Tansits , Ronald Tansits and Charles Tansits III; and WHEREAS , “CHARLES ” worked as an upholsterer for a few years then had a long, successful career in the printing industry , having retired thirty-seven years ago in October . NOW, THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED , that on TUESDAY , OCTOBER 13, 2020, Scranton City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Council wishes to congratulate “CHARLES J. TANSITS , JR.” on his 100th birthday and wish him good health and happiness on reaching this milestone . BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that this Proclamation be made a permanent part of the Record of this Council , as lasting tribute to “CHARLES J. TANSITS , JR." Again, I want to thank Mr. Tansits and his family. It was a wonderful event on Saturday . And, you know, for somebody who is 100 years old who fought in World War II, the Battle of the Bulge in the medical battalion , again, he still walks if not all, most of Lake Scranton and knows everybody up on East Mountain and has a lot of friends and a lot good family. So again, I want to congratulate Mr. Tansits and wish him the best of health. Mrs. Reed, please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MS. REED: Thank you. THIRD ORDER. 3-A.

FUEL CARD ANALYSIS RECEIVED FROM OFFICE OF THE CITY CONTROLLER FOR THE PERIOD AUGUST 24 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 23, 2020. 3-H. MINUTES OF THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE REVIEW BOARD MEETING HELD SEPTEMBER 10, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Order items? I have two. First, as I mention ed in the caucus and I'll mention at our regular meeting , 3-A, the minutes of the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority , I was concerned when I originally had read these minutes about item number two on park playgrounds on page number two of the minutes about the lower playground which is located near the Kanjorski Bridge according to these minutes is going to be demolish ed. It says that most of the playground equipment is in disrepair . I was concern ed about that because I do spend a significant amount of time down there with my children . I don't think that the playground is in total disrepair . I was just there two or three weeks ago. And I still think it's in pretty good shape. There are parts of it that certainly need to be upgraded. I did speak to Mr. Gattens who is the Chairman of the Authority who I think does a wonderful job as do all the board members . And he informed me that the playground is not going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 demolished . They are looking for upgrades . There may be certain parts that get taken out and hopefully replaced with some upgrade s. So I was really pleased to hear that. And also, if you look in the minutes too, I was pleased to see that there's going to be a new playground that's put a butterfly -- next to the butterfly garden which I think is next to the zoo. And it will be named the Butterfly Playground, which I think is very good. The second thing I wanted to mention we talked about in the caucus which is 3-D. And that is a memo that we received from the Mayor. It was an update to the September 14th, 2020 letter to replace a July 21st, 2020 letter attached to Resolution No. 73 of 2020 which was passed by this Council on September 29th, 2020. And it basically updated the Acting Fire Chief salary to $95,808.75. When this was on our agenda and we passed it September 29th, 2020, the salary that was in the original memo attached to the legislation was for 84 thousand -some odd dollars, which is what it is budgeted at -- the position of Fire Chief is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 budgeted at in the 2020 operating budget. I did -- as I mention ed in the caucus, I did speak to the Mayor today and, you know, told her that I do not agree with this. Again, the Mayor's position on it according to what she told me today was that the precedent has already been set because Al Lucas received this amount when he was the Fire Chief. At that time as Solicitor Hayes reminded me in the caucus the reasoning then was that there was an unexpended balance in the fire department budget. And that's the reason that they could have increased it -- or not increase d it but kept Al Lucas at $95,808.75, which I believe he was making as a Captain in the fire department . I don't know what Mr. Judge was making. But I don't agree with this. I didn't agree with it back then. I do think that when you have a budget you have to stick with what is budgeted . You have to live within your budget. And I know, you know, if -- whether a precedent 's been set or not, we passed legislation in the summer of 2020 that stated very clearly that if there was going to be an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 increase in any salary, that that would have to come before the Council . So I would like a letter to be sent to the Mayor asking for clarification on this matter, asking for a detail of where -- if there is an unexpended balance if it still exists and where, what line item is that coming out of. And then I really think we need to talk about looking at when we get those answers , looking at whether or not that legislation that we passed was violated . The simple fix here I think is to have this salary be what it should be which is 84,000 and some-odd dollars, which was in the 2020 budget. So that's my stance on it. And we'll ask for further information from Mayor Cognetti . So, Kevin, if could you draft that and we'll get together if you need any further clarification . ATTY. HAYES: Sure. No problem . MR. GAUGHAN : And that's all I have on the Third Order items. Does anyone else have anything on the Third Order items? Very good. If not, received and filed. Do any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two of them -- actually two worthwhile fundraisers for this week. So tomorrow and Thursday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., Boscov's is holding its annual Friends helping Friends shopping days. Customer s receive 20 percent off purchases and 5 percent of their purchases go to a participating charity or organization of their choice. So this year they have about 150 groups participating including the Scranton Police Department . So that was worth mentioning . Also, there's going to be a flea market this Saturday , October 17th, 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. This flea market will benefit our friends at the Friends of the Poor. It's going to be at 240 Elm Street, Scranton , PA. It's going to be outdoors at the Scranton Sheet Metal parking lot behind Dunkin. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd just like to say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 congratulations to Mr. Tansits and his family. I know several members of the family and they are all great people. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other announcements ? Okay, I have a few. NDC will attend our caucus next Tuesday , October 20th at 5:45 p.m., to provide their third quarter parking update. So they will give us a presentation on what their budget looks like to date, what it looks like they're projecting towards the end of the year and then any updates to the parking garages in the City. Scranton Tomorrow is schedule d for a public caucus at 5:45 on October 27th. There were several questions about Scranton Tomorrow . So I know that they'll come prepared to answer those questions and give us an update on their activities . We also have a caucus scheduled with Herbert , Rowland and Grubic for Tuesday , November 10th, 5:45 p.m., to discuss the City's approach to stormwater management , specifically the progress that has occurred with this company working with the City on the pollution reduction plan and complying with the pollution 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 reduction requirements by the Environmental Protection Agency. Also, they'll give us an update on what has been accomplished in terms of best management practice s the City should implement to maintain its MS4 Permit and the exploration of the feasibility and benefits of managing stormwater on a regional basis. This is something that we all -- Council has dealt with in the last few years, prior administrations . It's a problem that did not go away even though we've -- we're facing a pandemic . It's something that is going to be a strain on future budgets I think and a strain on our DPW and a strain on our community because of the requirements that were put down on municipalities throughout the State of Pennsylvania from the EPA. So I look forward to meeting with HRG to learn more about this. And, Mrs. Reed, if we could actually extend the invitation to the Mayor and see if any members of her administration would like to join the caucus as well. That might be helpful since I know HRG has been working closely with them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Also a paper copy of Council 's weekly agenda, including a copy of all legislation and backup is available to review in the City Treasurer 's office, the first floor of City Hall. The Treasurer has graciously agreed to the weekly agenda being placed in her office for public inspection and review in the event that they do not have internet access, which many of our elderly citizens do not. The agenda is posted also to Council 's webpage on the City's website each week if do you have internet access. And it will continue to be posted there. The paper copy is just another option and a means of striving for full transparency with regard to legislative matters. And on top of that, our legal notice is placed weekly in the Sunday edition of the Scranton Times detailing Council 's agenda for the next meeting . I also wanted to make an announcement about the Ethics Board. The ad will be placed in the paper this week. You should see it in the Scranton Times on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Thursday . Council will be accepting letters of interest and resumes until Thursday , October 22nd. This would be to fill Bruce Reddick 's seat who recently resigned. It's a one-year term until August, 2000 and -- or the term goes until August, 2021. All that we would ask is that any members of the public who are interested in filling this seat, please review the requirements located in the City's Ethics Code. And you could access that by going to www.scranton pa.gov. And you could send those letters of interest and resumes to Lreed@scrantonpa .gov or you could send it to the City Clerk, Lori Reed, 340 North Washington Avenue, City Hall. Also, I was informed earlier today that all collective bargaining agreement s have been posted on the City's website under the Human Resources Department . That's been a request that's been made in the past of the administration and they have posted those. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN S 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Marie Schumacher and Patricia Nestor. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion to accept public comment and a second. On the question ? I'll ask Mrs. Reed now to please read the public comment into the record. MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission by Marie Schumacher as follows : O Effective storm water management portends to be a principal initiative in 2019 regardless of the impact on the operating budget." This is a quote from the 2019 budget; have you digested the end of the sentence REGARDLESS OF THE IMPACT ON THE OPERATING BUDGET." Did it happen? Of course not. Worse last week the Council President said Storm Water wasn't going to happen this year. The treatment of the property owners having serious stormwater 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 issues is something that should keep any elected official awake nights. I don't know whether the next action should be elevation to DEP or Court. O I was pleased with the 2021 budget approach of establishing a doable revenue projection and then making the expenses fit within that projection . However in my eyes both the Administration and Council lost credibility as it does appear we did not need to extend the Exit Plan and the grab for Federal funds based on a six million dollar deficit due to the China virus. O Several weeks ago you tabled the Capital Budget until answers to the questions were received . Two weeks ago you said the answers would be available "next week." Not only were they not available last week, they are not in Third Order this week. Why? o How much have we paid Stevens and Lee to date for the LST court issue? O Last year Council authorized a rather unusal Contract , in that is for three years (through September 2022 with Speck and Associations and Barry Isett and Associates . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 How much money have we spent to date, are there any progress reports (say annually ) scheduled and what Department is administering this Contract ? O Earlier this year I provided Council with an article from the TImes-Tribune noting that "Contracts designed to ensure officers receive fair wages and benefits have spilled over into public policy." It was a few years back when we learned a Scranton police officer had done something and was punished by the Chief; however , we were not allowed information on the incident because of a Contract clause which I verified . This is wrong. I call on Council to ensure this clause in not included in the next Contract which you should be receiving soon. O When do you expect to receive the 2019 Audit and what is holding up this action? o When may we expect a presentation on the Serrenti property plans and cost over the next five years? O Finally , how many open court issues against the City are there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 The second submission is from Patricia Nestor as follows : Remember the other day I sent an e-mail asking if the Scranton police department could do gun safety classes with the public? I have another good reason why this should be done. Breona Taylor. I was reading comments on a Facebook post and someone said that before the police fired, her boyfriend first fired a “non lethal warning shot.”. There is no such thing. All bullets are lethal and you do not discharge a weapon without intent to kill. Missing a target is bad aim and shows lack of control . If you want to warn people, get an alarm, not a gun! Firing “warning shots” at police is a good way to get killed. Fire arm safety education is badly needed in this Scranton and the country . My brother said years ago *before* he got his hunting license he had to pass a safety course. There's no requirements for buying a gun for self defense . Please have SPD and city hall start a gun safety campaign . Crime has been going up and people are buying guns out of fear. Fear is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 a terrible teacher . (This concludes letters as submitted to Council for public comment .) MS. REED: That is all, Councilman Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. I just want to take a minute -- well, I'll -- does anyone have anything on the question for public comment before I go through some of the answers that we received ? ATTY. HAYES: Councilman Gaughan , with regard to Miss Schumacher 's question on the number of court cases, if she could be more specific perhaps we could give her a response . I don't know what she means by the number of court filings . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Mrs. Reed, if you could e-mail Miss Schumacher and ask her if she could provide clarification on that. Okay, so a couple things for Miss Schumacher . The first about last week I said stormwater wasn't going to happen this year. I don't believe I said that. If I did say that, that statement doesn't even really make sense. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 And I don't know what that actually means stormwater is not going to happen this year. We're meeting with the company that worked with the City on coming up with a plan to manage stormwater on a regional basis November 10th. I've been pushing for that update for the last few months. And we're finally I think going to get some action on that. I've always said that we have major stormwater problems throughout the City. And I'm hoping that the administration in working with HRG is going to work to identify and resolve a lot of those issues. As for the second comment here -- usually I wouldn't comment on a comment , but that the administration and Council lost credibility as it does not appear -- as it does appear we did not need to extend the Exit Plan and the grab for federal funds based on a 6 million dollar deficit due to the China virus. Just two comments there. If anyone was paying attention when that whole conversation went on, the main crux of the extension of the Exit Plan was due to the fact 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 that without it, we could not transition from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax which is old and outdated and there's a lot of issues with it to the Payroll Preparation Tax. So that was the main reason that was given for extending the Exit Plan. And also at that time, we weren't really sure what the impact was going to be of the pandemic . And things obviously could change. We don't know that. As for the use of China virus, I just -- it's COVID-19. I wouldn't blame it on a specific country . That doesn't make sense to me at all. About the capital budget, I am going to go through some of the question s that we received . There will be information next week in Third Order. We did not receive all of the answers yet to the question s. But we will receive them. I talked to the Mayor and Business Administrator today. I think we're waiting on some answers from the Department of Public Works. But they have been more than responsive to our requests . How much have we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 paid Stevens and Lee to date? Solicitor Hayes e-mailed the Council today to let us know that as of -- and we did receive an update in July that as of July we -- the City has spent $175,858 to Stevens and Lee on the LST court issue -- the Act 511 issue I believe it was. And, Solicitor Hayes, I think you were going to reach out to the Law Department to see how much we've incurred from July to October ? Oh, sorry, you're muted Kevin. ATTY. HAYES: Sorry about that. Yes, I have reached out to the City Solicitor and asked him to give me an update on any additional invoices that have been submitted or paid since July to Stevens and Lee in connection with the Act 511 appeal. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you. And Miss Schumacher posed some other questions here that we'll get to the appropriate department . I don't know the answer to I think the last three off the top of my head. So we will take care of that. A couple other things -- and I think it's important just to bring up that there was several questions raised over the last few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 weeks, a lot to do with the capital budget. So I just want to take a minute in Fourth Order now and go through those. One of the question s was on prearrest drug program that the former Police Chief, Carl Graziano kind champion ed I think last year or the year before. We receive d a detailed PowerPoint from Chief Namiotka -- Acting Chief Namiotka and a program description that is a few dozen pages that kind of details the whole program . So we are going to send that I believe it was Miss Schumacher that asked that. We'll send that out to her. And then, Mrs. Reed, just because I think this is a great program , I voted for it when it came up on our agenda last year or the year before. So, Mrs. Reed, if we can put this in Third Order I think if anybody wants to take a look at it, it's a really good thing for our community . There was a question on the -- specifically for the capital budget. I think there will be a lot of people interested in this on the McLain Park study. So there was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 going to be a study, a comprehensive study of all of our parks, our whole park system which I think is really -- a really, really good idea. So McLane Associates gave us a tentative project schedule along with a number of documents detailing everything that they've done and everything that they will do. I'm not going to go through every single thing because I would bore you all to death with it. We are going to put this in Third Order for next week so that the public can take a look at because this is paid for with public tax dollars . But just to give you a brief tentative update or tentative project schedule , they are currently doing site assessment s of the recreation facilities throughout the City. And they're starting the preparation of a report. So this would include inventory and analysis to all 30 City-owned parks and these field visits will occur weekly. They've already done several of them. Connors Park and Billy Barrett Park over in Minooka are an example of that. They're also including an assessment of other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 complementary facilities and partnerships like the Heritage Trail and the Nay Aug Avenue natural play area. A draft report has been started . Data obtained during the field visits and background information will continually be added to the report. In November and December they're looking at neighborhood outreach discussions and conceptual renderings . And then January or February of 2021, they're going to compile the final report, conceptual master plan, phased opinion of probable costs for what the upgrades look like. A draft report will be sent to the City for review and comment . And then McLane will sit with City officials to discuss priorities and grant opportunities . And I know that Mr. McLane would be more than willing to come before Council with his partners and, you know, present this and discuss it. This is a very, very good project and worth every single penny that the City spends because what this is going to do is give us a master plan for the next 10, 15, 20 years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 to show us exactly what needs to happen in the parks, where we might be a little deficient , what upgrade s we need. And the biggest thing and the reason that we pushed this was because it's going to really help us get grant money because when you go for these different grants like a DCNR grant, they want to see that you have a master comprehensive plan. So we're going to have that. And if you look at the backup documentation that's been provided , they're well on their way to completing that. So I want to thank them for the update. Hopefully that answers the question there. There was a question about the dog license policy, $35 per dog a year is way too high. I agree. Administration responded that that's currently under review. So the dog license policy for those of you with animals or pets, that's current ly under review. Bev deBarros asked about polling places will they be ready for in-person voting. Information on polling places can be found at votesPA .com. If you go to votesPA .com you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 could see where your polling station is and you could look up where vote drop boxes are. That's the Pennsylvania voters services website where you could look up your polling location among a number of other different things. If you are a voter in Lackawanna County, you could call the Elections office at 570-963-6737 or visit Lackawannacounty .org for a list of polling location s. Again, all that information is available at votesPA .com. Onto the capital budget, there was a number of questions for the IT Department . So the project ed cost for the IT Department is nearly a million dollars . And there are several questions on that. So the administration responded that the project is being managed by the City's Digital Transformation Manager currently titled Information Technology Manager and the Director of Information Technology . An RFP is being prepared for a third party technology partner who will provide , technical expertise throughout the implementation of the new operating platform . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 The new system for the City will unify resident and commercial information , City financials and enable integrated workflow for the City's core processes and citizen chasing tools including financial management , asset management , human resources , applications and payments for licenses and permits and general search capability for public information . The hardware upgrade s are ongoing as part of our maintenance program . The $300,000 cost is specific to projected one time upgrade d -- upgrade costs. There was another question about the training of personnel for this big project . The training will be a combination of outside services and inhouse training. There was also a question about the RACV funding for the new roof at City Hall. The RACV was submitted before the August 12th deadline . The City expects to know what funds have been granted by the second quarter of 2021. The City currently has $80,000 that was received from the Historical Museum Commission allocated to the repair of the south tower. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Other funding will be dependent on revenues received , first budget and the capital fund balance . There was several question s about the Serrenti conversion . The response from the administration is the public safety building has been an ongoing project since 2015. As stated in the capital budget highlights , this administration has made a commitment to improve management of all current and future project s. Past expenditure s and plans for the emergency services center have been reviewed by public safety and business administration . We are taking a phased approach to the completion of the facility in order to conserve cash and maximize state and federal funding bringing the center online for the services it was designed for. The first phase is the public safety training simulator which will benefit both the police department and community organizations . Our aim is that this training capability will generate revenue from other municipalities and private companies before the end of 2021. Be assured the concerns raised by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 this question are being fully considered by the administration . I think that that is it for those questions . There was a few other questions on the DPW items. We'll get to those when we receive them from the administration . Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of the motion to accept public comment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time, no. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. So in lieu of the article today that was in the paper about the Scranton landlord appeal city -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 ongoing condemnation of apartment building that had a fatal fire, I would like to request -- and Miss Reed, would you please be able to do this for me? I'd like to request the police, fire and LIPS Department reports with this incident and also the police and fire run cards of this incident , if you would please do that for me. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : I'm going to save my comment s for agenda items. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I have a few things. The first is, I did speak with the Mayor today -- question s about the internship program . There is an internship program going on in the City, which I think is a good thing.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 There have been questions about what the cost of that program is. I think the state picks up most of it. But the Mayor is going to get a full overview from our OECD Director who is managing the program . And I expect to have that by next week. Also, I'm waiting on information about the Novembrino Park project , specifically how many change orders since the beginning of the project have been submitted and for how much and the total cost of the project to date verse what was originally budgeted . So again, I expect to have that by next week. We talked in the caucus briefly about the budget presentation from last week. And I want to just reiterate my comment s from the caucus that now that, you know, I've had time to review the presentation and the numbers , I would like to request the following : I would like to request a breakdown of the capital expenditures , other departmental expenditure s and nondepartmental expenditures . These are coming in way under budget which is a good thing. And I was pleasantly surprised. But I just find it a little hard to believe. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 And I want to make sure that we have everything account ed for and a full picture of what the outlook is here before the end of the year. As I mention ed in the caucus, capital expenditures , we're going to spend under budget by almost a million dollars . Same thing with other departmental expenditures and nondepartmental expenditures nearly, you know, less than 5 million dollars . Again, good thing. Pleasantly surprised , but based on my experience towards the end of the year, things are really tight. And I hope I'm wrong on that. And I hope that these numbers , you know, stay where they're at. But I just want to be positive . And I think that was all that I had for tonight . Yes, that's all I have. Thank you. Mrs. Reed? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Gaughan , we spoke in caucus about the issue you just said. And I was looking , can we possibly to your request , can we add the quarter four revenue to actual revenue intake for quarter four of 2019 as well? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Thank you. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO APPROVE THE DESIGNATION OF THE 300 BLOCK OF CENTER STREET AS A ONE-WAY STREET FROM PENN AVENUE TOWARDS WYOMING AVENUE WITH THE SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE DESIGNATIONS AS REFLECTED IN THE ATTACHED DRAWING , C-4 CENTER STREET PARKING . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? Did we freeze? Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. I thought I -- MR. GAUGHAN : There you go. That's okay. I think you froze, Mark. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question , I'm going to be voting against 5-B and 5-C because what they essentially do is allow the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 county to create more parking spots downtown . I'm all for cooperation with the county. If they wanted to make it a one way to create a safer loading zone, I'd be all for it. But at the same time this, you know, one thing we have a surplus of downtown is parking . Plus, you add on the fact that they purchased the former Community Bake Shop, took that off the tax rolls and put a parking lot there. And the Globe Store, the County Government Center now is connected to a parking garage. Plus the fact that in a two block radius, there's at least four parking garages . We don't need to add more parking downtown . So for that reason, I'm going to be voting against 5-B and 5-C. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'll vote to move it forward so we can have a discussion . But I wouldn't mind seeing more information on the status of the Globe Store parking how far along they are with that. I think maybe some of the updates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 with NDC -- is it next week, Mr. Gaughan , might be helpful with that as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. As I'm reading through this -- and correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like the engineer for the county is saying that they use the 300 block of Center Street to access the garages , the loading docks and other points of ingress and egress to the Government Center. And from what I'm reading , the engineer s are requesting this because they don't believe that the parking that's already there for this section of the street is acceptable by engineering standard s for two-way traffic because the clearance in some areas of the proposed parking would be 16 feet. So I'm -- I mean, I -- I'm still reviewing this. But there's parking already there. I don't know. It seems like there is parking already going on there. And this would make it a one way so that when you're backing out and backing in it would be safer. Unless I'm -- I could be missing something there as well. I don't know. But anyways, I'm going to vote to introduce it so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 that we can continue to discuss it. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I just wanted to add, yeah, my understanding from the legislation wasn't that that it would be adding spots but maybe we need more clarification on that. It's been a while since I've driven down that street. But when I've been down there in the past, I know they have a parking area with spots. But I do remember it being pretty narrow. And I could understand why it would be a one way instead of a two way. And I think there's parking -- maybe temporary loading /parking along the side. So I could see how it would enhance the safety of the street. But I'm open to asking for further information on the spots. ATTY. HAYES: The one issue -- and I don't know the answer to this question as I sit here now is that there's -- pursuant to the City Code, there's no parking permitted in courts or alleys. And I don't know that Center Street qualifies for that or not. And I could research that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 But generally there is no -- the City Code prohibits any parking on courts or alleys. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Good question . Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : I mean, so I just read it a little differently because if you look at the legisla tive coversheet, specifically under what does the legislation do, what are the specific goals, tasks the legislation seeks to accomplish ? It states that legislation seeks to allow Lackawanna County to use the 300 block of Center Street for access to their Government building with the ability to allow parking that would be safe and in accordance with engineering standards . So I read that to mean that it would be adding parking . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. I think we need to clarify that prior to final passage . So we will do that. That's a good point. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? MR. DONAHUE : No. MR. GAUGHAN : The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A ROAD MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND LACKAWANNA COUNTY FOR THE PAVING, REPAIR, SNOWPLOWING , SIGNAGE AND ANY OTHER MAINTENANCE DUTIES, AS NEEDED ONCE THE 300 BLOCK OF CENTER STREET HAS BEEN DESIGNATED ONE-WAY. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF MATTHEW MEYER, PH.D., 930 TAYLOR AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18510 AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF ETHICS EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 20, 2020. DR. MEYER WILL BE REPLACING MARY JO SHERIDAN WHO RESIGNED EFFECTIVE AUGUST 28, 2020. DR. MEYER WILL FILL THE UNEXPIRED TERM OF MARY JO SHERIDAN WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AUGUST 31, 2022. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I don't think you could have asked for a better candidate for this board, someone who is trained in -- a trained philosopher and also trained in ethics, currently employed as a profess or of philosophy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 at the University of Scranton and has taught a number of ethics courses to hundreds of students and smaller seminars that talk about the importance of civil responsibility , so on and so forth. So I want to thank Dr. Meyer for showing interest and putting his name in. I also want to say that, you know, two years ago -- I think it was two years or maybe a year ago. I can't remember off the top of my head. But when I had really pushed to revive the Ethics Board, I really, really thought it was so important and everything that's gone on in the City in terms of corruption in the last year and a half has highlight ed that. The Ethics Board has -- it is not where it should. But I know that the members that are currently on that board are trying their best to get it really up and running and functioning . They have come a long way since we rewrote the Ethics Code a year and a half ago. There is more that needs to be done. I do know that -- I think all City employees now it's my understanding have signed off on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the fact that they received the Ethics Code and have acknowledge d it. And we're kind of living under those rules now. But one of the things that we had discussed previously was training . And that was going to be a part of kind of the Ethics Board's duty was to kind of get that training off the ground, not only for City employees but for public officials too. I think any public official in the City of Scranton should have that ethics training , should have that training on things that had to do with our Ethics Code and make sure that everybody fully understands what they're signing off on. So again, I want to thank Dr. Meyer for taking this position until 2022, wish him the best of luck. And we'll continue to move forward in finding the next person to complete the board and move forward . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.

MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'd like to make a motion to table 7-D until we receive a full breakdown of all bids from the administration . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second that. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion to table Item 7-D and a second. On the question for the motion to table? On the question , so there is two things that we're requesting here. Number one, a breakdown of all 11 bidders . There was a breakdown of the final four, which I appreciated . But we did request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 last week a breakdown of all 11 so that we could get a full picture . And I did speak with the Mayor and Business Administrator today. And they are in the process of providing us that. So when we get that we will bring this back up for a final vote. And second thing that we are waiting for is a disclosure by this firm in terms of political contributions given to any City officials over the last five years. I inquired about why that was not included in the bid and was told that it was an oversight . I have made it very clear to the administration that moving forward and they agree and this will be included according to the Law Department and the Mayor in any RFP or RFQ moving forward that there will be a disclosure by any firms that bid, want to do work in the City that they will disclose the amount, the date, anything else relevant to political contributions to any elected official in the City of Scranton . I think that's very important . And that will be included moving forward . This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 according to the administration was an oversight . And we'll wait for that information and then bring it up for a final vote if everyone has reviewed it next week. MR. DONAHUE : And I would just like to just add that I agree with that point 100 percent strictly to make it a public record that, you know, whoever is getting a contract here who they contributed to and here's how much they contribute d. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I agree. Anyone else on the question on the motion to table? All those in favor of tabling Item 7-D signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR.
