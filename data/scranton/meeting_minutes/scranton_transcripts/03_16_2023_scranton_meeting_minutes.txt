KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I just had a few. There was a couple takeaways. When we look at the Payroll Preparation Tax, the fourth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 quarter numbers came in. We were about -- we initially thought we were going to be about $800,000 short. But it ended up being 379 -- $378,000 short there. With the Single Tax Office when we're looking at refuse coming in we're about 1.6 million lower than we were last year. Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the administration and see -- we have the emergency declaration in here. But I'm not sure if we actually used the emergency declaration on any snow clearing in the snowstorm this week. But if we could ask if we used that, in fact, used that emergency declaration . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find out, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And just another takeaway, looking at some of the pension board meeting s I see that we -- some of -- we've lost four employees of the city that I didn't realize until looking through those minutes . That's all. MR. KING: Any other members have any comments on Third Order items? Nothing ? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple, this Saturday , March 18th, the Uka-vets from 6 to 10 p.m., will be having a St. Patrick 's party pot luck. And also, in addition to that, they're going to have entertainment by Duo and Side Piece. So feel free to bring something to eat and snack and enjoy the pot luck and the music. Second, St. Patrick 's Day, there will be a ham and cabbage takeout dinner at St. Patrick 's Parish. They'll sponsor a takeout ham and cabbage dinner on Friday, March 17th from 4 to 7 p.m., in the All Saints Academy school auditorium . Tickets are $10 per person. They could be purchased at the parish office or you could send a check in and they will be mailed to you. Only a limited amount of tickets . Of course, you could get them at the door. And lastly, the Friends of the Poor, our Friends of the Poor are proud to announce that they will have their annual Easter food and basket giveaway . This will take place April 4th from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. or while 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 supplies last. This is still a drivethrough distribution event. Also, you could walk up. And it will be at the Scranton Cultural Center on 420 North Washington Avenue. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Does anyone else have any announcements . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have an announcement . On Monday, March 20th there will be applications available for CDBG, HOME, and HESG funding . And the city will be accepting applications until 3 p.m. on Thursday , April 20th. The application process will be handled utilizing Neighborly and OECD is estimating that 2.7 million dollars of CDBG, $700,000 of HOME and $250,000 of HESG funding will be available . That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Anyone else? I'd just like to announce I was honored last week to greet the sister city delegation from Ballina Ireland . I met with Ballina City Mayor Mark Duffy along with councillors Declan Turnbull 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 and Amy Reap. We welcome d them here to City Hall. They also participated in the St. Patrick 's Day Parade over the weekend . And it was a wonderful weekend and an honor to have that Irish delegation from our sister city here in Scranton . I also had the opportunity to meet with the former Scranton City Council President who was in town unfortunately for a funeral . He was also former Deputy Mayor of City of Scranton , Rich Rossi. So we had Rich here in City Hall just to kind of come in a little bit and reminisce about the many years he served the city here in the City Hall. So I want to wish him well. And it sounded like he had great week meeting with some old friends here in the City of Scranton . That's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Today is March 16th, 2023. Do you know where your 2021 audit is? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. KING: It will be here next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Ah-hah. Okay. Do we know whether or not the Mayor is going to implement the penalty clause? MR. KING: Still do not have an answer on that yet. I'll reach out to her again, see where we are at with that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Even if she does not do that, I would still like to know what the problems were that caused it to be almost six months late beyond the September 30th date that was promised by Kohanski . And what is the status of legislation to appoint a new auditor ? MR. KING: I believe -- I'll address that in Fifth Order. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Do we have any movement on the arbitrations for the police and firefighter union contracts ? MR. KING: Nothing new since last week. They are both in arbitration . And hopefully they are expecting to settle the police one by the end of the month. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, how about the DPW contract which was signed on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 September 13th, 2022? I remember being told here that they had to, you know, send it back and forth between the parties to make sure it was correct . That was six months ago. Don't tell me it takes six months to dot the I's and cross the T's. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out on that again? Find out what's happening with that contract which, you know, has been signed and why we can't get it posted up on our website , if you could? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Contact the administration , please. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : And last week I inquired about a $600,000 loan that the city made to Ice Box. Ice Box has now been sold to Geisinger . What is the status of that loan? Did we get any information ? MR. KING: I don't believe we have any information on that at this point. And once again, we'll reach out to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 administration to see where that's at, if you could, reach out to the Mayor's office. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . MS. HODOWANITZ : Now last night I attended the Ethics Board. And I had some questions with regard to the Ethics Code which is a short document . It's only 28 pages. And I was told to come here and ask because of the involvement of the City Clerk. So on page nine, section four, statements of financial interest , any official or employee of the city or authorities or boards with decision -making authority including the advisory boards shall file with the City Clerk a statement of financial interest for the preceding calendar year by May 1 of each year as defined by the State Code of Ethics. Any individual appointed to such a position after May 1 has 15 working days to file the statement of financial interest . All statements must be made available for public inspection and copying , an amount not to exceed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 actual cost. And here is the kicker. All statements must -- not may, must be posted on the City's website . So please tell me where can I find those statements on the City's website ? MR. KING: I'm not aware are if they are not on there. And I would recommend that we contact the administration and find out if we could get those posted. If that is, in fact, what needs to happen then we should have them posted on there. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , Mr. King. We received them and we file them in alphabetical order, time and date stamped , and keep the records in our office. But I'll reach out. MR. KING: Have they been posted on the website in the past, are you aware? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, they haven't. They haven't. MR. KING: Okay. But if you could check with the administration and maybe the Law Department and have them check into that. MS. HODOWANITZ : The Ethics Board 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 says they're not contemplating any amendments to the code at this time. So they should abide by the code or make an amendment , one or the other. But I hope to see those statements and the DPW contract in the near future. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I'm sure I'm going to see Joan up here next week and the week after and the week after that asking the same questions with no answers from Council . Mr. King, she's asked you how many weeks about the Mayor endorsing that penalty of 10 percent for the audit. You keep on saying she hasn't given you an answer. MR. KING: She hasn't. MS. FRANUS: Did you ever say to her point blank I'm tired of waiting, could you please give me an answer? MR. KING: I've asked her several times. MS. FRANUS: And what does she say to you when you ask her?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. KING: They're looking into it. MS. FRANUS: I think you have to be more forceful and get a definite answer. They just don't want -- they don't want to do it because one hand washes the other in my opinion . If they do that, then the audit might look different if they penalize them. They can't do that, can they. Okay, now, I asked last week about the overtime of the DPW, Mr. King. And you asked Mr. Voldenberg to check into it. So far as of yesterday , he has not heard back. But don't you or Mr. Smurl who is in charge of DPW on this Council pick up a phone and call the director and say what are you doing about records for overtime ? Why are you not writing anything down as to why you're working overtime ? It's not just up to Mr. Voldenberg . You could pick up a phone. You're getting paid over $12,000 a year. Don't you think you and Mr. Smurl could ask yourself ? Let me ask you this. How do you feel about that? Do you think they should -- do you think they should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 write down the reasons they work overtime ? I'm waiting for a -- MR. KING: I do, yeah. I do. MS. FRANUS: Do you, Mr. Smurl? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. MS. FRANUS: Well, I think you should talk to them about it then instead of sitting up here and not getting answers . Mr. Voldenberg can only do so much. It's up to you now. By next week I expect an answer on that. That's taxpayer 's money. When the Mayor ran for election , she said she wanted transparency and accountability . Well, that's gone out the window. So one overtime I think it was 9:42 at night. I'd like to know the reason for that. Ask about that one. It was in February , 9:42 at night. Okay, now, Mr. Schuster last week you asked about Rubicon and how they're saving the money for the city. I suggest that you call DPW Chris Smith, the supervisor of refuse and the director to have them come in and explain everything about Rubicon , ask them to bring documents to show if any routes have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 reassigned , changed . Let the people in the city know what's going on, not just ask Mr. Voldenberg to find out. Have a caucus with the Director of DPW and Chris Smith, the supervisor of refuse. Have him -- have them come in and answer all of your questions and let the people at home know exactly what is going on down there at DPW. Are you willing to do that? MR. SCHUSTER : So my two questions are, how much money has been saved so far and if they answer, I assume it's zero because we haven't heard someone say that yet. And when it comes to the routes, I'm sure that they haven't used it for routing yet. And I'm sure that's why they haven't been in here, but -- MS. FRANUS: I still think -- Mr. Schuster , I still believe have them come here and say that. Let the people at home know exactly what's going on down there with Rubicon . That's up to the director and Chris Smith the supervisor to be taking care of this. Let them come here and answer those questions in public. I don't want to hear what they told you. I want to hear them say it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 We're paying them a lot of money. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me. We did receive some answers . I don't know if you saw them yet in an e-mail. They're pretty vague though. I agree. They should be here. We brought them in once before. MS. FRANUS: Well, bring them in again. MR. MCANDREW : And we didn't get the answers that -- MS. FRANUS: I'm asking you to please bring them in again because the people at home want to know what's going on with Rubicon . Sixty-two cities have that. It works very well. The reason I believe it's not working is because they're not implementing it. They don't want to. The union guys don't want anything to do with Rubicon . So I absolutely want to hear them say it. And if you don't bring them in, that just shows that we don't have transparency here either. So if you can't bring them in, that speaks volumes . Let them answer to the public. Rubicon is a good company . Let's see the DPW utilize it. And you will see a huge savings. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 But let them come here. Let them answer the questions . Let them bring the documents to show the people exactly what's going on or better yet, show them what's not going on at DPW, how they're not utilizing it. I want to see. I think all the people in the city want to know why the routes aren't changed yet, everything . Please bring them in. Thank you. And if you don't bring them in I'll be back again. Mr. King, please and Mr. Smurl, please go on and use your telephone and get some answers . MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Dave Rinaldi . MR. RINALDI : Thank you. David Rinaldi , 212 Colfax. I want to make a couple comments tonight . I'm sure everybody 's seen this. Geisinger , are they in trouble ? I don't know. Are they betting on the right horse? I don't know. Okay, how about this one? Is all the property that's not being used for actual medical treatment , is that going to be taxed? Are they going to pay city property taxes? Thirdly , the third thing I got from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the paper is just the beginning of this week. It was Geisinger is still buying properties , right? They bought the property at 1808 Vine Street for $325,000. Now, I don't know why they continue to buy property if they were thinking of pulling out. But, you know, I don't understand corporations and especially the greed. But so I really -- I do have a question . I know Councilman McAndrew and Councilman Schuster want or did at the last meeting want to hold Geisinger to the agreement that they made with the community prior to January 6th when the map changed . So I'm going to ask the rest of Council , the other three, Mr. Smurl, Mr. King, and Miss Rothchild what exactly has given you the idea that after spending millions of dollars Geisinger may pull out? I mean, I just don't understand it. I do know that there is some movement that's been made. But I'm going to renew my request from last -- the last meeting , have Geisinger come down here in front of the paper, in front of the TV cameras and let's sit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 down because what we've gotten down to now is just the effect they have on Wheeler and the effect that they have on Colfax, their plans. Have them come down. Have them sit here. Council come in and we can find out whether or not there is a possibility of them pulling out after all of this. I don't think there is. And I personally think that Council should lobby on behalf of the people who lived in that area for years and years and years and supported this city. Have someone come in here and especially with greed that's going on with corporations now and just take over a neighborhood and just make the property because of covenants that they put on just unusable from what it was before. It's not right. But I'll renew my questions . Like I said, I mean, what makes you think that after spending millions of dollars , a company who is reporting losses is going to pull out of this thing and where would they go? And finally , I do have a question though. I have a question on the rules that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 are in the back of the booklet. If someone is speaking after me or I shouldn 't say that. Can I yield my time to the person that speaks behind me and give them 10 minutes? And I would like to know why and I would also like to know why answering would take up the public's time before Council in their participation . And that's all I have today. Oh, I did want to mention one other thing. The city has been calling around to all the municipalities for March asking who are the first women who were in different elected offices. And I commend the city for doing that. We should have a history of that for every community in this county. So thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Rinaldi . Bob Shoemaker . MR. SHOEMAKER : Hi, everybody . My name is Bob Shoemaker . I live at 617 Colfax Avenue with my wife. We have lived in the city for the past 39 years. I'd like to thank the Council members for your dedication taking your time for Council . I served on both the Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Municipal Rec Authority and then also Zoning Hearing Board over the years. My wife and I both worked our entire careers in healthcare . My wife works for Geisinger . She works down at the old Ice Box in physical therapy . I work for Lehigh Valley Health Network at their new facility in Dickson City. I'm here tonight to voice my support for the expansion . I have friends here. I have acquaintance s here. That's our neighborhood . This is not directly across from my house but I could walk on my sidewalk and see the hospital and that garage is going to come back closer towards us. I'm really here tonight to speak, you know, this whole thing -- and again, I don't live across from this. But the whole expansion seems to be about the parking garages . And really I'm here to speak about the access to healthcare . CMC was built in 1969. You know, at the time we had two hospitals in -- two other hospital s in Scranton . We had a hospital in the Mid Valley. We had a hospital in Tunkhannock and we had two in Carbondale . Since that time Mid Valley is closed. Tunkhannock hospital is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 closed. Both hospital s in Carbondale have closed. Community Health Systems that owns both Regional and Moses Taylor are owned by a subsidiary . I think it's Tennessee . That's Community Health. They own Commonwealth Health Systems . They have closed Moses Taylor to patients -- inpatient s. They have closed the ER. Right now they are shutting patients to Regional . Those extra people that used to go to those facilities are now coming up to CMC. CMC, my understanding is they have about 38 ER beds, many of those are in the hallway . And so and on a busy time, the average wait at Geisinger is three to five hours for care. For behavioral health patient , it's about 39 hours until they're placed. I walk the park most morning s. I live in that neighborhood . Every day I see ambulances stacked up to get into the ER at Moses Taylor. As many as nine at a time. My understanding is the expansion that CMC is going to be -- they want two parking garages and so they're not parking on Nay Aug Park's property .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And they're going to open up the ER, many more beds and the hope is they will also have pediatric healthcare there, at least a block of rooms for it. CMC is the only local trauma facility . And the ER is the top of the funnel for the hospital . That's where those patient s come in. You know, there was discussion about them moving the ER to some other place so you don't have that traffic coming in. But they have to be part of the hospital . Geisinger has been moving -- that's why they have been moving into the city. They're trying to take all of those outpatient visits that used to come into the hospital and move them downtown so you don't have that traffic so you don't have those every 15 minute patient s, those people driving in. I think my misunderstanding is if I understand it is they hope to have more private rooms and expand the ER. I look at this as an issue for the whole region, okay? Right now Wayne County has one small hospital . Pike County has no hospital . Northern Monroe County has no hospital . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 They go to Pocono or come to Scranton . People from all over the area come into Scranton for healthcare . We're seeing a lot of retirees come into the area. Again, I work with a lot them throughout the northeast . They come from all of these different counties than Scranton . I think it's important as we look to grow the city and we want to bring those retirees in, that we need a good healthcare . Again, this is a regional problem . But I am sensitive to how much tax money is lost. You know, so we lost these properties and, you know, the hospital does provide services to alleviate some of the problems with the city. But we lose a lot of tax money. And then again, so I think the city government needs to go back and revisit the pilot program . I think the old days, the local universities and hospital s and nonprofits hesitate d to dump money into the black hole of the City of Scranton . I think the budget is certainly getting better. I think we could also target those pilot program s. If Geisinger makes a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 pilot donation , put it in that neighborhood right where it is. Let it stay there. I think that's really important for us. The neighborhood around CMC I think has some of the highest taxes probably in the county. So are they going to take one on the chin? Can I have another minute? MR. KING: The rules are five minutes, I'm sorry. MR. SHOEMAKER : Okay, thank you very much. Appreciate it. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SHOEMAKER : Appreciate it. MR. KING: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. You know, I thought today that I'm not going to spend time talking about ECTV because I have to send a couple more certified letters out. But, you know, when you look at what's going on at the CMC and what's happening to the residents of this city, they're serfs. They are just slaves to the government . You know, I guess this is somebody 's attorney who came here today. And if I was him, I'd be in the courtroom . So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 just have to say that, you know, maybe he'll pay attention to some of the things going on in the courthouse when I take ECTV to court and show what residents and what citizens in this country have rights and that, you know, somebody 's got to start respect ing those rights. And when we talk about hospital s in the city, the City of Scranton had the Scranton State General Hospital on Mulberry Street. As a child I delivered newspapers in that hospital . They shut that floor by floor down and put private rooms in them and put all new machinery and equipment . And that was the best hospital in the city right off the highway here on Mulberry Street. And then, of course, Governor Casey came in and closed it and played politics with the healthcare system. And we've chased non-profits out of healthcare as if for profit hospital s offer us something and they don't. And I'm not for for profit hospitals . I'm vehemently opposed to them. All money for healthcare should go back into the system. And when you know about how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Scranton State General Hospital started , you'll know that they brought a minor home and threw him on his porch and his wife and another woman started the Scranton State General Hospital from a little building that was there. They had a drug treatment center there also. And, you know, I think we have to realize that city government is seriously broken. The Mayor said she'd come up here to the Council and actually lead from the front and we don't have that. This attorney talked about changing the zoning map in the city. Everybody knew there was something going on when you do something like that because this is pay to play politics in this city. In my opinion , all five of the Council members are involved and former Council members . Don't forget what happened in 2015 when the Council and Mayor removed the PEG channel because the tax group. You don't want to hear what people have to say. That's the problem . And you really don't care what they think as you destroy the city with your legislation and your utter silliness and lack 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 of respect for resident s and the rights of Americans to petition their government . And it goes on here every day. And it's really pathetic that we accept it. But you know the one thing that I think everybody should understand is that not one of these Council members should be retained , not one in the next election . The only problem is, we need the republican candidate s or independent candidate s to come to this podium and tell the resident s of the city how they see things differently from you because we can't take much more of you. And the Mayor locking the downstairs up, I've got a letter coming for her soon too. We really have to have a discussion about grant money. We have to have a lot of discussions . And me, I'm not afraid to ask question s. And I'm not afraid of answers. And I'm not afraid of obstacles . I have been coming here almost four years. And the most pathetic thing that I see in this city is the residents afraid to pick their head up off the ground because you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 beat them down so much that they're just -- they're not even people anymore. They are just slaves. And the abuse just continues , whether it had to do with the Nay Aug project and whether it has to do with picking up the bottles and cans from non-profits and bars. The rules here only apply to certain people but not to everybody. And the government doesn't have our best in mind and it hasn't for a long time. It's all let's go meet. Let's get signatures together and let's pretend like we're representing somebody . But when you represent yourself , look at your pool study. The city is down to 76,000 people from 103 when I was a kid. There's not much time left. And you'll play until the fiddler dies. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Well, Council , as much as this anguishes me, I have to apologize to Council for my chastation last week. Mr. Schuster informed me after the meeting that some of these complaints of mine were being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 addressed . You know, it's so frustrating to just not to see anything done and have anything done. There was a letter in the paper Monday some people complimented code enforcement for a quick response about -- on Capouse about a bunch of slumlord s were taking over the place. I had a business there for 20 years. And slumlords aren't new to the area. But I've complained four or five years about a dozen things that every one of them is there today purposely . Mr. Oleski's office just purposely avoids all the issues like abandoned cars and so forth that I've been complaining about. And Mr. Sunday, you can't allow someone to single you out like he's done me because of personal reasons that being I'm always complaining about him not taking care of my neighborhood . You know, when he stood on my porch and took a picture of a 20-year-old yard chair with two cases of water on it and calls it rubbish , if I bought it, how can it be rubbish ? There's an American flag there 25 years right behind it. I guess that's part of his rubbish .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 I'll tell you, the only garbage on my porch that day was Mr. Sunday and his -- just constant attacks on me with ticket after ticket after ticket which Roseanne paid. But let me say one thing. You people -- very few of you people out there and Council know Mr. Oleski's office lost a lawsuit in 2021 for $285,000 for exactly the same things that he's doing to me exactly . It's in the paper. It's easy to see. I have a lawsuit right there waiting if I want to do something . This man doesn't have any business having an office in this city. He's not capable of running it. Of course, I have the same feelings about the Mayor. I just can't see where she's capable of taking care of the city. I see these pictures of Pittston . You know, you leave Scranton to go to Dickson City or I go to Kingston a lot of weekends . The road is so good. I go down North Main Avenue once or twice a day, there must be 150 cuts. Why is there so many places in the pavement and they are always allowed to be patched with cold 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 patches and all of that. It doesn't make sense. All of these other cities you drive through , they have a good street system. Scranton , they just tear up the street. As soon as they're paved they even tear them up. Well, again, I thank you for -- for doing -- taking some actions that I didn't know about. And I apologize for being so upset with Council . But the rest of what I said last week, the rest of them I picked on, I meant every word of it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. SCHUSTER : So, Mr. Ellman, that's the update -- MR. ELLMAN: Thank you for this. MR. SCHUSTER : -- that's the update on the properties that you gave me. Mr. Voldenberg reached out to all the departments to get that for you. And he also reached out to the Scranton Police Department about those few abandon ed vehicle s that are out there. And we haven't heard back about the abandon ed vehicle s yet. But I hope to hear soon. MR. ELLMAN: If you knew how out of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 character it is for me to say I'm sorry -- MR. SCHUSTER : That's quite all right. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: It ought to mean twice as much when I say it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MS. KOLOSKI : Doris Koloski , Hill Section resident . Okay, first I want to ask about moving the date for the public hearing . I know that -- they were going to agree to it. We need it to be any time after the 25th of the month. And we also wondered if we could have extended time and not be cut off in five minutes for public hearing because of some presentations . Okay, so you can give me an answer when I'm finished because I want to address some of the things that Mr. Shoemaker had said. Oh, one other thing. Where can you find out what the caucus is going to be about? Like, I came to the caucus today thinking Don King was going to be here because it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 cancelled Tuesday and coming Thursday , but there was nowhere to find that out as far as I know. You could answer me that when I'm done too. Now, I wanted to say something . The CMC might have started in 1968, but it was the Hahnemann Hospital before that because I gave birth there in 1964. And the rooms were like where you had to walk down the hall to go to the bathroom and to take a shower back then. Okay, so before that I wanted to say that. The ambulances , I'd like to address the ambulance pile up there because it's not piled up from the patient s. I'm up on that side of the park every single day on the hospital side. And I even walk by the ambulance bay a lot with my dogs. And most of the time even if they're unloading a patient , like, a little up the block which I've only seen once and wheeling them down. It's just a catastrophe . Most of those are empty. They take the patient in. And then they just keep parking there waiting for their next call. Some of them have now moved their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 ambulances up in front of the museum along the edge of the park to make room. So somebody must have said something to them about it because they're not -- they're just there waiting for calls. There's a lot of places they could move to to wait for calls. They're not stacked up with patient after patient after patient waiting to be wheeled in, not the ones I've seen anyway. So that I just wanted to say because that's what it looks like if you don't know. It looks like they're waiting and they're waiting and they're waiting . They don't. They go up. They let them out and then they stay there. The other thing is because I feel bad that everybody thinks we're against this approved healthcare , which we are not against this approved healthcare. I'd love to see the pediatric unit back. I personally would like to see it down at the Ice Box, a whole containment of pediatric , birthing , neonatal and everything there so the kids didn't have to wait in an emergency room filled with sick adults and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 getting knocked back because somebody has a heart attack. I would have love to see a pediatric center all by itself with everything from giving birth to taking care of the neonatal . They just bought that whole Ice Box. They could easily do that with parking. And it's a stand-alone facility . Stand-alone facilities are great because you don't have to wait for absolutely everything . The parking would only -- we're only asking that they only go 45 feet high instead of 10 stories or 8 stories . Now, they agreed to do it on my side of the block. I probably could easily say, okay, we're satisfied even though we're not really satisfied . But we agreed to compromise . It's the 200 block. And I don't have to be here for the 200 block because I live on the 400 block. But it isn't fair. And if they say it's not long enough because they need all these extra spaces, well, across the street they tore down already two of the houses that they bought and they said they're going to make a green space with little benches to sit on and everything .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Well, all they're going to do is people are going to be sitting on smoking and drop the cigarette butts all over like they do everywhere else around the hospital . Why can't they put a 45 foot parking garage on that side, just maybe for the physicians or something ? Then they could have that whole block of 45 foot parking garage. And I already spoke to the two people that are here and majorly concerned all the time about it. They would agree that would satisfy them. There is so many solutions but they won't talk to us. And they won't take ideas from -- okay, I'm going stop now because I want you to have your time to answer my questions about the time limit and the new date. MR. KING: I will look into the time limit. But I believe the rules do say five minutes for Council Chambers when we have meetings for speaking . So I believe that would require a change in the rules. As far as the caucuses , unfortunately we had a snowstorm . It was an emergency . And then the Mayor had requested 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 that we move that up until next week. We probably should have done a better job advertising that those caucuses were moved. So I apologize for that. MS. KOLOSKI : Where are the caucuses advertise d because I don't see it on the website . And I might not know where to look. MR. KING: They're usually not advertise d. We announce -- we announce if we're going to have a caucus here. MS. KOLOSKI : Oh, okay. MR. KING: But knowing you were here last week you would have been expecting it. We should have probably done a better job with that. So I apologize for that. MS. KOLOSKI : That's okay. I mean, it's -- MR. KING: They are going to be here next week. MS. KOLOSKI : Yeah, when they cancel it, they put in the cancelation . When the Mayor puts cancelation in she should say -- but it may not be the same agenda or something . MR. KING: Possible . MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. So the only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 other thing is, did you decide on a date that you could move that public meeting to? MR. KING: I can address that during Fifth Order. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. I'm sorry, what? MR. KING: I'll address that during Fifth Order. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, thank you. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . As of Council rules, the President has at any time the ability to extend beyond five minutes any of the public speaking time. That's actually in the rule themselves . So a person can request from the audience an extension . And it's up to the President of Council to decide whether or not it is -- MR. KING: Thank you. I haven't decided yet. MR. COYNE: It is also part of the -- addressed in the Sunshine Act purely for the reason -- they understand with financials before a city in some meetings that they do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 require an extended period of time. And they're asked to consider -- and you're asked to consider that just because of the scope of the issues. Getting onto different subject , we now have purchased our electric cars, 10 of them. Looking at the base price with no extras on them, that's $300,000 for the electric cars. Looking at the charging stations , the charging stations required for them will run about another $200,000 give or take. Looking at the walkability study that's still in its study form, we have over $130,000 spent. So right now we have $630,000 spent but we can't afford a pool. We can afford cars for employees . We can afford studies that have not moved forward and multiple bills on it but we can't afford a swimming pool. It's a shame that money can be found for everything else except for the residents . As of this DPW emergency , is DPW incapable of handling snow removal in the city? We've looked at it right now we have emergency orders to multiple people. Yet we have a DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Department which is suppose d to respond to these actions in the city. It's an emergency put out for all hands. And I understand there should be a procedure before it needs to be an emergency to address snow removal if it happens to be larger. But I don't see a snow event which really did not happen becoming a snow emergency to the point that DPW is not competent enough to do their job. They're paid to do that and I know DPW is competent in trash and a lot of other issues. I'm just confused why at this particular issue DPW is unable to handle snow in the City of Scranton . Looking at Geisinger , the losses in the paper, well, I take that with a grain of sand because often times losses are done from profits from the other year. And if you made $500,000 last year and you made $300,000 this year it's a loss of $200,000. It's not a loss. It's just a reduction in revenue . And obviously from Covid there was a gigantic boost in revenue so there should an expected compensation in the other direction . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Lack of staff is an issue on moving people through the hospital . Hospitals do not provide services . Hospitals are paid for services . They are not a charity handing it away for free. Every person in there does not get provided services . They pay for it whether it's insurance , out of pocket. It's a business . Zoning at this point, we are now looking at an inevitable side to approve the zoning as it is and ignore public input. The writing is already on the wall for this. The positions have already been taken. All that I could suggest at this point is the people who oppose this get together and start a referendum . I believe it's 45 days that there's a period where input has to be done. Then after signing , another 30 days. It's all the referendum number they need 1,954 registered voters. With 75 days, they need to only capture 27 voters a day to stop this bill no matter what happens and push it off to November for negotiations . Now is the time to stop City Hall 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 and this organization from moving forward by putting it to the voters and striking the power out and putting in the possibility of future negotiations because I think we're going nowhere here. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton , taxpayer . Is that speaker a permanent fixture here? I hope so. It's a lot easier to hear back there. MR. KING: Is it helping back there? MR. DOBRZYN : It's permanent . Good. MR. KING: I'm asking is it helping ? MR. DOBRZYN : Oh, yeah, greatly. Now, last week I -- well, I really shouldn 't have but I stopped by -- a little passing comment to somebody . And then next thing I know I'm getting poked and yelled at and hit with a paper. And, you know, it's over with. And I don't want to go any further , but please don't do that to me again because I will nip it in the bud at the magistrate 's office, not that I was injured but if I had done that to a female in the thoracic cavity, it could be construed as something entirely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 different , you know, so that's all I'm going to say on that. Now, the subject of veterans getting some trash removed , I think they did enough for the country . And in a case of veteran organizations , we can afford them a few amenities . I was -- I heard of Vietnam in third grade. And after I graduated high school I'm worried about the draft. You know, and I did get drafted. And I'm no big hero. And at that point you really weren't doing yourself a favor by volunteering . So, you know, the point being that we could extend a small amenity there. Now, while the subject of Geisinger is up, the pilots, oh, pilots on average if people are willing to pay them are about 8 percent of the property tax that would be paid in Pennsylvania . And that's just grand, but that doesn't pay the bills, not with 40 percent tax exempt. And I have contended for years that the State of Pennsylvania should take up for their constitution and replace a good amount of that tax money that's missing from our budgets . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 And that's all there is to it. The same people can't keep paying more and more with more and more property going up. And by the way, with the 40 foot limit, I think -- I hope I'm not making anybody mad but it's going to make hospitals -- this hospital all the more hungry for all the more sprawl, to sprawl out further in the Hill Section . So that's just -- we got a triple bladed sword there. Nobody's happy. Walkability , I think at this point you should use a super majority to shut it down. I could only imagine tearing stop lights out of the intersections and everything else. I was almost run down right out here. A guy came from the west lane of Washington and turned up Mulberry Street and the light turned out of the sports car and he was happy as all and cruised. And I had to run out of the way. And I'm not too good with running now a days if you haven't noticed . But as far as that walkability business , that guy is nothing but a snake oil salesman. And it's a real estate agent's pipe dream. That's all it is.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I don't want to see one more coin going into that. And this is also -- I don't get to say what tax money or how it's spent, you know, my tax money is probably only pittance but it's on average , but it's being handed to this guy with an illogical idea. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : So, please just shut it -- shut it down. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. KING: You too. MR. DOBRZYN : I'm not picking on anybody up there. You guys got here later. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, Mr. King. Everyone knows for the past three weeks we have not been collecting recyclable s from business es and non-profits . But I still see recyclable cans and stuff lined up in the streets in front of businesses .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 And I don't know, Mr. Voldenberg , does Council do an advertisement or is it to the City of Scranton to advertise that we are no longer doing business ? Since we have been picking them up for years, I think everybody has been accustom to them. And maybe we could do something just to advise the citizens we're not doing it anymore. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into that, sir. MR. SMURL: That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I have a few comment s. Some of the things I think I've been talking about for the last couple of weeks. I mentioned in caucus tonight about the ARP plan. I do believe , you know, with some of the recent information coming out about how to use the ARPA money, there is a possibility to take a look at the plan as it is and, you know, update it, see what's not relevant anymore. And I think we should reach out to Answer and possibly Miss Cipriani to come in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 and review the plan and see what we can -- if there's anything that needs to be updated or changed in the plan as we see it right now. I brought up the pool at McDade and the county using some of this money. And I think it's something that we definitely need to look at to revisit this plan. So if we can reach out to Miss Cipriani and possibly Answer to see if they could come in to give us an update on where it's going and if it could be revised. I brought it up in public comment tonight and I asked about Rubicon . I asked several questions about have we had any updated routes, have we saved any money with Rubicon . Can we reach out to DPW possibly Chris Smith or Scott Pietreface and see if we can get an update on Rubicon if we have any -- if we've done any routing with this system and if we've saved any money with this system specifical ly? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did get an answer today, Mr. Schuster , but I do have to follow up on some points. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. I'll take a look. So the answer came in today? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. VOLDENBERG : We did. This morning . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. I'll take a look at that and maybe I'll respond to that e-mail and see if we need to go from there then. So maybe we'll reach out to see if they can come in to give us an update. I did see an article about the EV cars that we got. I did ask questions last week or the week prior if we could ask those questions again, where are these cars being stored, where are these cars being charged , which employee s are assigned to these cars. MR. KING: I think we got a response to that as well. MR. SCHUSTER : They've said where they're being stored? MR. KING: Yeah, at the Serrenti Center, I believe . MR. SCHUSTER : The issue that's up at the Serrenti Center is though there's no charging stations for them to be charged so they have to be charged somewhere . MR. MCANDREW : They're going to be stored at a garage.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, so if we revisit those questions where are the cars going to be stored, which employee s are going to be assigned those vehicles . And then to add onto that, are we paying for the charging and storing of any of these vehicle , how long is the lease and does the administration realize that this brand and make and model of car has been discontinue d as of this November . And then just to follow up, we have a new engineering coordinator . I did ask about taking a look at the resume and if that was going to be sent down to Council . I think there was a slight answer in the newspaper about if we can just revisit that question if we're going to get a look at the resume and if it's going to be sent in front of Council for approval . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. First, I want to bring up something that I mention ed a few weeks ago somebody had contact ed me about a missing permit parking sign across from 1202 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 Vine Street. And I don't believe it's been replaced yet. So if we could please check in with DPW about replacing that sign, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a timeframe on that, Doctor. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And on the subject of permit parking signs, we also received communication from a resident who had parked over on Quincy Avenue nearby Moses Taylor to go visit someone there at the hospital . And they said that they did not see any visible permit parking signs and then they receive d a ticket -- parking ticket. And then when they took a look to see where the parking sign was, there was one down at the end of the block but there was only one on the block. So I'm not sure if there were permit parking signs there originally . And I know this was sent to the whole of Council . So I'm not sure if this has already been forward ed, but I wanted to make sure to bring that to your attention as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I referred that to the police department .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, perfect . And there was a question from someone that was spoken about whether or not Geisinger would pull out of their plans and move elsewhere . I really can't speak to what their contingency plans are. I do know that those empty lots across from Temple Israel which I mentioned last week too -- and so people do buy up a lot of property and then plans change and they might not actually build on it. And I would hate to see that happen and just see vacant lots which was a point that I did bring up last week too. And, you know, I think that it is a possibility that they could take the loss and decide to move elsewhere , like, somewhere where they have a bigger lot. They could make a larger hospital . I know they have more space up at Geisinger Wyoming Valley. And they've, you know, added onto that hospital there and added services . But they had the space. And I don't think that they would -- I don't know if they would find that in the City of Scranton or not. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 So I don't know that I'm willing to take that risk because I do think that it's important to have those services within the city. So that's all that I know in terms of that. That's I think all speculation at this point. So I don't have a concrete answer on what they would do in the event that this is not passed as it's propose d. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so also referring to caucus, I agree with Mr. Schuster that we need to know if there is any -- if there has been any change in criteria with regards to utilizing the ARPA funds that we're not aware of or maybe should be aware of. A bunch of people are hired using those funds, coordinator s. We also have a private contractor that is suppose d to help us manage that money and disperse that money. So I have an issue if some of the criteria changed based on what was discussed in caucus and we're not aware of it. So I don't think we should ask them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 to come in. We should really say please come in and -- or not even please, just come in, bring us up to date. If the county knows something that we don't, then shame on them and all the people who are paying to handle this money. And then secondly , so the ladies at Weston Field pool, they're still reaching out to me. And they're still having issues. And I give them credit for being diligent in fighting the fight over there. But their concern now is and, you know, they're very patient . So they are still having trouble s with lifeguard s and that's fine. We all understand it. The kids are in school, whatever . So all they want is when a lifeguard calls off, maybe set up a one call or a robocall for them because they come to the pool and it's closed or they find out at that moment. So could you please ask Mr. West if, you know -- and this was an idea from one of the swimmers . And they have great ideas. So maybe they could take their name and information . They're there or try to get there weekly and generate a list and then do a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 one call to these ladies so they don't have to drive and then find out that the pool is closed. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And that is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have some followup from last week. We mention ed about the audit. And I did talk to the Business Administrator , Larry West on the way in here. And I got a call from the Mayor pretty much at the same time indicating that they expect to have a draft of the audit by tomorrow , hopefully be able to get it to Council on Tuesday -- by Tuesday , March 21st. It's been a long time coming. So we'll look forward to finally having the 2021 audit here. Matt Domines advised that his office is in regular contact with CliftonLarsonAllen , the new audit firm for the city. They would start the 2022 audit midApril. They'll send quarterly reports to the city. The new auditor would conclude the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 FYE 2022 audit by August 31st, 2023 in advance of the September 30 deadline . Foster and Foster, actuary for the GASB-75 audit has agreed to report regular updated information to the new audit firm in 2023. Joan had -- there was a request made to both City Treasurer and the STL to place delinquent city real estate taxes on the city website . So we're -- that request has been submitted . So we'll stay on top of that until we get all of that updated . Fay Franus, a request was submitted to both DPW and the Business Administrator 's office related to DPW supervisor overtime for 2022 and 2023. We will probably reach out to them again and just see where we are with that if we could, Mr. Voldenberg , or perhaps we'll make a phone call ourselves. Al Young, followup for him, the LIPS and Zoning Department is following up on his pending building permit. A permit will be issued. Mr. Young was given the update via phone by zoning and City Council office. There was some earlier -- also, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Doris, right now the schedule is to vote on Sixth Order on the zoning ordinance tonight and then it's expected to be tabled. Next week at the caucus we're suppose d to have Don King, the City Planner come in and give an overview of the new zoning ordinance . Presently , we have a City Council public hearing on the zoning scheduled for April 11th. I will reach out to both the City Solicitor and discuss this with our Solicitor for City Council and see if that's still an appropriate date since this City Council meeting was moved by two days. I just want to make sure that we're following the proper timelines . Under the existing timeline we were schedule d to -- for a final vote on the zoning ordinance on April 18th. So if there are changes to that that need to be made I will announce them next week on March 21st. Earlier speaker indicated -- let's see, I wrote it down exactly what was said that all five Council members up here are involved in pay to play. I take great exception to that. I'm appalled at an accusation like that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 because I could guarantee you there is nobody sitting up here that's involve d with pay to play. So that was a blatant -- blatant lie. So I take great exception to that accusation . Furthermore , he indicated that all five of us sitting up here should never be reelected and don't deserve to serve on this Council . I could tell you at least from my perspective I never ran for Council to try to get reelected. There will not be a single vote I take in these chambers that's based on me getting reelected . That I could guarantee you. I guarantee you I will not take a vote at least on, oh, this -- I better vote this way because they might not re-elect me. I will never do that. I don't care if I get re-elected . I care about trying to do what I believe is in the best interest of the City of Scranton , period. It might not be what -- I mean, there's times we have three-two votes up here, sometimes a four-one vote. So that's what Council is all about. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 We should disagree on things. I believe though that this Council is interested in doing the best we can to improve the City of Scranton . Sometimes we disagree on how to get there, but I could guarantee you that every one of my colleagues up here on this Council care about the city. We want to do what's in the best interest of this city. And, you know, we're doing the very best that we can as a part-time job. And I know for a fact that each one of these individuals spend time away from these chambers on the phone, answering e-mails, making phone calls, stopping out meeting with the residents . So there is a lot of time and effort that goes into this. And I will tell you this, this is my first time sitting in an elected office. I respect anybody -- after sitting here now, I respect anyone that's willing to put their name on a ballot to get out and serve the public here because it can at times be a thankless job. But to me, listen, I could take criticism all day long. That's fine. But at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 the end of the day I'm interested and willing to put myself on the line to try to do what I can at least in four years to try to improve the City of Scranton . And that's all I have to say about that one. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 54, 2023 – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR THE LOCATION AND USE OF LOTS, LAND, BUILDINGS , AND OTHER STRUCTURES ; THE HEIGHT, NUMBER OF STORIES , AND SIZE AND BULK OF BUILDINGS AND 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 STRUCTURES ; THE DENSITY OF POPULATION ; OFF-STREET PARKING ; AND SIMILAR ACCESSORY REGULATIONS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , LACKAWANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA , AND FOR SAID PURPOSES DIVIDING THE CITY OF SCRANTON INTO DISTRICTS AND ESTABLISHING THE BOUNDARIES THEREOF , PRESCRIBING CERTAIN UNIFORM REGULATIONS FOR EACH SUCH DISTRICT , AND PROVIDING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND AMENDMENT OF ITS PROVISIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA MUNICIPALITIES PLANNING CODE (MPC), 53 P.S. § 10101 ET SEQ., AS AMENDED . MR. KING: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. SMURL: I second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , just to keep my vote uniform , I'll be voting no tonight on this. I do want to thank the other Council members beforehand for taking a look at some of the amendments I made for solar ordinance s. I think I would like to see that added here as well as the amendment s for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 height restriction s on Colfax Avenue. I do think the -- again, I don't want to see the hospital expansion stop. I don't want to see this project stop. And I do want to see the zoning pass for the whole city. But I do believe the expansion will occur whether the height restriction is in place or not. And, I mean, it still gives the hospital the opportunity to go in front of the zoning board for a variance . With that being said, Frank, I got one more request for you. We've spoken about the HUP test. There was an article in the Times over the last couple of days about a hospital losing its tax exempt status. Can we check in with the administration to see what the timeline is for the HUP test? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , this is going off of some things that I mention ed last week. And I've continue d to ask questions to find out more about the expansion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 and their plans. And it seems to come with the parking if they'll have enough spots if they don't have the height on the 200 of Colfax. Now, I don't think even though they would have had like a 100 feet maximum to put a building , I don't think they ever planned on putting two 100 foot parking garages . That would be much more than they ever needed. But I think because of the change from civic to institutional zone on the 400 block of Colfax, the lower height of that would have pushed the other height higher on that garage. Otherwise , they could have had, you know, maybe two 60 foot garages . I don't know. So I think this is in their mind the compromise for them but also with the goal of getting parking out of Nay Aug Park where, you know, they don't feel like there is enough safety for their employees walking to the hospital from that parking lot and the convenience factor too, especially for the other lot that they lease in Dunmore . And I think it also needs to be a consideration about safety for pedestrians . So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 a lot of people who visit Nay Aug throughout the week, through the weekends . I know in my experience too walking across from the one section of the park and walking across the street near the Everhart that there's not really an obvious place for the pedestrians to walk or a sidewalk you're walking on where the vehicles are travelling . So it would be less traffic going in and out of Nay Aug. I think if they are not able to get that building height on the second garage and to have that remain in the civic zone, then parking would to remain in Nay Aug and then potentially elsewhere as well. So I think that's where a large part of the issue lies. So I just wanted to point that out on the question . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so on the question my position , I remain a no. And like I said last week, I'm not against progress . I'm not against advanced healthcare . But a compromise of 55 feet, take it from 100 down to 45, it's the difference between me and the back wall. It's the difference between maybe me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 and the ceiling . I think that is a -- that compromise is minimal . And I don't think it affects the 200 -- 80 billion dollar expansion . I don't think it halts the expansion at all, the distance between me and the ceiling or me and the wall. MR. KING: All those in favor signify by saying. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. KING: The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : I make a motion to table Item 6-A. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. KING: There's a motion on the floor and a second to table Item 6-A. This ordinance is being tabled until a public hearing can be held -- a public hearing will be held on April 11, which follows the County Planning Commission 's requirement that City Council wait 45 days before holding a public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 hearing . That date is 45 days from when the propose d ordinance was sent to the County Planning Commission in February . On the question ? On the question , I will say that since the timeframe , the 45 days began right after planning had passed it that I believe that would allow us to continue with the date of April 11th for the public hearing . All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.
