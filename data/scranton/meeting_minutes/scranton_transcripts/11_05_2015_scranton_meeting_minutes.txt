Therehasn'tbeenareassessment in 45years.Generally thepeople thatweare speaking aboutarethepeople thatnever fileforanappeal.Theyaregoodcitizens thatpaytheirtaxeseveryyearandthink thatthat'stheirresponsibility andthat's theirroleandthat'swhattheydo.Sothey1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 areprobably paying thetaxbasedon assessment andneveraskedforareduction . Butwhatareassessment does,asI mentioned before,onethirdgoesup,one thirdstaysthesame,andonethirdgoes down.It'sneutral .It'staxrevenue neutral whichmeansinthefirstyeartaxes can'tgoup.It'sbasedonthatpremise so whatwillhappen ispeople thataren't paying theirfairsharewillpaytheirfair shareandthepeople thatarebeing overcharged withthehighassessment willgo down,andthat'swhatwearetrying todo. Wearetrying tocreate equality forallof ourcitizens ,plusthefactthatwewill create opportunities ontheeconomic sideof thestratosphere because wearenotseeing anynewconstruction incityandalotof thathastodowiththefactthatwehaven't hadareassessment insolongbecause ifyou buildanewhouseinthecityyourtaxesare through theroof.Ifyoubuildnew construction ,acommercial building ,your taxeswillgothrough theroofbecause the assessment willbebasedon1970valuations .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 SoIamaproponent for reassessment ,Iwillalways beaproponent forreassessment ,I'llbegladtotalkabout thisissues withanybody atanytime,I'm sureIcan'tconvince everybody ,butIam positive inmymindthatthisissomething thatthecityhastodoandhastoforcethe county todo.

Itwouldbemyrecommendation that theadministration consider atsomepointan assembling apanelofexperts toevaluate thefeasibility ofpursuing payasyouthrow options fortheCityofScranton .Weneed tofindwaste,protect ourenvironment and alsoourtaxpayers fromtheveryhigh garbage feethattheycurrently pay. Wealsoreceived anassessment that Ifoundveryinteresting complete dbyHarris Engineering ofourdowntown areastreet lighting system.Theconcerns Ihaveheard1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 alongI'msurerwithmycolleagues overand overandagainfrombusiness owners, developers andresidents isthatthe lighting downtown andreally throughout the wholecityisnotadequate andmakespeople feelunsafe atnight.Harris Engineering identified threemajorareasofconcern with respect totaking corrective action to better enhance lighting downtown .Thethree areaswere: Number one,aesthetics , deteriorating polls,inconsistent illumination levels,inconsistent styles of lighting fixtures andinconsistent lighting technology . Thesecond areawassafety.Low lighted areas,inconsistent spacing of lighting fixtures ,burntoutlamps,and deteriorating polls. Andthethird,andoneofthemost important iscost.Thereisinconsistent document ofpoleownership ,inconsistent documentation oflandlottage,andno long-termplanforthereduction ofsystem lighting costs.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Theengineering company recommended installing effective ,energy efficient streetlight .Someofthebenefits ofenergy efficient lighting suchasLEDarereduced coststothecity,increased safety, improved appearance andreducedlight pollution andlighttrespass . Andonthepointofincreased safety,thereports saidthatthe effective nessofimproved lighting and reducing crimeissecond onlytoincreased police presence soIthough thatwasvery important . Following theserecommendations will provide anincrease inlighting levels on citystreets thatwillimprove visibility fordrivers andpedestrians andprovide a clean,saferandmoreinviting landscape for Scranton 'sresidents andvisitors ,andI'm hopeful thatthisadministration willmake aneffort tofollow through withthese recommendations .AndthatisallIhaveto thisweek.Thankyou.
