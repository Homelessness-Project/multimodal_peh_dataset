The event will feature 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 approximately 75 vendors including some of the areas finest local businesses , artisans and wineries and span four floors of the Scranton Cultural Center.

Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on agenda items and city business . Nadine Simms spoke on city business . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. Motions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Just a few brief comments , I'm sure this is going to be included in our insurance policy, Mrs. Reed, if we could just find out for sure if the contents of the Serrenti building is covered under city insurance , you know. I can't remember seeing that report, it was so long ago just since it was brought up it would give us all peace of mind just to make sure our ducks are in a row when it comes to that. The only other thing I have today is on our agenda 5-C and 5-D there is going to be a motion, I'll be for it, it's going to be to table some legislation for traffic patterns for the new Sheetz building that's going to be potentially by Linden and Seventh . We had some talk about it in caucus, I'm sure some of my other councilmen will bring it up. It's the only legislation we are going to get for this project is going to be for the traffic signals and it's an immense project that has a lot of minutia 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 to it and we are just going to -- well, I'm going to be for tabling this legislation just to give us time to hear from PennDOT city planner , city engineer and Sheetz if they would like to input as well. Once we get our full in-depth coverage on that we can put that back on the table and go ahead with that in full force with having the knowledge of what the actual project entails . With that, I'll save all my other comments for agenda items. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , do you have any motions or comment ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments . MR. EVANS: Just a few. I was going to talk about reassessment , but Mr. Ellman was so nice to me tonight I'll pass on that and I'll pick it up next time. Mrs. Schumacher has been requesting for awhile to know what the bond rating is. It's BB plus, which is on grade below best grade, so if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 you see her and want to pass that onto her I'd appreciate it. Also, I'd like to talk briefly about an update on the idea sessions we had held at city council chambers . Work is in progress on several of the ideas and comments that were shared that evening . For example , the idea of bringing back a guide to do business in Scranton . We received a commitment from the Small Business Development Center to work with us on this project and pursuing that. We also identified a potential funding source if required for printing of a new guide. The committee also suggested that signs be erected with a large "P" indicating the location of the parking garages in the city on streets leading up to the garages . This is something that is done in many other cities, so I had a conversation with NDC and ABM and they are looking into it. I let them know that council would support any legislation that was necessary to make that happen. Also, a simplified approach to permits for some of our large events like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the holiday markets and holiday square. This is, again, a process with discussion with the city solicitor that is in process and we hope to have something relative to that hopefully soon. There was also a common theme during this idea session and other conversations with small business owners and property owners and taxpayers that how do we make reporting issues in the City of Scranton an easier and more friendly and responsive process , so to address that city council will be engaging in having a Power Point presentation over the next month or two with a company called See, Click, Fix. Essentially it works like this, the consumer , who is the citizen or the taxpayer or the business owner, has an app on their phone. They see an issue like a pothole or graffiti or even a couch on someone 's front porch, they can snap a picture , send it via the app to a city employee who is then becomes a point person who routes the request to the appropriate department or employee . The citizen is now told his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 report is received and is kept via text or e-mail as the request works its way into its proper conclusion . And the links are also maintained on each and every report so the administration and city council can see that the reports are being acknowledged and when they are being resolved and how long it has taken to close out that particular issue. So this is something I view as not only transparent , but engaged and efficient government . As an idea, I think that's a concept that we should all embrace for our city. The presentation will be expected to happen in a public caucus, and mostly likely in the Governor 's Room because it's easier to set up a large scene that we can see the full presentation and more people have the opportunity to view it as well, so when that happens we'll update and I'll let everybody know through an announcement at one our future council meetings . And that's all I have for tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I do. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 We received a complaint -- or I received a complaint a few weeks ago about truck traffic on North Main Avenue turning onto Oram Street and then there is all sorts of issues going on so I'm going to ask that we did get a memo from the city engineer , but I'm going to ask that we refer this matter to PennDOT and ask them to increase the signage along Main Avenue because trucks are making the wrong turn and they are damaging people's yards. City engineer John Pocius will be in our caucus next week, April 9, to give you an update on several project s that will be occurring throughout the city. I received a letter from a gentlemen in 300 block of Ferdinand Street about a property that is in disrepair so we are going to forward to the Licensing and Inspections Department . I brought this up in caucus, our office has sent several letters now to the Civil Service Commission , the chairmen , Mr. Jeff Mackey, and we sent one to their solicitor asking for an update on the rules 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 and regulations of the Civil Service Commission , the last copy that our office had received was May 25, 1999, and we have not received any response yet and I had some other questions for the Civil Service Commission , so if we can send another letter out to this commission and I am going to put -- I guess I have to put in a Right-to-Know request because it's very difficult to get information . Secondly , the Scranton Sewer Authority I asked back in February and January if the Scranton Sewer Authority had performed their audit yet back in June of 2017. The accounting firm Rainey & Rainey was hired for audit prep services so I wanted to know if the audit had been completed yet and if so I requested a copy again, no surprise there no response , so I'll be doing a Right-to-Know and send another correspondence on that. Also, I mentioned this I think the last four years and I don't know if anybody is listening , but the street sweeper that goes through out the city, I would like again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 to request the administration to take into account a better way of communicating with the residents that the street sweeper is coming to their neighborhood . The problem is that the street sweeper does a great job, but the people do not know to move their cars off the street so, therefore , the street is not properly cleaned . So, again, I will ask that we send correspondence to the mayor and to the DPW director asking them to come up with a way. I've given them several recommendations of my own to let people know when the street sweeper is coming through their neighborhood . I have also received a few complaints about the deterioration of East Mountain Road, so we'll send correspondence to the DPW on that, and then there are also several catch basins, particularly in the area of Yesu Lane as it meets East Mountain Road that are totally covered and residents are concerned about that. And that's all I have for this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 couple of items following up on some citizens questions . Regarding reassessment , it was brought up again and think I addressed it two weeks ago, but city council is committed to seeing this through . I can't speak for the mayor, you would have to ask him as far as what the administration thinks on the issue, but this is not going on the back burner. One way or the other, you know, we are going to have some resolution to this within this year. Secondly , a resident brought up non-lethal weapons in school, something I would completely support . I think it would make sense to present that to the school board where they may a little more, you know, a little more say in those type of issues than we would, but my wife is a teacher and, you know, that is something that I think would make sense making sure our teachers and children are safe. Next, DPW, I want to thank Larry Wynn and Tim Gilroy, who is on dispatch , for helping with a couple of issues with the DPW over the week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 And, finally , I know Councilman Perry mentioned it, you know, last week what it was announced that Sheetz was coming to the area I think a lot of people were -- myself included , were initially pretty happy, then when I found out the location and started hearing from residents , particularly in West Side and those who have children at Scranton High, the location I have some concerns . Anyone that lives in West Scranton or travels from West Scranton knows how backed up that intersection gets currently . Adding a gas station there with a drivethrough and adding some signalization , my fear is that it's not only going to effect that intersection , but it's going to push it back to the U-Haul down to the car wash and other way towards the Glider Diner as well. So as was mentioned , city council will introduce the legislation and table it. We hope to have a representative from PennDOT come in. I know a study was already conducted regarding this intersection , so we would like to hear more plain language what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 their study produced . I know it was very lengthy so we would like to talk to them about how they achieve the results of their study, and also I'd like to hear from a representative from Sheetz. It's their project , I would like to hear how they would, you know, deal with different issues as they arise. Like I said, I don't have a problem , I'm for them coming to Scranton , I'm just a little bit concerned about that location because it is an already very busy location right by the school and adding, you know -- multiply the traffic by however many times with it being a gas station I think is going to make the traffic situation for those going into West Side or going to Scranton High School even worse, so more to come on that in the coming weeks. That is all. MS. REED: 5-B.

EVANS: I would like to make a motion to table Items 5-C and 5-D. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: There's a motion on the floor and a second to table Items 5-C and 5-D, on the question ? MR. EVANS: On the question , my major concern with this and, again, we'll have some time to talk with PennDOT about it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 and anybody else that wants to come in and talk about it, is did they give the upmost consideration to pedestrian safety. Traffic studies generally put the heaviest emphasis on moving cars safely, but they rarely look at house safe is it for the pedestrians to cross that intersection , so that's my biggest concern and they are the type of questions I will be asking when we get a chance to talk some officials . MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , I agree with everything that's been said, and just from my own experience trying to get near that area when school is in is an absolute nightmare , and I'm assuming that this project will make that even worse than it already is so, again, I share the safety concerns of my colleagues . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Any else? All those in favor of tabling this signify by saying aye? MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH PETERS DESIGN GROUP, INC. FOR PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE SERRENTI MEMORIAL ARMY RESERVE CENTER RENOVATION PROJECT . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , we discussed this in caucus, this project in it's entirety , I've thought this from the very beginning , I don't believe that we should -- I didn't believe that she have moved forward with this project . I don't believe that we should add maintenance costs to our budget, which is what is going to happen in my opinion , especially a community that is in Act 47 and that may very well be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 leaving Act 47. We may have problems just sustaining on our own, never mind adding additional stress and lighting costs and heating and cooling and maintaining that building so there are concerns there. My other concern after looking at the contract with Peters design group is it seems to me that it is very vague and open ended. The fee schedule that was included in the backup says that it's going to be negotiable based upon ECC of the project and they will negotiate this fee based on extent of services required and then they give different percentages for some of the work that they plan on doing. I pulled the other bids that came in and some of them have lump sums, some of them have percentages , but we need more -- or I need more clarification on this I think before we can move forward , so I did ask that the city solicitor and the business administrator , whoever comes in and explains this. The other concern that I have is that in the backup there was several 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 questions that were posed by the bidders to the city, one of them was that they wanted to see the overall -- what the city's budget was for the project and the city said that no budget will be disclosed at this time and then there were other additional questions there. So, again, I think what I wouldn't want to see this firm get a contract and then something happen and we end up paying much more than we should have. I would rather see a flat fee and not leave this so open-ended and so vague so I'll vote for this tonight . I'm not going to vote for this because I don't agree with the project on it's face, but I do think we need answers to these questions that I posed tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . Councilman Gaughan and I, you know, we fall on different sides of the issue when it comes to the Serrenti building . I was always for this acquisition , but as far as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the questions being raised about 5-E, you know, I agree with most of those. I think it would be a good idea to get an explanation on some of the questions that you brought up. You know, this was brought up in caucus and I think this would just help going forward to make sure that we were told that monies spent on Serrenti building would come straight from grants and there have been -- I know the Department , the Police Department has been working hard to allocate these grants, I just want to make sure that it doesn't really state the language on 5-E that we are holding to that, so, you know, I agree that this could use some more explanation . MR. ROGAN: Just to reiterate , this was discussed in caucus and we are going to have the -- invite the city solicitor to our caucus next week to discuss this legislation , and I know we have discuss ed this at length, but this building is going to help increase public safety in the City of Scranton and especially the Hill section , so it's definitely something that -- it's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 very deserving project but the questions regarding the specific legislation we will have answered prior to the final vote. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.
