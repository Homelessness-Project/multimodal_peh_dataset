MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou.Mr.Evans. MR.EVANS:Reassessment isgoingto beahottopicofdiscussion thisweek. County Commissioner candidates weighed in thesubject ,theircommon themes seemtobe "Wewanttodoreassessment ,butitwill costtoomuch." Saying theywouldliketodoa reassessment butthereisnomoneyisnota solution orananswer it'sanexcuse.While Iwasthedirector oftheAssessment Office during theactual phaseofreassessment ,90 percent oftheinventories properties was completed by21stCentury Appraisals ,a company hiredbythecounty todothe reassessment ,andmuchofthenecessary mapping wascompleted bythecounty through theAssessor 'sOffice. Nearly $3million wasspentatthat pointtocomplete thereassessment and another estimated 2to$3million wouldbe necessary tototally complete it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 Because thecounty commissioners in 2009pulled theplugonreassessment that figure hasgrownto$8million ormore.It wasabaddecision then,anditremains a baddecision today. Recentlythecurrent commissioners eagerly pointed outthatthereisnow$8 million budget surplus asoneoftheir crowning achievements .Itisironic that$8 million isalsotheproposed costofthe countywidereassessment .Thereisnothing moreimportant totheeconomic vitality of ourcityandcounty thantaxfairness through areassessment ,soismoneythereal issueoristheperceived political cost simply toohigh? Andhereweare45yearsremoved fromthelastreassessment andtheCityof Scranton andit'spropertyowners continue tostruggle withassessments thataresimply unfair.Letmegaveyouanexample ofoneI ranacross recentlywhichissymbolic ofthe skewed assessed values ofproperties inour county.HouseA,therewasaproperty in Scranton ,aniceoldhouse,butitneedsa1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 lotofTLC.Itis3,100square feetona40 footby90footlotwithashared driveway . Thevalueofthehouseisestimated atless than$100,000.HouseBishouseinClarks Summit,isinimmaculate condition .Itis 4,300square feeton1.75acreswithalarge driveway ,andthreecargarage.Thevalue ofthishomewouldbeover$500,000.House A,theScranton house,HouseA,pays$6,631 inproperty taxes.HouseB,theClarks Summit house,pays$6,229inproperty tax. Buthere'swhereitgetsmoreinteresting , looking further intothenumbers youwill seethattheassessed valueoftheland, HouseAinScranton ,again,a40by90foot lotwithashared driveway is$7,750.The assessed valueofthelandofHouseBin Clarks Summit withthe1.75acresanda largedriveway is$1,500. Evenin1970itwouldhardto believe thatthoseassessments were accurate ,buttodayitanother example of theunfairness builtintothis45-yeargap without reassessment .Thisisascenario thatIwouldestimateplaysouthundreds ,if1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 notthousands oftimes,within thecounty. Theotherculprit inthismessis theStateofPennsylvania whoclaims they require reassessment butneverdoanything aboutit.Thestateneedstocomeupwitha formula shared costofthecounties to promote andmakereassessment moreviable. Theymustalsobeprogressive likeother states andallowforrolling reassessments thataretiedtoproperty valueincreases oncetheirreassessment isdone,thiswould keepvalues current anddoubling costsdown. Property taxfairness isn'tjusta county issueorastateissueoracity issue,itisafundamental rightofproperty owners andshould notbeignored likeithas beenforover45years.AsIhavestated before,ifthereiscontinued inaction by thecounty thenthereshould besomeaction bythecity.That'sallIhave.Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Goahead.

Idoknowthatithasbeenbroadcast inthepast,theproblem isthatasfaras ECTVisconcerned theycan'tdoalive broadcastfromthechamber building andso anything thattheywoulddowouldhavetobe onareplay.Idon'tknowifanyofthe localchannels ,broadcast channels woulddo itlive,Idon'tknowifthatisscheduled ornot.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Oneofthethings thatIhavealways thought aboutcouncil meetings isthatwe should tryandremove politics from government .Atelection timethatbecomes a verydifficult situation .Therehasbeen somecriticism thisevening andtosome extent Iwanttoapologize toMr.McAndrew . Hedidcontact mepriortolastweek's meeting andaskedmeaboutwhatIthought aboutreading aletter thathehadsentto Mrs.Novembrino .Icautioned himthatI'm notsurewhatthat--youknow,wherethat wouldgoandhowitwouldbeperceived,and Ithought thatashespokelastweekhemade anattempt toremovekindofthepolitics fromthequestions thathehad. Anyone canaskaquestion ,aswas said.Idon'tcare--people thatcometo thispodium forthenineyearsthatIhave beenhereandhaveaskedquestions ofpublic officials .Thesimple thingiseither answer themorsayno.Thisisnothing wrongwiththatandtoquestion somebody justforasking aquestion Ithinkis inappropriate .Sometimes thequestions can1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 beinappropriate andshould bemonitored fromhereifsomebody isspeakingatthe dies. Andthelastthing,mostofwhatwas contained intheletter thatMr.McAndrew senttoMrs.Novembrino wasmadepublicby others notbyhimandthentocriticize him forbeingpublic. So,again,I'mnot,again,I'mnot tyingtofavoranycandidate overanother . Myhopeisthatthatpodium,thisdais,does notbecome acenter forpolitical activity . Thisisforthegovernance oftheCityof Scranton andnotforthepolitics ofthe CityofScranton orLackawanna County. Onapositive note,Iguessthis pastweekIattended sixmeetings with bidders ontheparking monetization .These bidders camefromalloverthecountry as farawayasLosAngeles ,Puerto Rico,so thereisinterest .Ithought itwas interesting tojustsitandlisten tothese people andseethattherewasacompetition thattheywanted tobringabout,youknow, tohelpScranton solveaproblem andthat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 theywereinterested intheCityof Scranton ,andtheirperception oftheCity ofScranton ,unlike whatsomepeople saidat thepodium,theirperspective oftheCityof Scranton wasonethatwasverypositive . Theylooked atthearchitecture , theylookedattherestaurants ,thehotels, theactivity thatwastaking placeandall ofthisgaveaverypositive impression . Thesepeople werelooking atbidding fora leaseontheparking garages andthe off-street parking inScranton forupto50 years.Theyarenotbidding iftheydon't thinkthiscityhasafuture,andIthink thatthat--Icameawaywiththatideathat wehavepeople fromoutside ofCityof Scranton looking atitandsaying thiscity hasafuture andwewanttobeapartofit. Thereisatimelinefortheparking monetization thatissomewhatconstricted by theScranton --ortherevised recovery plan butmostofthesebidders feltthatthey couldabidebythattimeline.Whatweare looking atinthefuture isthattherewill beconcession agreements drawnup,theywill1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 begiventothebidders ,thebidders maybe askedforanindicative bid,whichiskind oflikeaballpark figure forwhattheyfeel thismonetization wouldbeworth,RFP's wouldthenbeprepared ,bidders would respond ,thecitywouldchoose oneofthe bid.Allofthishopefully donebytheend of2015. Thatisonestepintheplantoget thecitybacktofinancial credibility and allofthesepeople thought thattheycould helptheCityofScranton dothat.Theyhad trustintheCityofScranton thatwecould moveforward inapositive way.Andthat's all.
