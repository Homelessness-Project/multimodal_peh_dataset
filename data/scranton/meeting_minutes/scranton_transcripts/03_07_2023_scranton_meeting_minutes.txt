HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . So where's my audit? Hello? MR. KING: It's coming. MS. HODOWANITZ : Ah ha, well, I'll have you know that as of today, this audit is the latest audit for at least 20 years, okay? Kohanski 's been late for four years in a row. I still want to know whether the Mayor intends to enact that penalty clause; and if not, why not? MR. KING: I'm sorry, Joan, Friday, March 10th, that's this week that they'll have everything that they need. So I expect that will be done in short order from there. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I still want to know whether or not we're going to get that penalty clause of 10 percent . MR. KING: I asked the Mayor that question . I'm still waiting to -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, it looks like it's time to write a letter to the editor. Okay, also, when are we going to see the legislation for the next auditor CliftonLarsonAllen ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. KING: For the hiring of them? MS. HODOWANITZ : Yes. MR. KING: I would expect that would be coming up probably in the next week or two. MS. HODOWANITZ : Let's hope so. They're already behind the power curve. What's going on with the police and firefighter negotiations , their arbitration s? MR. KING: Same as reported last week. Hopefully have the fire resolved by the end of March and the police hoping that will begin the beginning of April. MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm wondering whether or not we're going to see some backdated pay raises. That could be a little bit expensive for the city. Also, I still don't see the DPW contract on the city website the one that was supposedly approved last September , so waiting on that. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , could you check with the administration , see where they are with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : I saw on the city's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 website , however , that we do have the February 28 data on delinquent trash fees, which is good. When are we going to start seeing the delinquent property taxes? MR. KING: If we can reach out to Cathy Wechsler and see if we can get a report on that as well. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, as of February 28th, that's looking like we're owed almost 11.3 million dollars which brings up the whole issue that Fay Franus has been addressing and that is picking up the trash and recyclables for the commercial businesses and non-profits . If we can't get that $11 million dollars from the people we're billing , we have no businesses giving a free ride to commercial business es and non-profits who are already getting a break on taxes. I say let them hire a private hauler. They're already getting a free ride on the tax side. Oh, I'm sure you all read your own agenda and backup and looked at the SRA minutes for February 1st, very interesting paragraph on the sale of the Ice Box to Geisinger . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 And I'll read a little bit of it. Geisinger has purchased from BRT Ice, the Ice Box for 23 million dollars . There has been ongoing litigation between the city, OECD, SRA and BRT Ice, that was the seller, regarding a loan in the amount of $600,000 and has not been paid back to the city. Solicitor Kelly of the SRA is eager to know, and so am I, whether or not SRA will move forward with litigation to petition to set aside the deed or to see if there will be some type of resolution for SRA to get its money back. And SRA is part of the city. I would like to know what's going on with that litigation and that $600,000. You know -- we've been giving a lot to Geisinger . And I'm wondering how this sale went through with this loan hanging in the balance . We need to know an answer to that. And this 5-C, the grant for 20 bare root trees to be planted on land owned by the city and nonprofit organization s. I know this pocket park in downtown Scranton that could use 20 trees. Why are we planting them for non-profits ? Let them buy their own trees. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Take a look at this. Take a close look at this. This is one of the bars in North Scranton that had their recyclable s out at the curb this morning . They put it out last night or early this morning . They did not put it out at the curb this morning for a private hauler to come because today is recycling day in North Scranton . They put it out to have the DPW pick it up. Now, Mr. Pietreface said that -- the Director said they're not going to be doing that anymore. Let's see what happens to these cans. If they're still there in a week that means he's telling the truth. If they're not, that means the DPW picked them up again. We've been paying for them for seven years. And the last two and a half years is when they started paying tonnage . So, Mr. Smurl, you started all this crap about giving them a $300 -- they have 672 cans a year, 432 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 cans a year. I have 24, maybe some people have 36 a year. These people should be paying $5,400 a year in garbage fees or 8,400, not 300. And the tonnage , 40 of these -- 40, this is 20 cans right here, twice a month that's 40. 40 cans is a ton. We pay as citizens have been paying for them for two and a half years. All the taxpayers have been paying for all of these special interest , special people that the DPW and the City of Scranton is taking care of. We've been paying that tonnage fee for them. Some of them are $480 a year or more. So they get a free ride. I understand you, Mr. Smurl, and maybe you, Mr. Schuster , want to make an exemption for the VFWs and the American legions . They're a nonprofit . They don't even pay property tax. You better not do that because you're going to be starting a war because why should they get a break and every nonprofit in the city doesn't? You can't do for one and not for all. It says a private hauler. Do you know a private hauler is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 lot less expensive than a garbage fee and tonnage ? We you get a private hauler, they charge the bar the price of the tonnage . And they create a hauler to take it away. They cannot keep doing this. So, Mr. Smurl and Mr. Schuster , and anybody else up there that wants to give these people, these special people, these chosen few, these bars, not few, many, many, many. Even people tonight told me how many times they've seen bars and restaurant s having the recycling truck come and pick them up, the DPW. Well, so, Mr. Smurl, my goal is going to be from now until November to make sure you do not get elected because you have two faces. When you were at the Recreation Authority you were completely against when the slide was torn down. I understand you were banging on table and you wanted to prosecute the Mayor because it was terrible that she did that. It was terrible . But now all of a sudden, you're the Mayor's favorite person. I wonder why you got appoint ed to do her bidding . This has -- this is going -- well, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 if I have to put signs up for everybody else I'm going to. And I'm going to spread the word. You are not for the people. You are for the business es and the special interest and the people that are being taken care by the DPW and the city. Why would you want to take care of business es instead of resident s and taxpayer s that pay your salary, by the way, Mr. Smurl? Another thing I want to get into -- and I'll be back next week to hear anything you say in motions . I'm going to be back to counter act anything you say tonight . You may have the last word tonight but I'll have one again next week. Another thing, the DPW, I did a right to know to get the overtime for the supervisors because they get paid overtime. I got the name of the supervisor , how many hours they worked and the amount of money they made. But now when I did it for February , they do not want to give me the reasons why they're working, no reasons at all. So what does that -- that's deception and fraud. They want to do this so there's no accountability at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 all for all the overtime . They just write down I worked so many hours. There's no proof. There's no record. When I did it for the whole year last year, the first half of the year there was no records. The last half there was records . But they're all made up, most of them. So now they don't want to do any. They said there's no records available . Why doesn't the city controller go after them? He said it's not his responsibility . It is his responsibility to see if there's so much overtime being spent and nobody is doing anything about it. Now the Director of DPW, Scott Pietreface , last year he made $47,000. Guess what he made in overtime, $29,000, plus a couple hundred more, 29,000 in overtime . But now that he got 47 last year, now he's getting 75,000. He can't work overtime now as the Director . But he doesn't need to because he's making all that money with the extra raise. But the supervisors are still getting overtime right and left and all the workers . For what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 reason? They won't give a reason. Now, don't you think we as taxpayers who are paying that money would have a right to know exactly what they're doing overtime ? And I expect this Council to make sure that they make a note of every day anybody works and the reason that they're working . The taxpayers have to -- they have to know how their money -- we're paying for that. We have a right to know how our money is being spent. So you, Council , that's your responsibility to make sure they get those records every month with a reason why there is overtime . MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Mr. Voldenberg , can you send a note down to Mr. Pietreface to see how they track overtime and how they identify exactly , you know, what work is being done during that overtime ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can you also add to that and get each of the supervisor s and what they totalled last year in overtime a piece? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. SCHUSTER : Thanks. MR. KING: David Rinaldi . MR. RINALDI : Good evening . I'm David Rinaldi . I'm a property owner of 212 Colfax. And I'm here to make some remarks on what is listed as motion B in your agenda tonight . And I just wanted to stick with the recent history because the negotiation s between the neighborhood and Geisinger have been going on and on and on for years and years. But we thought we had an agreement . And then all of a sudden on the anniversary of the insurrection in Washington , the map was changed . It was changed and we had a -- we were here at the Planning Commission meeting Attorney Scacchitti -- Ed Scacchitti lives on Arthur Avenue provided this February 21st letter to the Planning Commission . I don't know whether you've seen it or not. But anyway, we thought we had an agreement . The map changed . We could not find out why it changed . And at that PC meeting Attorney Scacchitti provided this rendering of exactly what it's going to look like -- this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 would be the odd side of Colfax (inaudible .) Now, what I want to say to Council is this. I don't know why they all of a sudden decided they needed a 100 foot garage. But I know they upset the entire neighborhood . Mostly my neighbors are concerned about myself and the people on Wheeler who are going to be most effected . In that letter, Attorney Scacchitti asked why there was a change in the map and we never got an answer. But I want to go onto say this. In 2021, Geisinger had 8.1 billion dollars in revenue . The numbers aren't out for '22, 8.1 billion . They spent 23 million on the Ice Box. Then they come back and they -- and they -- and somehow the map changes . And so what I'm suggesting to Council is Council has a couple of opportunities here, one of which is to either not move forward on the motion and hold it in abeyance and ask Geisinger -- I'm sure their representat ive is here tonight to sit down at this table with myself and the other three property owners on the 200 block of Colfax and the people who live on the 200 block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 of Wheeler behind there and negotiate for what is acceptable if they're going to put up 100 foot tall parking garages . They never said this. We have never been able -- even in the beginning they said they were going to give us the plan, give us the plan, give us the plan. They never did. So you have an opportunity to really to lobby on behalf of the people who have lived in this city, who have paid taxes for years. You have two competitors of Geisinger . You have UMPC and you have Lehigh Valley which just built a hospital . So you don't have to worry about them going somewhere else. They're not going to go anywhere else. They've spent millions of dollars already . So what I suggest is that we will sit down right here at this table in front of the cameras in front of the Times, Mr. Lesnefsky and we will try to in good faith negotiate a solution to that before you go forward and just approve what they're looking for which changed , of course, on January 6th. So I'd like you to think about that and think about the fact that you're talking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 about a billion dollar corporation here, a billion dollar corporation . All we are is property owners in the City of Scranton who lived here our whole lives. Me in particular , I've owned property in this city my entire life. I've had a business here for 40 plus years. I've support ed the city. I mean, at least -- I would never negotiate the way Geisinger did. But you have an opportunity to have them come back and negotiate in public in good faith and then make a decision on whether or not you want to change the zoning in that area. And I understand that it's the whole zoning map. It's all the different zones. And it's part of the SAPA. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Rinaldi . MR. RINALDI : Thank you very much. I appreciate your time. MR. KING: All right. Drew Simpson . MR. SIMPSON : President King, Vice President McAndrew , and Council members , good evening . My name is Drew Simpson . I am the regional manager for the Eastern Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 representing the hardworking men and women of Carpenters Local Union 445 in Scranton . I'm here tonight to speak on agenda Item 5-B and to speak in favor of the propose d zoning ordinance that is on the agenda for later this evening . When passed, this ordinance will allow Geisinger CMC Hospital to move forward with two parking garages that will be built by the best trained skilled carpenters in the industry . These carpenters will be earning family sustain ing wages and receiving health insurance and also earning a pension and annuity so that they could have dignified retirement when their career is over. When project s like this are built in the city, it allows us to offer high school graduate s from Scranton schools or anyone looking for a career the opportunity to join our tuition free apprentice ship program where they will earn while they learn. Geisinger CMC has continue d to grow and now growing have built millions of dollars into construction project s allowing our carpenters to work close to home. If these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 garages are not allowed to be built, what does that mean for the future construction projects of expansion of this facility . We can't afford the possibility that this first class medical facility may look elsewhere to continue to grow. I believe that these garages will help with parking at Nay Aug Park and on the streets surrounding the hospitals that may cause patient s and visitors to walk blocks to come visit. So in closing , I encourage Council to vote yes for the zoning ordinance so we can get our people working . Thank you for your consideration . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Simpson. I appreciate it. MR. SIMPSON : Thank you. MR. KING: Al Young. MR. YOUNG: Al Young, Scranton resident . Now you could turn the clock on. Good evening , Council members . As some of you -- some of you already know, I applied for a building permit five weeks ago. It's been held up by the Law Department for reasons that Mr. Jenkins thinks there may be a no build 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 clause on Meadow Brook. Well, if that were true, then why on earth did the city allow the garage next door to me to be placed back over the new culvert that they just spent over $150,000 to build? My question to you all and I hope the Law Department and the Mayor and anybody else listening in LIPS are listening. My car and a carport may weigh two ton. Now, I'm not planning to build this on the creek. I have not planned to build it over the creek. I plan on erecting it next to and behind my deck which gives me about 3 to 4 feet before the creek is available . Now, I measured the garage floor next door. There is 15 and 3 quarter yards of concrete which weighs 63,000 pounds as a base, plus the foundation , plus a two car garage on top of the whole unit. I'm assuming that this may weigh in the neighborhood of maybe 68,000 pounds. And there's a no build clause? Who are they trying to BS here? It's time that we get on with this -- the nonsense . This 34 ton is a far cry from my 2 ton -- 2 ton addition . I really think it's time for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 city to get past my litigation and think of what is going on and think of the proper thing to do. I sent Mr. King -- Don King an e-mail about this problem at the beginning . And he has yet to respond . And I think this is part of his duty. I think it's time that the city takes stock in who they appoint or who they hire and what the hell they know about what they're doing. Please, at least get this thing going. Five weeks it's about time. If I lose my down payment on this, you want another litigation ? I don't think. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Young. We'll look into that. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yeah, thank you. As you know, I'm not a happy camper. But believe it or not, I understand the need of a consultant to address the rising questions that were in the paper this morning about making it more liveable here investwise. You need consultant are a necessity when we have such a pathetic , incompetent lot of employees as the Licensing Bureau, the traffic office, the Mayor's office, the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 administration and the City Council . You people are -- you're pro city but you are not pro taxpayer . We're the ones that are paying all the bills. All we hear about is a bunch of deadbeat developers downtown that do everything humanly possible to avoid their tax obligations . You know how I've been complaining for six months, four months about my tickets I got from the city for rubbish . Next door didn't get any tickets and it was his rubbish . They cited me. They've been picking on me. It doesn't make sense to me or anybody that's been involved in it. My whole neighborhood has declined terrible . Nobody cares. I got a slumlord next door parking cars in the yard. They have destroyed my house values. You haven't lifted a finger about it, don't care about parking on the yard. Across the street's another guy is -- the house is in shambles . He lives in New York. He phoned me a couple years ago and wanted to see if I would buy the house. The house needs to be torn down. It's abandoned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Just the roof is caved in. Next door is the mom that parks on city property . They have destroyed the city property . They're from Virginia , parked cars there. They don't pay taxes. Have any of you ever thought about telling them to repair the property and park someplace -- they're the ones with seven cars. One house doesn't need seven cars and half of them don't run. They got one junk they put out in the street now for a couple weeks. All of this is -- I've had -- I don't know four or five people talk to me about the same problems in their neighborhood . All we hear about is praise for this part of the city and praise for that part. You people don't tell the truth. You know, maybe I ought to crank up my son's computer that's sitting on the floor and get out there and tell the facts and tell the truths so the whole city could see what Bidenville is really like. It's not the Utopia that you think it is downtown . And I got one other question that I've -- been brought to my attention three or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 four times. When the reassessment is over, who is going to make the final status of -- the tax status of our properties ? I know some people better than me tried to find out. There doesn't seem to be any answer. That seems like it's more important than some of the silly things that go on in this very room day after day. Anybody have an idea? Tell the public or is that going to be another secret around here? MR. KING: It's countywide tax reassessment . MR. ELLMAN: Yes. All right. You ought to just turn around make your -- turn around and start giving some attention to the city and the neighborhoods . I don't know if anybody ever of goes to Sheetz. But every time I pull in there, somebody cries about the teachers , the schools . Our schools are in the bottom of the barrel. And you have some no English speaking ingrates -- MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Have a good night. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. ELLMAN: Thank you for allowing me to talk. MR. KING: Eli Verchuk . MR. VERCHUK : Hello. I'm Eli Verchuk from Leslie Drive. And I don't know if any of you are aware but four weeks ago the Lackawanna bridge, I think, there was an SUV that went over the barrier . And I was wondering if we could just a reflector or something to put on it to help protect drivers so at night they could see it? MR. KING: I'm sorry, what -- Lackawanna bridge? MR. VERCHUK : I think so. It's right when you come into town from the East Mountain section . There's a vehicle barrier and I'm just wondering if we could get, like, a reflector or something so when you're making that turn you could see it -- Spruce Street. MR. KING: A vehicle went over the bridge, okay. MR. VERCHUK : The barrier , the cement barrier . MR. KING: Okay. Thank you, Eli. Can we have our highways inspectors or the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 police department take a look at that and evaluate that for lighting or reflection to make that -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: -- more visible . That exhausts the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? I would ask you to please state your name and your address . Thank you. MS. XANTHIS : Hi. My name is Krysten Xanthis . I wasn't coming here to speak today. But I've tried all my resources . MR. KING: I'm sorry, what was your name again? I'm sorry. MS. XANTHIS : Kristen Xanthis . MR. KING: Okay, and where are you -- MS. XANTHIS : Dickson Avenue. MR. KING: Dickson Avenue, okay. MS. XANTHIS : I don't know if there is anywhere that you guys could tell me to go to try to find, I guess, the funding because Colts says they have none to get security . But they have enough funding to build a new building . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 There's a meeting on March 22nd at 4:30 at the board meeting at the Lackawanna Transit Center. I don't know if anybody could attend it. But, I mean, I don't want to see somebody else have the same thing happen. MR. KING: Does this pertain to the article that was in the paper? MS. XANTHIS : Yeah. MR. KING: Okay. All right. MS. XANTHIS : I go to another hearing soon for that person that's still in jail for right now. But, you know, I don't know what that's going to come of. But, I mean, one person, you know, I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with the city. But you don't know how people are. I mean, people come from everywhere that go there. And, I mean, I understand the security here and that's fine. I'm not saying anything against that. It's just that is a big place daily from morning until late evening and people go in and out of there. And what happened shouldn 't have happened . But, I mean, I don't know if anybody could attend that. But, I mean, you know, it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 not very safe down there. And that's part of the city. MR. KING: So that's the Lackawanna -- the Multimodal Transportation Center at the end of Lackawanna Avenue, correct ? MS. XANTHIS : Yes. MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. MS. XANTHIS : Thank you. MR. KING: Can we reach out to the police chief and between them and the sheriff 's department to see if there is anything that could be done to try to get at least police visibility down there, lighting , maybe we could look into that as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : We have, Mr. King, a number of times and I'll reach out again. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MS. WOLBACK : Hi, good evening . My name is Megan Wolback {phonetic }. I'm a taxpayer in the City of Scranton . I'm also a nursing leader at Geisinger Community Medical Center. I really felt compelled to be here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 this evening to really talk about the struggle s that we're seeing in our hospital just because of the lack of much needed space and services . Our undersize emergency department , our ageing imaging and diagnostic services as well as just our semiprivate bed model I think are really standing in the way of us being able to take better care of our community . Our hospital every day is faced with capacity constraints . We're averaging about 110, 115 percent capacity every day. Our emergency department , if anyone has had the chance to be in there it's just flooded with patients on stretcher s in the hallway , a very busy waiting area. People left even without being seen which is unfortunate and I think a disservice to our community . But just we don't have the space for all of these patients . And I think we have taken a lot of time to take advantage of literally every nook and cranny to put a stretcher , a wheelchair , anything . It's just not enough space. We have patients waiting for hours just to even move up to an inpatient bed, on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 average about eight hours. And that's because our inpatient beds, are units are at the same capacity . You know, for this community we have just outgrown our footprint and again, really looking at how we better serve our community , you know, our own family members . Our behavioral health patients , it's unfortunate but we have about 250 behavorial health patients coming in every month in crisis. Geisinger CMC is the only hospital in this area to take those patients . So they wait hours, on average 39 hours to even get to the right bed. And it's sad. We have so many young children all the way up to geriatrics , you know, sitting in a room getting medication . But they are not receiving the therapy that they need while being in crisis. As a nursing leader, I talk to my nursing colleagues every day, my physicians . And they're just strained . They're burned out. They're going home and it saddens me to say they go home feeling like they didn't do a good job. And they did. They're taking care of sick patient s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 in our hospital . And they work hard every day. But to go home and feel like you didn't give enough because they weren't able to get their patient to the right level of care timely or to have the right service or the space to provide the care that they want to. Again, just going back to what can we do to better serve our community . I really feel like a larger improved hospital is what we need to care for the patients that are coming to us, not only for the providers , our doctors , our nurses to have the space they need. But it's also for our patient s, our family members to have an experience that they can heal because I will tell you in our patient satisfaction surveys or when I'm talking to families , the space constraint s are probably one of the biggest frustrations for them because it's not at times providing that healing environment . So what I would like to ask this evening for all of you is to just really consider the rezoning. It's what our community needs. It's what our employees need to do or to give exceptional care. And it's what our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 patients need to heal and to be where they are going to be safest to get them back home. So thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Megan, Miss Wolback , can you please give your address ? MS. WOLBACK : I'm not a Scranton resident . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . It was a very interesting statement that we just heard. But unless they plan on doing a military triage and take stacking patient s in the parking garage, I really don't think that a parking garage will change the amount of ER space, the amount of beds in the hospital unless like you said, they plan on using the garage to do triage and actually put patient s out in the parking spaces while they're waiting for that eight hours for the room to clear. A solution of a parking garage does not at all address patient care. It makes it easier to park for the staff so they don't have to pay for parking , give a donation to the parks in lieu of actually having to pay for their people to park in the neighborhood .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 But it's little disingenuous to say that a parking garage will increase care and suddenly make equipment in the hospital better or newer. The barrier in question that was talked about was the -- there's a cement barrier in the middle of the road between the University of Scranton and the hotel that when you leave Center City you're going towards the Scranton Expressway . That little barrier in the center is solid concrete with a V. And the person drove up onto it in the middle and lifted themselves up. When it is wet and raining out -- MR. KING: Did that happen tonight , Mr. Coyne? MR. COYNE: That happened about three or four weeks ago, I believe . And what happened was the rain when it hits that certain area, not only makes the concrete dark and black; but it makes the roadway which makes it very hard to be visible . I would recommend rather than just a reflector to get yellow line tape and put a yellow line along the top sides of that cement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 barrier just to make that center divider completely visible to people who are turning there, especially in times when there's inclement weather or it may not be visible . Onto consultants , we talk about a lot of consultant s here helping the city. There was an article that I read recently about it. Cities have been turning consultant s all over the place. The average government spending on consult s is about 20 percent of the construction of any projects they do. It's a big business and a big cost that none of it is done in-house and all of it is farmed out. And often times consultant s get paid multiple times just because what they first come up with is never what is decided on. And they go back for rewrites again and again and get paid again and again for each one of those rewrites. Running the consultant sometimes is necessary but being able to do it in-house also should be a step of at least getting the beginning plans out. It should be available for any government to figure out what they need and then move forward with a prospective plan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 to a consultant rather than having a consultant propose everything in the beginning and move from there. Looking at the recent Recovery Act funds, if you take a look at the walkability study, we've heard a lot about the walkability study. As a matter of fact, there's about $120,000 that has already been spent from the recovery funds on the walkability study. We have no study in hand. We have nothing firm. But we've already spent $120,000 on it. That's lot of money for nothing . Sure we've talked about a few stop signs here or moving the streetlights , making some things wider. But as far as I'm concerned , a $120,000 for what we've seen so far is not compensation for the amount of money that we've brought in. And last, I brought before this body for the zoning the concept of public dedication . Public dedication allows construction in this city but part of it is dedicated through the zoning change to parks. To not have that in this or considered in this is robbing the children of 30 years of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 subsidized parks mandated by developers . That's two generations of 15 years for kids that you are throwing away because no one conceived of what is actually in the code that says when you build something you're allowed to make a mandatory dedication that goes to parks alone. But it seems the park and the children aren't that important . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MS. KOLOSKI : Doris Koloski . Okay, I'm going to try to talk fast because I wanted to talk all about this and address what Mr. Smurl had said at the end last week's meeting . But now that I have the nurse manager here from Geisinger and heard everything she said, I would love to ask her some questions even if she could share time with her answers. I would like you guys to look through that packet. And that packet is a rendering that Mr. Smurl had talked about seeing up at the hospital last year. Now, if you look at the front page and the last page, it will tell you that these rendering s are not -- are subject to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 change. So if they're subject to change, then they're meaningless . That's number one. Number two, they did come to a compromise in the 400 block and they completely refuse to compromise in the 200 block. I'm here for the 200 block because the 200 block of Colfax doesn't deserve a 100 foot building . Why they can't have a 45 foot parking garage is obscene . I mean, the parking garage is going to go the entire length of the block. So why does it have to be so high that it ruins their whole quality of life? Also, the other thing I wanted to address with that which just left my mind, I'm sorry to say, is the buildings . Now, in that packet you should have something that tells you all the things they bought and what they plan to do with it. The Olive Street medical office building is what they want to do with Olive Street is make it offices . The Geisinger orthopedics resident building , Geisinger Mount Pleasant , Geisinger Behavioral . They definitely need all of those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 things. But the behavorial is actually going into another building . That is I believe the one in Pittston but I'm not sure. So don't quote me on that. And that should empty if I'm not mistaken the whole seventh floor of the hospital which should give them another whole floor. So nowhere in this thing does it say that they're going to -- and they're going to have the cancer center, of course, in Dickson City. So nowhere does in this does it address the problem of what I'm reading in the paper and seeing on Facebook . And most of the people are more upset that there is no pediatric s and that there is no pediatrics specialized emergency and they have to take their kids all the way down to the Weis Center is Daleville -- Danville . And none of that is addressed in this. There's a cardiac unit. You have it in your packet there. It tells you the different units that they're going to put in when they rip down the other side of the 300 and put it in. And nowhere is there a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 pediatric s or anything like that. Now, what I would love to ask the nurse manager is, do you -- can you tell me honestly because this could be just a rumor that there are sections of the floors closed because they don't have enough staff to staff them? I'd like to know that. I'd also like to know if your employees have to pay for parking because last I heard they did and that's why they never park there because they don't to take the chunk out. So you're going to build a 40 foot high building across the street from you and taking up almost the entire -- taking up the entire block and unless they're going to give free parking , they're not going to park there anyway. They're still going to park in front of our houses and around the corner and on the side and 600. Unless this is Geisinger 's way of making sure they can't park for free like in the park or anything and they have to pay back to the hospital the fee to park there. Is it true -- MR. KING: Doris. Doris, excuse me. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MS. KOLOSKI : I'm taking up my time -- MR. KING: No, you are to address Council . We don't get into debate with the -- if you want to speak to Miss Wolback afterwards -- MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. All right. MR. KING: Thank you. Those are the rules. MS. KOLOSKI : This is going to my problem . I won't speak to her then. But this is going to my problem then because they destroyed my neighborhood and bought down all the houses. You had the NeighborWorks people here (inaudible ) for two years. When they called me last year I don't have a block anymore. Can I go off my block if I want to do an improvement of my house? So what I'm saying is, that you are putting up two garages . I could read this part that was a letter to editor from a woman who lives in Waverly about how she has to take her child now. And she wants Geisinger to expand because she thinks she will have to take her child to the Janet Weis Center every time it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 has some kind of medical issue. That's not true. It's two parking garages. And they're putting like a cardiac and a trauma and an ER. The other thing is what I've -- is most of the people I've seen when I go to the ER over there is that the reason isn't because there's no room that all the people are piled up, it's because they don't have staff. They have one ER doctor. So you are waiting . And you could be waiting there and obviously if somebody comes in with a heart attack and you're there with a bleeding finger the heard attack is going to take precedence . So you're pushed back and you're waiting even longer. MR. KING: Thank you, Doris. MS. KOLOSKI : Red light, I'm sorry. MR. KING: I let you extend because I cut you off. MS. KOLOSKI : Please look over my packet. MR. KING: We will. Thank you very much. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. DOBRZYN : Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I always seem to get on the wrong page anyway. Just before -- I had this all mapped out. At any rate, I also caught notice of that planting trees in front of non-profits . I mean, I have to object to the name non-profits , the very name because it's a tax exempt. And it's some cases they just kind of do a few good things and drift by and other times, you know, you even hear some scandals where the upper echelon is living high off the hog. And they have a bunch of volunteer workers beating their brains out for it. And it's just -- I don't think we should be doing anything on planting tress for that. We should take care of our parks the best we can as we have heard and noticed over the years here, there's quite a few amenities lacking and curtailed from our parks. And we just can't afford them. I don't need another tax increase . I'm just drifting by on -- trying to get by. So with all of the other -- the gas company got to use some kind of formula where gas went up and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 people were cutting back. And we didn't have that bad of a winter so, oh, they have the right to charge all the more for shipping all the less gas to your front door. My gas bill is about $75 over last year. And we have a warmer winter, figure that out, you know? Everybody makes a mistake in their favor more or less. And basically I have to agree with misses -- the lady with the recycling , Fay Franus. I don't like to rip into anybody that much, but I would suggest that we look into that and make some changes there. And two weeks ago we had a Covid rumor statement or fraud. Last week it was the lockdown. I mean, everybody beat up on Dr. Fauci and our epidemiologist and so forth. It's just a shame that you know 1.2 million people dying of Covid and current ly 500 a day. And if you look at some of our hospital 's problems like Geisinger , you know, I actually had what I called a drive-by angioplasty on my leg. I was joking around with the doctors in 2019 or 2021 it was actually . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 And they got me into the hospital that day. And three hours later I was walking out because they didn't have any room for anybody . And it was an emergency to get that artery opened. So that's the kind of situation with the Covid, I mean, that's practically destroyed the hospital . So, gee, I don't know about parking spaces and everything else. I certainly wish that things would improve. But they might need a little help from the public here. Start protecting yourself and get out and get vaccinated . It's not that bad. Buy a bottle of Jack Daniels on the way home and sit down. Do it on a Saturday and you'll be feeling fine in no time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, thank you. My 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 first is the front stairs at City Hall last week it was brought up by Mr. Spindler to replace I believe it's the blue stone out there. I did some research and found the Historical Architecture Review Board did recommend to replace the blue stone to keep the building looking like it's suppose d to look. And that I believe was about eight months ago. So I don't know if we're going to move forward . Mr. Voldenberg , would you ask the city whoever that project is -- in charge of that project if they are going take the advice of the Architecture Review Board or if they are planning to put concrete in there or what fixes they're going to happen there? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And I was also at the DPW building . The garage where they repair all the trucks, I believe that building is only 19 years old. But the heavy lifting equipment where they lift all the heavy trucks, the floor is crumbling around all of them and seem to be in very poor condition .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 And also where they work on the trucks, there was a pit underneath where they walk underneath to do the underneath work, change the oil and such. That pit seems to be way too short for equipment we have today. Maybe at the time it was built it was okay. But now if you park the truck on top of the pit, you cannot get down underneath . You have to crawl under the front engine of the truck. So that doesn't seem to be safe. So if our city engineer would go down, look at the concrete and also see if we could bring that pit up to today's standard s. Maybe it's the equipment that's bigger. But it's an unsafe condition for our employees . And then one last thing, on Adams Avenue behind the old Central High School where you come around the side of it where Adams Avenue goes into North Washington Avenue, it seems to be three lanes there, one lane turns -- you could turn left and go down and the other two lanes quickly run together . So if you could ask -- I believe if we could do a study there to find out if we could put some markings on the road, maybe a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 left turn behind the building to turn left and then the other two lanes to merge together properly or to line them so that it's a little safer to merge there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll make that suggestion , sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have several , two of which were brought up in public comment tonight . So I asked on several occasion s about the 1700 of Wyoming , you know, when -- it was brought up in public comment tonight . It's taking five weeks to get a permit. I know I've asked at least twice Mr. Voldenberg . Could we please inquire about that again? And just to make a comment on that, I don't think it should be taking five weeks to gain a city permit. I did have some correspondence with the assistant planner Craig Beavers about the land and fee in lieu for Parks and Rec. It was brought up and some information was given to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 us. And it was brought up again in comment tonight . He did have some decent answers for me. But can we reach out to Craig and also Don King and see if we can get an answer in writing why the fee and land in lieu of Parks and Rec wouldn't be added to the new zoning ordinance . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I had a question about Rubicon which I don't think as of yet we've had an answer to. About two weeks ago I asked how much has the city saved since the implementation of the Rubicon system and have we finalized the routes. Can we look into a little bit of follow up on that to see if we can get the answers to how much we have saved and if the routes have been finalize d yet? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out again, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. We got an e-mail about the fleet of electric vehicle s that the city has purchased . I heard that they had been purchased . I knew it was in the ARPA plan but I wasn't given official notice until I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 receive d an e-mail. So I have several question s about these vehicles . Can we get, Mr. Voldenberg , a list of the individual s that are going to be assigned these cars, where these cars are going to be charged, the timeline for the completion of our charging station , where the cars are currently being stored, what make and model car we purchased , what was the total ARPA cost, where did we purchase them from and were they bid through COSTARS ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask all those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . That's all, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, so I wanted to mention that yesterday morning I went on a ride not in the electric vehicles but I did see where those are being housed over at the Serrenti Center. But I went on a ride with Andrew Sunday, Michael Doherty who is a code enforcement officer and then also Director Eileen Cipriani for Community Development .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 And we rode through the Hill Section in the past quite a few times I've done walkthroughs with code enforcement officers of the Hill neighborhood to, you know, to find out what we're doing about certain properties , a lot of chronic problem properties . And this time driving through we had gone through streets that I'm not normally driving on. And some of the conditions that people are living in are atrocious . And it's just deplorable to see piles of garbage on people's properties or in their backyards . And some of the other things that I saw that it's -- it's really taking me back and, I mean, we have a number of issues throughout the city with blight and we still obviously have issues with compliance from people who have received , like, we've gone through the process with giving them the violation letters and quality of life ticket after ticket after ticket trying to bring them to the magistrate . And some people just blatantly ignoring everything that they get from the city and no changes are happening . So I'm very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 interested in continuing to explore legislation that the city should have to -- I know we've already are -- tighten ed up the ordinance or increased fines, added the rental registration ordinance . I'm hoping the rental registration will also help. But it's not all rentals. Some of them are, you know, being lived in by the property owners themselves . So this is just a major issue for me and for the city as a whole, not just for the Hill Section . But that is just where we had driven through . And a lot of times in the alleyway s too with garbage just being completely out of cans or blown over all over the place. And some of it was from University students that live there too but certainly not all of them. But I'll also be contact ing the University of Scranton to see what we could do to get at least those students in off campus housing to help with the garbage because it's looking pretty bad right now. So I just wanted to mention that. And we had also received a response from the deputy solicitor for the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 regarding a question a resident had last week on the aggressive dog legislation and what he had said to us was that there's already , like, a robust dangerous dog law through the state. And if a dog is deemed dangerous , then there is several owners that the -- there is several steps that the owner needs to take. Such dogs must pay -- such dog owners must pay a $500 registration fee and are subject to a fine of up to $5,000 for failing to follow the Dangerous Dog Law. But they do -- some state law does prevent the city from prohibiting or limiting a specific breed of dog which I wasn't personally interested in doing anyway. But I know we had questions about in the past. And then we did have a number of conversations last year. We had conversations with stakeholder s as well. They determined to add a part-time position to the Animal Control Department to help aid in animal control throughout the city. But there is nothing else at this time that I think that they're -- that it looks like the administration is considering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 in terms of legislation . So that's everything that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So being National Women's History month, an involved citizen by the name of Debra Nehouse (phonetic ) contact ed me with a great idea for Council , for us to do a proclamation for women who were first to occupy government positions in Lackawanna County. Miss Nehouse is graciously conducting the research for this proclamation and would like it done before the end of the month. So when I receive this information , I would like to ask our very own proclamation wizard Kathy Carrera over there to help us with that proclamation . Thank you. And so last night, the Scranton School District leaders recognize d West Scranton Intermediate staff and students who saved a child from drowning on February 24th. Physical education teacher Paul Divine rescued the child from the water, began performing CPR. Mark Loretti the swim coach also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 assisted with CPR and helped revive the child in addition to some student s and teachers who were all involved . I would like for us on Council to do the same with a proclamation on behalf of these brave heros of West Intermediate . So, Kathy, could you help us with that one too? Thank you. That is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I just have some followups from the previous week in terms of -- it was something that was mentioned tonight about the audit. Matt Domines ' the City Finance Director advised Foster and Foster, the actuary for the GASB-75 report advised Friday afternoon the police would have been finalized . That was last Friday followed by the nonuniform on Monday, March 6th, which would have been yesterday . And then the fire by Friday as I mentioned earlier March 10th. Kelly Lindsey with Kohanski and Company advised Matt that they could finalize the audit once this data is received from the actuary . So we're hoping they'll have everything they need by this Friday and they'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 be able to finalize it really quickly afterward s. Mr. Domines ' further advised that he he's in regular contact CliftonLarsonAllen , the new audit firm for the city. They hope to start the 2022 audit in midApril. If you could just check on the Law Department about sending that name up for approval from Council . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. Also Doris Koloski mention ed there was something with DPW was advised the Don't Walk signs at the intersection of Mulberry Street and Harrison Avenue were damaged and we've requested to repair. Is that correct , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That is correct , sir. MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. Mrs. Schumacher had mentioned Council requested our interim Parks and Rec Director to review the swings and other playground equipment at Nay Aug Park and all city parks and advise their condition to Council . So we're waiting for that report, but we have them on it, Marie. And the city Law Department advised 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 that they have not yet secured an outside party to review and secure easement s related to the Meadow Brook Flood Project. Les Spindler had some concern , new pave cut inspector compile a spreadsheet listing all pave cuts and status and we'll have it to Council this week. List is complete but needs updated format via the IT for Council review. City Law Department advised there's no aggressive -- oh, we just talked about the dog issue. So thank you, Dr. Rothchild , for addressing that as well. That's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS FOR THE LOCATION AND USE OF LOTS, LAND, BUILDINGS , AND OTHER STRUCTURES ; THE HEIGHT, NUMBER OF STORIES , AND SIZE AND BULK OF BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES ; THE DENSITY OF POPULATION ; OFF-STREET PARKING ; AND SIMILAR ACCESSORY REGULATIONS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , LACKAWANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA , AND FOR SAID PURPOSES DIVIDING THE CITY OF SCRANTON INTO DISTRICTS AND ESTABLISHING THE BOUNDARIES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 THEREOF , PRESCRIBING CERTAIN UNIFORM REGULATIONS FOR EACH SUCH DISTRICT , AND PROVIDING FOR ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND AMENDMENT OF ITS PROVISIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA MUNICIPALITIES PLANNING CODE (MPC), 53 P.S. § 10101 ET SEQ., AS AMENDED . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SMURL: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so I do have one -- two sets of amendment s I'd like to make a motion to approve two sets of amendments to go with Item 5-B. So the first one is I would like to amend Article 5, Section 5.16 regarding solar energy systems. I would like to be defined as solar energy systems , means systems of panels containing photovoltaic cells, either rooftop or on the ground including all necessary appurtenances , that this is intended to generate power for consumption on site to residence or businesses . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 And 5.17, Principal Solar Energy Systems , PSESs which would be defined as an area of land or other area used for solar collection system principally used to capture solar energy, convert it to electrical energy or thermal power and supply electrical or thermal power for off-site use of lots of more than one acre. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: So we have a motion and a second to amend 5-B of the zoning ordinance . I don't have it written down the exact -- was it 516 -- 5.16 and solar energy systems and 5.17 principal solar energy systems add them to the zoning ordinance . MR. SCHUSTER : To add these definition s to the new zoning ordinance . MR. KING: Okay. On the question ? I haven't really had an opportunity to take a serious look at what you're requesting . It's kind of the first I'm hearing of it. So those do not exist in the existing zoning ordinance , correct ? MR. SCHUSTER : They do not. MR. KING: Okay. So we're adding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 additional definitions . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so there's two sections of the code here from 5.16 and 5.17, one regarding solar energy systems , the second regarding principal solar energy systems and they're not defined in the code. There's multiple attribute s to each but they are not technically defined. MR. KING: Okay. So if this were to move forward this motion, I would have to ask our Solicitor , Attorney Gallagher , if this motion were to move forward , it still would need final approval by Seventh Order so -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : You would be amending the zoning ordinance trying to -- MR. KING: Be amending it so then as it moved forward from here, that would be included . I just wanted clarification on that. ATTY. GALLAGHER : It would be included in the zoning ordinance that you're trying to introduce tonight . MR. KING: Okay. ATTY. GALLAGHER : It would be an amended zoning ordinance for all intents and purposes adding Tom's definition . And then you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 would vote on that zoning ordinance . MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , if we could maybe hold off on that amendment tonight and if you could provide us with the written definitions , I think that would be more helpful to give us time to review the amendment and the changes prior to adding them. MR. KING: On the question ? I would agree with that. I'm not sitting here saying I'm against that amendment . It's just that I would like to kind of look at how it fits into the existing zoning. So I'm not saying that next week if it moves to Sixth Order that I would not -- that I would be against that. I just would like to look into it a little further . That's all I -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I could understand everybody wants to look at it a little further . It's been something I've been looking at for some time. It's come up at the zoning meeting . And some other things have come up at the Planning meeting so it's been on the table.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 With that being said, I mean, I wouldn't feel comfortable moving this forward or introducing it without some of these things include d. So I may be voting no when it comes to that time. But I do understand the opinion . MR. MCANDREW : Well, on the question , there's a motion on the table. So we have to vote on it. MR. KING: Right. So if there's no further question s on the motion, we'll take it to a vote at this time. MR. SCHUSTER : So this will be a vote on the amendment . MR. KING: This will be a vote on the amendment to add that language to 5.16 and 5.17. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , like I said, I would like just some more time to review it. I mean, these definitions make sense to me as of now. I just want to make sure that I take the time before voting yes on the amendment . So I appreciate it if the amendment does not go for today if it's brought up the following week after we had time to -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. KING: I agree. DR. ROTHCHILD : And I also wanted to ask where the definitions came from. I just want to make sure that they are legally sound and have our solicitor review them as well if he hasn't. MR. SMURL: Mr. King, is this something that we could bring up again next Tuesday at the next meeting if it doesn't go tonight ? Is this something that -- MR. KING: If it doesn't go tonight , it could be reintroduced next week during sixth -- prior to Sixth Order. MR. SMURL: Okay. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Keep in mind that there's going to be a public hearing on this before you take a final vote. MR. KING: I believe the public hearing will not occur until it -- 30 days past Sixth Order, correct ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : That's correct . MR. KING: Thank you. If there's nothing more on the motion if we could get it to a vote. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. SMURL: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: No, the -- 3-2, the motion fails. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Also on the question , I have another motion to amend. I would like to amend the zoning map to provide that the odd side of the street of the 200 block of Colfax Avenue be zoned to town city institution al. So it would be the same as the even side of the 400 block of Colfax. And secondly , I would like to amend the zoning map to provide that the even side of the 200 block of Colfax be zoned city mixed use residential to be same as the odd side of the 400 block of Colfax. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: There's been a motion on and a second to adjust the ordinance to change 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 the 200 block of Colfax from civic to institutional and the 200 -- I guess it would be the even side of 200 to mixed city use. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , we're going to see a Geisinger expansion . I don't think that a height restriction is going to change the fact that the hospital will be expanded. I do think we've heard a lot from the citizen s and neighborhood meetings at Planning Commission meetings , etc. And I do think this would be a compromise between Geisinger and the Hill Section resident s. The point of zoning is to keep the integrity of the neighborhood s. And it would still keep our -- the structure of -- if the hospital would like a variance they could come in front of the Zoning Board to get that variance . MR. KING: Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , so I'm a neighborhood guy and a man of reason and compromise . I appreciate the hard work that Don King and his staff did for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 the new zoning ordinance . But I stand for the resident s of the Hill Section and I stand with the resident s of Fawnwood. I'm not against progress or advanced healthcare . I don't feel that a reasonable compromise would greatly affect Geisinger 's 280 million plus expansion plan. There will be plenty of work for the unions and their members . So that is why I'm for this amendment . MR. KING: Anyone else on the question ? MR. SMURL: Well, I have one comment . And I learned this this evening from Council person Rothchild that one existing garage right how is 86 feet and the second garage that they were planning to tear, both of those I guess. The second was 75 feet. And she gave us a number of the amount of cars that would fit. So and I believe we need that amount of parking for the future expansion of the hospital . MR. KING: Also on the question , I believe that if we end up lowering the height of the parking in the 200 block it may very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 well kill this project . And I also believe that as was announced here tonight that there is dire need in this city for healthcare , expanded healthcare . And it's not just about garages. It's going to be expanding the hospital to improve healthcare and to add services to the city greatly much needed. And keep in mind we have the emergency room at Moses Taylor which is going to be closing April 1st which is going to add even more stress to the existing situation at Geisinger . Furthermore , we are going to be adding plenty of jobs for construction over the next two to three years for this project for local workers , local union workers on top of ultimately expanding the workforce at Geisinger to the tune of approximately 120 new jobs from what I understand . They plan to increase resources for trauma, heart attack, stroke care and additional services with that. And from what Dr. Rothchild had indicated earlier this evening was that the new parking garage in the 200 was likely not to exceed 80 feet; is that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 correct ? Excuse me -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Eight stories , the height of proposed new one on that 200, yeah. MR. KING: Right. And then there is already an existing 86 foot parking garage there now. So, therefore , I can't support this amendment . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I have a number of thoughts and comments about this amendment and about the zoning ordinance . I've really over the past year have been trying to seriously take a look at this from all sides. And it's difficult for me because the Hill is my home. And I love the neighborhood . We bought our home there I think back in 2017. But I was student at the U and had rentals in the Hill before that. We lived in other parts of the city and then ultimately chose to come back to that neighborhood and that's truly where my heart is. And so it was, you know, very difficult for me as well to see the homes that were demolished and that were purchased by Geisinger to move forward with this expansion .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 And I'm not happy with the way that things were done either. And I know that for the neighbors they -- there is -- there's a lot of broken trust. And there's a lot of fear of the unknown and what's to come in the future for them and for the neighborhood that they also care so much about. At the same token, those homes -- those properties are gone now. And I don't want to see a lot stay vacant. And that has happened in other parts of the city like over near Moses Taylor there's been a lot for many, many years that was, you know, that was purchased , same thing, homes were demolish ed and nothing was done with. So I really don't want to see that happen here. And like I said, I've been having conversations between the neighbors , with Geisinger . I've met with Don King with a number of people to continue these conversations and to see what, you know, what we need to do as a city in this zoning ordinance . And I've brought forward before concern s from neighbors regarding the height, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 but not only that the appearance and the aesthetics of the proposed expansion and the garages , the noise, the traffic , the lighting , a lot of things that are -- that have been concerns for a few years with their current garages too. So I want to ensure that they continue to take these concerns seriously in the expansion . Now, there was the compromise of on the 400 block that changing from civic zone to institutional . So that would cap the height. I believe it's 45 feet and wouldn't be higher than the former Audubon School was that was there previous ly. And there is a lot of, like, a larger lot and a larger land there that they don't have to go as high. They could go shorter from what I've been told. And it wouldn't take up the entire block. There would be part for a possibly a pocket park or green space. They're working that out with the neighbor s. They've also propose d an advisory Council with the neighbors to continue these conversation s throughout the process . The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 problem still remains on the 200 block and what will happen there. And that's the amendment that you're seeing put forth tonight . So the -- there's this notion that they're not expanding the hospital and that they're just building garages , which, you know, I want to clear up and clarify because the two current garages that they have on the 300 of Colfax right across from the main hospital building itself, those garages will, you know, will be no longer garages . Those will be part of the expansion of a hospital . Also from what I've been told what their plans are is to not only expand the emergency department which you heard a little bit about before as to why that is so problematic , the lack of the space they have in there. But they also do have -- they still have rooms where there is more than one person in a room. And they want to get to single patient rooms throughout the hospital to better their care. And they are looking into additional programs and units that they don't currently have there like the possibility of a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 pediatric wing, which they don't have in which the city really, really could use. You know, I also come from the perspective of being in healthcare . I've said many times here I'm a physical therapist . I don't have any conflicts with Geisinger . I just want to make sure I put that out there. I've never worked for Geisinger . And being in healthcare I do understand the realities too of needing that spacing and wanting to provide that service to the community . I personally don't want to have to go outside of the area for my care. And I've gone to the ED a couple of times with my daughter in the past. And every time the waiting room is insanely packed to the point where I've stood outside with her because I felt more comfortable with that as opposed to sitting there in the emergency department and thankfully because of her age they, you know, would take her quickly back. But we would be passing by gurney after gurney with people on it in the hallway s of the emergency department just to get back to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 the room that we were able to get into. But that's not the case for many. And so I, you know, I understand the need there. And so that would be what they plan for the 300 block is to then extend the hospital into there to get rid of the garages . So I have some numbers . I have been trying to do my due diligence in asking as many questions as I can to help me in making a thoughtful decision here. So just to explain what I was told that the current garages are the 300 of Colfax. There's an employee lot. There's a visitor lot. The employee lot is a height of 86 feet and the visitor lot is at 75 feet. And then the total spaces between those two garages , the parking they have in Nay Aug and then a leased lot in Dunmore that they shuttle employees from totals a little over 1,400 spots. And with these new propose d garages on the 400 block, that would give them 700 spots. So that's the shorter but longer garage. And then on the 200 block the way that's propose d now being in a civic zone if it was eight stories which is what their plan is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 for that, then that would give them 900 spots. So that would be a total of 1,600 spots. So not only would that cover the amount of parking that they have now, but it would also give them additional parking because they anticipate with increase services , added employees and more visitors , more cars that they need parking for while getting those vehicle s out of Nay Aug Park. Now, they would still continue paying, like, Nay Aug Park through the contract that they have. But they ideally do not want the parking to be there in the park. They would rather on their own campus rather than having employee s and people walk from there. So that's some of the information that I've received and I wanted to share. So I am trying to look at the bigger picture . This is a zoning ordinance for the entire city, not just for one section of the city. And at this time I'm going to say no to the amendment because I do think it's preemptive . I want to wait to hear from Don King next week as well. I want to hear what people continue to have to say for the public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 hearing . I have been hearing from people from both sides, those who, you know, want expansion favorable to Geisinger and those who are neighbors and who want the zones changed . So I'm going to continue listening and, you know, maybe in the process the amendment could be revisited . MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . On the question , anyone further ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, further on the question , I'd like to apologize to my colleague s for putting this out there. I do think the conversation needed to be started early. I think anybody that watches meeting s watches that sometimes I will vote no to introduction . And it's because I like to get the conversation started before it moves ahead to Sixth Order and then to final passage because sometimes I think once it gets there it goes too far. I will be voting no for introduction tonight . I would have liked that Council would have gotten our amendment s together to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 on the same page moving forward as we go. But I do know there's going to be a lot of talk from now until final passage and hopefully we'll get some of these amendments in there before final passage . MR. KING: Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. KING: So there's been a motion to amend the 5-B zoning ordinance to change the 200 block from civic to institutional and on the even block to mixed residential ; is that correct ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: No, 3-2 vote. The ayes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 have it and so moved -- oh, excuse me, excuse me. Excuse me. That was on the amendment . So now we're back to the motion. We had a motion and we had a second. So now we'll have a roll call for the actual 5-B. MR. SCHUSTER : Prior to that just on the question , in the beginning when the draft rolled out, it did roll out to the neighborhood associations and a lot of those associations did get to review that draft. They came back with what they were -- what their thought s were for their own particular section of Scranton . I do feel a sufficient amount of time has passed. It's been over a year that the draft and updates have been out there. I haven't really heard from any other neighborhoods other than these two particular neighborhood s. So I feel like this ordinance has been vetted. If anything comes up in the future, I think it's late by that point. We've seen that several times here with the city.
