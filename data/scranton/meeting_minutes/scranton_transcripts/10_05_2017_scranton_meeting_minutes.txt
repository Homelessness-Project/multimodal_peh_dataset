Youknow,theresidents ofthiscity aregoingtohave--well,Lackawanna County aregoingtohavearealissueontheir handssoon,thisreassessment issue.And I'mhoping thatthepeople throughout Lackawanna County vote"no"tothatbecause it'snotthatthegovernment doesn'thave enough money,it'snotcompetent enough to handle themoneythatitdoeshave,andit's borrowed excessive amounts ofmoneyontop ofthemoneythatit'sreceived intaxes,so aslongaswecontinue toallowthis silliness tocontinue wearenotsafeinany ofthethings weown.Really weneedan elected government thatunderstands thatwe havetoabolish allproperty taxin Pennsylvania tosolvetheproblems that elected government shavecaused. Youknow,wetakealookat--and therehasbeenlotofdiscussion hereabout theScranton SewerAuthority sale,andlike Isaidlastweek,it'sprobably illegal all thewayaround andeverything that'sbeen donewithallofthemoneyisillegal allof1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 thewayaround,butthepeople thatare goingtohavetopaythatmoneybackifit everiseverchallenged aretheresidents of thiscity,notthepeople weelected and, youknow,it'spretty pathetic .

MS.SCHUMACHER :Goodevening .I'm heretonight tospeakonthemotion 7-Bthat youtabled because Ibelieve whatIwantto sayisstillpertinent .Therearefourmain issues tothatagenda item.Theyare, number one,asdescribed byBrenda Sacco, theDeputyDirector ofOperations and Finance fortheLackawanna County Department ofPlanning andEconomic Development ,this isaprimelocation .Taking thisproperty offthetaxrollswouldbeatravesty and addtotheburden ofthetaxpaying property1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 owners thatweareforced tobear.Ata minimum ,Ibelieve theconcurrence forthe liability forconveying thisproperty from taxpaying todebttotaxexempt should first beobtained fromboththeScranton School BoardandtheCountyastheyalsostandto loseproperty taxrevenue . Thelandportion oftheassessment isalready established at$60,000andusing anaverage ofseveral downtowncorner commercial properties thataresixfloors,I calculated the2017property taxprobably wouldhavebeenwith$50,000.That'sahalf amillion dollars overadecade thatyou wouldbeflushing downthetubes,andI actually thinkitwouldbemore,butI didn'twanttogooverboard .

Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.Asprior, I'llbediscussing reassessment againthis evening .AtaLackawanna County Commissioners 'meeting andpriortoa commissioners 'finalvoteontheballot question ,Iaskedthemtopostpone putting thequestion ontheballot untila comprehensive property assessment study couldbecompleted byanindependent third party.Tonight I'mgoingtodiscuss one suchstudycompleted byBlairCounty by Weis,Burkardt andKramer,LLC,priorto theirdecision todoareassessment aswell asoffering somecomments onthe informational sessions beingheldbythe county aswespeak.Onthefirstpageof thestudytheoverview section states the following :"Manyarenotawarethatthe primary goalofproperty assessments isto ensure thatfairandequitable assessments ofproperty aresetsothetaxburden is equally spread amongallproperty owners." Itgoesontosay,"Ifassessment1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 systems arenotperiodically adjusted ,they become regressive sothatproperties depreciating atahigher ratearetaxat lessthantheirfairshareandproperty appreciating atalesser rateorthosethat havedepreciate dinvaluepaymorethan theirfairshare." Sobasedonthosestatements does anyone thinkacounty thathasn'thada reassessment innearly 50yearshasan assessment system thatisfairand equitable ?Thefirstofthetwo-day reassessment informational session sstarted yesterday .Ididattend thesession today atcitycouncil chambers . According totoday'sedition ofthe Times-Tribune ,whathasbecome increasingly clearisthatmanyresidents areconfused andhavemisconceptions aboutboththe question andtheprocess .Also,basedon newspaperreports itappears thatthe commissioner thatisfirmly against the reassessment andvotedtoputthequestion ontheballot butdidnotsecond amotion to postpone thequestion untilnextyear's1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 primary ,whichbytheway,wouldhave allowed foraneducational period thatwould measure inmonths instead ofweeks,hasnow decidedtorailagainst theprocess itself. Youjustcan'tmakethisstuffup. SowhileIfoundtheinformation al session thatIattended tobefairand without prejudice ,itisstillacaseoftoo little toolate,butIwillcitesome examples ofwhatIthought wasfairness within thepresentation .Attorney Joan Price,theCounty'sreassessment expert, stated abouttaxfairness ,"That'sthegoal. Tomakecertain thatproperty owners are paying nomoreornolessthantheirfair shareoftherealestate taxes.Thatisit thepurpose behind it." Yes,Attorney Price,thatisexactly thereason wedoareassessment sothankyou verymuchforthatstatement . Another speaker brought upatried andtruescaretactic,thiswaslast evening ,ofthesenior citizen beinghurtby areassessment .Attorney Priceresponded , "Well,notnecessarily ."1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Yes,Attorney Price,thatisitalso right.I'lltakeitastepfurther ,inmy opinion theopposite ofwhatthespeaker proposed mayhappen.Manyseniorswillfall intothecategorythatImentioned earlier whereproperties appreciating atalesser rateorthosewhohavedepreciated invalue paymorethantheirfairshareintaxes,so acountywide reassessment istheonly adjustment thattrulyaddresses uniformity . Itisalsoimportant tonotethat reassessment cannot beconducted toincrease taxrevenue.Soforthosethatliketofan thatflametheyareincorrect .Strict anti-windfall lawsareinplacerestricting jurisdiction sfromreaping thewindfall due toreassessment .Infact,following the reassessment ,county andmunicipalities are prohibited fromcollecting morethanan additional 10percent oftheaggregate real estate mortgage taxescollected theyear priortothereassessment unless thattaxing jurisdiction hasvotedtoenacttax increase . Sofinally Iwanttoconclude by1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 making onemorecomment whichisaquote fromtheBlairCountystudythatsays, "Whileeverytaxisaburden,itismore chieflybornwhenthecitizen feelsthathe isonlyrequired topayhisproportionate shareofthatburden measured bythevalue ofhisproperty tothatofhisneighbor ."
