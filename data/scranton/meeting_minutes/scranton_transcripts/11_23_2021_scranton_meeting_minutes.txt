MINUTES OF THE ETHICS BOARD MEETING HELD OCTOBER 20, 2021. 3-H. MINUTES OF THE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD MEETING HELD OCTOBER 14, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have two. First, in the composite pension meeting from October , Mr. Voldenberg , it mentions that there was an e-mail that made the Board aware of miscalculation of the MMO that Council approved in September . Can you inquire about that and find out what the miscalculation was? It's not clear from the minutes . And I don't ever remember receiving any official correspondence making us aware of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. GAUGHAN : And the second thing I wanted to mention very quickly is 3-A tonight is the projections and the budget letter that we got from the Pennsylvania Economy League. Every year that we received the budget, they give us their -- how our projections or how our budget was in comparison to their plans. And I am very concerned about some of the projection s that we are way off of where they had projected . In terms of revenues , interfund transfers 340 percent over what was budgeted ; other nontax revenue , 198 percent . In 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 expenditures ; pension , 20.5 percent ; other employees expenses , 16.5 percent ; capital expenditures , 120 percent ; nondepartmental expenditures ; 132 percent . I'd like to reach out to Pennsylvania Economy League, Mr. Voldenberg . Usually we have a conversation or a caucus with them prior to the end of the year. Since we are on the cusp of exiting Act 47, I think it would be good to have that final conversation with them before the end of the year. So if you could reach out to them and see if they would like to come in for a caucus to discuss this letter or -- from Act 47. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to them tomorrow . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . It seemed like with some of the CBAs and with the healthcare , there possibly could be a change in some of those numbers. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I just want to wish 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 everybody a Happy Thanksgiving . That's all I have. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : That's what I wanted to say as well. Happy Thanksgiving . Hope everyone spends the holiday safely and with family. MR. DONAHUE : Just to add to that because of the Thanksgiving holiday , garbage collection for the Thursday and Friday pickup will be a day behind. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just want to take a second to say something about our former colleague and a good friend of mine and a lot of ours up here and -- former Council member Bob McGoff. Former Mayor and former Council member Wayne Evans used to speak on Bob McGoff on the anniversary of his passing, which was November 19, 2015. And it's been six years since Mr. McGoff passed away. And former Mayor Evans had read Mr. McGoff's words that he spoke at this Council meeting when he himself was going through a courageous battle with cancer. So I want to take a second to keep that tradition alive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 because we all think and I think so highly of Bob McGoff and all that he did for our city, I just want to take a second and read his words into the record on the six year anniversary of his passing . And Bob McGoff said, "Just one thing I would like to mention . I would just like to say that I know all of us have been affected in some way by this insidious disease . And I would just encourage that anyone that knows someone who is fighting this or dealing with treatments involved with cancer to be a friend. One of the things that happens to cancer patients and those under treatment , depression is a very significant aspect of it. And believe it or not, simply sitting down and talking with people, going, watching a television show, bringing down dinner and having something to eat with them goes a long way to helping people deal with that. And I would just encourage that if you know someone , please be a friend and be a part of the helping process ." And those were Bob McGoff's words. He was such an inspiration to all of Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 When I sat here next to him and he was fighting that battle with cancer, you would never know it. He showed up. He dealt with everyone with grace and with honor and with courage . I learned a lot from him. I was a new Council member in 2014. And I learned really how to be a Council member because of all of the things that he did and he was able to show me along the way. So I wanted to just take a second as my former colleague Wayne Evans did and honor him and hope that we can all remember him in our prayers and his family. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : And the first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . Any update on the audit? MR. DONAHUE : We're still waiting for the Sewer Authority . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. I have very mixed feelings about the way the 2022 budget is going right now. Last week I downloaded the draft or the proposal early on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Tuesday morning and that plus PEL's document and spent the rest of the day going through both of them and been going to the various meetings with department heads and then tonight with police and fire. And I beat Larry West about the head and shoulders tonight because I'm a little bit frustrated . He presented to you a number of changes which I have not been privy to. And I hope that you plan to put those in next week's agenda. I asked him to attach a memo explaining what happened with the pay raises and how that affected the budget because it's not self-explanatory if you just look at a spreadsheet which brings me to a few comments about transparency , full disclosure and fiduciary responsibility . Sometimes I feel like I'm chopped liver. Now granted , I sold my property last year so I don't get a property tax bill per se. But you have better believe that Mr. Charlie Jefferson factors his property taxes into my rent charge. So I do pay property taxes indirectly as does every tenant in the City or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 you have a very stupid landlord , which I do not. But, you know, trying to keep up with the -- these budget projections to do my own due diligence as a citizen , it's like we haven't learned much in the last 10 or 20 years that we can't wrap our arms this octopus called the budget process . We don't have an audit so we don't have audited financial statements for the year 2020. We're basing it on 2019 which is prepandemic . We got to get that thing changed . We got to get the Sewer Authority and every other authority to get on the same calendar year that the City is in so that you could all get it done. And then, you know, we've got four union contracts under negotiation . And it's very possible that their contracts are going to expire before those contracts are resolved . And worse case is that they're going to arbitration because you know what kind of record that the City has when these things go into arbitration . So I'm trying to feel -- I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 reliable figures on which to assess what's happening with the budget, not just next year but the next five years. And the numbers are shaky at best. On top of that, 3-A, Mr. Cross's document about reviewing the proposed budget that it meets the goals of the Exit Plan. But it's based on the October 24th version of the budget. So has anybody sent him all of these changes or do you plan to send him all of these changes ? MR. GAUGHAN : Well, we plan to get in contact with him because just as frustrated as you are, Miss Hodowanitz , I've never been this frustrated in eight years on City Council because the same mistakes that were made last year were made this year. MS. HODOWANITZ : I wasn't privy to the process last year because I don't do Zoom because I'm too cheap to have the internet because I'm paying rent to Mr. Charlie Jefferson who's charging me for his property taxes. But be that as it may, I have to compliment the City on this process of bringing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 in the Mayor and the department heads. I think that was excellent . And I hope that goes on until the end of time. And I think Mr. West is doing a very good job considering that he was dropped into this process in the middle of the year. And he's inheriting something that somebody else started . But my God, we got to do better than this. We're like the Keystone cops. And I don't care how we do it. Do a car wash and I'll pay for it. But we've got to do better in this process . So that is my frustration for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner taxpayer . Last week I didn't make it here but I watched the caucus and the Council meeting . And what caught my interest was the OECD Director saying that they might have to take a look at the rental registration ordinance . I've been saying that for I don't know how many years because every year even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 though I'm exempt from registering , I still get a form that says I have to register . And this year I called and spoke to Director Oleski and he said, Les, we talked about this last year. He said don't send it in and he hung up on me. So I'm not sending it in. But the way that ordinance is written even though I'm exempt, I still get that in the mail and I shouldn 't have to. It's a waste of my time to fill it out. It's a waste of the person's time sending it and putting postage on it. As I said before, it should be rewritten . And I would like Attorney Hayes' opinion on that if he could pull the ordinance up and see what he thinks it says. I'm sure he could pull it up in a couple seconds before I'm done talking here. Next thing, driving around the City in my retirement job delivering auto parts I come across a lot of areas that I usually don't see. Last week I was at a red light at Sanderson Avenue and Olive Street. To my left was the old All Phase Electric building . All the windows in the front it looks like they were recently busted out. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 place is a mess. It looks -- it's an eyesore . Across the street just up from there was Perfect Alignment building . That's -- no busted out windows , but it's just an old dilapidated building . I'm just wondering if we got all of these developers in the City, Charles Jefferson , Basalyga , Russo{sic}, can't -- I thought maybe the City could talk to these -- one of these people and try to develop these buildings , maybe get a business in there instead of just doing apartment buildings . These build -- it looks like a slum area right there on that corner. Maybe we can try to get somebody to develop those building s and try to get some businesses in there. I think that would be a good thing. Lastly, last time I was here I spoke about the DPW supervisor who was on my corner painting lines all over the corner and everything and not just where I live, the whole corner. And he said they're going to get done before the cold gets here. I said that's fine. Well, I'm starting to have my doubts because the cold is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 here and they still haven't done it. I'm sure they're busy. And if it's not done until spring, I guess I could put up with that. But hopefully we'll get some nice weather before the snow flies. But at least, you know, at least they did come up and look. I had that problem for years and years. A lot of times they wouldn't come up and look. I guess I have to be satisfied with whenever they come up and do it. That's all I have tonight . I want to wish everybody a happy healthy Thanksgiving and we'll see you next time. MR. GAUGHAN : Happy Thanksgiving . Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Happy Thanksgiving . MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Can you hear me there? I can't tell with this mask. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, we can hear you. MS. FRANUS: Thank you. I normally wouldn't be anywhere because I haven't been out in like two years. This is so important to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 come here and speak about this budget and what's going on in the City. I haven't left my dog Anderson in -- ever so, hi, Anderson . He's watching . So anyway, I wanted to say that I really, really wanted to thank the Mayor for getting us out of distress , working with you, Council , and the administration , Business Administrator . It's 22, 29 years, I don't know what it is; but it's decades. And with her guidance and your guidance , we're finally getting out of this. Normally I wouldn't say we need pay raises. But, you know what, when I look back at the way the City's been run under past administration s and mayors, we had people that were hired that were friends of the mayor, friends of this person, friends of that person instead of qualified intelligent people. And here's the deal breaker , when you interview people say from Clarks Summit or Throop or anywhere for a job, once they hear they have to come into Scranton , which they know, but once they hear the salary, that's a deal breaker .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 They won't come because the pay isn't enough. That's why I'm with Mayor Cognetti and saying these pay raises are very important to get the best people like the Human Resource Assistant Director and the finance chair take over $80,000 for PEL which is very important . I think that's a -- very, very important to give the supervisors and department heads raises. They deserve it, especially if we are going to get top-notch people. The City is turning around. It's a new beginning . Here's another thing, this friend of mine Jason Lebraski {sic} who lives in Keyser Valley phoned me this afternoon . I was so pleased to hear this. He lives on the corner by Lafayette and Dewey or something . And he came across these men that were working on a pipe. I don't know if it was engineers , the men that were working with them. They were opening up -- they're going to open up a pipe by -- remember Lenny Srebro who comes here all the time complained for years about flooding in his home.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 You know this, Mr. Gaughan and Council members. So now because of new competent management at the DPW, this is getting done. I think this is wonderful . And I'm sure everybody on Council heard Lenny come here all the time. He must be very happy. Now, another thing I want to talk about. History -- history in the making as far as I'm concerned . This Rubicon , this new technology , I think it's wonderful . I was reading the RFP. And it says with this there's going to be more efficiency . There's going to be more optimization in collections . There's also going to be fairer distribution s, the route distributions for the truck drivers . So I think everybody -- it's a win-win. So I know my guys that collect my garbage , they're the best guys in the world. My sister -- everybody loves their drivers . They do so much for them. They really should be appreciated . Christmas is coming. Don't forget them at the holidays . They really do a wonderful job for us. Now, another thing I wanted to bring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 up, the supervisors . I understood last week I was impressed when I heard Mr. Preambo come in. One of the things he said that I wrote down that I thought was excellent . He said without monitoring , nothing gets done. What does that tell you? It tells you that you need supervisor s. When I worked at the water company I had a supervisor . Without him guiding me and leading me every day, I wouldn't get my work done the way it should be done. They are super important . So I think like Mr. Preambo mentioned , I believe that the Parks Department and the Highway Department does not have a supervisor . That's very important to do. So I hope Council in their budget in your thinking realize this should be done. And please give these departments supervisors . I can't even stress enough how important this is. I wouldn't be here otherwise . This budget is too important . I want you to trust the Mayor and believe what she's saying and that she will hire competent people.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I think everybody should get their raises because they deserve it. And even Mr. West last week who stepped in for the Parks Department and gave us all that information because the department head wasn't able to be here. Everybody is working together . And we're seeing so many improvements in this City. So would you please consider these budget recommendation s and please pass them? Let me just check to see if there is anything else I want to say here. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Miss Franus. MS. FRANUS: Oh, was my time up? Oh, my time is up. Mr. Gaughan , I just want to say to you, I wish you all the best when you leave. And I hope everything goes well for you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. MS. FRANUS: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Have a good night. Next speaker is David Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Once again, I'd like to remind Council that televisions are piling up in the courts and that's a county thing or was until they decided they weren't doing it anymore. And along with televisions , cardboard boxes and stuff are not really being recycled to their proper -- if you have a family, it's time to start worrying about them. In 10 years, 15 years maybe I won't be here so not my concern anymore. Once again, I'd like to remind Council that there are some nonprofits kind of have foul operation s that they are probably not paying 10 cents worth of property tax on like I mentioned up at the top of Linden Street on West Side, a bunch of cement blocks laying around in the yard. It used to be owned or operated by Final Things and they're religious nonprofit . Well, that's fine and dandy; but that neighborhood 's a mess. And they are not doing anything with it. They should either decide what to do or give it back to the City or whatever they want to do with it. Now, with a lot of the expansions of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 non-profits and tax exempt entities like courthouses and state buildings and stuff, we once again -- we're lacking money that we should have. And I'm not bashing them. I'm not bashing the university . I'm not bashing hospitals . I was just there today. But, it would be interesting if the state would offer some kind of compensation for it even like half. We would have millions and millions of dollars to deal with it. And they do benefit people from outside the City. If you get sick in the Abingtons or out towards Madisonville or wherever , Covington Township , you're headed to Scranton . And by the way, we don't have a pediatric surgery unit in one of our hospitals -- the old Moses Taylor. They have to be shipped for an appendicitis to Lehigh Valley. Is that not crazy? I mean, that's insane if you ask me. And COVID once again, it's over 100,000 a day. About 1,500 people a day die from it as we speak. I was at to see my doctor last week, my regular doctor and primary care. And he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 went to a wedding . His whole family came down with COVID. And they were vaccinated three times. So until people get off their ditty box and get vaccinated -- like I said, I'll take two. They're small. You know, I'm on my third. I'll take two more. They're small. You know, so it's just important that people get off their ditty box and get vaccinated because it just keeps piling around. And a little thing on the environment , last year -- and I'm pretty sure it's available on the internet, Michael Moore put out a film on the various failures of alternative generation of electricity like solar power and windmills and stuff like that, different applications like that. And I mean maybe there's been some improvements , but it's something that everybody should watch because they are clear cutting forests chopping them down into chips and sending them in ships over to Germany. And Germany was given an award for the wonderful alternative energy they were generating . Well, cutting down trees isn't the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 answer. I thank you. Have a good evening and a nice Thanksgiving . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. You as well. Have a good night. That exhaust s the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else in the audience like to address Council this evening ? MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And the first thing I want to ask about and maybe it's me, but each week that I come to Council and Miss Hodowanitz -- Joan gets up and talks about the audit. What is the reason as to why we don't have it? I know you mentioned something , Mr. Gaughan , that you're just as frustrated as Joan is. So for myself and all the others sitting out there who watch Council must wonder what is the reason? Can you give us the reason? Does the audit company get penalize d for not coming forward ? Do they get -- you know, what's in it for them that would make them come forward and complete this audit? I don't know because I have enough on my plate to keep my little budget together 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 and audit by checkbook . So as Joan comes up week after week after week and asks about the audit, I wonder -- and I'm sure others out there in Scranton wonder what is it? Are they being penalized and what can we do -- Council do to make them come up to the plate? And I certainly hope they don't have another contract for next year to do the audit for the City of Scranton . MR. GAUGHAN : So what we've been told is that they're waiting for -- the audit company is waiting for an audit of the Sewer Authority to be completed , correct , Councilman Donahue ? Because that's a component of our audit to look at their financial s as well because they are -- have not yet been dissolved yet because there is outstanding judgment s that have to be resolved . So that I think at this point is the only holdup if I'm not mistaken , Kyle, if you want to add anything else. MR. DONAHUE : That's -- yeah, so the contract that we did give that was given out four years ago, it's for four years. So there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 is another year on there. But I know Attorney Hayes is reviewing the current contract and developing ways going into next year how we strength en that especially certain deadlines and having a hard deadline in the contract . MS. JEFFRIES : Okay, because I always think, you know, in my working days and all, we had meeting s like this. And you come to the table with your status on your projects . And believe me, if I kept telling my boss I wasn't ready, I'm waiting , I'm waiting , I'm waiting for this, I wouldn't have my job very long, you know? I'd have to come up with an action plan as to what I was going to do. So that was my first thing. My second thing is, I guess this is like an advertisement for the light show at the Nay Aug Park. It's up and running . It's fantastic . If you have not been to the light show in say the last five years, you must put it on your agenda on your calendar to go to the light show. It starts at 5:00, 5:30 and runs to 10:00 at night. And it is just fantastic . And we've done a great thing this year.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 We tried to represent all of the different denominations in the City that might be celebrating the holiday around Christmas . So we do have the Kwanzaa , the Merry Christmas , the Hanukkah and I forget the other one. But we have represented everyone . So there is a lot going on up at Nay Aug Park and during the light show. And I just want to give a shout-out to all of those that are working to make that happen every night. Okay? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I guess tonight 's frustration night. I have been frustrated -- well, a long time with Council but a week from tonight on what is not happening on Wyoming Avenue. Council heard Cipriani -- Miss Cipriani say that the property owner is causing the delay by adding a number of things that probably are not possible . And the Mayor said they keep moving the posts. So it's the property owner slowing the process . But I want to ask you tonight is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that did any of you go directly to the property owner and ask for his list of demands during this week? MR. GAUGHAN : Well, that would be inappropriate because we are legislators . There is no law that we can pass to make this happen. We've highlighted it and tried our best. But it would be inappropriate -- Solicitor Hayes, if you want to correct me if I'm wrong -- for us to go to a property owner. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. The clock is running . MR. GAUGHAN : You asked me a question . MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. I got the message . You didn't do it. Now I have learned the property owner solicitor has tried to arrange a meeting with City Solicitors on numerous occasions with no return calls. Now this taxpayer is requesting that it's time that you invite both the City and the property owner to a caucus to a meeting and get this straightened out. This has been going on far too long and somebody is not telling the truth here. I think that you need to do that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 So moving on. The 7-A tonight , the way I read Robinson Park, the neighbor who had kids -- when ARC was there, they only rented the building . Now it sounds as though they are getting the entire park. And I know when my little guy was -- before he went to school we were up there a lot. And I think it would be, you know, terrible if the neighborhood kids can't use their own park. MR. GAUGHAN : No, they could still use the park. It's open to the public. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Next one is 7-C, the SAFER Grant. Back a decade or so ago we could not be efficient as a fire company because the Harrison Avenue Bridge could not be utilize d by the weight of a fire truck. But that bridge as we all know has been replaced now for over a year. And I have not seen any efficiency study done of the fire department . And I think that that's critical . Are we doing it the most efficient way that we can and do we really need to add 10 more people? And on the other, this EMT stuff I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 just heard about. So I'm not sure that we need that either. But then I thought as to the tax rates on the agenda tonight , I hope that if the budget is -- you're not going to pass these that you'll put them on the table until the budget is approved. Is that -- MR. GAUGHAN : Well, they -- nothing is changing other than the payroll preparation tax. And I expect that that will stay in. MS. SCHUMACHER : So you are going to go ahead and approve that before the budget is -- MR. GAUGHAN : Well, they're -- so they're on the agenda for three weeks because they're ordinances . So it doesn't -- it doesn't -- since we're not changing anything in the budget, it doesn't make any difference . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And on H -- well, no. The other -- the other thing I had is -- I don't know -- just very frustrated that things don't seem to be happening . And I hope that we can get moving. And I don't agree with Miss Franus that we're on easy street. I think it's going to be difficult . And I only got 18 seconds. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 So I'll now say that I hope that you all find many things to be thankful for this Thursday and enjoy the holiday . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. You as well. Have a good night. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I went to the DPW to have a problem resolved . I brought City sewer maps that I had and made copies of them and actually laid out the water flow problem s that I had for our direct neighborhood . I'm happy to respond that within two days of me bringing to the Sewer Authority , one of the Sewer Authority personnel reached out to me. This was just before Thanksgiving to come out and do a site survey to see what was going on because I had laid out all of the -- not only the sewer maps but water flows that were causing impacts on multiple properties . He had wanted to schedule an appointment for him and an engineer to come out in the following week. But due to me being out of town for one of those days and then being on vacation , it actually was delayed for two weeks which is more than acceptable . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 They came out, took a look at the site, and within the next week were out there with the crews cleaning the waste water drains. Part of the issues that I had talked about were the neighbor s' basement s were being flooded because of the diversion of basically a half a block of the City's water being kicked out onto the street. When they pulled the drain covers and took a look at them when the road was paved seven and a half years ago, a piece of the blacktop had actually been dumped or fell into the base water system while they were remilling the surface . That remained in there. So there was a chunk of 2 foot by about 1 and a half foot roadway surface that was directly laying over the pipe and filling it up with silt. They removed that and I hope everything is going to be completely resolved the next time because they cleared the three drains that were slowly draining on the block. They had talked about increasing the curb pipe. But naturally both of us agreed that that would be improper to do with the cold coming on because putting the tarmac on it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 would just with cold patch and expansion because of the snow just makes it weak which would cause it to break off and more likely destroy the work. But hopefully the repair of the sewer drains of these stormwater drains will resolve the situation completely . I stopped in and I caught up with Mr. Preambo before the last caucus because even though I was going out of town, I wanted to personally commend his personnel for their job or efficiency for them reaching out and for their conscientious nature in taking care of an issue that was -- that's issue number one. Number two is on this budget. First of all, for the fire department and the police department contracts , in the next contract going forward I think it would be prudent to put in a date in there that be negotiated and end in the third quarter . It should not end on the end of December because that way you are negotiating a budget and unknown numbers over a period of time to make a budget that you have no idea. If the contract ended six months or three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 months before the budget would have to be in, you would have the foresight when that final agreement was made to know what your numbers are going to be. Now because it ends at the same time as budget and you aren't privy to all of the information from the negotiations . You have no idea what those prospective changes are going to end up to be in the end. It would be more prudent rather than December 31st for the contract to end, have it end on August 31st for the next contract which then would give you a negotiation period to get those numbers . I'm not adverse to the City increasing budgets, especially not for the Department of Public Works. But I am conscientious of the fact that you are working blind with numbers that are presented to you, and in this case adjustments being made in the second presentation of the budget. How can you actually make a reasonable decision when we have one more meeting and that meeting is where we get to see some of the adjustments ? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 nice night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. SCHUSTER : I think -- I mean, the only comment I guess I have tonight is there was a property at Cedar Avenue I put in for the last couple weeks. I've heard there hasn't been anything done with that property so if we could send that in again. As for the budget, I think it would be appropriate for me to discuss at this point in time or wait until on the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : It's up to you. You could wait until on the question . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll wait until on the question for that one. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s this evening ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, over on Matt Avenue along side the Chamberlin plant, there's a huge hole with a metal plates over it. First 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 of all, I don't know why the hole is there. Maybe it's a utility company . Can we please investigate because with winter fastly approaching , that would wreak havoc on the plows trying to get over there. That's a nightmare . So, Mr. Voldenberg , could you just reach out to somebody to see who is responsibile for that hole and the metal plates? MR. DONAHUE : And, Mr. McAndrew , just to jump in too, I did reach out to -- last Thursday morning before -- yeah, since the day that DPW was in here, I reached out to DPW Preambo . And he was going to reach out to the water company because that was their project where they put the stuff over it. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. A second inquiry won't hurt. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll handle it. MR. MCANDREW : Thanks, Councilman Donahue . So last week, you know, we bring this up all the time. So I brought up job descriptions while Mr. West was here. And he said, you know what, I'll get them to you. We want a job description for the people that have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 already been here. I especially want job descriptions for all the propose d new hires, definitely . So and then we talked about increases . So and he said they're all performance based. So I asked this other question that I have yet to receive an answer for. I asked if there were any formal evaluations of any employee in any capacity of any department done last year. So I didn't get an answer yet. So could you please -- I asked in person. So maybe we could send an e-mail as a remainder with both questions . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments this evening ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Just two -- two citizens complaint s I wanted to bring up. Somebody had contact ed me yesterday . I believe they reached out to some other department s. But I'd like to make sure that we send correspondence s to them as well regarding an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 issue illegal tire dumping that is happening on Skyview Drive near Saginaw . So I believe she left a message for our office too. I just want to make sure that we -- that we reach out to the departments to get over there and see what's happening , find out who owns the property where the dumping is occurring . And then the other thing that I want to check on because we had received an update on the 400 block of East Gibson Street where there's overgrown bushes and that are, you know, covering the sidewalk and going into the roadway as well as the boat and some other vehicle s that are parked near there. The update only gave us a list of partial owners. It was like three owners. I can't find where it is now. But that was all that it included . So I'd like to know if violations were issued to those owners, how there are three people that are joined in the ownership of that property and what's going to be done about it. So if, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could reach out again about that property I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 appreciate it. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : No, I'll save my comment s for agenda items. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Just two things -- or three things rather. We did receive an OECD salary breakdown by funding stream from Eileen Cipriani , the Executive Director of OECD. Trying to read and understand the OECD budget this year was very, very difficult . So we'll include that in Third Order for next week. The police department respond ed to -- and followed up on an abandon ed vehicle that neighbor s were complaining about in the 400 block of Phelps Street. Neighbor s had indicated that the vehicle was tagged but remained on the street. So that's being taken care of. And the last thing I wanted to mention was the lights at Nay Aug Park. I know that Miss Jeffries mentioned it. I had an opportunity to go through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 with my children recently . And they have done an absolute ly phenomenal job this year. There are more lights. They are in different locations . It's the best I think I've ever seen it look. And that's a credit to the Recreation Authority Board, Jerry Smurl, Bob Gattens , and the Parks and Recreation Department and the employees in that department . They have done a very, very good job. It's a huge asset to the City. And that's all I have this evening . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING AND ESTABLISHING SPECIAL CITY ACCOUNT NO. 02.229642 ENTITLED “ARP FUNDS” FOR THE RECEIPT OF AND DISBURSEMENT OF MONIES FROM THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN (ARP) FUNDS. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, on the question , Solicitor Hayes, if you can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 look into -- I've asked this question . I have not receive d an answer yet. What is the process for -- okay, so -- I don't think we've officially accepted this money. And I don't know if we have to by ordinance or by resolution . So that's the first question is how that works if we have to officially accept it by -- City Council has to accept it. And then the second thing is, if we have to accept or vote on some sort of plan on how to spend these funds or does Council do that piecemeal as they come forward . We received a tentative plan from the Mayor. I just want to make sure that Council has a say in this process in terms of, you know, voting on it at some point. So if you could look -- ATTY. HAYES: -- with Fidelity . Fidelity was going to hold the funds. So I don't know why -- MR. DONAHUE : I think the Fidelity -- so from what I understand , the Fidelity is the bank account in which the funds were deposited . I think this is to create a City line item, a fund line item where you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 could put that money in and then pay it out. I don't know if we pay out of the Fidelity account . But in just discussions I've had with Larry West, I think in terms of a plan on how we're going to spend this, more than likely it's going to be done not as one. So we'll get lost revenue first. But it will probably be done quarterly instead of all at once so we'll have a batch, you know, for the first quarter of the year, a batch for the second quarter of the year. And I was told that Council will be a part of that process . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH ANSER ADVISORY AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES GROUP, INC., TO PROVIDE CONSULTING SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARP). MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I think we need clarification on this question . The rubric is hard to understand . They have a scoring -- they score the vendors . But it's hard to tell how they came up with that score. So that would be my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 first question . The second question is, it's hard to tell who is the lowest bidder here. There are several vendors . And they list the cost. For example , project executive for the answer advisory that the administration has chosen is $300 an hour. Then there's a position $265 an hour. So if we can clarify that, Mr. Voldenberg , that would be number one. Number two, in the budget -- in the 2022 budget we're hiring an ARPA Executive Director at $80,000. And it would seem to me after reading some of the things in this proposal where we're going to hire a consultant to help us with the American Rescue Plan Act, we're also hiring an executive director . And it seems like the two position s may be doing some of the same functions . So I want to clarify that as well. As everyone knows, we've received over 68 and a half million dollars in ARP funding. We're going to be spending roughly 2.3 million dollars on this company to do several things, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the general requirements are on page 10. I just want to make sure we're -- there's not double work going on here. Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Just on the question , just to add to that, in addition to the ARPA Director , we also have an ARPA Citizens Outreach Coordinator and also an ARP SRA staff that are additions to our budget. So I have the same concern s as Mr. Gaughan . We're spending this money on this company but then also creating a staff. It does come out of, you know, the recovery plan -- Rescue Plan funds, but at the same time, those funds we need to maximize those use to get the most bang for our buck there. MR. SCHUSTER : I would also echo those concerns . MR. GAUGHAN : So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you relay that to the administration and see if we can get an answer before next week since this is a resolution ?

MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-B. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-B pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just a couple things that I noticed here. First is disclosure forms were not filled out. It was signed at the bottom. But there was no answers to the disclosures . So, Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to look into that? Also, there was no pricing page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 involved in this. And then lastly, they did mention in their proposal that there were -- they said that using data from the pilot program that was brought up last week, Rubicon 's preliminary analysis indicates the City has the opportunity to realize $519,000 in cost savings annually with the technology . Would we be able to get justification for that number exactly where those savings are going to come from? And that's all I have for right now. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, also on the question , thanks, Kyle, for bringing up the justification for those savings. I also received some question s regarding the reliability of the services and that the school district , they went through something similar which never really panned out with the promises that were given in the beginning . Can we reach out to Mr. Preambo and ask if they -- what the results of the pilot program are and if the service was reliable or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 if there was any kind of percentage of reliability involved with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I just wanted to add I wasn't here -- I wasn't present last week when this piece was introduced. But I know this has been a thought for quite some time that they would have this initiative and be able to collect this data and I'm supportive of it. I think that it will be a great way to, you know, keep track of the garbage trucks. But I was also happy to hear from Director Preambo about the route optimization which I believe is where some of those cost savings may come in if I remember correctly . And I'm also really interested in seeing the results of that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I also share the same 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 concerns that Councilman Donahue and Schuster have. Where's the backup for this $500,000 projected savings on the pilot? I vaguely remember the pilot even happening . And we didn't hear anything until now. So I would definitely like some backup on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 6-C. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 93, 2021 - AN ORDINANCE - APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2022 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2022 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2022. MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-C. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 that Item 6-C pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'd just like to express that I've had a lot of frustration regarding this budget from actually receiving it on the day I was suppose d to receive it up until tonight . And ever since I received this budget, I've gone through it every night. I've taken a look at the numbers . And tonight we were handed changes at the start of the meeting that we reviewed on the spot. And there were three areas of -- three increases that I would have had questions on. I would have been prepare d to come with questions on but I was just given them tonight . I think Council as a whole has express ed a lot concern s with a lot of moving numbers from the CBAs to, you know, we're moving into the Payroll Prep Tax this year, which might not be as accurate as we think. You know what I mean, that is yet to be seen. There is too many moving numbers here. And I would just like to say that, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 know, having changes given to us on the fly isn't acceptable . And it's not the way we should be moving forward with this budget. And I would like to say I am thankful for the process we've used this year. I'm glad that the department heads have come in. I thought we had very good conversations . And we got to tease this out. But the format of this is just not acceptable . And I think some of the men that were here tonight , you know, presenting this I don't think it's an error on their part. I think it's in the preparation of the budget. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a problem with the changes also and we're pretty much told there's more coming. So I'm disappoint ed with that aspect of the budget. MR. DONAHUE : On the question , probably over the last 10 days or so I've spent between 40 an 50 hours looking at spreadsheets, typing up my own spreadsheet s on what was given to us.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 And I could say that basically what's on our agenda tonight is not accurate . It is not accurate at all. And there are a lot of fixes that need to be made. We're working through trying to figure out what those fixes are. And then once we have those fixes, we could actually have a baseline where then we could discuss the policy implications of what is actually in here including , you know, new positions , any raises involved , any increases in capital expenditures . There's a lot of work that needs to be done. I know that there was some concern tonight about transparency . So I know that I could guarantee that as soon as we get an idea of what the budget is and where we're at, we will post that as soon as possible . If anyone wants a copy e-mailed to them as soon as we have that information in hand, please send me your e-mail address . I will send you what we have. That's all I could say at this moment. I mean, we're continuing to work through this. It's a holiday this week but we will continue to work through it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 Hopefully we have better information by -- in terms of the salary detail by Monday. But I am frustrated because for the second year in a row we were given a budget that was not balanced . And that's all I have for right now. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree with the concern s that have already been brought up. I certainly don't want to stay silent on this or I also don't want to rehash what's already been said. However , I do feel like we're proofreading a draft document when we should instead be looking at the final legislation and, you know, certainly you could expect the potential amendments or changes to be made but not in such a large scale. And if we weren't to catch some of these errors, then who would? So this is certainly problematic , something that we definitely need to correct for the future and find out where we went wrong in the process and how this could go more smoothly. But I do appreciate that we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 trying to get started earlier . We need to bump that further up to an earlier time and then I would like to continue with bringing department heads in future years because I think that's something that's been effective so far. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The budget process for the second year in the row has more holes in it than a piece of swiss cheese. And I'm not exaggerating . This has been a complete disaster on more than one level. First, the budget for the second year in a row is technically not balanced as my colleagues pointed out. Now, last year we might be able to chalk it up to a new mayor and a new administration . What is the excuse this year; a new business administrator ? I don't believe it. Mr. Deeley who is now the Network Systems Manager has his hands all over this budget. It's time for somebody in this building to get a calculator that works because you're putting all five members of Council at a huge disadvantage and especially the public. These are your tax dollars . And the budget as Councilman Donahue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 mention ed that's on our agenda tonight is not accurate . The numbers aren't accurate . And that's not bad enough. The columns on spreadsheets that we were given were missing. The detail for the Treasury Department was missing. Some pages are in this document twice. Some positions are listed as nonunion when they are, in fact, union and vice versa. We were handed a document tonight as soon as I came in that shows the police department budget is off by $325,000.63. Tonight we were handed this. The fire department is off by $155,008. What kind of operation are we running here? And again, I'm not exaggerating . If we can chalk this up to a simple mistake , hey, there's a number missing here, I could totally understand that. This is two years in a row. I've been on this Council for eight years. I've never seen anything more embarrassing in my entire life. And they should be embarrassed . Mr. West, the Mayor, everybody should be embarrassed for the budget that we were presented .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Now that wasn't bad enough that the numbers weren't correct . Let me talk for a minute about our office and the way our office was treated . The process of getting the budget to our office was rushed. It was piecemealed right until the very last minute. We were here past 4:30 on a Friday. That is a recipe for disaster and mistakes . Several line items there was nothing budgeted in 2021, yet money being spent ignoring the wishes of Council and the public. In years prior, a narrative was provided which detailed any major increase s and changes for each department . That was not included this year and could have prevented many question s that had to be posed. Last year was sloppy. This year is sloppier . Again, I have to be honest. This is the worst I've seen in eight years, in eight years. And again, chalk it up last year to a new administration . I could understand that. This year is totally unacceptable . And I have to point it out because it puts all of us in a very precarious position moving forward . Because now, this isn't correct . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 The police and fire department budget isn't correct . As Councilman Donahue said, he's looking at 5,000 spreadsheets. I'm looking at spreadsheets. We don't know what numbers are correct and incorrect . And they're all apparently going to have to change. Now, as for the budget itself, outside of all the correction s that we have, last year we made 55 amendments . This year, God knows how many we're going to have to make. Let's step back for a minute and take a look at where we are as a City. We are finally poised to exit Act 47 distressed status in January , 2022. And this is a good thing because we shed the label of being distress ed. But as everyone knows, it doesn't mean that we are out of the woods yet by any stretch of the imagination . Our recovery coordinator detailed in its most recent report that the City will still experience operating deficits through the 2022-2026 projection period. The annual expenditure growth is 2 percent . And this isn't news to anyone on Council or I'm sure anyone in the public. Our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 revenues remain relatively flat. The coordinator is recommend ing that the City increase its property tax millage by 20 percent for the years 2024 to 2026. That is reality . They also state that any expenditure reductions implement ed by the City during this period may reduce the percent age property tax millage rate's increase . The Mayor with the budget that she put forward absent all of the mistake s which there are many, has put forward a plan that I think extremely ill-advised , specifically with the hiring of 10 additional firemen through a SAFER Grant that will run out in three years. I was not impressed one bit with the answers I heard tonight from Chief Judge or Mr. West. All told, if this is allowed and this goes through , it adds well over a million dollars to our bottom line in year four, salaries , benefits , pension , on and on. Now, the concerning part for me is this will hit year four at the exact same time that the City would according to our own recovery coordinator be expected to raise taxes on the residents of our City. If we approve 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 the plan present ed today -- first of all, we approve a budget that is not balanced . But if we approve the budget today outside of it not being balanced , I could almost assure people that taxes will have to be raised higher than 20 percent over the next several years to cover the cost of all the additional personnel . Ambulance service , EMS service that's listed in the grant application to hire the additional firemen that's suppose d to sustain these positions , we didn't hear a peep out of them tonight on how that works. But yet, we're suppose d to approve this and say we'll figure it out in year four. Well, isn't that the same way that the City has gotten in the position that we're in now that 30 years later we're finally shedding distressed status because we said there's a grant. Let's take it. And let's not worry about year four. We'll figure -- according to Mr. West and Mr. Judge, we'll figure that out. We're having discussion s about it. Well, that's not what it says in the grant. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 that's concerning because what's being relayed to the federal government is not -- according to their words tonight reality . So I have grave concerns , grave concern s that we will be putting City taxpayers in a precarious financial position when the grant runs out. Now the conversation s that I've had they said, well, in year four we can furlough them. Well, who wants to be furloughed . In a perfect world anybody would like to add more public safety personnel . But we are not in a position financially according to the -- our own plan that we have from the recovery coordinator to do that. And if we were to do that, I think it would be a big mistake . The City's issue is lagging revenues and increasing legacy costs. The Mayor's plan will only compound the problem , only compound the problem . Now, they talk about retirements . There's a lot of maybes. Maybe this will happen. Maybe that will happen. Well, common sense tells you that if your plan is to add an ambulance service and you're going to add 3,000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 calls more per day in year four, how are you going to furlough 10 firemen ? You're going to need that extra personnel with all the different program s that they want to run here. Now, in addition to the plan -- the Mayor's plan to hire 10 additional firemen , she also plans on adding over a dozen new position , giving out raises to 39 employees that if you total everything up including the benefits adds up to over a million dollars . I understand the rational e with some of the raises. I've seen it over the last few years. I understand that some positions are under paid. Anyone who looks at this with a shred of common sense can see that. But I think that we need to be extremely careful when analyzing these new positions and raises and look not just to next year but similar to the SAFER Grant, look several years down the road. Can the City afford this? As Councilman Donahue has noted here correctly several times, can we sustain it? Everyone is aware in this building and in the City and around the country that the price of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 everything is going up with inflation . This doesn't change for city government . Costs go up. Legacy costs increase . Most of it is out of our control . So the question is, can we keep up with it? I think we need to be very careful we're not adding too many positions and raises at one time. I prefer to take a multiyear approach to any increase s and raises in nonunion staff which I think would be more pragmatic due to the sensitive nature of our financial condition here in the City. So over the next few weeks I plan to work closely with fellow Council members, the Mayor and her administration to make sure this budget is affordable for the residents of our City. Some may think I'm being too harsh in my initial assessment . You have to understand we all have full-time jobs outside of being Council members . This is not my full-time position . So for me to go through and look at this and find all of these mistake s when I have to make a very difficult decision on the financial future of the City is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 extremely frustrating , not just one year but for two years. So I don't know what goes on in the BA's office or what goes on in the IT Department that's being run by Carl Deeley, something has to change here. If this happens in year three in the private industry , people would be fired over this type of silly mistakes , silly mistakes that now we have to deal with and change. Anybody else?

We overspend on police and fire and we under spend on everything else. We can't continue to add staff to the fire department when we need to add staff to our DPW Department , when we need to add staff in the Business Administration office obviously , when we need to add staff to DPW, Parks and Quality of Life. We need home inspectors out there. Those -- that's where we need to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 talk about hiring staff. We can't continue to add to something that we already overpaid for. So for that reason I'm going to be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I also plan on voting no on this piece of legislation . I'm in agreement with many of the reasons already given. However , you know, I do want to make it clear that I want our City to be safe. I think it's important that our firefighter s, our police department are well staffed . We need them to be able to respond to calls. I feel like they are, you know, doing that and fulfilling expectations . I also think it's important that we're fiscally responsible as a city. And I don't see this as a fiscally responsible decision . I don't feel that there's been enough reasoning given for sustain ability in the future. When this grant does run out, there's no guarantee of getting another grant to pay for the firefighter s hired. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 And I just -- I'm thinking long terms -- long-term in reference to this piece. And I'm not in agreement at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, as Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I really, really, really wanted to vote yes tonight for this. I love providing opportunity for young men and women who live in the City and prepare them for a career in public safety. I had concerns . Some of them were answered. But my problem was, you know, clear sustain ability . I like the fact that, you know, in three years you could get another grant that would retain them as part of the process . I personally can't take that gamble on behalf of the stakeholders of the City. So I'm very sad to say I'm voting no for this because I was very hopeful . But I didn't get enough clear sustain ability presented tonight. MR. SCHUSTER : Also with me, there's many aspects of this plan that I could support . However , we have been given two separate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 justifications . With the budget right now, there's too many uncertainties for me to be able to support something at this point in time with -- I want to, you know, really put an emphasis on with no solid plan to sustain . I do encourage the fire department to look into maybe taking another pass at this into the future when there is a solid plan to sustain . But like I said, with too many uncertainties where we're at and the timing of this how it goes, I think right now it's going to be a time for me to make a tough choice now so Councils don't have to make tougher choices in the future such as furloughs and tax increases on our citizens . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I won't rehash everything because I've stated it a few minutes ago. The bottom line is as my colleagues stated, there's no clear plan to sustain these position s. Would we like to add more public safety personnel ? Of course, every city would. And I appreciate the job that our fire personnel currently do, but to add 10 more positions although it is under a grant and not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 have a clear plan in year four is playing Russian roulette with the City finances . It's a gamble. Too many hypothetical s. It's just not something that I could sign my name onto. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR.

GAUGHAN : This piece of legislation is currently tabled. I think we do intend to take it up before the end of the year. But we'd like to talk to the IT Department again before we consider it.
