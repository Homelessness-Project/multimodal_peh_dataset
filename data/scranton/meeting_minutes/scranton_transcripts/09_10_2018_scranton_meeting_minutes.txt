Before I start, I want to say welcome back, Kathy, and it's nice to see you here again. Kathy was out for awhile, she is back joining us and just our whole staff does a fantastic job. They are all the lifeblood that makes our office works so I just want to welcome you back, it's nice seeing you again. MS. CARRERA : Thank you. MR. PERRY: A couple of items, Mr. Spindler I think he had an issue about the fireworks and what's on our agenda tonight . Unfortunately , the legislation is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 -- it's only as good as the piece of paper it's written on if it's not being enforced . Some of the issues he spoke about with the fireworks situation in his neighborhood sounds like more of an enforcement problem. If there is already a law on the books that won't allow fireworks to be set off within 150 foot of any structure and that's not being honored then that sounds like an issue the police department that needs to come up and take care because there is already -- the way the legislation is written it's pretty stringent that fireworks cannot be set of off within 150 feet of any structure so that really limits it down, or on city property so you can't even go in a street, an alley, you can't go to a neighborhood park, all of these places are off limits to set off fireworks. So right now as this legislation stands if it's being followed and enforced I think it's good legislation . Some issues that were taken care of over the break that I haven't been able to update everybody on, there is a dangerous intersection at the 2600 block of Pittston 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Avenue. If anybody is unfamiliar with this situation it is where one lane turns into two lanes and what happened is if someone is coming up and they're not paying attention that one way if you are in the right-hand lane you just drive right up into oncoming traffic . There is some minor signs there but in my opinion and based on some of the accidents that have been over the years it's just not enough, so we did get PennDOT to give us some new signage , some new reflectors and just to make that more of in your face to drivers of oncoming traffic . They are also going to do a study there to see if there absolutely needs to be more enforce ment done and just more make the traffic more aware of the upcoming situation . So I'll keep you guys updated on that, but as of right now there is going to be some updated larger signs with reflectors at that intersection . Also, some basin rain has been terrible , terrible and, you know, our infrastructure for handling it is not very good. We just aren't -- we just cannot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 handle it and the stuff that we have needs to be cleaned out and cleaned out regularly . There has been two basins that I know have been taken care of that have come to my attention , one was in Powell Court, that was taken care of two days before this weather hit, that rain, and the people there were very thankful because that was -- when I took a look at that not only was it blocked but it was just right up to the grate. The whole thing was just covered and it was in a back alley, it was probably out of sight, out of mind type of situation and the citizens there and the residents just put up with that for too long, and I'm glad they were able to pick up the phone and talk to us, American Water Company was out there quick to take care of it because it was part of their responsibility , and it was taken care of and did some follow-up during the rain and they didn't have any flooding issues in that particular part. Also, there has been a drain basin issue that has been fixed on Church Street, again, the water company was out there to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 take of that. And there is also a follow-up item that I will have more information on when I get it, there needs to be some milling done on that street to offset just the way the road lies it kind of tends to pool water off in one section or away from the drainage , so even thought the drain is open there might still be a stagnant water situation so once I get an update on DPW on the millage of that street I'll make sure to pass that on. On our agenda tonight I'm very happy to see some legislation on the street sign project . I'm glad to see this going forward as we all talk about it, we all know it's something that needed to be do and I'm hoping within the next couple of months to get the street project off the ground and get some of these signs changed . You know, just for instance my wife is from the Pittston area and sometimes we go to visit family and I'll tell you what those signs are fantastic . They are brand new, they are up, they are out there, I don't know my way around there but I can look at a street sign 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 and know exactly where I'm going and what street I'm on. That's the type of street signs and just the infrastructure that we need for our citizens and our visitors in this city because right now, you know, I'll be the first to say I think it's a disgrace . I'll even go in parts of the city I do know, the upper South Side or West Side, you know, they just need to be there. It's just something , it's a basic city service that I this I think we need to provide . What else do we have, there is so much going on. Okay, so I haven't weighed in official ly on the coffee shop situation that I think has been going on. Now, let me tell you this, it's been in the paper, there has been many articles about it. As we know, our LIPS director , Mr. Hinton, wants to open a coffee shop in the old boathouse in Nay Aug. That has been going back and forth with us and it appears that -- in his application all of the checks, you know, they might have hit the right boxes, but the legality of it at the moment it looks like his application was filled out correctly , it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 was announced correctly , he did everything he needed to do to take care of this. With that being said, I still think it's bad optics. You know, there is an eyeball test to everything and when you see a city employee getting in business with the city, you know, that always raises a red flag and concern . So while it appears that everything was done correctly , and I say appears because I have been -- we have been bouncing this off our solicitor back and forth, it just doesn't pass the optic test for me, that's what I'm saying, and I'm for, and I know Mr. Gaughan and several of the council men will bring this up as well, but I'm definitely in favor of any kind of ethic code amendment that we need to do because , you know, there is some things just -- some things just don't sit right and this is one that just doesn't pass the optic test or the eyeball test to me. Lastly, I know Mr. Rogan hit on this with September 11 tomorrow , again, guys, let's just keep the family of fallen in our thoughts , you know, I send all of my love I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 have to those families and what a horrific day that we all remember . It was one of those flash bulb memory days where we remember everything we were doing that morning and, again, just to show you that, you know, the first responders , God bless them, they are out there. They don't know who you are and you don't know who they are, but they will be there for you in a second and they be willing to give their lives to help you, so let's all remember that and, again, let's never forget the tragedy that fell on us September 11. That's all I have today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to quickly follow-up on what Marie brought up with the storm drains. Mrs. Reed, would be able to send a request to DPW asking for a list of all storm drains that they are responsible for? Also, regarding Mr. Hinton's proposed coffee shop at Nay Aug Park, this whole legal back and forth is just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 ridiculous to me. In my opinion it doesn't matter whether the state ethics code preempts the city's or not, the City of Scranton has an ethics code and it should be followed . Either Mr. Hinton wants to be the Director of Licensing and Inspection or he wants to run a coffee shop. It's my opinion that he should not be permitted to do both but that's a decision that will ultimately fall on the mayor. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yeah. Touching on that subject on the Nay Aug Park issue, at council 's request we asked our solicitor for an opinion if there is a conflict between the city's ethics code and the code adopted by the state. So in typical bureaucratic fashion the state authored an ethics code in 1998 and then put in a caveat that if a city code was enacted prior to 1998, and ours was in 1976, then the state code supercedes the local code. However , if the city code was enacted after 1998, even if it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 restrictive , then it would become the code that guides the city. Typical government nonsense . With that said, I would be in favor of amending our code, even slightly amending it, effectively creating a new code and allowing Scranton 's more restrictive code to take precedent or reviewing the recent ordinance like the one from the city of Reading that Councilman Gaughan brought to our attention during our caucus. Although it won't effect this matter, it will clear up any future questions as to what code should be used. But, quite frankly , all of this is just corrective action. In my simplistic viewpoint , I really don't care, as Councilman Donahue said, that the current code is not what legally binds this issue. To me, it doesn't matter if this issue was determined to be legal. Something being legal, something adhering to the letter of the law does not always make it the right thing to do. We are elected officials and along with appointed officials as well as employees of the city, particular ly cabinet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 members , we should be held to a different standard , to a higher standard . What guides us shouldn 't be if something is legal to do, what should always guide is if something is the right thing to do. In all honesty , I'm extremely disappointed that the mayor has allowed this ever to get this far. At the end of the day, the mayor must decide if he wants the members of his cabinet be fully dedicated to their position with the city or if they should be allowed to seek outside business opportunities using city assets. On the storm water issue, obviously , this was a big topic for discussion tonight , the storms of August clearly showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are not prepared as a city to deal with storm water with the present arrange ment. There is no doubt that city employees responded the best they could to the severe emergency conditions , but we need a plan and we need it now. So I'm requesting that the representatives of Arcadis finally be invited to a public caucus or possibly a work session in the very near future to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 discuss the status of the study that they have been working on for months and months and months to give us a some preliminary findings and hopefully creat a dialogue that will allow us to get all on the same page to get this thing done. I remain confident that we can ultimately can come up with a long time plan that will be proactive instead of reactive in our handling of the storm water. The clock is ticking . Our friends , our neighbors and our family members have been affected by storm water and our suffering so we need to act and we need to act soon. One final subject , I want to talk a little bit about the Scranton bypass to Clarks Summit. This is the $170 million Scranton bypass as proposed by the turnpike commission and PennDOT , in my opinion , we do not need another ill conceived and unnecessary road construction project . They are asking all of us to buy into a project that will be taking people's homes, most likely not to pay for itself ever. It will not create additional growth opportunities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 and as a project takes traffic away from the City of Scranton and that is never a good thing for the current or future economic growth of the city. Again, all of this to save a few minutes on a morning or evening commute for a few people. If there is $170 million laying around in available funds, we should not be creating and expanding the highway system, we should be rebuilding our existing roads and bridges and infrastructure . If there is $170 million around, I'm sure the City of Scranton could identify many projects , including storm water, that would rebuild our existing infrastructure without the need to build one new road. We can even dedicate some of that undoing to many wrong headed decisions on some of the state roads within the city, roads were are designed to move cars quickly through our downtown and neighborhoods at the peril of pedestrians and even the few bicyclist s that will brave our streets . So to our neighbors in Clarks Summit who may lose your homes in the name of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 questionable progress , I want you to know that I stand with you on this issue. That's all I have tonight . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First of all, I want to congratulate Councilman Rogan on the birth of his daughter and wish him and his wife and new daughter all of the best. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Just a couple of citizens ' request s over the month of August. 1207 North Main Avenue, Mrs. Reed, can we double check again if this property is on demolition list and if so when is it scheduled to be demolished ? I have been in contact with one resident that lives right next door and the hole has opened up on the border of this property and it's become very dangerous and the house is in horrible condition . He has told it was on the demolition list but we just need to confirm that. Also, Mrs. Ann Robinson , who has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 come to these meetings several times about 803-805-808 and 809 Hampton Street in West Scranton , 808 and 809 are listed as vacant lots. She has complained numerous times that the lots are not being taken care of, so I have reached out to Ralph Pappas from the county to see if there is any way we can get those placed in the land back. Just to touch on storm water for a minute, I have several questions on the Merrifield Avenue pumping station , right after the storm flooded in August I met with some residents in that area and to say that, you know, there were devastated is an understatement , and this isn't anything new. Every time we get a heavy rain they get absolutely -- their houses get flooded . It's unbelievable . So I would like to know about the Merrifield pumping station . Number one, what kind of maintenance is done at that pumping station and when is it done? Has there been any testing done on the pumping station ? How frequently is that done? And who is trained on running this pumping 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 station ? What is the city's plan? You know, we are talking up here about storm water for the last three years, and Councilman Evans brought up the Arcadis study. Now, I got an e-mail from -- because I have been asking about this from Mr. Bulzoni , and it looks to me that he is saying we are not going to see anything until at least 2019. Once we confirm that they can do the mapping , according to this e-mail and Anthony Dill from Arcadis who doing the study, it's going to take approximately two to three months to complete the digitizing work. Once that is complete , they have to do an analysis of the rate and credit and appeals policy so that has to be to developed , billing options , and that's going to take an additional three months to complete from my understanding reading this e-mail. So I agree with Mr. Evans that, you know, we were told two years ago that this thing was going to take nine months and two years later we are still in the same position , so I do think we need a caucus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 with all of the individuals involved so that we can get an update and get a handle on this because I don't think we are moving fast enough or in the right direction . I also think based on my conversations over the last month with really the residents in every section of the city, we need a public meeting or a public caucus on the recent storm and the city's response because I do not fault the fire department , I think they did a great job, the police department or DPW, but there definitely was a communications breakdown someplace , and I'll give you one example . People have experienced thousands of dollars of damage in basements and in their homes and I asked multiple times, asked the mayor's office, who from the city is going out and assessing this damage, how is that being done, what is the process , because we can get reimbursed by the state. I still have not gotten an answer on that, so I don't know if there is a plan or if anything is being done or what the case is, but I had several questions , and Councilman Donahue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 brought one of these up in the caucus earlier , who is in charge of emergency management in the city, who coordinates these efforts ? So when we have a major emergency like the flood who is getting information out to residents ? You know, in my opinion there should have been a press conference , there should have been something in the newspaper, in the news media telling people where to go, what to do, where to file this paperwork that's so important . Who is trained to operate the levy system? Are the gates tested? We had several questions about that. And how much damage in dollar amount was there from the recent storm and are we submitting this information to PEMA, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Association -- or agency? And how does this process work? How are residents supposed to know where to go for help and does damage that occurred to an individual homeowner factor into the assessment ? So I think that we need a clear handle on this I would like to have a public caucus so we can get answers . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Mr. Norton, who came earlier , I have been in contact with him and the Pennsylvania American Water Company is, again, the 1100 blocks of Rundell Street and really from South Main Avenue from St. Ann's Street all the way down to Loomis Avenue the storm drains are clearly inefficient to handle storm water here in heavy rain events. So, again, I asked Mrs. Reed earlier , we need a meeting with the water company and with city officials to find out what the remedy for that situation is. Mr. Srebro and Mr. Besko, who have come here multiple times with their issues of flooding in Keyser Valley, tried to set up a meeting with them and the city engineer and the mayor. I sent a letter, no reply, for the last few weeks. I did receive an e-mail or was copies on an e-mail from Mr. Pocius to Kay Garvey, the mayor's secretary , and Mrs. Reed, August 24, that states that Mr. Pocius did meet with Mr. Besko and he is doing research on the information that Mr. Besko provided and he will get back to him with his findings . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Mr. Evans brought up a program , and It think it's so important and it will be so beneficial to the city, the See, Click, Fix initiative so if we, as a council , send a letter again to the mayor to find out, number one, if he is onboard with this idea or not, and if he is on board with it are we, you know, moving forward with it or aren't we because it's been months now since Mr. Evans had brought that information to this council . We had a public caucus on it and the presentation and I think, quite frankly , that it would allow the city to hold our departments accountable and it would provide great communication between the government and the people. Now, onto the coffee shop business with Mr. Hinton. While we are on recess during the month of August there was an article in the Scranton Times regarding Mr. Hinton, who is the director of Licensing , Inspections and Permits, and the article had to do with Mr. Hinton entering into a lease in July of 2017 with the Scranton Recreation Authority to run a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 coffee shop out of the building at Nay Aug Park. The lease is for 12 years with the first two years being rent free and then $3,000 a year thereafter . First of all, let me say that, you know, I think this idea might be a good one in all reality , just not with a member of the mayor's cabinet running it, especially the director of the Licensing , Inspections and Permits. I have to preface my comments tonight by saying this is not anything personal against Mr. Hinton, but the mere appearance of a city employee using the building on city property at a city-owned park to run a coffee shop should have been enough for Mayor Courtright and members of the Recreation Authority Board to say no way to this idea. The mayor has been silent on this issue. I approached him, I called his office, sent an e-mail, no reply, and then I approached him up at McLane Park for a grand opening of the park a few weeks ago and he told me it was a personnel issue and he walked away from me. This shouldn 't be a surprise to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 anyone who has been following city government over the last five years. The mayor is using the excuse that this is a personnel issue. Ladies and gentlemen , that is absolutely ridiculous . Mr. Hinton is not covered under any bargaining unit, he serves at the pleasure of the mayor and his cabinet . Therefore , this is the mayor's problem . If this was so transparent , why didn't anyone on the council besides I think Mr. Evans know about it? If this was so transparent and the mayor believed that he should open up something , a coffee shop in that building at Nay Aug Park, why wasn't there a major public announcement , a press conference , a press release? Some communication between the mayor, the Recreation Authority and city council ? There was zero. Zip. So, again, they talk about transparency , I don't see it. The city's ethics code is very, very clear on this issue and I did ask our solicitor to provide his opinion on whether Mr. Hinton violated any portion of the city's ethics code and Mr. Minora agreed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 that he did violate the city's ethics code. You know, there is a question obviously about of whether or not the state ethics code preempts the city's ethics code, but regardless , as my colleagues said, of any of that, this is not right. The question of the legality of it is still unclear , but it doesn't make it right, it's my opinion still unethical . That we have a city employee using city property to run a coffee shop. Now, Mr. Hinton's counsel sent me a letter, and I'd just like to go through this very quickly . He makes several points in this letter addressing my concern about the ethics -- possible ethics violations . His council says, "No person from the public, city council or the authority raised any objection to the lease agreement prior to its execution ." My response to that would how would we provide an objection when we didn't know about it -- or at least I didn't know about it until I ready it in the paper. It also says Mr. Hinton met with council and Wayne Evans, which he just addressed as a former 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 conversation and to discuss his plans, apparently this is supposed to be enough to satisfy the disclosure requirement in our ethics code. He should have disclosed it to the full council , not just one member. It also says no person objected to his plans or the lease nor did anyone advise him they thought the lease was violating the City of Scranton 's Ethics Code. That should have been up to, number one, the solicitor of the Recreation Authority , and Mr. Hinton. The State Ethics Commission always commits to giving advisory opinions on these type of issues and so would the Ethics Board and they did not do that. He also says Mr. Hinton has already spent considerable funds on the rehabilitation of the property after execution of the lease. Nobody from the City of Scranton or the city council objected while Mr. Hinton spent thousands of dollars and countless hours of labor during his off hours to renovate the property . Again, how would we have known even to object. I would have objected to this the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 moment that I knew about it. He also says in his letter to me that many public officials have side business or second jobs that don't interfere with their public jobs, and I can understand and that and that is true, everyone up here has a second job, it's just not running a coffee shop out of a public building on public land. He also says that Mr. Hinton acknowledges being a public official warrants close scrutiny of his conduct. Council should withhold judgment on this transaction until it learns all of the facts. Now, his counsel says that and I asked Mr. Hinton and I have a letter here that I sent a few weeks ago. Mr. Hinton's reply to my letter in e-mail to Mrs. Reed, our city clerk, is really arrogant and troubling . He says in his e-mail to Mrs. Reed he is more than happy to talk to -- or have me talk to his attorney , and also was more than welcome to stop for a coffee when his shop is open. This is not only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 extremely arrogant but it's completely unprofessional and unbecoming of a cabinet member of the City of Scranton , but it is not surprising . Mr. Hinton has a history of being arrogant and, quite frankly , aloof in his position as Licensing and Inspections director , and let me reference a recent decision and a recent newspaper article with the headline, "Judge rules Scranton revoking of contractor 's license without a hearing violated due process rights." I just want to read very quickly from a hearing in Federal Court. "In January of 2014, Patrick Hinton was appointed to serve as the director of Licensing , Inspections and Permits for the City of Scranton . Prior to accepting this position , Hinton had work as a drug and alcohol counselor and as a wellness coordinator for the Scranton School district . Hinton had no previous direct work experience with the Department of Licensing , Inspections and Permits before assuming the position of director of that office. Owing to this lack of prior 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 experience , Hinton also began his tenure as director the Department of Licensing , Inspections and Permits without the benefit of a comprehensive institution al background and knowledge regarding the operation s of that office. Thus, from more than a year after he assumed these duties, Hinton was unaware of material information pertaining to the city's licensing and license revocation procedures --" and then it goes on to list all of these examples . "Finally , Hinton was not informed that the city's own ordinance s called for graduated penalties for contractors beginning with suspension of licenses before proceeding to license revocation s. This is a matter that's in Federal Court and in my estimation it's going to cost the city a ton of money. So the bottom line here is that, you know, the fact that the mayor would hire someone for this important position because he is a political ally rather than a competent , qualified individual who knows what he is doing in that position is, quite frankly , a disgrace and there have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 other instances from my understanding where the city has lost at the magisterial level and Mr. Hinton is costing the city money. In light of Mr. Hinton's coffee shop deal, Mayor Courtright 's silence and utter disregard for our ethics code I decided and I talked to my colleagues in the caucus that it's time for the city's ethics code to be updated and to be expanded. So over the past few weeks I have looked at how other cities across Pennsylvania deal with their ethics. I found Reading , Pennsylvania 's Ethics Code to be extremely comprehensive and well written . I provided a copy of that ordinance to my colleagues and to Solicitor Minora in the caucus tonight . I also last week spoke to Mr. Ed Stock, who was an attorney for the Reading Ethics Board and we discussed how their system works. So I would like to use their ethics code as a model and as a guide for updating our ethics code, and I would like to read for a second what their ethics code says right in the first paragraph . Their declaration of policy says the following : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 "The proper operation of a democratic government requires that public officials and employees be independent , impartial and responsible to the people. That government decisions and policy be made in the proper channels of governmental structure that public office not be used for personal gain and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government . Each official or employee of the city must be constant ly on guard in its conflict of interest . No official or employee should be involved in any activity which might be seen as conflicting with his or her responsibilities to the city. The people of Reading have a right to expect that their representatives act with independence and fairness to all groups and not favor a few individuals or themselves ." So there is one or two paragraphs that I would like included in our updated ethics code and I think that applies partly to the situation that we find ourselves in with Mr. Hinton. And, again, let me say about my comments , this is not a personal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 vendetta . Mr. Hinton in his e-mail said this was a personal vendetta against him by myself. This is not a personal vendetta . I would be bringing this issue up if it was any other employee in city hall. Ladies and gentlemen , this, as my colleagues have said tonight , is not right. Now, one of the most interesting parts of in Reading 's Code of Ethics, was the inclusion of campaign finance reform and I also mentioned in the caucus tonight that as a part of our updating of the ethics code and I really think we should include campaign finances reform as a part of that. The perception that the people have in the City of Scranton in my experience over the last five years is that our government relies heavily on pay-to-play politics . The way that it usually works, in my estimation , is that lawyers flood the mayor's campaign coffers , not just Mayor Courtright , but mayors going back decades , and then they line their pockets with taxpayer money and eventually land some kind of legal work. People have grown tired not just in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Scranton , but across the country of a small group of people who can write large checks having so much influence and control over elected official s. We need to look no further than the recent sewer sale here in the City of Scranton . Mr. Abrahamsen , who sued a member of council over asking for receipts , $200,000 payments for the Parking Authority deal and the Sewer Authority deal and he is the mayor's -- one of his largest campaign donors. This perception that Scranton 's motto is "It's not what you know it's who you know" is bad for business . What do outside businesses think if they might be interested in moving here when they read our local newspaper and see all of the different antics that go on in their mind? It's my belief that it is time to put the power and influence back into the hands of the average middle class citizen . Those people who don't have enough money to write a $500,000 check but who would still like the ear of local politicians , so I'm proposing that we follow Readings lead and that we set limits for campaign 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 contributions in the City of Scranton . For too long it has been open season for deep pocket donors and special interest s in this area and it is time for that to end. As I mentioned to my colleagues and shared with them, some of the campaign limits, I won't go through all of them, but what this would do is set a limit for campaign contributors for both election years and non-election years, so for individuals you would only be able to donate to a candidate up to $2,600 and so on and so forth. So, again, I think we are putting the power back into the people's hands. So at this time, I'd like to make a motion that city council directs Attorney Minora to draft legislation amending and updating the City of Scranton 's Ethics Code to also include campaign finance reform. MR. DONAHUE : I'll second that motion. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , I would ask that we use Reading 's Ethics Code and campaign finances reform as a model and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 a guide that we follow the spirit of that law. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : On the question real quick, I would just like to say that I just couldn't agree with the comments that Mr. Gaughan just made. MR. ROGAN: Any else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : And, finally , just another matter of concern when we talk about our own Board of Ethics, when you look at what Reading does they take their Code of Ethics seriously . They convene I believe in June or July. They announce or elect a chairperson and vice chairperson and there several mechanisms in here that clearly show that Reading takes campaign finance reform and ethics seriously . The way that we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 it currently set up I don't think we are taking ethics serious ly in the City of Scranton . For example , last year I had inquired with the mayor's office on why the terms of all of the people who are currently listed on the City of Scranton 's Board of Ethics have expired . I never got an answer to that question , so we have five people who are appointed by the mayor to the Ethics Board and all of their terms have expired . Back in 2001 as an addition to the research that I did, notice was given that the Board of Ethics in May of 2001, had been appointed , form and convened and then it lists all of the different mechanisms that you can take to file a claim. To my knowledge , that's never been done so I don't even know if the current board that we have is even legitimate . So, again, I do think that is so important . I look forward to working with Solicitor Minora and my colleagues to updating this ethics code and finally in the City of Scranton taking ethics seriously . Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just TWO items I wanted to bring up, we did receive the report from Dave Bulzoni last month. If you recall, about a year or so ago Councilman Evans and myself worked with the Neighbor Works to put together a first time homebuyer's program when they could also use this money for down payments assistance or for rehabilitation . We did receive a report in August and it lists so far there has been 33 applicants who had applied for this program and the vast majority of them have already closed and they are right in our community , a number of them in West Side, a lot in West Side, South Scranton , North Scranton , the Hill, so this program really is a huge success so far and I think it's something we need to continue to fund, hopefully fund it on an increased level, which is great. These are many of the streets and neighborhoods within our city that do need that little bit of a facelift where people could get a little bit of money to fix up their homes when they're buying them and it puts properties in the hands of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 homeowners instead of possibly as out-of-town landlords that may be coming in and purchasing the properties otherwise . So this is very good news. It's something I think we need to continue to fund and continue to push. Lastly, I just want to comment , Councilman Evans brought up the Scranton bypass. I wasn't planning on addressing this issue, but I have to disagree with some of what was mentioned , many of us who live in the City of Scranton dread that travel on Interstate 81 so something certainly needs to be done. Personally I think widening the road to three or four lanes would be a better solution than having a bypass around the city, but something needs to be done. Anyone who travels that road knows how much of a disaster it is, it's impossible to get around. It's probably one of the most frequent complaints that I hear from people in our area is the amount of congestion on interstate 81 so something certainly needs to be done. I think a bypass should be explored , I'm not saying I'm for it, but I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 saying it's something that should certainly be explored and if that's the only way to alleviate a lot of that traffic on Interstate 81 it's something that should move forward . Like I said, I would prefer to see the road widened so traffic can move through quickly. MR. PERRY: And to chime in on that as well, I'm not sure why they want to spend $170 million when they can just repair the Northeast extension on the turnpike and make it free and that would go from Pittston to Clarks Summit, the road is already there. I'm just saying. MR. DONAHUE : I did attend the public hearing that was held in council chambers in August about them closing down to do light repairs , closing down on Moosic Street exit, and one of the things that was brought up in that hearing was that bid work for -- bid work for a redesign of the entire highway has just gone out. I mean, that's not -- the way it was explained it's still eight to 10 years down the road but they did -- PennDOT did put out requests for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 proposals to get complete redesign from the Luzerne County line at least through Dunmore . MR. ROGAN: And that's the worst part, too. I know that all of the new bridges that went in are designed to hold at least three lanes of traffic , which is good. Unfortunate ly, infrastructure does take time, eight to ten years is long time to wait so anything that could be done to alleviate the problem I think is certainly warranted . That is all. MS.

EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I do have a question about this and I brought it up in the caucus, I remember that with the city's 2018 paving project a lot of these streets were on there so I'm assuming that they were taken off so if we could get an update on the city's paving project and get a clarification on that so that is why we are asking for grant funding because we took those off the original list? Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Just to reiterate , I know I spoke about this before, this development has some of the worst roads within our city and they also pay some of the highest taxes in the city so this is long overdue for the folks who live in the Fawnwood section .

EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: Yes, on the question , we discussed this in caucus as well, but I do have several questions on this. I would like to, if we could, have Mr. Bulzoni come into a caucus and go through some of these questions . One of the questions that I have is in his memo he says that as a budgetary consideration the city may contemplate staffing need since the sign inventory is now managed by one full-time and one part-time employee , so I would like a better understanding as we approach the 2019 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 budget, I mean, we are getting close enough where I think we can assume that that is either going to be in there or not in there so I would like to know that before we delve into this, and then we are also seeking a DCED multi-modal transportation grant to fund 70 percent of the project so our match if we got the grant would be roughly . $81,200. If we don't get the grant I think we are just going to fund the entire cost out of our debt service account fund balance so that would require council approval so I have some questions about that as well so I think Mr. Bulzoni could probably clear a loot of that. And I would like to hear from the DPW on this and what their thoughts are, especially I know Gene Reed has been running the sign department for the last number of years so he would have a lot of experience in that, so if we could set that up in the next week or two that would be great.
