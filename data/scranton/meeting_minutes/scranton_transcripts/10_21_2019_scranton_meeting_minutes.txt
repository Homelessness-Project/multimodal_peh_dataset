CHECK RECEIVED IN THE AMOUNT OF $500.00 FROM HARRISON HOUSE PERSONAL CARE HOME, WHICH IS PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 If not, received and filed. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to make a motion to table Item 7-A. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Item 7-A is the legislation where the City or Council is going to adopt the contract with Barry Isett and Associates to complete a service assessment for a review of the Licensing , Permits and Inspections Department . I'm making this motion to table this legislation for a few different reasons one of which after reviewing the contract I think it may be open-ended. I talked to the Business Administrator and one of the things that we discussed was possibly a rebidding this contract and asking the companies for a fixed cost. This contract runs for two years, 2019 to 2021. My concern is that we're leaving ourselves open with hourly rates. And the other reason why I wanted to table this is in looking at the other contract , the other proposal , one of the things in there which we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 have all talked about in terms of Licensing and Inspections is the technology component . One of the complaints that we have received time and time again from the public in regards to the Licensing and Inspections Department is that you can't do anything online. You can't get a permit online. You can't file anything online. You have to physically come down to the office, pay for permits . Within the SAFEBuilt proposal which is the one that the City did not choose there is a technology component in the form of software that this company would offer for no cost. So I think that we should look at that more closely before we make a decision . So for those reasons I ask my colleagues if they would table this legislation . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: We did discuss this in caucus. This will be a one week tabling and then we'll have it back up for a up or down vote next week. This is a very important piece of legislation . So we do need to have a vote on it. But an additional week to get some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 questions answered is warranted . All those in favor signify by saying aye. ALL MEMBERS : Aye. Opposed? The ayes have it and so moved. Do any Council members have announcement s to make? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I have one. The City of Scranton is preparing their Five Year Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plan and its analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. As part of the planning process , the City is conducting a survey to identify residents ' needs in the community and ideas on what City residents would like to see funds used for. Please take a few minutes if you haven't already and complete the survey which can be found at the top of the City's website Scranton PA dot gov. MR. ROGAN: One announcement , Council recently placed an ad in the newspaper for an alternative member of the Zoning Board of Appeals . If any resident would be interested in being considered as an alternate zoning board member, kindly submit a letter of interest or resume to the Office of the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Clerk no later than Wednesday , October 30th, 2019. ATTY. MINORA: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items and matters of general concern : Joan Hodowanitz David Yarros Sue Verrone Theresa Roberts Marie Schumacher Ron Ellman Bob Bolus Dave Dobrzyn ATTY. MINORA: 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to answer Joan's question about the audit, when I asked about that last week I was told hopefully by November 1st. So I did mention to Mayor Evans that maybe we should consider putting our bids together for next year's audit now to try to speed up that process so we already have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 bids in and we just have to approve it. On Mrs. Schumacher 's -- Marie's comment for cleaning out the creek beds, that's actually done by FEMA and PEMA in relation to the flooding from last year. So they could control that to clear out any creek beds that were disturbed because of that flooding. So they do it in conjunction with the City because the City has to go through and justify all the funding. But it's really FEMA and PEMA that are putting out those bids. Council woman Dempsey and myself attended the Plot Neighborhood meeting about a week and a half ago. They passed along a few complaints . Those include several large pothole s on Race Street between Shawnee and Comegys and on Brown Avenue and also on Amelia Avenue between Parker Street and Bates Street. It was also reported that there is a missing stop sign on Brighton Avenue where Brighton wraps around to meet Finn Street. And they also passed along complaint s about tractor -trailers being parked mostly on Shawnee Avenue and other surrounding streets at night with the motor still running .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 They're unsure if the drivers are using it as a spot to sleep at night, but the noise from the tractor -trailer s is disturbing the peace of the neighborhood . I will be forwarding along those complaints to the proper department s. A couple other complaint I received in the past week I will also be forwarding along include one from residents of Jackson Heights of a dangerous situation in front of St. Lucy's church where cars are speeding around the bend where Scranton Street and St. Frances Cabrini Avenue meet. Residents feel it's a dangerous situation as they are trying to pull out of the parking lot for Jackson Heights while cars are speeding around that bend. I've also gotten a few complaint s about storm drains collapsing into the road, one is on the corner of Pierce Street and North Main Avenue. And the other is on Gerard Drive where the sidewalk is actually collapsing in. So I will be forward ing those along to the proper departments this week as well. Now, on the issue with Sewer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Authority easement s, I actually decided to run for Council in the first place mainly because of my dissatisfaction with the way the sewer sale was handled. It was my opinion then and that opinion still holds true today that the sewer system should not have been sold until this easement issue is settled and also until the City developed a plan on how to handle stormwater . And here we are three years later and these easements still have not been secured and we don't have a plan for stormwater . It is absolutely completely unacceptable. It is clear as can be that the major beneficiaries of this whole deal were the lawyers who were paid millions of dollars to handle the deal. I also agreed at the time with the request by the previous Council to ask the Sewer Authority to request the Auditor General to come in and review the sale in its entirety. Unfortunately , the Sewer Authority Board shot that request down. Given everything that has transpired regarding the former Mayor, I believe the Sewer Authority Board should reconsider that request . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 I am pleased that Attorney Shrive has agreed to come in next week to answer Council 's questions regarding this easement issue because I also have a few questions including how many easement s have been secured to date? How many still need to be secured ? Also what outside attorneys have been hired to secure these easements and what have they been paid since the close of sale. These are all important questions and I'm hopeful that Attorney Shrive could answer those questions for us next week. Finally on the continuing fiasco involving the gas cards, I have been saying for the last four years that the City of Scranton needs to fundamentally change the way it does business . The revelations over the last few months are definitive proof that the City's financial controls and internal oversight need to be improved immediately . For too long City employees were able to run amok and do what they please because they were well aware of the lack of internal controls and oversight in place to actually hold them accountable . It's important 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 to mention that there may have been justifiable reasons for the amounts cited in yesterday 's paper. But if there was proper justification it needs to be properly explained and documented . And that bring us to back to the question of why the City does not have a fleet manager . According to the City vehicle list Council man Gaughan and myself were provided over a year ago, the City has 277 vehicle s in its fleet, which includes everything from fire trucks, police cruisers and motorcycle s to garbage trucks, backhoes and trailers . Without a fleet manager , who is responsible for overseeing all of those vehicles ? This Council requested an audit of the Gas Card Program because we wanted to rely on an expert to come in and determine what, if any, control s are currently in place and what we need to do to strengthen those controls . That audit had to be put out to bid for 30 days and those bids are set to be opened on November 1st. Since that is not enough time to post on Council 's agenda for our meeting on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 November 4th, we should consider holding a special meeting either late in the week of the fourth or the following week of the 11th to pass the legislation with emergency certificate so the company with the lowest bid could be hired sooner than later so they could get to work immediately . Otherwise , if we're going to follow our normal procedure we wouldn't be passing legislation for this audit to actually being until November 25th after we were to introduce it on November 18th. I also believe the Administration should also reach out to the Auditor General 's Office to see if they could be of any assistance in looking into and reviewing internal controls of the Gas Card Program . In the meantime , the Administration should provide Council with an update on any and all new procedures and/or policies put in place since this issue arose and -- any justification and/or explanation of the irregular charges already brought to light by the Scranton Times. And that's all I have for this evening .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Attorney Minora, I know you said you had something to -- ATTY. MINORA: Yes, Attorney Dempsey , she asked that some of her remarks be made part of the record. So I will give them to Kathy so that they could be recorded . (The following are Attorney Dempsey 's remarks given to Attorney Minora.) 1. Spoke to Mr. Bulzoni and the expected date for the final audit remains 12/1/19. The reason for the delay remains consistent with my prior explanation in that he advised me that Kohanski is a new auditing firm and there is additional delay in the inputting of information . If that is accurate , which I have absolutely no reason to doubt, I would not expect this type of delay next year which is hopefully the good news. 2. The budget remains in the same timetable — due to PEL — in preliminary form by 10/18/19. I have not been provided a copy of what was sent to PEL, as of the writing of these notes, 10/17/19. 3. NRS Update — I participated in a meeting in the Mayor's office. The1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 city relayed to NRS that we are selecting 12/31/19 as the date to officially end our relationship with NRS. There was also ample discussion about the transfer of data from NRS to the City and that may actually end up being more complicated that I originally thought due to the different programs and due to what appears to be a lack of full automation on the City's behalf. I hope this can be rectified asap. The matter is now is the hands of the City Solicitor to deal with NRS as we transition and to fine tune the details of an agreement and also in the hands of the IT people from both sides to hopefully make this transfer as seamless , timely and efficient as possible . We were unable to pick a quicker date for two reasons , (1) Per Mr. Bulzoni , the City needs the continuing monthly revenue available to us especially at the end of the year (which I cannot argue with) and (2) the data transfer — in and of itself is unfortunately going to take time and require some logistics on both ends. Our next step in handling these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 refuse delinquencies is to put out a new RFQ for someone to assist the City in collecting the "delinquent " refuse fees going forward . Having had conversations with the Mayor and the City Solicitor we are thinking of writing the RFQ to mandate the inclusion of lawyers and/or a legal team of some sort, who can go to court almost automatically in the future, so that these delays do not continue to exist in the fashion that they currently do and also, so that the people who are the greatest offenders on that delinquent list are caught earlier . Also, so that once hired, this new group can aggressively go after the all delinquent refuse fees. As everyone knows, this has been a pet peeve of mine since my arrival to Council and I remain confident that we are moving in the right direction here. I thank Mayor Evans for his leadership in this regard. 4. I attended the Plot Neighborhood Meeting with Mr. Donahue and continue to find that all neighborhoods share the same sort of problems . They were concerned with Blight, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 traffic issues, neighborhood nuisances etc. I was impressed with the group and the leadership - they are a passionate group of people and love their neighborhood as we all do which is one of the reasons that this City remains a great place to live. 5. I attended a tour of the Boys and Girls Club in Scranton with Mayor Evans, Mr. Donahue and Mary Pat Ward from OECD. I was impressed with their services and their commitment to this community . My hat goes off to all nonprofits in this City especially those that continue to serve our most vulnerable populations , the homeless , those struggling with income, the elderly and of course, our children . 6. Kathy - I have two people who are waiting on crosswalks and some signage out on Green Ridge St. — they are St. Paul's School and the Green Ridge Library . Can someone please be kind enough to find out when the "line painting machine " will be ready to go. If, in fact it is ready, Kathy, would you be kind enough to make sure the relevant person at DPW has our two letters to them, authored in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 the past, about the library and St. Paul's. Both leaders (Kara Ware and Scott Thomas) have contacted me on numerous occasions , and I can no longer justify any more delay. If the machine is not fixed, Can we please get a reason for the delay and hopefully rectify it asap? I have seen this machine before and it does not appear to be a machine that is complex to repair unless there are additional issues that I am unaware of. 7. I remain concerned about the Scranton Sewer Authority easement issue. I tried to contact Atty. Jason Shrive numerous times (4-5) before my departure . In his defense , he called me back, but we could never get to each other at the right time. I know he is supposed to appear next week at Council , and I will be looking forward to hearing his answers to my Councilmates and I will be investigating this further when I return. 8. I am very pleased to note that City Council has changed past practice for appointment to the Zoning board. I believe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 the zoning board is the one board in the city that City Council is responsible for appointing . In the paper, within the last two weeks, City Council placed an advertisement noting that it was accepting applications for appointment to the zoning board. In the past, I believe this was more of an "informal appointment process ." Now, all of Scranton 's residents have a right to send in an application , apply for that seat and potentially sit on that board regardless of who you are or who you know etc.......For now, we are looking for one alternate , I believe . I commend my Councilmates on this decision as it is one more step toward equal access to government , additional transparency and increased accountability which I commend , and which remains one of my main priorities during my tenure here. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Perfect . Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, quite a few. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Thank you. First, I'd like to make a motion that City Council send correspondence to the Scranton Sewer Authority Board and its Chairman asking them to reconvene for a special meeting as soon as possible to consider voting to invite the Auditor General of Pennsylvania to audit the Authority and the sale of the Authority to Pennsylvania American Water. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Two years ago I had made a motion in these chambers almost simultaneously with all Council members in Dunmore to invite the Auditor General of Pennsylvania to come in and review the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority . In one of the most mind-boggling decisions that I have ever seen in my entire life, the Sewer Authority Board voted against inviting the Auditor General in to review the sale. If you remember at that time there was many questions and there was controversy and really a black cloud hanging over the sale. Fast forward three years later and I believe we're in the same position . I have not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 talked to one person in this City or in Dunmore or in Lackawanna County for that matter that has any faith whatsoever that this deal was done above board as the previous Mayor had said. The Auditor General is on record multiple times saying that he would be more than happy to come in and review the sale of the Authority to Pennsylvania American Water. Why would anyone in their right mind not want Eugene DePasquale , the Auditor General to come in and review the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority . In the State of Pennsylvania it was and I believe it still is the largest sale of a public authority of its kind. I think the lack of oversight and the Board's decision not to allow the Auditor General to come in was a major mistake . Fast forward a few years and we find out that there was an awful lot of corruption going on in this building and elsewhere from the previous Mayor. And I think that in light of that, in light of the issues that we currently find ourselves in, in light of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 lawsuits I think it's time to take another look at this and put it to bed once and for all. Now, should the Auditor General come in and review the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority and find that everything was done above board, great. I do not see a drawback just like I didn't see one three years ago to having him come in with his team and take another look. And I don't think that anybody should be afraid to allow a thorough review by the Auditor General if everything was done above board. I want to read from an article of January 9th, 2018 where the Auditor General said if he is granted additional power to audit authorities which he would have had to been granted by the state legislature , the first authority on his list in the State of Pennsylvania would have been the Scranton Sewer Authority . He said when the Philadelphia Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority respond ed to public pressure and invited my team in, we uncovered wide-ranging problem s that led to dramatic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 reforms at both entities . I also would like to cite Senator Blake who at that time in an article January 12th, 2018 on Eyewitness News, NBC or WBRE rather, he said that audits don't just uncover wrongdoing but they could also point out good conduct as well. I would rather have the authority and rather be reaffirmed and let the taxpayer s be reassured that what has been going on has been going on in their interest . I think that's an important point to make. The Governor of the State of Pennsylvania said I have to admit I haven't studied the bill to allow the Auditor General to audit municipal authorities , but in general , the idea of more accountability and more transparency strikes me as a really good idea. I would agree with the Governor . I don't think we have any elected official in the City of Scranton or in Dunmore that does not want an audit of the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority to Pennsylvania American Water. So if this City is truly going to turn the corner and embrace transparency and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 do things the right way then let this be the first step. So I would hope that my colleagues would agree let's ask the Sewer Authority Board to reconvene for a special meeting . Let's ask them to do the right thing for the taxpayer s and the ratepayers of this City and Dunmore . Let's ask them to invite the Auditor General in who is more than willing to come in with his team and audit the sale and let's finally move in the right direction . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : And I do plan on calling Mayor Burke of Dunmore tomorrow morning and asking that a similar motion be made. And I will call the President of Council of Dunmore and ask him that a similar motion be made at their next regularly scheduled meeting.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Mr. Shrive who is the attorney for the Scranton Sewer Authority respond ed as Councilman Donahue said that he will be coming before Council in an executive session regarding the easements on Monday, October 28th at 5:15 p.m. In preparation for that meeting I'd like to make a motion that Council send the following letter with request for information from Mr. Shrive. Number one, how many easement s have actually been secured to date? Please list the addresses of these properties . Number two, how many easements still need to be secured ? Please list the address es of these properties . Number three, were any condemnations or condemnation declarations filed on specific properties and if so, please list the number of these proceed ings and the addresses of the affected property owners. Number four, what attorneys were hired and tasked with securing these easements ? Whose responsibility was this? Number five, what attorneys have been paid to secure easement s to date and what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 is the amount paid out for this work? Number six, please provide an explanation as to why attorneys were paid in full before all easements were officially secured . Number seven, why did the sale between Pennsylvania American Water and the Scranton Sewer Authority close and legislation was sent down before City Council in December , 2016 requesting the dissolution of the Authority before the easement s were secured ? If it was clear in the summer of 2016 that there was an issue with easements , then why would you want to dissolve the Authority and then turn around and it still exists three years later? Number eight, when were City officials made aware of the escrow reversion deadline ? Please list all City officials who were aware of this date and when they were made aware. Number nine, when were you as Executive Director and Solicitor of the Sewer Authority made aware of the escrow reversion deadline? And finally , does the escrow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 reversion deadline exist in writing anywhere ? If so, please provide this documentation . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : On the gas card issue which I think needs to be address ed at this point, as the layers of the rotten onion that was the former Courtright Administration are continually peeled back, we uncovered gross incompetence and mismanagement. The most recently revelation made by the Scranton Times dealing with the gas card debacle is another embarrassing black eye on a city that is currently punch drunk. On October 9th, the City Controller sent a letter to the DPW asking for an explanation regarding several discrepancies found within that department in regards to the use of gas cards.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 The Scranton Times investigative report this past Sunday highlighted many more red flags with the use of these cards. This report begs the question why didn't anyone in the Controller 's Office, in the Business Administrator 's office, in the DPW or really anyone tasked with reviewing these charges and approving payment , why didn't anybody question this? How did this get through so many layers of government without anybody turning an eye and saying, wait. This does not look right. All of these charges to my knowledge , were approved and were paid. Someone in this administration or in the former administration must be held accountable and take responsibility for this epic lack of oversight and fix it immediately . I'd like to start by making a motion to ask City Council to send the following letter to the Business Administrator , the DPW Director , Mr. Gallagher and the City Controller with the following question -- and also the Mayor with the following questions : For the Business Administrator 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 office, why do so many employees need gas cards? There are 80-plus employees with gas cards. Why were all these employees given cards when, to our knowledge , there is no written policy on the use. Whose idea was this and why was there no oversight ? This is just inviting abuse and shows an awful lack of judgment in my opinion . I'd also like to ask the DPW Director to explain each discrepancy listed in the Controller 's letter of October 9th, 2019 in writing . To the DPW Director and the Business Administrator , please justify to City Council why gas cards and pin numbers were transfer able between individual s and departments . Please list the name and title of all employees who used DPW employee Mr. McMullin 's pin number to get gas. If gas cards were lost or stolen which is the excuse that was given in the newspaper as to why pin numbers were given out like candy, why weren't they immediately cancelled to prevent potential fraud and abuse? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Were there any cards in the last five years that were ever reported lost or stolen to any members of the Administration and were they ever cancelled ? According to the Scranton Times article this past Sunday, one DPW employee used his gas card 11 times on January 22nd, 2018 and January 22nd, 2019 according to the Scranton Times to buy nearly 260 gallons of diesel fuel on both occasion s. There was also a nonfuel purchase of $25.48 on January 22nd, 2018. Please provide an explanation in writing for this large purchase of diesel fuel. I should have put this in my comments by saying that I am not accusing anyone in this City of any wrongdoing or any criminal activity . I'm simply asking these questions because something needs to be put in writing to explain this. And if they can explain it and it's just the fact that there was a total lack of oversight and incompetence , then they should put that in writing as well. My next question , why are DPW employees getting gas using Mr. McMullin 's pin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 number but with house gas cards meant for the police department . According to the newspaper and what Council has been told, house gas cards are not issued to individual City workers . To the Business Administrator 's Office, the DPW, the Controller , has any City employee to your knowledge used the City-issued gas card for personal use? I'd like to remind everyone that one cent of fuel spent on personal use is theft of services . Also, I'd like someone in the Administration to please explain the rational e behind the selection of the gas stations where house cards are stored for the police department . One of the things that I was concern ed about and I mentioned this two weeks ago is that when the City transferred from Valero to Sunoco, they were given a no bid contract . Now, the reason according to the Administration is because Valero went out of business and Sunoco was given a sole source contract because apparently there was no other stations that could do that work. I don't know if that -- the truth behind that; but that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 what was given. To Mayor Evans, what has been done or will be done to clearly set forth precise and exact parameters for the purchase of gas on a City card with clear instructions that no personal use should be allowed. The policy should set forth who was responsible for oversight of these charges and how the process will work. And to the Controller 's Office, why wasn't your office reviewing these gas charges ? How could their be approval with this many discrepancies and issues? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , I would like these questions to be answered by the end of business 4 p.m., Friday, October 25th. If these question s are not answered to Council 's satisfaction , I would like to put in the letter Council reserves the right to utilize Section 312 of the Scranton Home Rule Charter entitled Powers of Council which states that Council may make investigations into the affairs of the City and conduct of any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 department , office, or agency in aid of its legislative powers and functions and may issue subpoenas for these purposes . Ladies and gentlemen , this is a very serious matter which is why this Council has asked for a three-year certified audit of gas card usage and really a look at the program as a whole keeping in mind from the auditor best practices in accounting standards . Moving forward as I mentioned in my question to the Mayor and the Administration , I think that they should immediately -- and I'm hoping and I'm assuming that they're revisiting this issue and the fact that we're issuing 80-plus gas cards to employees . I do think that that in it of itself with no policy invites abuse. Again, I want to make sure I state that I'm not accusing anyone of any wrongdoing. But I do think in order for us to move forward , we need these questions and these explanation s and answers in writing . When I go around and I talk to people in the public as I mentioned in the beginning of my statement on this, the City has a black eye now. We are literally -- I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 know if we have any credibility left. So if we don't get these answers in writing and someone from this Administration does not step up and members of the previous Administration and explain this and come clean on why there was no oversight and what exactly happened, then I think we have a major issue. So I do think in the interim we need a strong policy and procedures governing this program . We need to turn the corner here and make sure we hold people account able. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to make a motion to place the overtime figures that I received from City Controller Roseann Novembrino in Third Order for the next Council meeting . MR. DONAHUE : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I had requested two weeks ago for the overtime numbers from the Controller 's Office. And I appreciate them getting back to me so quickly . I asked for a complete accounting of where we stand in overtime . I believe I did the same last year. So just to give everybody an update, right now we are -- we budgeted at $650,000 for the police department . We are over budget by $16,301.06. We're actually over budget in each category that's listed for overtime . We're about $40,000 over as of the pay period ending September 27, 2019. As for the fire department overtime which I requested in a separate correspondence because it wasn't included in the original one, the budget allocated $350,000. And we have a balance of $94,670.68 as of September 27th, 2019. What I would like to ask the police department and fire department is if they can provide Council how much of that funding that's been expended so far is reimbursable to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 City. MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I would also like to make a motion to place the Controller 's letter of October 9th directed to the Department of Public Works regarding gas card discrepancies into Third Order on our agenda for next week. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd also to make a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 motion at this time to put the letter we received and we were copied on effectively -- the Administration effectively terminating or asking for a termination of the Northeast Revenue Services contract in Third Order for next week. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . We receive d a letter October 16th, 2019. We were copied on this letter. This letter was directed to Sean Shamany of Northeast Revenue Services . They are the collector of delinquent real estate and refuse taxes in the City. I won't go through the whole letter, but the gist of it is that the City would like to terminate the contract effective December 31st, 2019. There's other information in here. And I think this is -- I would like to put it in Third Order next week. MR. ROGAN: On the question , I did speak with the Mayor regarding this. And I know Council is unanimous that we want to move in another direction in regards to this collection . But this is not a done deal yet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 It is still in negotiations . For a football analogy we're on the, you know, we're on the five yard line going in to have this finalize d. I don't think putting that letter out on the record at this point is appropriate because it's not a final determination . If you would amend the motion to be, you know, as soon as it's finalize d, obviously at that point I think it would be appropriate . But it is not finalized yet. So I would caution with putting it out there right yet. MR. GAUGHAN : The only thing I would say and I don't want to get into back and forth on this. But there's nothing in here that says it's confidential . And Council did receive it. So I don't want to amend my motion but I'd just like an up or down vote. MR. ROGAN: We discussed this prior and it was a confidential memo. Why it wasn't listed that way was a mistaken on somebody 's part. But like we discuss ed earlier , I did discuss it with the Mayor because I wanted to bring up that letter. And he asked at this time that we don't. Anyone else? All those in favor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: No. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Opposed ? No. The motion fails. MR. GAUGHAN : On the NRS termination or potential termination , I would like -- and I know the Administration is in constant discussion s on what the next steps are from here. If the City does end up terminating NRS which I believe that they should based on their involvement in two federal corruption investigation s, I would like to request a timeline on where we go from here. As Mr. Rogan mentioned earlier in the meeting Council did request -- and I have been pushing this for the last few years for us to put out in the newspaper an advertisement when we put people on the zoning board. So we did that. It is in the newspaper . And if anybody is interested in being an alternate member of the zoning board, please submit your resumes and your cover letters to Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Also, on September 25th I had made a motion to request that the Administration provide a cover sheet which I went over in detail on September 25th to accompany the legislation that they send down. The Administration still has not complied with that motion. I would just like to send more correspondence , Miss Carrera , if you could and ask them when they intend on complying with Council 's request and if they could please delineate that in correspondence . Also, I sent a letter to Mayor Evans and the administration on September 13th, 2019 regarding completion and progress of recommendations made by the Pennsylvania Economy League in our Recovery Plan. I had asked when the Pennsylvania Economy League and Mr. Bulzoni came before us in a caucus at the end of the summer for a detailed explanation on each initiative and each recommendation that was in the recovery plan where the City was in completing that. I receive d a response from PEL that was not -- it did not suffice with me, very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 vague. It was either completed or underway . I wanted a much more detailed response so that this Council could understand , for example , the Human Resources Department was supposed to put together a more comprehensive program and update their database . It's not clear if that's been done yet. So rather than it's underway since we are exiting Act 47 next summer, I would appreciate and, Miss Carrera , if you could send again another reminder that I would like a more detailed response on that. I'd also like, Miss Carrera , if you could send a letter on my behalf to Mayor Evans the Administration asking for an update on the self audit of Chief DeSarno 's gas charge. I would like to know is there a timeframe for the self audit. I know this was announced a few weeks ago. I do think we need more specifics in writing on what this looks like, what documentation will be provided and where we are in that process because , of course, I think that is important . We also received an e-mail from Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Bulzoni along with proposals of the possible relocation of the offices of OECD out of City Hall into other location s. There's a number of different reasons that are cited in here. He does ask in his correspondence what the Council thinks and what the Administration might think. Just at first glance, I would say that I would prefer to keep OECD in this building and not have to pay rent to another building . I do know that years ago OECD was in the Scranton Life Building and eventually they had to move back into City Hall. So I'm sure we'll continue to discuss this. But just at first glance I do have some concerns . I would like Council -- and we can talk about this hopefully in our caucus next week to start thinking about scheduling a meeting with Mayor Evans, the Business Administrator and the Pennsylvania Economy League in regards to the 2020 budget. I'm hoping that this year Council gives ourselves enough time to have meaningful conversation and a meaningful back and forth regarding the budget. In years past we've -- in my opinion we have hamstringed ourselves to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 30 or 45 minutes. And we're sitting here and in my judgment there is never enough time. And it's not a fruitful conversation . So I would just ask my colleagues if we can consider that next week. I don't think it should be limited to just a half hour or 45 minutes . I think we should give ourselves more time. And if we have to schedule a meeting separate from the Council meeting , I think that actually might even be letter. Miss Carrera , I would also like to request from the Administration any and all contract s the City is currently entered into, the term or duration of those contract s and a brief explanation as to what the contract is for and what it entails. That would be very helpful . Also just on citizens ' request s, 1452 West Locust Street if you remember months and months ago I held up a picture of the gentleman that lives next door to the large hole standing in it. The hole is marked to be fixed and to be filled. But the neighbor s have reached out to me once again and wanted to know what the timeline is on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 They also wanted to know whether the sidewalks which have been damaged because of the hole will be fixed as well. That's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Nothing at this time. ATTY. MINORA: 5-B.

I was trying to scribble really quick. And I would also like to pose a question of my own on this. Back in December of 2017, I was not at the meeting for final passage of this. But the City entered into a contract or an agreement with New Cingular Wireless for lease 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 payments when they put up these cell towers.
