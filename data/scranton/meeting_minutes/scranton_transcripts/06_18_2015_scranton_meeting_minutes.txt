MR.ROGAN:Onebriefitemandthen I'mgoingtotalkaboutourcaucus alittle bit.Alittle bitofastrange request ,but I'msurethisissomething thatCouncilman Wechsler isfamiliar with,it'sinhis neighbor hood.Aresident contact me,she listsonYesuDriveonEastMountain andher address isoftenconfusedwitha neighbor oringYesuLane,andthereisonly onehomeonYesiLane,whichisnowupfor salebecause theowneriscurrently ina nursing home,andshewouldliketoseeif thisoneblockstreet withonehomeonit canbecome partoftheadjoining Shortlane. Thiswouldendtheconfusion foremergency1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 vehicles andanyone attempting tofindhomes inthisarea. So,Mrs.Reed,Idohavethis request ,IknowitwouldhavegototheDPW, butIalsothinkithastogototheCounty 911Centeraswelltoseeifthisis something thatwecouldgettakencareof andthepostoffice aswellsoIdohave thisandanything wecandototryandget thisstraightened out. Regarding thecaucus,boy,Icould talkallnightonthis,butIwon't.Ihad alistofotherquestions thatIplanned on asking Mr.Boscov,butIknowmyself andI thinkallfiveofuseveryquestion weasked wegotthesameanswer,thatBoscov Department Storedoesn'townthemalland that--itwasthesameanswer overandover again.AndIthinkthatMr.Boscov was beingsomewhatdisingenuous regarding the relationship between himandthemallwhen hewasoneofthedriving forces behind that mallandinthewaning daysoftheSteamtown MallPartners ,Mr.Boscov wasthefaceof thatpartnership andthereisnoquestion1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 aboutthat.Whenever therewastalkof bringing anewanchor storeordoing something torevitalize themallunderthe oldownership itwasMr.Boscov that people wasturning to.Hetookthat leadershiproleandnowthatthings didn't workoutthewaywewanted toheispretty muchclaiming thatIhadnothing todowith themall,Ionlyhadsomething todowith Boscov store. Andthereisnoquestion that Boscov'sstoreisasuccessful store,I thinkthevastmajority ofresidents inthe cityshopthere.Ishopthere,myfamily shopsthere,it'sagreatstore,butthe mall,Mr.Boscov hadhishandsinaswell, aswellasSampter 'sbuilding andthe Oppenheim building andtheywerealsoloans thatweredueonthosebuildings aswell, butmyphonediedonmewhenIwaspulling upthedocument ,itwasIbelieve $1million plusinterest foroneofthebuildings and $749,000plusinterest fortheothers,and thoseareownedbyMr.Boscov fromtheMall Associates ,andit'saverycomplicated1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 situation andIthinkintonight 'scaucus Mr.Boscov --theysayifyoucan'tdazzle themwithbrilliance ,baffle themwith,you know,andIthinkthat'swhatMr.Boscov was aiming for,because wedidn'tgetany answers toanyofthequestions thatwehave had,andheiswilling tomakeadonation theSection 108,buttheotherloanswere stillpayable tothecity.Forinstance , theUDAG,that'sthemoneythatIbelieve Mr.Quinnbrought up,whenthatmoneygets repaid twicethat'swhenitcanbeusedfor otheritems. AndIwaswrong,Ididcheckon that,double checkonthatbalance it's closer to$100,000not$10,000,soIdid havethatwronginitially . Mr.Boscov keptsaying,"Well,it's notthecity'sdollars ,it'snotthecity's dollars ,"andheisrightinthatthecity didn'twritethechecktoSteamtown Mall Partners a/k/aAlBoscov andhispartners rightoutofthecitycoffers ,butthese wereeconomic development fundsthatwere giventotheCityofScranton andthenthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 CityofScranton gavethemtoSteamtown Mall Partners andAlBoscov forredevelopment . Thosefundscanhavebeenusedforan assortment ofotherproject sthroughout the city.Theydidn'thavetobeusedforhis project .Andthewaytheseloansare structured ismanytimesthemoneycomes back.Withthe108theycomeback,itgets repaid toHUD.Iftheyarenotpaid,it comesoffofourlineofcredit,whichis whatweusefornumerous programs .Paving inlowtomoderate income areas, neighborhood police patrols ,little leagues , parksprograms ,andthelistgoesonandon andweseeeveryyearwhenwedoourCDBG allotmentallofthegoodprograms thatare funded through thatallotmentandwhenthe Section 108loansarenotpaidit'sahuge hit. Onthelarger issueofwhat'sgoing onwiththatproperty ,although Mr.Boscov claims heisnotintentionally devaluing the mallIdonotbelieve that.Ibelieve that theMallPartners previous debtwasjustfor roundnumbers waswellinexcess of$1001 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 million andnowyoucouldbuyitfor $700,000?Whywouldhenotbuyitatthat bargain basementprice.Thatwouldbelike thefiveofusuphereowning apieceof property for$100,000,defaulting onallof thedebtandthenoneofusbuying itfor $70,000.It'sthesametypeofthingthat willhappen ifMr.Boscov buysitfor $700,000,$1million ,freeandclearwith alloftheotherdebtswashed,withthe banksout,thecityout,andhimleftwith theproperty formaybeonly$700,000. Andyouputthatintoperspective , lookatthepriceofahouseintheCityof Scranton ,youcouldbyanicehouse70,80 thousand dollars ,compare thattothesize ofthemall,justtoputitintoperspective howgoodofadealMr.Boscov couldbe getting ifhedoes,indeed,purchase that property for$700,000ora$1million .If hedoespurchase it,Iwishhimthebest,I hopethathisplanswork,butjustjudging bymyresearch andthatofothers ofmalls throughout America thatitdoesn'tworkin thisoldstrictly retail sense.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Therehavebeenalotofgoodideas withmixedviewsusedthathavebeenbrought upandIthinkMr.Boscov isbeingfoolish fornotexploring those.Iunderstand that hisbreadandbutterisinretail,butby bringing inpeople andhaving amarketplace , byhaving otherevents theyaregoingtogo inthereandshopwiththeotherstores.If youwalkthrough thatmallnow,youhave pretty muchonesuccessful storeinthat mall,whichisBoscov's,andtherestofthe mallisaghosttown. SoIguesswe'llseewhathappens withthesale.IfMr.Boscov winsthebid Iamhopeful thatthereisanother developer outtherethatwillbidagainst Mr.Boscov haveandhopefullydevelop itintosomething moremodern andsomething thatcouldbeused inmanyotherfacets,butstillhavea retail component ,stillhaveaBoscov store, haveanother anchor store.Iguesswe'll havetowaitandseewhathappens ,butIam hopeful thatthrough thisprocess something goodwillhappen,butIamconcerned regarding thedebtthatisowedtothecity.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 Andisthatallfortonight .Thankyou.

It'sobvious thatpurchasing the mallitself isprobably muchcheaper than leasing fromanother loaner fortheseven yearsthatheisstillobligated tobethere1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 soIthinkthereare,youknow,numerous interest sMr.Boscov hasthatgobeyond,you know,someofthethings thatwerementioned andMr.Boscov isagreatbusinessman andI thinktonight wesawthatheisprobably alsoaverygoodpolitician .Hecansaya lotandnotprovide necessarily theanswers thatyouneed,butwewillcontinue to monitor whatgoesonwiththemallandwith Mr.Boscov andespecially withthisgrant application that,again,itkindofdanced around theideathatiftheygetthisgrant theyalsoneedthecityto,youknow,apply forwhatisit,Section 108loan,inthe amount of$15million .That'ssomething thatIthinkthatwereally needtobe concerned with.
