City council will meet again on January 1 unless a special meeting will be necessary before that date. Also, this evening an executive session was held regarding a matter of litigation . MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . MR. WECHSLER : Norma Jefferies . MS. JEFFERIES : Norma Jefferies , Scranton resident , and like I said before, I have been back in town about two years, two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 and a half years and certain things, you know, it's easy to complain about things, but I only complain so much before I have to pick up the phone and do something or try to do something so one of my things tonight is about the street condition and the street condition in the Hill Section of Scranton . It seems that there is digging and more digging and more digging that continues to go on and usually only takes me five minutes to get to my part-time job, which is on Jefferson Avenue, so it doesn't take me long to get there, I can usually just zip down Gibson Street, but lately it's taking me more -- longer and longer. Now, longer and, longer is maybe more minutes , you know, but it's just the idea that when you turn up the street and then there is a road closure . You go down another one, there is a road closure . So the thing that really got me the other day was on -- I wound up on Olive Street. Now, I don't know if you know where Olive Street over there, I don't drive there because it's cobblestones and if there's any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 kind of dampness it's going to be slippery . So I said, "Nah, I'm not going that way." So I wound up on Mulberry Street. Well, you know what Mulberry Street is like at 8:30 in the morning so I thought I got to call somebody . So I called the UGI was my first call and what they told me was -- they were very nice, you know, and they told me that they give a report to the municipalities of the work that they are going to be doing and that it should be shared with us. I said, oh, okay. So then I called American Water and asked about information and the lady, I mean, she put me through like a deposition , you know, of everything that she was writing down and what I was saying and where I live, what streets was I talking about and basically I was talking about Prescott Avenue -- no, I don't do Olive Street, Prescott and Gibson and Webster , you know, all of those streets , so she was taking all of this down. So in any case, she told me, she said, "Well, you probably won't get a call 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 back or anything for 72 hours." I said, "Okay." So I put my cell phone on charge and I went about my day and then I came back and may cell phone I missed a call and it was from Tony, who was from American Water, and he left a very detailed message about the conditions of the street in the Hill section and he told me that the work on Pine Street is complete and that the base work is being done and the paving will be done in the spring. With the base work being completed there on Pine Street that it will give and make it capable for the plows to plow the snow in the winter. He also left the message that the work continues on Gibson, Prescott and Webster to at least January or February and the workers do change spots, they don't work in the same spot all of the time he said, that they go back and forth on the streets . So I tried to -- left a message and left me his phone number and told me if I had any other questions to please call him, which I did, I returned the call to American Water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 and to this gentleman , but it went to his voice mail. So basically I wanted to ask him, I had questions and why is it taking so long especially on Prescott Avenue. I don't live on Prescott , but I have family that lives there and I'm there every day. Not every day, most of the days, so I went back to what the UGI had said that it was on the city website . So I went to the city website it see if there is any information out there so I checked under the city department s, the development and proposed events and links and I did not find anything so I don't know where it goes once they give it to whoever they give it to. So my only question I have do you know about this report and is something that can be shared with the public so that we can know? And, like I said, I'm not a complain er, but if something is annoying me I'm not going to complain to someone else I am going to see what I can do to find out what the situation is and how I can make it go further if they tell me. So they did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 tell at UGI that they give detailed plans of the work on the city streets and I'm just looking to see where that is tonight . MR. WECHSLER : They do give detailed plans, they go through the pave cut inspector . MS. JEFFERIES : The who inspector ? MR. WECHSLER : The pave cut inspect or, he receives a copy of all the plans from UGI and the water company and the Sewer Authority , now they are combined , so they go through Mr. Hazzouri and they go through they're shared with DPW and the city engineers . They are not posted -- well, as far as I know they are not posted on the city's website at all. MS. JEFFERIES : Yeah, I didn't see anything at all on that. MR. WECHSLER : But they do coordinate as best they can with the utility project s and our paving, but -- and I dealt with them as well but sometimes the emergency repairs come up or there is reports of different dates and things like that, so that kind of changes their plan so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 that's kind of one of the reasons why they are in one place and they don't see them until the next day, so they kind of move around. And another problem is as that as they do this work once the asphalt plants close for the winter they really can't even do any paving after that so you are really stuck with the cold patch through the winter and as long as it's warm they are going to continue to do the pipe work. MR. EVANS: I talked about it before, but I think we need to revisit the pave cut ordinance again, put some controls in there, make sure that there is a spreadsheet for everybody to see so we know exactly when the work is being done and where and how and how long it's going to take. I think we need to you talk to the utility companies about doing it differently because what they are doing is doing all of the mains first, going all over the city, coming back and doing he laterals , and by the time they are done with the laterals going into people's houses it's the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 wintertime and we have to drive over these war zone-type streets for four or five months until the spring time comes and that's unacceptable . So I think it's just a matter of better coordination and better policy that the city has to have, so I think it's time. We sat down there last year with the city engineer and the pave cut inspector and I think it's time to sit down again and really take a hard look at the ordinance and see if we can tidy it up. MR. WECHSLER : Yes, there is a -- after the first of the year when council reorganizes all council members have been invited to go back to Pennsylvania American Water to take a look at the proposed projects in the spring so everyone on council can get a good idea of exactly what's happening . MS. JEFFERIES : Okay. MR. PERRY: And maybe there is a feasibility level where if we can have the pave cut inspector if he -- he is the one -- he is that the head of this, he gets all of the information from the utilities and maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 there is a way that he can get that to our IT Department and maybe even as crude as a scan of the PDF file put out of what's being worked on and where and like Council Wechsler said, all of those dates, you know, they are kind of floating dates on weather -related things, but at least we have an idea. I know I went through similar to what you went through this year last year in my neighborhood where Colliery Avenue was the same way and it wasn't going to get finished until spring, but there was a good amount of time where, you know, myself and some of the other neighbors we weren't really sure of the timeframes . So I think if we had an idea of the timeframes it would put us at ease a little bit more and the road closures are tough, but, unfortunately , there is nothing you can do about it until they are done and eventually we will have some nice paved roads, but it gets frustrated , especially when you're kind in the dark with things. MS. JEFFERIES : Right, if I can have just one more second about what's out on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that website, what I did read was about the storm water and asking people about the leaves and telling them the affects of the leaves and not letting them go down to the drains. That was quite interesting reading , too, if anyone wants to go out there and read that. That was interesting . That's it for me. MR. WECHSLER : Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton resident and taxpayer . I have to agree with Norma, that would be very useful information to be put on the city's website and for those who don't have access to the internet and can't access the website perhaps something could be worked out between the city to feed a weekly report to the Times-Tribune , they can publish that, know, maybe in the classified s, but that's information that people need to know. I mean, they are trying to get to work, trying to get to school, it doesn't do them any good to be running around in circles , okay. Speaking of the winter, you only have one more session before the holidays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 are we to assume that the arrangements you have made last year with reference to parking during snow storms will again apply this year? MR. WECHSLER : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : So that -- will an emergency be declared by the mayor and people can park in the parking garages ? MR. WECHSLER : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : You might want to make sure that that gets republicized either on the website or in the newspaper or something so that people know and the people who aren't familiar with from last year. Where, oh where, is the Knowel's insurance list? Don't all answer at once. MR. EVANS: Don't have it for you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. You know, somebody is going on Santa's naughty list. We will find out who should have gotten that thing done. I know that they got a three-year contract back at the end of March. I'm hoping I don't have to wait three years to see the new list. And, also, I was in the caucus and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 heard the comments about the Arcadis study, I think it would be useful also if you could give the public a general idea when that thing is going to wind up and the information made available . As I recall, when we passed the contract for Arcadis we were talking about October and November timeframe for completion , you were hoping to have the done before the end of the year and it's understandable you might not make that target, but it would be nice having passed that target date if we could get an update on a projected completion date because I, like many people, would like to know if this is going to impact homeowners and others financially , I would remember know sooner rather than later. Like many people -- MR. WECHSLER : I can tell you this, the study release is not imminent . MS. HODOWANITZ : I know it's not going to have that kind of information . MR. WECHSLER : The report is not imminent in being released . MS. HODOWANITZ : So it's way, way -- it's right behind the Knowel's insurance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 list. MR. WECHSLER : I won't be here for it, I can tell you that. MS. HODOWANITZ : I know you won't, but it's behind the insurance list. That's fine. MR. WECHSLER : It's ahead of the insurance list, but it's not imminent . MS. HODOWANITZ : The other thing that would be nice to get updates on is how we are standing on transferring the proceeds of the sewer sale into the pension plans. I know that it's going to be done incrementally and you got the trust set up, many people did not go to the Pension Board meetings which are held monthly , and they are not televised , and there is a time lag before the minutes are publically released , so whoever can kind of keep -- maybe the financial chair, if you could keep kind of an eye on that and say, you know, okay, of the $22 million $2 million is gone, and the next $2 million is gone and whatever so we have a sensing because , you know, the market is hot and, you know, you want to get that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 12 percent rate of return before the market crashes , which sooner or later it's going to have to go down. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council. Bob Bolus. On "C" regarding the Scranton Tomorrow , I think we before we hand anybody $250,000 I think we need to know exactly the form of what plan do they have, how are they going to market the city, at what cost for advertising , etcetera, etcetera , and how much are we going to be paying in wages for their people to do this job? Like, what are they allocating ? They should have separate pro forma set up just like a balance sheet, we are going to give you $250,000, what are you going to give us in return? Rhetoric ? We got enough of that around here. How are you going to plan to bring in people to the city? How are going to address businesses coming in here with the school board and how are you going to handle this issue or that issue, and I don't see that in here anywhere along the line exactly what we are paying for. It's like just handing somebody a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 basket of money and saying, "Here, have fun," and we have no idea of accountability or what they are doing for it. So I think that should be tabled until we have a much better understanding and a plan laid out as to how much wage we are going to pay them out of $250,000 to do whatever they are going to do, and I would ask council tonight to table that until they come before us here and layout a comprehensive plan that makes sense to us, not just some rhetoric , sending some loose papers ads, some flyers out and blow a quarter of a million bucks, so I think we need to go that route first. Let's do it intelligently and spend our money wisely. You wouldn't go buy a car not knowing anything about it and you sure as heck wouldn't go in a grocery store and pick up a bag of groceries or something out of there without first understanding what it was and what you are paying for, and that's the same issue I have here. If we are going to move the city forward , let's move it forward 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 intelligently , and I'm not taking anything from Scranton Tomorrow or anything on it, but I want to hear what the heck you are going to do for us, and that's what we are paying for you so let's see if we could table that tonight and have a public quorum here, let them explain to us. Let's get some accountability , as Mr. Gaughan would say he wants transparency , his black skunk is here tonight and he is not even here tonight, breaking my hear. MR. WECHSLER : Yeah, did you hear, Mr. Bolus, he had emergency surgery . MR. BOLUS: Pardon? MR. WECHSLER : He had emergency surgery , that's why he is not here. MR. BOLUS: Geez, he could have called me, we could have did that for him. I wish him well, I really do, and it does get some fun in here and sometimes you got to have some humor in here, sometimes it get intense , but I think at the end of the day we can all walk outside , shake hands and say we did a good job or a bad job and that's what makes this the right place to be, we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 have the comradery with everybody . We all have opinions , good, bad or indifferent . What I'd like to do is on the parking garage here, it's been a big pet peeve, paid four point some million dollars to Basalyga , I want to know where our parking spaces are, and I'm sure the heck they are not going to be on the upstairs , outside in the snow in the upper garage, we paid for park spaces, they should be premium parking spaces allocated to the people of this city that just paid for them, and Basalyga has to be held accountable now. I'm tired of hearing about him, I'm tired of hearing about this and hearing about that at our expense , and then I'm going to drive over and go through a gate and get a ticket to pay the parking space we already paid for. I want to know where my parking space is or anybody else's. So I think we need to have him be held accountable on the parking , enough said. To think back when I talked about doing a casino here in Scranton when I wanted to buy the mall, which we were going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 to buy the mall, we couldn't get any support to ask the gaming board to at least consider an additional license for the City of Scranton and what's happened . It was like we looked into a crystal ball and they gave without a license , think how Scranton would have grown over what the mall is or whatever it is, we could have made this into one of the greatest financially stable places in the United States with everything we had to offer people coming here to come into a casino in downtown Scranton . And it's just disappointing that we couldn't get the cooperation to have anybody send a letter around to do it. I have been working with the county on PTSD, it's a major issue. I had a clinical psychologist up here from Florida that I brought up that addressed them for over two hours and I think we are moving forward that our citizens in this community in a very short period of time we are going to start seeing the results of the PTSD study to help people here. And last, and I won't take any more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 time, I want to congratulate actually the mayor for his victory , but more importantly , I had the honor of addressing and representing the City of Scranton and Lackawanna County in Baltimore a couple of week ago at the American Towmen Association convention where I presented on behalf of the city the key to the city and, Wayne, you were there, the honor was that the captain 's of industry table that addressed the spirit ride that I was able to address and present this, Scranton was out of 147 cities the only city to present the key to the city to the spirit ride, and the spirit ride understand it is related to the Move Over Law for first responders . And they were taken aback that Scranton was the only place that did it. And now they are pushing every mayor in every city that the spirit ride goes through to follow the example of Scranton , Pennsylvania , Lackawanna County, and we did set another milestone for somebody else to follow you us. And my dinner will be -- MR. WECHSLER : I was going to say, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 you wanted to make the announcement . MR. BOLUS: My dinner will be on Christmas Day, this will be the 24th year I'm doing it, the dinner is open to everyone and anyone who doesn't want to be home alone on Christmas . We do offer rides, we will be delivering two meals to a family and takeouts will not only be available to those that attend the dinner. So bring your family, leave the cooking to us and enjoy the festivities and see what Scranton spirit is really about. I hope I get back next week to do it. If not, I'm going to delegate Mr. Rogan to bring it up again next week if I can't make it back here because of the time frame. And if I can't, gentlemen , Merry Christmas . MR. WECHSLER : Same to you. Thank you, Mr. Bolus. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Bolus, what's the time? MR. EVANS: And the location as well? MR. BOLUS: You can get there at five in the morning and start taking the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 turkeys out of the oven. MR. ROGAN: You don't want me cooking . MR. BOLUS: We start serving from noon to 6:00 and we will deliver meals. Like I said, two meals to a family, we help our elderly people that are in need to call us. My phone number, I'm sorry, is 570-346-7659. Thank you. MR. EVANS: I don't think you mentioned the and location . MS. CARRERA : Location . MR. BOLUS: Oh, it's St. Pat's at All Saints Academy the back of the cafeteria . Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council. Dave Dobrzyn , resident , finally a local issue. It must be five years in a row, ever time leaves come up we pick the paper, we always pick the paper week. Please, remember next year I can leave the cans out under the Lilac bush or hide them under the evergreens , but I can't store papers without a lot of grief. They are either sitting on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 my back porch they can even get wet there, and if we have any type of weather before December 5 and our recycle crew gets snagged for downtown snow removal or something then it's sitting there through Christmas and New Year's, so my luck we'll have show before the Martin Luther King Day and that will really do it. So, please, try and coordinate that bottles and cans. You can put them in a white bag, the white bottles , and mark it with a magic marker "Please recycle" and they take them for me, you know, so even if I have extra, because I usually have at least three barrels a month, probably closer to four if it's a long month. The 500 block at the corner right by Buona Pizza came up I read in the paper and, you know, the thought always occurred to me if that were paved and a couple of meters were put in there it would be a great parking area for people that wanted to shop or visit with Buona Pizza or whatever and something should be done with it, but we really need to get something done with it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 and not just hand it over to somebody for a couple of bucks and in reality one of the things that started my consternation with the last mayor was the way Buona Pizza was treated . They just -- they were put under eminent domain and it really hurt them, and they spent more on that lot, the city did, than what they offered Buona Pizza for a business that was 40 years old and paid taxes. I remember when my wife and I were teenage rs we used to go to the movies and stop over Buona Pizza on Saturday or Sunday night. So, you know, it's really something could be done with the lot, I don't think we need anymore business properties or storefronts on that block, we already have quite a few that aren't filled, so maybe we should see if the Parking Authority wants to do something or if Buona wants to buy it sell it to them and let them run the parking lot, whatever , but it's unsightly , the sidewalks are never clean. I almost went head over heels with my pizza a couple of times walking out of there during the winter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 and something should be done with it. On signage, if possible , we should explore details that we could just have somebody up on a ladder, slap a decal on the faded signs for city streets and stuff and at least explore whether it could be cheaper . And, once again, on PILOTS, please, you know, I'll try not to be too insulting but, they really need to get together , if they don't want to provide PILOTS, the tax exempts , then start petitioning the state to do something to replace some of the missing property tax because it gets a little -- it's a little much on thirty-five hundred . And, by the way, on Hemlock across from Scranton Grinder there must be 20 bags of leaves standing there so is there another weekday by any chance we have? MR. WECHSLER : No, they will have to get picked up with the trash. MR. DOBRZYN : Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like 20 bags and even worse yet it's in the low biodegrade leaf bags, you know, shame. Have a good night. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. WECHSLER : Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening . Marie Schumacher . I would like to start off tonight by asking people to vote for the PA -- Lackawanna for the PA river of the year. It was covered in the paper, so I'm hoping that boosts the voting because the last I checked , which I believe was last night, we are still in single digit as a percent of the vote and other places were in the 30's. So, I mean, I think the people who work on that river have really done a fantastic job from when I was a kid certainly , and at least it's fishable now, I wouldn't want to eat one out of there, but fishable and hopefully some day it will be swimmable, but we need to -- if not for any other reason but to thank the people and give some light and shed some light on the people who actually work so very hard to accomplish that. Has anybody seen the settlement agreement for the Wyoming Avenue and Linden property ? MR. WECHSLER : No, we would not see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 that. That's for the city solicitor . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, you could ask for it. You wouldn't vote on something certainly before you knew if that was the total -- MR. WECHSLER : It's a lawsuit . It's a lawsuit . We don't vote on lawsuit s. MR. EVANS: The settlement agreement wouldn't be provided until at least 48 hours outside of the closing . The settlement -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I mean, I don't think you should vote on it until we could see something . If that suffices , just buying that property , but I have a real issue with that because we have got -- they paid a lot more money than what we are paying for that property , plus I don't know where we stand with respect to the remediation that was spoken on last week, how we compete for that, and again, I think we have plenty of parks downtown, but I want to move on. Mr. Wechsler , are you going to give us a rundown on the parking meeting that was held on Monday? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. WECHSLER : They are going to provide a summary of the meeting and that will be presented to the -- prior to the Parking Authority meeting for public comment so I am not -- the information that was discussed at that meeting is classified because it is a private company , so I am not at liberty to discuss it. MS. SCHUMACHER : When is the next Parking Authority meeting ? MR. WECHSLER : I don't know. MS. SCHUMACHER : Who does? MR. EVANS: I'm not sure when the meeting is. MS. SCHUMACHER : Is the office equipped to find out when that is held? MR. EVANS: Sure, we can find out. I'm sure they meet at the same time each month. I'm sure we can find that out. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. Also, what is the policy with respect to the deployment of the vacuum truck? MR. WECHSLER : The vacuum is deployed when it works. It doesn't always work. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MS. SCHUMACHER : You know, something needs to be done a whole lot better. This was two weeks. I mean, I though I was going to have a heart attack dragging my -- I put everything out this morning because I wasn't really sure what they were doing and then dragging the papers back but, I mean, I don't think it's really fair that some people have to bag them, go over and get the bags and come back and bag them and other people just put in the street and let it sit there until somebody comes and maybe they don't even come and -- MR. WECHSLER : That's the risk you run. Everyone was told to put their leaves in the bags. MS. SCHUMACHER : I know that, but they went two weeks, right, as well on just leaves? They didn't do any recyclables for two weeks. MR. WECHSLER : Last week lost the papers to collect the leaves. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I don't know. Okay, onto the next, there was new positions in the budget that you all approved for next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 year, are those new positions going to be advertised ? MR. EVANS: I would hope so. I mean, some might be internal because there might be some movement within city hall, people that are in similar jobs, but I would imagine they should all be advertised . MS. SCHUMACHER : Has anybody been named to any of the positions yet? MR. EVANS: Not that I'm aware of. MS. SCHUMACHER : Other than the BA. MR. EVANS: Well, the BA, obviously , yeah. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. I think it would be nice if they were advertised for a change. On this on five -- what is it, 6-C, I have a problem with it. I read through that and I'm not sure if this is a project for the City of Scranton or if it's for -- may I just finish the thought because I won't go into all of the details , but many of them have a rational when it gives the topic and then it says, "Summary" and then "rational " and I'll just read this one because there is more than one that reads 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 like this. "Viable activity demonstrating the effectiveness and capacity of Scranton Tomorrow . " I mean, you read through them and it sounds more as though the goal of this is to promote Scranton Tomorrow as a viable organization rather than what it's going to do for the city, but more on that next week. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Anyone else? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. WECHSLER : Mr. Perry? MR. PERRY: Yes, thank you, Mr. Wechsler . A couple of items tonight , the first item I received a phone call, if we could have Mr. Santoli stop and pay a visit on Maple Avenue, I believe the address is close to 538, there is a tree that is -- looks like it's damaged , it's about to fall down and the residents there are worried that another first snowstorm might topple it over on some power lines or some property . And, second, is it -- I don't know if this is possible so let's put the wheels 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 in motion, maybe if we can send something over to Mr. Hazzouri to see if it's possible once he gets the information from UGI and American Water if he can just e-mail a PDF file to IT and then maybe IT could scan that to our website and then at least we will have something , you know, some kind of information out there for the residents to know what street is being worked on and what the actual plan is. Granted , plans do change and we understand that, but maybe if we have something there that's at least a start and see if there is any feasibility in that. And finally , you know, it'd be awful for me not mention today, it's December 7 today, you know, every meeting we start off with thanking our servicemen and women of this country and, you know, that's the right thing to do, but on some of these, you know, whether it's Veteran 's Day, Memorial Day or December 7, you know, it just makes you think about that a little bit more. We all have military people in our life, whether it's a friend, a family, a father, a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 grandfather and some of them gave the ultimate sacrifice , and I want to take the next 10 seconds just to thank all of the active and retired military personnel that fight for our great country and their families . Let's not forget about the families that are left behind that are the backbone of our military and they really put up a strong fight sometimes just as strong a the people who get sent overseas . So I just want to thank them for that blanket of freedom that they give all of us that we get to live in every day and their bravery and sacrifice it never goes unnoticed so thank you. That's all. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Rogan? MR. ROGAN: Yes, just a couple of brief items. We did discuss this little bit in our caucus, city council , our attorney , Attorney Minora, has receive d the double pension scandal report from the state police so council members will be asked to -- there is going to be some documentation we have to sign before reviewing it, but we do have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that report and it's something I'm very anxious to read and over the couple of weeks between the end of this session and swearing in next year I'll be thoroughly examining that report. Again, we will be bound by certain legal restrictions on what we can say. For instance , if there was say a member of the Pension Board who was interviewed by the state police multiple times we couldn't mentions that person's name. We couldn't mention anything within that report naming names, anything of that nature, but what we can do is use that information to try and put reforms in place that will prevent this from happening again. We haven't seen -- as I mentioned , we haven't seen it yet. I have my suspicions on how this transpired , who the people who have committed possibly crimes that, unfortunately , because of statute of limitations they cannot be addressed as crimes, but it's our obligation to make sure that this doesn't happen again. So reviewing those reports are something that I will work on diligently over the next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 month or so. Mr. Bolus brought up an item tonight that is something that's been reported widely in the papers regarding casinos and mini-casino licenses within the State of Pennsylvania . I know there are some smaller towns that's been reported to have opposed these type of casinos . I think something like this would be great for the city. Drive down to Wilkes-Barre and see the economic development around -- in and around Mohegan Sun, not only for gaming, which people enjoy, but the restaurants , the jobs, so if there was ever an opportunity for either Mt. Airy or Mohegan Sun to open a satellite casino in the City of Scranton is something I would fully support . I know the mall has been always brought up as a site for that and really one floor of Boscov's is big enough for one of these mini-casinos . It's not going to be anything on the scale of what you see on Mt. Airy or at Mohegan Sun, but I think it would be an economic engine for the City of Scranton . So that's something I would support if that was able 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 to happen here in the city. And, finally , I would like to thank Mr. Bolus for, again, hosting his Christmas dinner, the dinner that Mr. Bolus holds at Christmas time and I know Mr. Piccolino does one every year for Thanksgiving , it's really what Scranton is all about, so I want to thank him for doing that for the community for 24 years and, again, as we had mentioned , anyone who doesn't have anyone to be with on Christmas go over to St. Pat's in West Side between 12 and 6 and all are welcome , so I just want to thank him. I'll address agenda items and the DPW contract and some other items as they come up. Thank you. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you, Mr. Rogan. Mr. Evans? MR. EVANS: Thank you. I'm going to briefly talk about one of the agenda items tonight , 7-A, which is a reduction in the real estate transfer tax. I think over the years we have all seen the negative impact of raising taxes. Over the decades we've sort of pushed ourselves well beyond the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 point of efficient returns with any attempt to raise taxes or fees in the city. It's more of an opportunity to achieve a second modest reduction in the real estate transfer tax which becomes more than a reduction and a nuisance tax. In many ways, it is a shift in the philosophy , one that I've espouse d on city council ever since I have been sitting in this seat. So while revenue projections for the real estate taxes at the end of the third quarter may be running slightly behind expectations , that is true for almost every tax and fee in that same time frame so it's not unusual , but I still feel the opportunity to reduce this tax and achieve equal of more revenue which is still very achievable from a one-year standpoint is certainly not enough to prove to disprove that theory. But more than that, I think we are trying to send a message that in the simplest terms Scranton is finally trying to be homeowner friendly , that they want to be once again a city of homeowners and that we are working toward that goal by reducing impediments where we can. We want to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 known that we are trying to grow with the real estate market, that we cannot continue to deal with policies in the past that have stunted growth for more than a generation . And, yes, we need to do more and find ways to be even -- by this sector anywhere we can because the city with a higher percentage of homeowners is a stable city, a cleaner city, a safer city and there are positive signs in the real estate market that it's happening . According to a report developed by the Greater Scranton Board of Realtors , in the City of Scranton over the last 12 months ending with the third quarter of 2017, new listing s were down 8.7 percent . That's a good thing because it's an indication of a stronger market and it begins a same old shift from a buyer's market to a seller's market, and that should bring about an increase in home prices, something we haven't seen in Scranton in quite awhile. Also, there are other signs that the real estate market in Scranton is improving . Pending sales are up 26 percent and closed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 sales are up 28.1 percent in that same timeframe , so I'm very encouraged by those numbers and the trends that they indicate , so I will continue to support this legislation and any opportunity we may have in the future to reduce or eliminate any tax or any fee that would help grow the city. That's all I have for now. Thanks. MR. WECHSLER : Thank you, Mr. Evans. I'd like to congratulate the officials of Lackawanna County and the people who ran the Marketplace at the Globe Store over the weekend, it was a great success . I know my wife took some of my money down there to visit. It worked quite well and I congratulate all of these people again and I'd also like to wish the Marketplace at Steamtown Mall on their prepared opening and hopefully they will have the same success as the organizers of the other event. The other night I had the pleasure , and I'd like to thank James May from PennDOT and also DPW Director Gallagher , Dennis Gallagher . They contacted me to arrange to have the veterans from the South Side VFP 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 being the last people to drive across the Harrison Avenue bridge. These men have given their time for the past 75 years in maintaining the Duffy statute and Duffy Park and I think it was a great honor to be the last ones to cross the bridge. And on Friday morning at 9 a.m. the city actually will take possession of the Harrison Avenue bridge, there will be a ribbon cutting at 9 a.m., and then as the weather turns better the bridge will have some final touches placed on it and the completion of Duffy Park will be probably towards the end of 2018. So it's nice to see that that project is getting completed . Just to follow-up on Councilman Rogan's comments about the casinos , the city has decided not to opt out. They would have to have say they did not want to participate in the small casino program so the city has not elected to opt out, so that will be a possibility in the future of the city of a small casino. Personally , myself, I would welcome a casino if it did not effect the current businesses and restaurants in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 city. My big concern about this would be people would stay in the casino and not come out to our bars and restaurants , so I would support it if it was add to our businesses and did not take away from that. That's all I have. MS. REED: 5-B. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 128, 2017 – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 6, 1976 ENTITLED "AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) IMPOSING A TAX FOR GENERAL REVENUE PURPOSES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 ON THE TRANSFER OF REAL PROPERTY SITUATE WITHIN THE CITY OF SCRANTON ; PRESCRIBING AND REGULATING THE METHOD OF EVIDENCING THE PAYMENT OF SUCH TAX; CONFERRING POWERS AND IMPOSING DUTIES UPON CERTAIN PERSONS , AND PROVIDING PENALTIES ", BY IMPOSING THE RATE OF THE REALTY TRANSFER TAX AT TWO AND TWO TENTHS PERCENT (2.2%) FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2018 AND THE SAME SHALL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT ANNUALLY THEREAFTER . MR. WECHSLER : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. EVANS: As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. ROGAN: Second. MR. WECHSLER : On the question ? MR. ROGAN: Yes, I'd just like to echo the comments that Councilman Evans mentioned earlier , and this is something that council really has been pushing hard for is the further reduction of the realty transfer tax. I would love to see the day that this tax is completely eliminated . We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 have a long way to go to get there, but this reduction , again, is going to help homeowners in the city that are looking to sell their homes, and more importantly it's going to help perspective buyers who are going to move into the city for the first time to help grow our tax base, so gladly two years in a row we were able to cut the realty transfer tax, hold the line on property taxes so we have things moving in the right direction . MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . As modest of a decrease that this might seem, not only does it add up for potential property owners in the city, but what it does I can personally it -- it sets a new goal, a new standard in the city. Whenever we want to roll back a tax, because we all believe , you know, taxes are too high and we pay an awful lot, I don't mind paying taxes for a service , but we always figure we could manage it a little bit better, but the very first thing you are go to hear is well, if you repeal a tax and we bring it down that money, that revenue has to be replaced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 somewhere and we always state that well, the tax will pay for itself with the bigger pie, we'll get more revenue based on people paying less because more people want to move into the city and I think that this on a small scale proves that point to us because this is not the first time we have reduced this tax this is the second year in a row we have been able to reduce this tax, so I'm hoping that this cascades into other areas of the city finance where we can actually some day take a look and start turning back some of these taxes.

PERRY: Yes, I just have one item on the question here, this is going to generate some revenue for us. What I would like to get with the Business Administrator and maybe set up a special account where we could use some of the funds from this to help pay for our street sign project . I know that's something that's been talked about a lot lately and it's all a question of where is the money going to come from. I know the administration talked about performing a study of just a study based on cost and maybe we can just bypass if this money already hasn't been allocated for some other use, so that's something I would like to get with the new business administrator with and see if we can set something up for 2018. MR. EVANS: Yes, on the question , I would certainly support that because I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 it's is a great idea and what's nice about this is it's an annual fee that we are going to be getting so something we could work on annually, and constantly upgrade or street signs so that would be a great idea.

MR. WECHSLER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-J. MR. ROGAN: Second. MR. WECHSLER : On the question ? MR. ROGAN: Yes, on the question , this item is the Department of Public Works contract , I don't think there has been a councilman in recent city history that's been more critical of the DPW at times than I have, so I spent a long time reviewing this contract and although there are some provisions in there that I wish weren't and there are some other things that I'm not 100 percent happy with, overall this is a very fair contract . Again, it's minimal pay increases , 2 percent for our DPW workers . Most importantly in this contract , which I think is a must for all future contracts in the city is random drug testing for DPW employees . This has already been put into place within our fire department and it's been very successful and we in our caucus tonight discussed that a little bit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 more about how the drug testing would be run and it would be completely done at random, but it's very important , especially with having employees driving heavy equipment throughout the city that we are sure that our work force isn't using drugs, and it is something that needs to be applied to every department in the city not only DPW. So that's something that was put into this contract that is new, that is a big change so that's something that I certainly support . And the other reason why I'm going to support this legislation is over the last four years the DPW in my opinion has improved quite a bit. One of my biggest gripes in the past with the public works, and still a problem sometimes but it has improved quite a bit is when residents contact myself and my colleagues with problems that when we send them to the director or many times an employee they get done, but in the past that wasn't the case. So there are some members of the DPW I do want to thank by name, I know there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 a number of other others that work hard every day, but Denny Gallagher , the director , has helped me with numerous citizen 's requests during the course of the year. The person that's probably done the most is Larry Wynn, I mentioned him and thanked him a number of time at these meetings so I wanted to thank him. Gene Reed, who is technically the DPW employee , I believe he falls under a different union, but he works at DPW. Bill Slocum and, of course, Tim Gilroy are guys who have helped out with the citizen 's request that I had so I want to take the chance to thank all of them for their hard work for our city and I will be voting "yes" on this contract . MR. EVANS: On the question , the city solicitor met with us in caucus prior to our meeting tonight and we had several questions , one related to what impact what the contract have on storm water management if this city decided to retain management as part of the DPW or if the storm authority was created by the city or if a storm water authority was created in a more regional 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 approach . Also, we have concerns -- well, I had concerns about the garbage study being done and if we decided to go with a per bag or hybrid system would there be any restrictions , so we were assured by the city solicitor that there are no restrictions in the contract or any of those issues so that is one of the main reasons I will be voting in the affirmative as well. MR. WECHSLER : I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the administration and the union leadership at DPW. I believe this contract was negotiated fairly, give and take on both sides, and I do think it resulted in a fair contract to both the workers and to the taxpayers . Roll call, please. MS.

MR. WECHSLER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-L. MR. ROGAN: Second. MR. WECHSLER : On the question ? MR. PERRY: Yes, I'm sorry, on the question . We tabled this and I'm not against having a park but what I'm for is having as many properties that we have on the city tax rolls for obvious reasons so I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 know that's something in many causes that we have while we have we kicked this idea and around and the bottom line is this property has been for sale and on the market for over ten years and to say that the market for this property was cold would be an understatement . So there was no way to move this property . If we could, it could have been sold and already on the tax rolls, so now we are left with the options of what are we going to do with it. Now, there was another question of purchasing it first but we have to have title of it to apply for the grants, that's the understanding and that was the explanation that we have for our grants, the county grants have to come together and we cannot apply for them until we own it. So I'm going to be for this project . I think the green space will be beautiful , but I would have rather have a business on that property but it just wasn't going to happen and this is a good Plan B. MR. ROGAN: This is a piece of legislation I struggled with quite a bit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 because as Councilman Perry mentioned I want to see this developed privately . I do not want to see a park put in this location . On the other side is the background on this piece of property is that this was a large mistake by the Doherty administration when they agreed to remediate this land. Because of that, it resulted in a lawsuit . From talking to the city solicitor , and I want to thank the city solicitor for informing council every step of the way on this, the unfortunate truth on this is that it would cost more to fight it out in Court and to go down that path than to settle the suit by this piece of legislation . I will be voting "yes" for the legislation for that reason and that reason only. I would like the city to try to market the property in the meantime , to try to find a suitable developer that would be interested in the property even if means selling it at a loss to get it keep it on the tax rolls and have that developed , so that is something that I will be discussing with the mayor and his administration but, unfortunately , at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 time there really is only one decision and it is to pass this legislation to settle that lawsuit . Again, for those who don't know, Mayor Doherty did agree in writing to remediate this property and the city did not fulfill their duty, that's why there is a lawsuit over this piece of land and that's why we are where we are. I know there is a good amount of support for putting a park there. Again, I don't know if I'm sold on that idea, I would like to see it developed , but the lawsuit does need to be settled , and it's been my longstanding position with many of these items that when it comes to lawsuits the city never comes out on the right side of them so getting this settled I think is the best course of action for the taxpayers and I do want to strongly urge the mayor and the administration to consider using this piece of land as an economic development tool to try and lure our business into the city. Like I said, even if means selling this at a loss. MR. EVANS: On the question , I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 probably going to repeat some of the things my colleagues have said already , but the conditions that lead to the city's purchase of this land basically are as follows : We have (a), a pending lawsuit by the current owners. "(B), we have a property that has been exposed to the real estate market on and off for maybe eight to ten years with no takers. (C), the lack of reassessment make it extremely to develop commercial parcels and build new commercial construction in the city. So my solution is pretty simple, certainly I would prefer this property be developed as a mixed use, a personal project that was stated by my colleagues , but that would always be number one in my eyes, but the reality is the current climate does not allow for that and the market has spoken. After 1,782 days actually on the market and a purchase price that is 35 percent less than the purchase price that was paid by the owners, it's time to make a deal. Because of all of that, I feel the alternative for this land be used as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 pocket park downtown while part of Scranton Tomorrow has development is a sound solution to a very unique situation so I will be supporting this legislation to purchase this parcel of land at Linden and Wyoming . MR. WECHSLER : Yes. I'll also be voting for this legislation . Just to kind of recap what was said, in order for the county to do any remediation at that site that property does have to be in the hands of the city ora a nonprofit. Once the city takes possession of that land, it also opens up an opportunity for some more grants from the state to also develop that area. And I also think, as Councilman Rogan mentioned , this is going to be an opportunity actually for the city and the county to begin discuss what we are going to do with the empty spaces in our current commercial buildings when the county moves into the Globe Store. As everyone is quite aware, there are several offices in the county that take up a lot of office space and buildings throughout the city, and I think although a new office building there may have been a good idea at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 one time, we going to have come up with some type of idea to start marketing the empty offices that are going to be left behind when the county moves. I know some of them are going to become apartments and maybe some retail space, but we are going to have to concentrate between the city at Scranton Tomorrow , Lackawanna County, and the State to come up with a way to start filling some of our empty spaces that are going to be opening up as we move into next year.
