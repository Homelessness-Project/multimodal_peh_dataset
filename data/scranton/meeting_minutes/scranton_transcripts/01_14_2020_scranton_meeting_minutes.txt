GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one. The PA Department of Conservation and Natural Resources recognizes one river annually as their river of the year. This recognition is done to raise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 awareness of the important recreational ecological historical resources associate d with the state's river and streams . And the Lackawanna River is one of this year's nominees . The Lackawanna was in the lead through last Friday. So if you haven't already, please take the time to vote for the Lackawanna River as River of the Year at PA river of the year dot org. Voting ends this Friday, January 17th at 5 p.m. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have an announcement as well. On this Saturday , January 18th, we will be starting at 11 a.m., in Wilkes-Barre. There's going to be a Northeast Pennsylvania Women's March that I will be speaking at as well as Mayor Cognetti . So I just wanted to make the public aware that if anyone was interested in attending that march and that is going to be hosted by NEPA Now, the national organization for women, Action Together , and Northeast PA and NEPA. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few. First, ECTV announced the schedule of broadcast times for City Council meetings as follows : So our meetings have changed obviously from Monday nights to Tuesday nights. Our caucuses on Tuesdays will start at 5:45. The public is always welcome to attend. And our regular meeting s will start at 6:30. Tuesdays , this meeting will be live. Wednesday s, it will be shown on ECTV at 10 a.m., Thursday at 2:30 p.m., Friday at 10 p.m., Saturday , 12 noon, and Sunday at 8 p.m. Next Monday, January 20th, City Hall will be closed in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. The DPW is also off on this day. So refuse and red recycling container s will be a day behind next week. Next Tuesday , January 21st, there will be a public hearing at 6:15 p.m. for item 5-B on tonight 's agenda, closing a portion of Blucher Avenue between Beech Street and Birch Street on East Mountain . I have two other announcements which I think will be well received . And I'm glad 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Miss Hodowanitz that you are sitting down for the first one. The 2018 audit has been received today in Council 's office. Council just received the audit. So obviously we have not had a chance to go through . And I'll go through it. It will be in Third Order next week. So it will be on our agenda. There's a copy at the front desk in the Clerk's office. So if anyone wants to go through and take a look at it you're more than welcome to do that. Also, I wanted to announce that it's my understanding the gas card audit which was a point of contention last year, the contract has been signed with the Moretti firm December 26th. And there will be a meeting soon with the administration about that audit. And they have already started preliminary work as far as I know. The only other thing I want to mention is I would request anyone that comes up to speak at the meeting , please just state your name for the record for our stenographer . And also, if you have a request for information from Council , if you could just whether you put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 it in writing , whether you write a note and give it to our office secretary , Kathy Carrera and put your name and e-mail or your phone number, we would like in this new year to track any request s that come through so that we can have a record of it. So if you do have a lengthy request and it's, you know, not something simple that we can just answer right off the bat on the agenda, I would ask that you put it in writing . You could send one of us an e-mail because we are going to start tracking that. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items or matters of general concern : Mayor Paige Cognetti Mary Joe Sheridan John Bravo Thomas Coyne Les Spindler Lee Morgan Len Srebro 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Joan Hodowanitz Marie Schumacher Dave Dobrzyn Norma Jeffries ) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : And, Mr. Rogan, do you have any comments tonight ? MR. ROGAN: Yes, just a couple brief comments . First, I'd like to thank Mayor Cognetti for coming to our caucus and our meeting tonight . I'm looking forward to working with her and hoping to have an open dialog on a number of issues. I'd also like to thank her and commend her for -- with her cabinet picks. It would be very easy for a new Mayor to come in here and just say I'm cleaning house. I'm getting rid of everyone , whether they do a good job or not because I'm new. We've seen that happen with previous administration s in the past. So I do want to commend her and her transition team for keeping many key employees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 that have done a great job through various administrations over the last few years. So that's something that I think that is very good. On the other side, the emergency certificate for the no bid contract for the 511 appeal, I do have some serious concerns . I do think our caucus today was very helpful . I've been on Council a long time, believe it or not longer than everyone else on the board combined . This is the first time I've ever seen an emergency certificate for legal services . When the appeal -- when the City lost the case at the time, Mayor Evans was Mayor. And I remember talking with him quite a number of times during this period about the status of the appeal. And at the time Mayor Evans related to me that the appeal is ready. We just have to run it down to be filed. What changed between then and now I'm uncertain on. Obviously an emergency to prepare the appeal to file it I would fully support . I think every one would. But there is no question that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 City has to appeal the case. As far as picking a law firm for a case that may last many years and may cost -- I think will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees without a bidding process I think is something that should be revisited . If it is the idea of strictly for the filing of the appeal which has been done, again, I support that. That's an emergency . Nobody is saying that the City should not appeal the case. What I do think should happen though is that it is put out to bid and all these other firms are given an opportunity to bid on it. Again, it's unfortunately the City's history with lawsuits and court proceeding s is not a good one. The arbitration award for our City Police and Fire dragged out in the courts through years, cost the City millions of dollars just in the court award and then the legal fees were astronomical . I know there was a question about if there's a cap. I don't believe there is. I think these type of contracts are typically a dollar amount. So it would be "X" amount per 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 hour. I do know from the memo we received that was negotiated . And it does sound like the rate may be favorable compare d to the other -- I don't want to say bidders but the two other firms that were interviewed . There's a lot of legal firms out there. And again, I know Council is going to receive something to put a rubber stamp on as far as an approval goes. But really, the process should have played out through the RFP process and through our bid process . I don't know -- even know if Council 's vote under an emergency certificate is even meaningful . Typically when we see an emergency certificate used is we have a massive snowstorm that comes in. DPW can't handle it. The Mayor calls up whatever company . They put people in. I never seen an emergency certificate come to Council for approval on a contract . Legislation emergency certificates we get all the time to pass legislation through one reading . But I've never seen it used in this manner. Again, it had to be filed. There's no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 question about that. I just think the previous Mayor had it ready to go through the legal department . I understand the change in strategy from using our internal attorneys to using outside attorneys . I understand it and probably -- it probably is the best course of action because our city solicitor and her team have a number of issues to work on. So I'm not disagreeing with the strategy or the reasoning behind it. But I do think -- and I know Councilman McAndrew asked the question to our solicitor in the caucus if it could have been filed by the City directly and then another team takes over, which I think is the best course of action. That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Rogan. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a few. Thank you. As Chairman of Public Safety, I would like to give a shout-out to our first responders for last week's events. First being the heroic efforts of Scranton firefighter , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Bill Walsh and the Ice Rescue Team for saving a deer that fell through the ice at Moosic Lake. Great job. Secondly , shout-out and thank you to the brave men and women of the Scranton Police Department and surrounding area police departments for National Law Enforcement Day, which was last Thursday . So once again a big thank you to our hometown heros. I would also like to speak to the emergency declaration . So I posed this question in the back like Councilman Rogan just said. And my question was pretty much, okay, the decision -- I understand the sense of urgency with regards to the appeal, of course. So but the decision came down on the 16th. My question -- and I'm going to pose it again, Solicitor Hayes, to you so the public is informed because I had a question . And I wanted it answered and some rational e. And my question was, why didn't the current solicitor start the appeal process , get it started? I know it had to be started to give us some wiggle room or some time to actually put it out to bid, the legal service s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that are going to be required because it appears to me that it's more reactive than proactive . ATTY. HAYES: Councilman McAndrew , my understanding is that the prior administration -- and I was not part of these discussions -- made the determination that they wanted the incoming Mayor to have the ability to decide whether to proceed with the appeal and to select -- be involved in the selection of counsel who would take up the appeal. So the current Mayor was presented with, you know, a circumstance where she was appointed -- or she assumed office on January the 6th, the appeal is due January the 14th. Obviously she had no options other than the one that she pursued at that time. I can't tell you as to why notice of appeal was not filed prior to Mayor Cognetti assuming office. But that's my understanding as to why -- that was part of the rational e as far as I know is leave it to the new Mayor to make the decision as to whether she wants to pursue the appeal and to be involved in the selection of counsel .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. I also have a request to Mrs. Reed. I've had a couple inquiries to me with regards to the splash pad at Novembrino Pool Complex . Could you please reach out or craft a letter to Tom Preamble of OECD for an update and a timeline , if you would do that for me, please? Thank you. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have no comments at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I was extremely disappoint ed in Auditor General Eugene DePasquale 's statement that budget cuts may prevent his office from conducting a performance audit of the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority after the Sewer Authority Board finally invited the AG to come in and perform the audit. Two years ago the Auditor General issued a statement supporting a bill that would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 give his office the power to independently audit municipal authorities in which he stated that if he was given that power, first municipal authority he would audit would be Scranton . So if he thought it was that important two years ago, what has changed in the last two years? I agree with Councilman Gaughan 's statement s that were in the paper along with the article that this audit can finally put this issue to bed by providing answers to resident s in the City. And it also could provide a guide to municipal authorities across the state who are in discussion s to do the same thing that we do. So, therefore , I would like to make a motion for Council to send a letter to the Auditor General to urge him to find the resources necessary to finally perform this audit. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I'd like to say something on the question . As a school 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 director , I embrace the Auditor General audits that were conduct ed. I embraced the findings and the recommendation s. I too don't understand why an audit on the Scranton Sewer Authority sale would not be a priority at the state level because of its magnitude even with the reduction of their staff. So the first request , I hope that was a save the date and we're sending another invitation . And I hope he comes in with at least plus one or a few more. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I would agree. I think as I stated in the past, I do think, you know, this is something that both the Dunmore Council , the Scranton Council and the Dunmore -- current Dunmore Mayor Tim Burke has been pushing for. I understand that it was out of the Auditor General 's control that his staff was cut by the Republican control led legislature . However , I do think that whatever resources the Auditor General can put towards the audit, it is important . I think it's important to this Council . It's important to the Dunmore 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Council . And it's important to all of the ratepayers in both Dunmore and Scranton . So I agree with sending the followup letter asking the Auditor General maybe for a timeline on when he might make a decision and just expressing how important again this is to both the Council of Scranton and of Dunmore . Anybody else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. MR. DONAHUE : That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Well, thank you everyone for coming out tonight . I have a few comments . In regards to the Act 511 emergency declaration that just came down, I just want to make a few points because I think the issue is being -- it's a more complicated issue than it's being made out to be. I look at it two ways. The decision from the judge came down on I think December 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 16th. So in a perfect world, let's just say that the previous administration under Wayne Evans had issued an RFQ and they had one ready to go for appellate legal services . That takes weeks to get the bids in to review the bids. Then that would have to come before Council . That takes a minimum of three weeks. So there is at least two or three months there. The deadline to appeal was January 14th. So in my view after all the facts that I've looked at and in my conversations with the administration , the alternative would be to not file an appeal and be faced with a 50 million dollar judgment which, of course, we don't have 50 million dollars . So the alternative in my opinion would be devastating . As I mentioned in the newspaper , is it an ideal situation ? No. And I think Mayor Cognetti made that point tonight . It is certainly not an ideal situation to start off the new year with an emergency declaration . Is it an absolute necessity ? Yes. Will we have to pay legal fees? Yes. But the alternative is, you know, instead of paying tens of thousand s or hundreds of thousands in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 legal fees, we're going to have to pay 50 million dollars . And that's still up in the air on whether , you know, on how the case is going to work out. So I do think it's important the logistics of it obviously was explain ed in the memo that was receive d by Council . And I'm hopeful that this firm comes in and argues successfully on behalf of the City. One of the things that I've heard over the last few days from people is the, you know, the City should just file bankruptcy . Again, this issue is not as simple as the City filing bankruptcy . There is a process that has to be followed . If for some reason this judgment or the appeal didn't work in the City's favor, you don't just go into bankruptcy . You have to go into receiver ship first. We're exiting by all accounts Act 47 in the summer. So again, this is a very complicated issue. And I feel very comfortable having this law firm with Judge Vanaskie who was an appeal's judge on the team to argue this case. So that's all I have to say on the Act 511 declaration . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I just want to check through a few things that are left over from 2019. So I had the opportunity to speak earlier this afternoon to Director of Licensing and Inspections , Tom Oleski. And one of the question s that I had asked him was regarding Barry Isett. Barry Isett is a company that the City hired to go into the Licensing and Inspections Office and basically perform an assessment, what's, you know, what's working , what's not working and make recommendations . I was concerned to find out that the Director has not had any contact with Barry Isett yet. I know in the past Council has requested updates from this company . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could get in contact with the administration and Barry Isett and find out exactly what is going on with the contract . The contract was signed months ago. So I believe that work should have started . So if you could find out exactly what's going on with that. In regards to the recycling , several people brought it up to me over the last few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 months and, Miss Schumacher , you brought it up tonight . I think in terms of communication with the public, the honest answer is the City dropped the ball. I think moving forward -- I'm hopeful with this new administration that people are apprised of exactly what's going on. As it was delineated in the newspaper quite clearly , the City knew about this months and months and months ago. So there is some kind of disconnect between the, you know, the department s and the administration getting the information out to the public. So as Councilman Donahue reiterated tonight , I think that is being worked on and we should see a plan hopefully quickly because people have questions . One of the things that I brought up before that I think is a good idea and I have talked in the past to Mayor Cognetti about it is using different avenues for communication with resident s. We talked here for the last two years about SeeClickFix a program that would track requests that come in from the public. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I think the City should use social media more. There are several people on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram. So I do think that there is a lot of ways that the City could improve communication s. And I'm really hopeful that will take place under this new administration . As I mention ed at the top of the meeting , one of the issues that was present at Council meeting s for months and months and months was the gas card audit. As I stated, it's my understanding that the contract was signed December 26th. The firm Moretti has requested a meeting apparently with the Mayor and administration and the Controller 's Office. And it's my understanding that they've already started to compile information and start the audit. So, Mrs. Reed, I would just appreciate it if you could send something to Moretti asking them to keep Council updated on their progress and what the timeline looks like because I know several of us are interested in that. As I mentioned also at the top of the meeting , the 2018 audit we finally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 received . I would like, Mrs. Reed, if you could send correspondence on my behalf as I had asked in 2019 asking that an exit conference be held with the auditors with the business administrator in a public caucus so that we can start that as a regular occurrence . And I believe -- and I've always said that that should have happened in the past but it never did. So I think to gain an understand ing of the audit, any finding s I haven't looked through it yet because we just receive d it today. I think that is a good idea. Council received a December 17th, 2019 letter address ed to Dave Bulzoni from the Department of Environmental Protection regarding the Stafford Meadowbrook Flood Protection Project . Mrs. Reed, if you could please get in touch with Mr. Gallagher and I'll fill Councilman Donahue on this as well. There was several issues with the project that was found to be were minimally acceptable by DEP. So if we can find out what the work schedule is for this project and I'd 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 also like to know when they're going reassess their current maintenance plan and implement measures that will keep the project operational and protect its integrity . So if we can send that out this week I would appreciate it. Also Mr. Coyne came tonight . I know the last time you were here, Mr. Coyne, you had posed a question regarding our IT Department . That letter was sent on December 20th, 2019 with a transition that may have fallen through the cracks. So, Mrs. Reed, we didn't receive a response yet. But if we can send that again and ask for a response no later than the end of business -- the end of business Friday of next week. We also -- Council requested on December 20th a meeting with Rainey and Rainey which is the audit prep firm that works with the City. Mrs. Reed, if you could please send a letter directly to Rainey and Rainey and copy the new business administrator on it asking for a meeting caucus as soon as possible to discuss the issues that occurred with the development and the finishing of the 2018 audit. I know this is something that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Councilwoman Dempsey was on and talked about often. And I think it's important that we don't let this go and we get answers as to exactly what occurred . I know there is two sides to every story. So I'd like to make sure that is out in the open. As I mentioned to Miss Hodowanitz or Mr. Schumacher , we received an MS4 inspection report. And there were seven violations noted in the compliance inspection report. I would like, Mrs. Reed, if you could get in touch with Mr. King, our City Planner and Mr. Gallagher and ask them what the status of the MS4 permit application exactly is. I know the way we left it off in 2019 was there was a ten day extension . And I also requested Friday in my meeting with the administration that Council is updated by Herbert , Rowland & Grubic, the company that was working on stormwater measures with the City that they be brought in for a caucus since we did sign a contract with them and that they give us an update. I think it's important . It's the next big issue that the City is going to face. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 And I would like to be ahead of the curve there so everyone is on the same page. One of the things that Councilwoman Dempsey sent a letter back in either at the end of October , early November asking how many signed Ethics Code acknowledges were outstanding from City employees and what, if anything , the administration would do if they were not signed. As far as I know, we did not receive any response from the previous administration on that letter. Mrs. Reed, if you could please send that letter out again on my behalf and ask that a response be provided no later than the end of business Friday of next week. I'd also like to request a copy of the RFP or RFQ that the City put out for health insurance services with Millennium administrators . Again, going back to Councilwoman Dempsey , she had brought up several concerns regarding healthcare costs for the City. We received an e-mail on Monday, December 16th regarding healthcare costs that the City had incurred . To date, we're at 17.2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 million dollars . And as Councilwoman Dempsey stated that at the time something must be done on these costs and done soon. And her words, the costs were outrageous and unmanaged in her review. I would like to request as Councilwoman Dempsey did a -- at least a quarterly analysis from Millennium administrators , what they're recommending whether it be quarterly , short term, long-term to control or reduce these healthcare costs. I think it's one of -- really one of the big issues that the City has faced in the past and that we're going to face moving into the future. So we need to stay on top of that. I requested on November 20th of 2019, a letter to be sent out to the former fire chief regarding emergency management -- the Emergency Management Plan. I had posed several questions regarding the copy of the Emergency Management Multiyear Training Plan, a copy of pertinent plan documents , exercises related to relevant hazards and threats . We did not receive a response to that request. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 another request to the new acting Fire Chief, Al Lucas and ask that he respond no later than next Friday end of business . One of the issues that we encountered at the end of 2019, I just met with a neighbor over on Third Avenue regarding this again is truck traffic on Third Avenue. One of the issues is the Elm Street bridge has been posted. So there are trucks coming out -- salt trucks coming out of the plant behind Danny's Garage there on Elm Street. And instead of going over the bridge, now they are going down to Third Avenue. So needless to say, this is a residential area. There is a lot of homes on this street, young families and elderly people. And it's been a major disruption to their lives. So I met last night with one of the neighbor s who's kind of leading the charge over there. And City Engineer John Pocius also met with us. So I am going to ask, Mrs. Reed, if you could send correspond ence to Mr. Pocius asking for a formal review of this situation and asking for his opinion in writing on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 whether or not traffic can be redirected off of Third Avenue onto Railroad Avenue and they could take a right down Broadway Street. That's kind of the -- one of the solution s that was discussed . Again, I think a lot of things here have to be hashed out, one of which may be the possible repeal or amendment of ordinance File of Council No. 29 from 1995 which prohibit ed truck traffic in the Bellevue area on several streets. So we may if we go that route depending on what comes back from the City Engineer 's Office, we may have to repeal or amend the ordinance from 1995. So I'd like you to look at it and Solicitor Hayes when you get a chance. And as I stated, meeting with the gentleman yesterday and Mr. Pocius in speaking to the neighbors , in fact, I had, I don't know, three or four missed called today -- they called the office from Third Avenue. It is an issue. So I would like that to be addressed . Also, late this afternoon -- and I sent an e-mail to Mrs. Reed. I receive d a call from a resident in the 600 block of North Main 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Avenue. This resident explain ed that there is a field behind her home off of Powderly Court that is literally sinking into the ground. The holes have become so bad that it's consuming trees and other debris nearby. This resident and other residents are concerned that the sinking ground is moving towards their homes off of Main Avenue. So I asked Mrs. Reed if she would send something , official correspondence to the DPW to assess the situation . The neighbors aren't sure if the land off the Powderly Court is, in fact, owned by the City or someone else. Nevertheless , this situation in their opinion is so dangerous that it warrants immediate attention from City officials . And the last thing I'll end with tonight is the rental registration issue that Miss Schumacher brought up. So there is a lengthy memo, Miss Schumacher , that -- and I'm sure others are interested that Mr. Oleski, the Director of Licensing and Inspections had sent. Council , we received it January 3rd, 2020. It was dated December 29th, 2019. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 He goes onto explain how that whole debacle and fiasco as you put it happened. To answer one of your questions without going through the whole memo here, the cost of postage to send out the delinquent rental registration letters via certified mail and regular US mail was $29,745.50. This will be placed in Third Order and will be on our agenda for next week. So anyone that's interested could take a look at it. In the meantime , if anyone wants a copy of it, that could certainly be accommodated as well. Other than that, I don't have anything . And we can move forward with the meeting . Thank you. MS.
