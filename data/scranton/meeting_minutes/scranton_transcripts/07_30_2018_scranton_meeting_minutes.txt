PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I'm going to be voting "no". I'm going to detail additional reasons why I don't think we should bring this back for a final vote because there are discrepancies between Mr. Abrahamsen 's firm's first submittal , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 supplemental submittal and his second supplemental submittal and, quite frankly , I mean, I think this is ridiculous that we are going to allow a law firm to do work with the city with their track record over the last few years so I'll be voting "no" and have an explanation at the end of the meeting .

Also, what is being billed as Lackawanna Arts weekend , downtown will be a pretty exciting place this weekend . This Friday, of course, is First Friday. Always a great event. There is also the 14th 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 annual Scranton Jazz Festival on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

Thank you. MR.

Refuse and recycling will one day behind the week of that holiday . MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment as follows : Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Gerard Hetman spoke on matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Al Young spoke on city business .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes. Thank you. Well, first, Mr. Young, the last time we spoke things were going in the right direction . I mean, it's -- I'm heartbroken. I don't know the ins and out of decisions or the legality of it, but that's a phone call I'll definitely make to find out one way or the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 other because as far as I know any time anything has been put in front of us we have done nothing about taken care of it as fast as we could to help your issue and to hear all of these snags come back on a legal issue it's very disheartening and I know I don't just speak for myself on this I speak for all of us when we hear this. It's just-- I mean, this has been going on too long and I'll make phone calls or go take a visit, take a walk today and see if I can at least get my head around why the ping pong game, I don't understand it. But I can't talk too intelligently about it because I don't know all of the ins and outs yet. With that said, there is an issue on the 3200 block, the end of the 3200 block of Powell Court. There is a blocked storm drain. I don't know if it's a single or dual use so I don't know the responsibility , if it lies on us or the water company , so if we can make our first step to get the ball rolling and send that off to public works for a site check. I actually have some pictures , Lori, I'll e-mail with them with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 you with the request and they can get out there but I know this it's blocked solid. There is just no room for anything . I wasn't even sure there was a drain there. I was there a couple of times to take pictures and it was just puddle, puddle, puddle and then finally after a week or two of dry spells I actually saw the drain. Also, my city e-mail has been hit or miss with me most of the summer. It was working good for a little while, but I just got a bunch in all at once so I'm going to answer all of these e-mails today after the meeting but if you would, if anybody doesn't want to contact me if you would use an alternate e-mail so it's a little bit more reliable and that e-mail address is timperryccv@hotmail .com. Timperryccv@ hotmail .com, and that way I can just be little bit more fluent with the e-responses and not, you know, have to wait until, you know, when the city e-mail address wants to work. And that's all I have for right now. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : The only thing I have, Mrs. Reed, would you able to send a letter to the Law Department requesting an update on what's going on, to set up a meeting to request an update on what's going on with the Young property ? That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: A few. First of all, my understanding the reassessment is revenue neutral in the first year and 5 percent in the year following a reassessment , which could be normal for any city or municipality to be allowed to do that. As far the HUP test and reassessment I don't think they're mutually exclusive , I think actually a reassessment helps with a HUP test because we are going to be identifying properties as we go. I don't disagree that we should be doing that now. The administration is responsible for that. I have chided them on several occasions to do that and I'll continue to do that as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 well. To my knowledge , the only entity that ever has done that is Allegheny County so we would be the first, at least on this side of the state, to challenge the properties and see if they should be classified as non-tax exempt via the HUP test. On the AirBnB, the funding is in place for a new zoning code. The RFP is out and we expect that be to started either the last quarter of this year or the first quarter of 2019. The information Marie has been asking for, I have it, I received it via e-mail. I didn't get a response yet from Evan, but as soon as I get a response I'll let you know as well. On another topic, today I'm going to talk a little bit about the subject of smaller locally owned businesses and what I'm going to discuss today is another outgrowth of the idea session , as a matter of fact, that was mentioned before on small business . To that point, I'm going to periodically propose policy changes within the City of Scranton that will help and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 enhance our existing and small business community . First, I would like to expand on what a locally owned business means to our community . I think we can all agree that they certainly play a central role in any healthy city and are among the best economic engines that drive a city to advancing growth and opportunity . Small business ownership has historically been a pathway to the middle class for generations of Americans and Scrantonians alike and it continues to be a vital tool for expanding prosperity . According to the Institute for Local Self Reliance , there are five key reasons that we should all support the small and locally owned business community . By the way, when I use the word "we" I mean we as local public official s. Number one, local small businesses are linked to higher incomes and less inequality . Number two, an entrepreneurship fuels job creation . Three, independent businesses generate more tax revenue at a lower public cost. Four, local businesses foster community cohesion and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 well-being; and, five, community scaled businesses reduce pollution and improve environmental sustainability . So the first policy change I would like to discuss is the purchasing and procurement policy of the City of Scranton . Studies have shown that when local governments purchase goods and services from local independent businesses there is a positive feedback loop that is created which increase s economic activity , employment and tax revenue . So in effect you are using the tool of city spending to foster economic development by sourcing products and services locally. To that end, I have asked BA Bulzoni to review the City's current purchasing and procure ment policy with an eye towards buying more locally. It is my understanding that we're doing some of that now, but I'm not aware of a formal policy to that effect that is currently in place. I hope to have something to report on when we return from our recess and I am confident that is something we can easily achieve . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Also, the concept may be a great opportunity for the shared services committee working with the school district . It shouldn 't always be about the low price for a product or service . As I noted earlier , keeping our money local allows it to be recycled within in our community , within our city and a lower public cost and results clearly indicate that many economic benefits beyond a lower price are created by simply buying local. Again, I can't stress enough how important maintaining and growing our locally owned small business community is. It is our responsibility to remove government obstacles and to encourage their growth in every way we can. We should all be absolutely committed to making this happen. A quick note on parking , especially downtown . I'd like to remind everyone that on street parking in the downtown is free after 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and all day and evenings Saturday and Sunday. During those timeframes there are hundreds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and hundreds and hundreds of free parking spaces throughout the downtown so please take advantage of that and visit our businesses and restaurants , shop, stop for dinner, even take a yoga class, whatever you want to do, we have a diverse and interesting downtown as well as a diverse neighborhood commercial area so please advantage of all that we have to offer and check that out. And I have the rest for agenda items. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First comment that I'd like to make is in regards to Mr. Young and, obviously , we have talked about this for the last few years, which is troubling and concerning in and of itself. The bottom line here is and, Mr. Young, I've had numerous conversations with you, he is being held hostage basically in his own home. Number one, because there is a big hole in his backyard ; number two, because he couldn't sell his home if even if he tried; and number three, it's my belief that once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 lawyers get involved common sense sometimes goes out the window. It was quite sometime ago when Mr. Young came to council . The city deemed that an emergency , which it is, it is a public safety emergency , anyone who has not seen his backyard and hasn't seen the proximity to an alley which is right behind his property and the children that play in that neighbor hood would understand that it is a major, major hazard. So the fact that here we are years later still waiting for the city to make a move, and I understand the complex ity of the situation because of the Meadow Brook Creek project , but the emergency takes precedent over that. We have had conversations with the administration , we thought we were getting some place, and as Mr. Young pointed out, you take one step forward and five steps back. It's my belief that -- I agree with Mr. Young that the five of us, five council members , need to go to the mayor and demand that he settle this once and for all. Get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 rid of the attorneys , get rid of the lawsuits , and take care of the issue because if this was in your backyard or if it was in anybody else's backyard you would expect the same. So I would ask that the five of my colleagues call the mayor, set up a meeting and let's get in issue taken care of once and for all. My last comment is about the caucus that we had this afternoon with the Pennsylvania Economy League. First of all, it's my belief that the caucus should have been more than a half hour. It's not nearly enough time, I had an additional questions that I was not able to get it, so that's number one. Number two, I asked for this caucus months ago and it is completely unacceptable that not one person from the administration bothered to show up and sit at that table and answer questions . I asked not only for the Pennsylvania Economy League to come but for the mayor and the business administrator because they are the ones that are crafting the budget. You know, it's not like we are talking about installing a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 sidewalk at Mt. Pleasant , we are talking about the financial stability of the city over the next few years and our exit from Act 47. So the fact that -- and I understand Mr. Bulzoni had a prior commitment and he did show up at the end and sat in the audience , but it's unacceptable that no one from the city bothered to come and answer any questions or chime in on the city's financial health over the next few years. It was also really concerning to me as we checked through some of the recommendations in the exit plan that there was either a non-answer from PEL or the fact that they didn't know what the progress was from the city or that there was no progress . There are simple things in that plan from the debt management policy to the fact, and this goes back to 2015, to get all of the ordinances and regulations and rules from the Pennsylvania Boards and create a governance policy, and still we are here in 2018 and there is none so that's concerning . So, you know, I hope that when we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 come back in September before we get into the budget that we can ask PEL and the mayor and the business administrator to come back before many council so that we can have these conversations and so we can understand where we are going to be in the next two or three years as we exit Act 47. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple of comments . The double pension was brought up again, and unfortunately , crafting legislation takes a lot longer than we would like but it is something that's continuing to be worked on and there will be legislation , that much I can guarantee you to put reforms in place to stop the double pension situation from happening again and this is something I have been working on, geez, probably over two years at this point. Unfortunately , it does take a while. It took us a year just to get the state police report so it is something that we are still actively working on. The second item, which is one that a lot of other towns have done and a couple of people brought it up to me, a number of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 other towns around Scranton have banners on a lot of their main streets for hometown heroes, and I think that's a great program, it's something I think we should look at doing. It's a great way to honor our veterans and really it also spruces up those streets . When you drive down some of the streets in surrounding communities that have those hometown hero banners not only is it an honor to the veterans , their families , a measure of pride and it makes the streets look nice. So if my colleagues would agree, I'd like to send a letter to the administration asking that the city look into some type of hometown heros program . It might be something we want to partner with maybe one of the local nonprofits with, maybe the Chamber of Commerce . I do think it's a great idea and I have to thank the residents that brought it up to me. Scranton is not doing this type of program when other towns are and it really has been popular in other areas. So if everyone agrees, I'd like to send that letter to the mayor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 And, finally , just following up on the caucus with PEL, I do agree, I actually didn't get a chance to ask any questions as well because we did run out on time. Overall, though, I'm glad the representatives of PEL came in and really being on council as long as I have this is by far the most positive report financially that very have received from PEL. You know, the financial standpoint with the city not having to raise taxes in two years, we are paying our bills which, again, shouldn 't be an accomplishment , but ten years ago, even lesser than that it was a big accomplishment just to have money on hand to be able to pay bills. So I'm grateful for the amount of progress that we have made. I'm not sure others and the newspaper will probably harp on the areas of concern , but all in all the city has made tremendous progress over the last number of years and that's something I'm hoping will continue to move forward and hoping to continue a cooperative relationship not only with PEL, but with our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 other community partners. And that is all. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . You know, I'm not going to beat a horse to death because I think I have made my points over the last few weeks, but I do want to point out one thing. Mr. Abrahamsen and his firm submitted a supplemental submittal on July 16 when I had requested -- you know, when I pointed out that they did not fill out the RFQ correctly , so they did submit something on July 16 and it gave the person 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 who contributed , to whom they contributed to, the date and then the amount. When I pointed out, again, that it still was not filled out correctly they submitted an additional document on July 20. Now, the problem with this is, I will point out a few issues. Number one, there are political contributions that are on this second submittal that were not on the first. For example , April 4, 2013, Mr. Abrahamsen donated to Bill Courtright in the amount of $2,500. That was not included on the first submittal . There are different dates for contributions , for example , July -- on the submittal from July 20 it says that Mr. Abrahamsen donated to Mr. Courtright on September 21, 2013, September 25, 2013, those dates are different than the ones that he submitted on July 16. There is several other examples of this, I'm not going to go through every one of them, but the bottom line here is it's extremely sloppy. And, you know, based on all of this information that I presented over the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 few weeks coupled with the serious concerns that I have about this law firm, I can't in good conscience vote for this contract and I'm not sure how any of my colleagues can vote for it as well. The firm has made close to a million dollars over the last few years from doing business with this city and the fact that a simple RFQ was not filled out correctly is extremely concerning . I mean, if they are not forthright with this information now and it was in the RFQ, you know, what if something comes up and we need to request additional information . How are we sure that they are giving us the correct documentation and that what they are giving us is truthful ? You know, the fact that the dates are different , contributions to the mayor were left out of the initial supplemental document that was provided is extremely troubling . The second point, we did meet with the city solicitor . She did provide answers to the questions that I had asked and I do appreciate that. We do not see eye-to-eye on this issue. I do not think that it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 fair that the city added language in the RFQ that the firm who understands the unique culture of Scranton 's labor unions will be given preference . This was not in the original RFP back in 2014 when we had seven bidders for this contract . This year we only have two I think because of the language that was put in there. So, you know, it's my belief that we should be trying to get as many bidders as possible to get the best deal for the city. Finally , you know, the fact that Mr. Abrahamsen attempted to sue me for asking for backup documentation for the work he did in exchange for $400,000 is extremely troubling , not only pointed out by me, but my colleagues and members of the public last year. And I would like people to think of it this way, it's a simple analogy , if you went to a mechanic to fix your car and he charged you $5,000 you would want to see a receipt for what he did or that amount of money. If the mechanic gave you a hard time when you asked for the backup documentation . If he gave you one receipt and then it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 wasn't right and gave you another receipt , that wasn't right, you had to continue to ask for information , then he attempted to sue you because you were asking why he charged you $5,000 I don't think, I'm guessing , that none of my colleagues up here or no one in the audience , no one in the public would hire that mechanic again, so logic should tell all of us that we should not hire this law firm again. Rebid it for all of the reasons that I have given over the last few weeks. So I do not think that this law firm should get in contract for all of the reasons that I have pointed out and I would hope that my colleagues would use common sense and vote against this contract. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Is there anyone else on the question ? MR. EVANS: On the question , one thing I wanted to give some credit to is Attorney Eskra, the city solicitor , not just for responding to city council 's question s, but to my knowledge this contract and the Labella contract were the first RFPs that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 made a requirement by the city the completion of attachment "e" and full disclosure of campaign contribution s to political candidates , so I think that brings a very bright light and additional transparencies to the process so I don't think that can be understated. Otherwise , I think it's time to vote. MR. PERRY: Yeah, on the question , I wasn't clear about the completion for the RFQ and without having it fully filled out I was not for this contract . In the meantime, we did get everything that we needed to hear. I was against Mr. Abrahamsen 's lawsuit against Councilman Gaughan , I was vocal about it at the time. He since has retracted that and, you know, I believe he has actually contact ed Mr. Gaughan and said, "Don't worry about it," and that's good for me. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, he has not contacted me personally , nor would I entertain a phone call because I don't really think that's appropriate , he did drop the lawsuit . But, look, I think a precedent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 has been set here, gentlemen , that in the future should we ever request additional documentation or ask for additional information that, you know, we are under the guise of a possible threat that we may get sued. So I think that everyone should take that in strong consideration before we hire this firm again. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, on the question , I'm going to -- I agree with Councilman Gaughan , I think if the requirements are put in a RFQ when it goes out it should go out with everything that the RFQ required , we shouldn 't have to request additional information so that's why I believe it should be rebid and I will be voting against this. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please? MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Yes. MS.
