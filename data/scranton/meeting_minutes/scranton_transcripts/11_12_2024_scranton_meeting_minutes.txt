MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially Ann Marie Guardi, John Mellow, and James Merkle. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON NOVEMBER 5, 2024, REGARDING PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX COLLECTIONS AS OF OCTOBER 29, 2024. 3-B. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT FOR YEAR-TO-DATE NOVEMBER 6, 2024 AND YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISON REPORT FOR NOVEMBER 6, 2023 TO NOVEMBER 6, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have one announcement . Council was informed by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation about a road closure . So Nay Aug Avenue is going to be closed for the construction of the bridge on Green Ridge Street. And it will be closing on November 21st. So it's next Thursday . And it's going to reopen on October 23rd of 2026. So it's going to be closed for the next two years that portion of Nay Aug Avenue while that bridge is being replaced. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. I should have probably mentioned it during caucus. But as Chairman for the Committee on Public Safety, I would like to personal ly thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 and applaud the Scranton Police Department , the District Attorney 's Office, and all other law enforcement entities that were involved for their efforts with Operation Deep Blue that resulted in arresting nine gang members of crips and dismantling a major drug trafficking ring in our city. Good job, guys. MR. SCHUSTER : I would like to second that as well. Good job, guys. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton , still no police union contract on the City's website . Is that anywhere near completion ? MR. SMURL: They told me it is -- they are still compiling it the same as the fire department . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, two finger typist? MR. SMURL: I'm sorry, what? MS. HODOWANITZ : Two finger typist. MR. SMURL: After 40 years of not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 complying , it is what it is. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, how about DPW union contract negotiations ? MR. SMURL: They are still in negotiation . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, forty-nine days left in their contract . And how about the 2023 audits? MR. SMURL: Oh, I forgot to ask Matt. I'm sorry. I will find out for you next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, I won't forget. You should all have a spreadsheet that I worked on over the weekend . It's only part of the budget. I was very interested in the pay raises and see how they broke down and a few other things. One of the things about budgets is, it usually focuses on the upcoming year. But sometimes when you are doing that you should -- you can identify trends, both positive and negative , which you should then be projecting out maybe two, three, four, five years because they -- maybe there's something you could change or correct . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 But at any rate, I looked at overtime because you know how we always keep watching that. And it's project ed to go up 16.07 percent next year. That's total overtime . But on the positive side, police overtime has a reimbursement under revenues of 320,000 dollars which I thought is damn fine. Their own overtime and their expenses is up 300,000 dollars so they seem to counter balance each other. Hopefully that will work out well. I looked at healthcare before I looked at the individual departments for salaries . And it's going up 5.5 percent pretty much across the board. But that's actually very good when you consider that the average nationwide increase is 9 percent . So we've managed to come in under that radar. But the pay raises, I just want to list the ones that are double digit. The Business Administrator , a salary increase of 13.9 percent ; Code Enforcement manager 13.91 percent ; City Solicitor 13.9 percent . Here's an interesting one, the Law Department Confidential Secretary up 23.14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 percent . And then there's the DPW fleet services supervisor . I wonder if this is the guy that's checking Rubicon . That person is up 16.44 percent . Now, there's a whole lot of other ones as you could see on the eight page spreadsheet , a lot of them in the 8 and 9 percent categories . And many of these are probably well deserved . But you have to address that yourself. I saw there are two key areas where revenues are down. And I'm wondering if this is going to be a trend. Act 47 and other grants and DPW recycling , that apparently has taken a dip for the revenues . Department earnings went from 425,000 dollars down to 95,000 dollars , one would wonder why. Is that going to continue ? And then continue increases and expenses to look at. Telephone up 31 percent , 325,000 dollars ; liability and casualty insurance up 19 percent to 2.6 million . Workers comp up 50 percent to 3.5 million ; Business Administration office itself up 23 percent to 8.1 million . Their postage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 and freight up 87.5 percent to 75,000 dollars ; code enforcement up 45 percent , LIPS up 29 percent , and DPW refuse up 600 percent . Have a good day. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Bob Bolus. MR. SCHUSTER : When it comes to DPW negotiations , I think they met in regards to the MOU or the MOA. But I don't think they met in actual negotiations at this point in time. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . I have some suggestions about what we heard here tonight with all three departments . First of all, I don't believe we should be doing any type of leasing . We have to maintain the vehicles when you lease them. They got to be in different conditions when they go back and everything else. And we're paying the company that is leasing them. We're putting money -- their money in their pocket. We should be buying them. You could get grants for anything else. Here we're playing around with Weston Field, how long we been playing with money here, money there doing this, doing that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 That's just one example . You could get grants to buy your equipment . You got to maintain them anyway. They should all be convert ed to natural gas. You'll cut down on your oil changes by 90 percent , just that alone on any vehicle because you're not -- on a natural combustion engine it sucks stuff in from the outside , the air, the dirt, etc. Natural gas, it's the gas to the engine. There's nothing in between . They run smoother , cleaner and they are very efficient . So look at that right across the board, police, fire, DPW and you'll save tons and tons of money, number one. Number two, I brought up here with what's going on with Lackawanna County with Gaughan pushing this tax on us. And I haven't heard anybody here stand up for our rights against him of what he's doing with his tax increase . I brought out the hospital that's coming here is tax exempt. They are tax exempt but they are making millions and million s of dollars . We don't get free medical . Why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 should they get free taxes? Number one, I brought out about all the nonprofit s, the university , other ones. University , I brought out is the Catholic Jesuit school. They violated the rule of God. Sex is a man and a woman. They violated . Their tax exempt should be revoked on all of these properties that they have, put the money back in the taxpayers , keep the chapel tax exempt. Those are just for some of the things that we need to do here but nobody is willing to do it. If we want to build this community , you got to make cuts or just put money out, money out, money out; but we're not getting nothing in return. You're just knocking the hell out of the people in this community , the seniors can't figure how we're going to live here anymore. Yet, we're going to get hit with a tax assessment. You're already paying a school tax that's ridiculous for people who only work so many months out of a year, get holidays , this, that, and we're paying for it. Kids can't even write their bloody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 name anymore and this is what we're paying for. But you're taking it out on all the people in the city. I'd like to see all five you at the commissioner 's meeting and object to what they're doing because it's putting the screws to the people in this community . Gaughan has an attitude . He called a commissioner , Mr. Chermak , the other commissioner a coward. I don't care who he thinks he is or what it is. I'm surprised Chermak didn't lay him out to be honest with you because he's out of order. This isn't a gestapo controlled community or dictator ship. It's about people that you represent . Now, the whole new thing is we have a president . And I want to show Mr. Les there because he had a shirt that he kept wearing Trump sucks. Well, I want to show you my friend, this is your new president . Get used to it, okay. And we have to because we have a president that's going to make this country great where it was. You're going to see the gas countries come back up. You're going to see the economy change. He's already making 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 changes , already calling overseas. And he's going to get a lot of things done that weren't done. But most important thing is, our gas industry is going to come back. People are going to go to work and we're going to do that. But we got to watch spending money on Weston Field and all the money we're squandering . This is the hottest summer in the year and where do we go swimming ? Nay Aug is a mud pond, a stupid splash park because they didn't use it. You're in the industry . You know about grouting and doing everything else to cut out leaks or raising building s and everything else. You know how we do all that; and that should have been done up there, but nobody bothered to test it. So called engineers are clueless. But we have a mud pond and Nay Aug Park. And we're going to have a splash park and we seniors are going to run and goodie, goodie, we're having so much fun in a splash park. It's ludicrous that we have to go through this. Let's make a change for the city, just like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 this guy on my chest is going to change this country around. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mr. Bolus, will you check the light switch back there to see if it's on? The lights are all out on that side. MR. BOLUS: Wait. I'm sorry? MR. SMURL: The light switch -- oh, he'll check it. MR. BOLUS: Oh, the lights aren't lit over here. I was wondering what happened tonight . I thought maybe it was my eyesight . MR. SMURL: Oh, there it is. MR. BOLUS: Oh, there you go. There's our miracle worker. Look at that. She put light on the subject . Thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: You too. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . This is a subject I talked about many times, Dorothy Street by the playground. We're going to put new storm drains, the hole is filled in. But I said this a while back that area keeps sinking . There's a big dip there now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 I was walking my dog by there the other day. A minivan went by and bottomed out. I talk about this time after time after time and nothing gets done. It was done unprofessionally . I'm not an engineer . But it doesn't take one to figure out somebody screwed up. It wasn't filled in right and now it's sinking . And it's going to cause people to have their cars damaged. The whole thing's got to be dug up and refilled again and paved over again. MR. SMURL: Les, how far up is that? MR. SCHUSTER : 1800. MR. SMURL: 1800, thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , will you please send that to Director Gassenmeyer ? MR. VOLDENBERG : They've been advised . I'll advise again. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, the excuse will probably be now that the weather is getting too bad to do it. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , when we ask that, can we ask if it was just a temporary fill and they were coming back or if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that was the permanent fix and it just subsided ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SPINDLER : Something on a positive side, I was glad to hear the other day on the news that we're not going to have a tax increase in the 2025 budget. So at least that's a help because as Bob said, the county is giving the screws to us. I don't know what people in my shoes are going to do with a 33 percent tax hike. We'll see what happens there. On Channel 16 news tonight they had a story about a playground in Wilkes-Barre. It was built two years ago but they just had a big celebration there today. It's specifically for autistic and special needs children . We're building splash pads in this city, all playgrounds for kids that aren't special needs. Correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think we have playground like that in this city, do we? MR. SCHUSTER : So the Municipal Rec Authority has been funding -- getting funds together to do the butterfly park at Nay Aug 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and that is an all inclusive playground that they're attempting to build. MR. SPINDLER : Because I drive special needs kids to and from school and something like that would be terrific . MR. SMURL: It's begun. Please, can you stop speaking in the back? We can't hear up here. Give Mr. Spindler a chance to speak. MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, it showed the kids today. They had a ball there. The Mayor was there. They had a zip line. Mayor Brown was pushing them on the zip line. It would be something terrific to have in this city instead of all these splash pads we're putting in. That's all I have tonight -- oh, just one thing. The only people that are -- the President is going to help are people like Bob that are rolling in money. They're not going to help people like me that live paycheck to paycheck . I have to work a part-time-job to make ends meet. So good luck, Bob. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Hello, Council . The first thing I have here is that the people that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 are robbing the poor are your city and county governments. It's not the President of the United States. So, you know, if you're a little offended about the amount of taxes you're paying just look in front of you and you could see where the problem begins. Okay, but, you know, there's allegedly going to be a meeting in Tripp Park on Thursday at 6:00 on a stormwater authority . I hope everybody would go to that meeting . A phone number there is 570-343-0342. I don't have a number for the Tripp Park Neighborhood Authority . But this stormwater has to be funded by the city's budget. The city sold the sewer authority off, knew it didn't have a plan, okay, and the original plan was to build three retention ponds with the Scranton Sewer Authority and when it was possible that they would drain the ponds down and run the water through the plant. But, you know, you've got to thank the former Council President Joe Weschler because he didn't support the project but he introduced it. The Council President doesn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 have to introduce anything at any time and no one could force them to do that. So if you know that a project has no merit no matter what the Mayor wants to do, no matter what your fellow Council members want to do, they can't force you to introduce that legislation . And I think it goes back to Joe Weschler . Now, you could ask yourself what about Bill Gaughan and, you know, Pat Rogan, Wayne Evans, and Tim Perry. Well, they never should have voted to sell that either because now we're in a situation in the city where we have a totally useless city government and county government because we have citizens in our city that can't pay their water and their sewer bills. But I don't hear any discussion taking place as far as the Council . Did you ever think that maybe you should, you know, say something or do something at all just anything ? Even the people in the county like the County Commissioners ? How about the Council in Dunmore ? I mean, there really needs to be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 solution found. Even if it leads to condemnation actions in law to gain control of those assets because the State of Pennsylvania owns all the water, every drop of it. Now, the PUC is just another corrupt political organization appoint ed by the Governor . They never should have let that sale take place because the Scranton Sewer Authority and the bonds that were sold to build it were never designed to pay the city's pensions . And, you know, Mr. Smurl, I'd like you in the next meeting to tell all the residents in this city how much money out of the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority went to pensions , let all the people in this city know and exactly where that money went, okay? Let's really know how much really went there. And let's not talk about borrowed money that went there, okay, let's really talk about the beating that the residents took and now, you know something , there was a conversation here about the homeless having to pay $2.50 to take a shower at Weston Field I believe it was. Well, that's how much it costs a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 resident to take a shower in their own home. There's people telling me that they can't live here anymore. They can't pay 2 or 300 dollars a month for water and sewer. And I'm waiting for this Council to do something and the Mayor. Okay, it's nice to parade yourselves around and do slide shows. But the truth of the matter is, people can't live in this city because of the mismanagement of this city by the people they elected . And, you know, I mean, it's just reached the point even when you look at ECTV. That's an asset that belongs to the people, not the city government . The people should have a right to go to that channel and be heard on the things they want to fix in this city. But you have locked them out. And I haven't heard this Council talk about restoring that as a public access channel for the public. You're like little dictators . I think that Hitler is standing behind you or Stalin because you don't represent us, okay, you dictate to us and tax us and abuse us. But you're not doing anything for us and that needs to change. And in the next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 election , we got rid of Cartright and we got rid of Casey and we got rid of all the democrats . And you know what, it's time to get rid of the rest, the Mayor, the Council , vote independents in, but you guys have to go. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : The only place for that kind of talk is down the street there's an FBI office. But make sure it's the truth. I had a little thought popped into my head when it was announced that public safety employees could move out of town. And I would just caution them not -- don't move too far. I spent a good part of my life sitting in a car. And one time there was a snowstorm on New Year's Day. I had to show up at work. And lucky I did because I got indulged from the boss with a couple of quadruple bourbons at the bar. And the next morning there were a few guys fired for not showing up. He was a tyrant about it but he's the boss. Like they said in the mafia, you got the boss. And the article on the Harrison Avenue bridge, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 appreciate the fact that it's got attention , but better sooner than later. We might have lost the weather , hopefully soon before any damage happens . That water soaks in, universal solvent . Now, with all of this radicalism that's going on, please be cautious with the finances . Just be careful . We're probably okay for this year. But things aren't really going to get any better. And it's the only thing you could do if you get too obligator y to various interests is to raise taxes and that's starting to hurt. And on the roads, I hear that constantly they should use that money to fix the roads. Well, what's the point when you get a utility tearing them up. On Hickory Street 800 block, massive disgust ing patch on it. And then right before you hit Evans Realty on that same street, probably out in front of that old church, another big pothole . And then I turned off of Pittston Avenue there when I'm turning to Moosic Street so I don't know if that's Pittston or not. There is one hell of big 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 hole. I'll say hell because I could see the flames down there. And it's been -- this tax exempt, you can't tax a tax exempt. But what we need is compensation from the state. And I always felt that the taxpayer s should be Scranton exclusive taxpayer s, a nongovernment . But the idea of exclusive is that the people that were coming into the tax period when we had it were people that were profiting mightily by not having to pay taxes to replace all the tax exempts . So we really need to go after the state and even possibly get a court decision on it, if you can. On the street scape, you know, I would hope that we don't change the streets too much. The lights are good and all and no bike lanes on the streets . We really don't need that downtown . I was down here last week a friend called me. He was having some car trouble . And a guy passed me up there by the college on the parking lane just because I was going slow and looking around. But I certainly was going a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 reasonable speed. And we're pulling up to a red light. So we don't need anymore craziness with driving in this town. Congratulations lover boys. You went out and voted last Tuesday . And my missus was on the computer and there are women denouncing swearing off of men over birth control and all of these issues and lack of support . So I hope you have a love life when you're all done and thank you and have a good night, everybody . MR. SMURL: Thank you. That is all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . Back to business , I set up the same spread sheet that Joan evidently did and we both crunched the numbers and came out with the same exact percentages on raises. So it looks like each one of us was doing double duty. What I find amazing is that when the funding failed for the Nay Aug park pool project , the administration did not even have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the courtesy to inform Council on this fact. And if they did inform certain members of Council , those members of Council certainly did not inform the public before the last meeting , talk about a house divided . I see in the budget that care continues for the unsheltered as we have in the 2024 budget, 10,000 unspent for the hunger initiative and 10,000 dollars for the homeless outreach initiative . Nothing spent. I see why people are upset when they look at the numbers , especially the unions. When the Mayor's executive assistant and special assistant s both get 8.1 increases . The big winner as noted was the confidentiality secretary at 23.14 percent . It's not from the HR Department and employee files so I can't target that for that wonderful confidentiality , but 23 percent raise, really? In the budget we see the beautiful blocks program allocated 10,000 dollars and has zero spent as of 9/30. We want to increase that budget from 40,000 to 100,000 dollars when nothing was spent, an increase of 250 percent . Planning Commission has 10,000 dollars and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 spent $38.46. Are we missing bills? Shade tree, 40 unspent; capital expenditures 20,000; nothing 's been spent. On the other side is the code enforcement supplies . They had 4,500 in the pot and they sent 18,605 dollars by the end of September . Is that due to the double recycling card and mailing and the printing of them going out as it was supposedly by a friend of a code enforcement officer who was the person who is the printer for that recycling calendar ? Streetscapes for Wyoming Avenue has 2.2 million dollars obligated but not expended . Move some to Nay Aug Park. Streetscapes North Washington and Linden has 1.95 million . Adams has 1.98 million open. Revenue loss without an audit could be 10 million . Right now we have 9.85 obligated but not spent. That leaves 150,000 that could be shifted to other programs . Revenue loss has Robinson Park expended 300,000 dollars but still has a 200,000 dollar balance . Electric vehicle s is expended half, but has 108,109 dollars left. I understan d we're obligate d for a five-year lease. Move some of it and replace 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 it with part of the landfill 100,000 a year fund. We have extra trash and fire trucks supposedly to lend out, so we should be good, right? I understand that some of the programs I suggested above are not in the revenue loss category . But if we could free up some unallocated revenue loss space and move some to other categories , we may be able to add a little more to revenue loss space to fund Nay Aug Park pools. Tech upgrades to city assets is in revenue loss. Could that 300,000 dollars be shifted to infrastructure category from revenue loss and free up a spot for 300,000 more in revenue loss for the pool. I expect project s were set and they did not want Council to know or the people to know that Nay Aug Park was in this state until the end of December when the funds were locked in and could not be changed. Time is short. We need to move right now. As for the raises, I suggest producing the large percentage of those manager s to 2.5 percent , take that extra money from the spreadsheet. It's 100,000 dollars . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Put it to the Nay Aug Park pool. Are those working in the highest paying positions in desperate need of 30 pieces of silver at the cost of the children and community . And I'm not asking people to forego everything . But as Huey Long said, "We need to share the wealth." Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta . I would like to thank all law enforcement agencies and officer s involved in their continuing efforts in keeping the residents and streets of Scranton safe following today's press conference . Now the bid saga continues . As you're aware, the City of Scranton original ly rejected the lowest bid for the Capouse Avenue School Splash Pad Project . The City of Scranton claimed the reason was that the low contractor was not responsible . The city claims the low bidder on the Capouse Avenue School Splash Pad Project is not responsible due to the Novembrino Splash Pad project and the fact that the low bidder on Capouse Avenue project issued change orders on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the Novembrino Splash Pad project . Keep in mind the City of Scranton accepted all but two of the change orders on the Novembrino Splash Pad project along with other change orders from the other Prime contractor s that were doing work on the Novembrino Splash Pad project . Are you following me? Also present ed to City Council was that a local taxpayer filed a preliminary injunction due to the city's rejection of the low bid for Capouse Avenue School Splash Pad Project . A judge granted us the hearing . On November 8th, 2024, challenging the city's award and its decision was that the low bidder was not responsible . The city hired outside counsel to contest a preliminary injunction and to have this hired counsel represent the city at the November 8th hearing . After four and a half hours of testimony and evidence , the City of Scranton through its outside counsel advised the taxpayer and the Court that rather than show any evidence in support of its rejection of the low bid and declaring that the lower bidder was not responsible , they decided after 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 four and a half hours now to reject all bids for the Capouse Avenue School Splash Pad Project . So now the city is cancelling the project for the splash pad on Capouse Avenue and it's going to rebid it again at a later date. This is factual . Council , you should be general ly concerned why did the city go through this injunction hearing , pay an outside law firm when we have a solicitor and a team of lawyers in the city that are all looking to get raises to appear in court for four and a half hours and then reject all bids? Council , you should be concerned why the city made claims and could not stand behind this declaration and accusations that the low bidder on the Capouse Avenue School Splash Pad Project was not responsible . Council , you need to ask why is the city continuing to expend taxpayer dollars bidding and rebidding on this Capouse Avenue School Splash Pad Project wasting and spending taxpayer dollars that we do not have to waste? Council , you also need to inquire how much city funds were spent to date bidding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 and rebidding on the Capouse Avenue School Splash Pad Project . Council , you also need to inquire how much the city has paid the outside legal counsel to represent the city for this preliminary injunction considering the 2025 budget has raises for the Solicitor and that office. This issue isn't going away. Council , you're aware if the City of Scranton has a Controller , you may be able to confer with him on the issue of bidding . Remember one thing, Council , you were presented with an opportunity to sit down with this contractor before it went this far and cost the city any money. Doing work for the city shouldn 't depend on if the Mayor likes you or not. Council , you were present ed with an awful lot of information on the budget tonight . Two members asked questions . You have one member who attends whenever he feels or he calls in. You have one member that's been leaving the seat for 20 minutes or more. Are you ready to make these educated budget votes? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Start paying attention to the issues present ed to you, Council . Rumor has it that you guys are going to get raises as long as you approve one for the Mayor, Mr. Smurl. Are you also aware that the homeless camps are back? Do you know anything about the rescues lately of the homeless people that have been in the underground culverts ? There is probably six of them within the last month that are stuck in the underground culverts . Have a good night, Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to talk about common sense. How could an administration wait years to finally start work on so many project s knowing that the cost would have been less years ago? One that is near and dear to me is Nay Aug Park. Those pools will be closed for seven years before they are reopened. That's if the Mayor gets the 3 million dollars in donation s for her very costly mistake . It's like she's saying I messed up. Give me money so I don't look bad so I could be reelected .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 It's horrible feeling knowing that children and families cannot experience what it's like to swim and make a day of it or a crown jewel of a park. One of my very first memories of Nay Aug Park was July 4th, 1976. Peters administration put on a great night that I will never forget. Thank you, Mayor Peters. The good people of Scranton would like to know when each of these projects will be completed . The Mayor speaks about painting 200 crosswalk s. That's 50 intersection s. Scranton is 26 square miles. There are well over 4,000 intersection s in the City of Scranton . School children take buses throughout the city. They do not live within a two block radius of a school. Five hundred thousand dollars for paving inspector s from Luzerne County who do not know our roads just Eileen Cipriani is not the answer. How much does it cost for an engineering firm from Luzerne County? Utility companies continue to cut our roads without sealing them properly causing reoccurring expenses for the good people of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Scranton . None of you even address the issue and have anybody contact the utilities to prevent reoccurring expenses . I would certainly hope that there is a change with the President of Council next year. Cutting grass and hanging decorations as your only qualifications do not work for Scranton . Dr. Rothchild , sincerely hope you would consider this as an option. A few former Council women in the past come to mind who did very well. And I think you could shatter some ceiling s. I would also hope that Sean McAndrew gets more than 100 signatures and runs for City Council . We need a change for the better. When it comes to the Mayor, she continues to crumble under pressure . There was an incident and an accident this past Saturday on Keyser Avenue. Truck four was respond ing to a fire alarm. There was a vehicle in the way that chose to pull off to the left as opposed to the right causing a minor accident . Thankfully nobody was injured . Police arrived and questioned the driver. She replied , "I thought that I had to pull off to the left for the fire trucks." The driver was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 our Mayor. Call Harvard and get your money back. They failed you. Safety in our community is critically important to our future. Today we heard about an 11 month investigation by the Scranton Police, State Police, Attorney General 's Office, Lackawanna County Detectives , District Attorney Mark Powell, First Assistant Brian Gallagher and the good people from the Lackawanna County District Attorney 's Office. Nine were charged so far, guns, vast amount of drugs including thousands of pills suspected to contain fentanyl in the pill press. My son passed away from a pill containing fentanyl . So on behalf of my son, my family, my friends, his friends , his brother s and sisters in the Marines , thank you for keeping our community and each one of you safe and all of us safe as you possibly can. God bless our first respond ers. God bless the good people of Scranton . Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just comments , I do want to thank Scranton Police Department in conjunction with the District Attorney 's Office, the FBI, the State Police, doing a tremendous job. Eleven months of hard work gathering up those nine criminals who were really truly injuring and putting lives and at stake in our city, so kudos to all the great work that went into that. Once again something was mentioned earlier about the PUC, the Pennsylvania American Water Company . There was an office across the street. We all -- every one of us spoke at a hearing , state reps. I met with Borough Council in Dunmore , worked together . I thought it was a great effort. Many of you sitting here went and testified . And I felt like it was a really true community effort to try to fight Pennsylvania American Water Company . We weren't totally successful . We cut it in half. So we achieved something . But to say we did nothing , sat here, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 that's not the truth. We do what we could. And I think it was a good effort by everyone , not just Council , the Mayor included along with our state reps our state senator and Borough Council in Dunmore and the citizens of the City of Scranton . Petitions were signed. People spoke. We fought it and we got it reduced. We didn't get it to zero, which we all would have liked. But we got it reduced. So to say we did nothing , sorry, that's wrong. Something was done. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I do have a few. Just a reminder this Thursday , November 14th at 6 p.m., there will be a meeting at the Tripp Park Community Center to discuss stormwater and the stormwater project s that are at North Scranton , West Scranton , Minooka , and Tripp Park. So anybody in those affected areas, there will be a meeting Thursday at 6 at the Tripp Park Community Center. Some of the questions I had tonight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 to get answers for, I asked during the caucus. I asked about the leaf cleanup if they were following the schedule . Looking at the schedule , the answer we got tonight is they are somewhat following the schedule for leaf cleanup according to that recycling calendar . But they're going to get high areas of leaf falling here and there when they can. So I would suggest that anyone that has neighborhood s that are high end leaves, please call DPW to let them know that your area is in need of a cleanup and they could get out with trucks and the vac trucks to clean up those leaves because I think that's how they're taking the high priority areas is citizens calls. I got some answers from last week. So I did have some inquires about Rubicon . We heard tonight in caucus I asked if the contract as it's ending in December if we're going to continue that contract . So they did give us an update that once the testing is complete they're going to go live. I asked about a go live date. They said they'll provide it to Council in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 future, but Rubicon is a software as a service . So that means that we're going to require to have the software for that system that we're going to run independently on our own after the routes have been optimized . Hopefully we get the routes optimized by December and we get a rollout and then we could utilize that data collection and information from that system to make our routes more efficient to save some money. At this point in time it's yet to be seen. At this point it's yet to be seen. Frank, if we could just send over to administration what the annual fee is. I know we did ask it in person tonight . But if we could officially put that in what is the annual fee for the software for Rubicon . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : You'll see tonight in our agenda there are some projects in Keyser Valley that have been complete d as part of the 2018 flooding . So they're going to go into the budget and they're reimbursable projects . So finally some of those projects from 2018 were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 completed . I think that's all I have for tonight . Sorry, one last thing. It's been stated thank you to the Lackawanna County DA's Office, the State Police, Scranton Police Department for the arrest that they've made taking some dangerous items off of the streets. Thank you for that arrest and that investigation . That is all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. I have a few things, some things that are in response so a couple things that are a number of topics here. But first off, I also wanted to thank our SPD and our partnership s with the county and other departments who were able to arrest the gang members and to take more drugs off of our streets. I appreciate the work that they do so much in keeping our community safe. And I appreciate them being here tonight , both Chief Carroll and Chief Judge for explaining all the work that their departments have done over the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 past year and what we have to look forward to in the budget. Speaking of the budget with regards to questions on it, there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes and outside of these Council meeting s. I spent many hours going through the budget and developing my own questions and many that have been asked outside of the meeting so that I don't necessarily need to take up the time during the caucuses because I know how valuable it is to hear from those department heads coming in and to be able ask those questions in advance so I already have those answers . So there is plenty that's being done on that. And I do appreciate too the questions that other Council members have had, many of which are similar to what I would ask especially with regards to the question tonight on Rubicon and the route optimization . I also really want to see that occur. We've been waiting way too long on that. And I have been disappoint ed as well. So I just wanted to express that. And I want us to get our money's worth of that program 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 too. The other thing that I wanted to just touch on too that Council man King had addressed on our involvement with the Pennsylvania American Water Company and the PUC meeting s that took place last year. We all worked very hard to try to get those increases lessened , if not absolved . And unfortunately there still were increases , not as much as there would have been if we hadn't been speaking up and hadn't gotten together with the community and organize d with others and elected officials in our area to do that. So I feel like we have been very vocal as a Council on that and to say that we're doing nothing or have done nothing is absolutely untrue and is far from the truth as you could get. And there was a question about the beautiful blocks grant money -- or money from the city if that had been spent. And I know that it has been. So that must be an error that needs to be corrected in the budget. And I -- there was something too about the Nay Aug pool grant that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 they have been going for for the second phase of the pool construction . And I know I was not aware that that grant had been denied prior to us being informed of that last week during the meeting. So I could just speak for myself on that. I just wanted to make that clear. And there's a complaint that I was -- that I have been trying to get addressed . And I know Mr. Voldenberg has sent this out multiple times too. And I still don't know why it's not fixed. But it's just a street that's out on the 700 block of Harrison Avenue so if we can -- MR. VOLDENBERG : That would be 739 Harrison . I'll follow up. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thanks, a street light. That would be great. Thank you. I think that's all that I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions -- MR. MCANDREW : I didn't have anything , but I do now. So Mr. Morgan the way he addressed us and said we have done nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 about the water increase is just ridiculous . If he stayed for a meeting -- for a remainder of the meeting s he'd hear the truth. There was public hearing s with the PUC, which is process . We follow the process . We all went and petitioned on behalf of the residents , the rate increase . We've had dialogue with Pennsylvania American Water. I mean, we did our best. Beyond that, I don't know what else we could do. We stood up for the resident s. We fought for the residents . We can't waive a wand. I think he thinks we can, but we can't. And I just want to say that on behalf of myself and my colleagues here. We fought the fight. We didn't win this one. But I don't know what else he thinks we could do. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . As far as the grant for Nay Aug park that we did not receive , I believe next we will be getting legislation s down for another grant application that is already in process to put Nay Aug Park back on again. And that is for the second stage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 which is I would say a little over a year away. So I think we're still in good shape. That is all, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Smurl, while we're on that, can we contact Eileen Cipriani and see what ARPA money is left over? We have a lot of budget transfer s that we got, what money is left over and what is the reason we wouldn't be putting it towards the next phase of Nay Aug Pool if we could get that definitive answer. MR. SMURL: The money as in -- MR. SCHUSTER : Is there any remaining ARPA money that's not -- MR. KING: Or can we reprioritize it? MR. SMURL: I will do that tomorrow . MR. KING: I knew this was going to happen. No, I knew -- I knew that this first phase was going to get done and we weren't going to get that eight lane pool. Well, guess what, this budget is going to somehow reflect that we are going to get that eight lane pool. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

The $30,000 is going toward a stormwater project that they're already doing. And we are just -- yeah, I know -- they should have corrected . I found that today. So they told me it was going be used for the stormwater project . MR. SCHUSTER : So this is the one that features the parking facilitie s 5-0 -- assistance , maintenance , and installation of features . The features are electric charging stations 5-0, page four of the document . MR. SMURL: Yeah. MR. SCHUSTER : States electric charging stations . MR.

So I will find out again tomorrow , make sure that's what it is. It was supposed to go to the $30,000 to be added to their stormwater project that they're doing so that we don't have to individually do that whole project .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – WAIVING RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTOR ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF CERTAIN SITE WORK AND RELATED WORK FOR A SALT STORAGE SHED. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-Q be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 when looking at the original ordinance with the responsible contractor ordinance that we passed recently , there is three reasons we can waive an ordinance -- or waive this. One is because it's an emergency situation ; two, it's through a resolution which this is what this is; and three, at the request of the BA that none of the bids meet the standard s of the ordinance . So at this point in time they're asking us to use the second route as waiving it through a resolution . I was happy to see that we did get some of the bids. Do they know which bid it's going to be granted to or after we waive it, they're going to choose the bid? MR. SMURL: Right, I was told it was -- well, all the bids came in. One was 300,000, 200,000. And so the reason one of the companies did not get it was because of the new rules and stuff. So I did speak with someone from the unions today and some other people who are going to meet tomorrow on this to get the wording straight so that we're all on the same page because we just put this through . So I don't want to make an exception 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 already because it's new. So I'd like to naturally just introduce it and find out tomorrow what the wording really should be or how it should be in there, not just say, okay, we're going to make it an emergency job because we could do that every day. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that's an easy excuse. MR. SMURL: I don't want it to be just passed by that. I want to hear everybody 's part of it. So we are meeting tomorrow on this. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. I'd be willing to table it if we wanted to keep it off if we wanted to hold it where it's at until we get those answers . MR. SMURL: Supposedly tomorrow -- the other reason why I would like to introduce it is so that salt could get up because we have salt coming and nowhere to put it. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. MR. SMURL: And unfortunate ly it would be an emergency and then they could make that decision without it. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. So we'll move 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 it forward . But, yeah, question s definitely to be answered on this one. MR. SMURL: Yes. Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? I do have a problem with this. The City of Scranton continually helps the University of Scranton , everything they ask of us we do, put grants in for them, whatever . I believe it's now it's time for the University of Scranton to step up and help the City of Scranton with donation in lieu of taxes. We continually have increase s in our fire and our police and our garbage and everything that the university uses. And your donation continually decreased, so I would really like to see that donation increase . And another reason is, at the end of the school year the buildings are cleared out up there. And the City of Scranton taxpayers pick up tons and tons of garbage throughout the entire Hill Section . And this has been going on for many, many, many years. So I would just like to see that increase. MR. SCHUSTER : So I'll also chime in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 on that. I'm glad to hear you say that, Mr. Smurl, that the University of Scranton benefits off the City of Scranton for countless things, whether it be the zoning ordinance or whether it be things such as this. So I would like to see an increase in the pilot payment to the city. MR. SMURL: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye.
