CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED MAY 3, 2022 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR COUNCIL COMPLAINTS . MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a comment . A question came up in caucus from Councilman Schuster regarding the Human Relations Commission and that there was a complaint received and that was why an emergency meeting was held and that's for Item 3-C. And it appears that that complaint 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 was then sent to the state commission . So I would like to request additional information . It doesn't appear that they've met since then. So perhaps we could get information on when they plan for another meeting , if they're planning on trainings for the commissioners . I understand that there might be some new commissioners and I believe they need to be trained first to be able to investigate complaints . And perhaps that's why this was sent to the state commission . But I don't want to make assumptions . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could please get some clarity and some updates on the Human Relations Commission . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to them, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Does anyone -- are there any other comments on Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two quick ones. So this Saturday , May 14th, the West Side Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts of Troop 50 out of St. Ann's will have an annual pasta dinner. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 It will be at the St. Ann's food stand. Takeout only from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. It's $10. So, you know, they wish -- so please stop by and support these young men. And then second, I think Mr. King mentioned this last week. I'm going to mention it again. So this Saturday at Nay Aug Park, it's going to be -- the event is hosted by the Junior League of Scranton . They're going to host a Touch a Truck event at Nay Aug. It's Saturday -- this Saturday , May 14th from 11 to 3 p.m. I think it's going to be a blast. I know my grandson is all about trucks. This will be a great event. And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: Just briefly , a number of citizens have come up to me recently about people putting their garbage cans out either well before the 24 hour -- the ordinance I believe indicates you should put out your trash cans no more than 24 hours before pickup and then within that 24 hours make sure that you put back, you know, behind your house, what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 have you. I actually had a constituent send me numerous pictures of a lot of people just leaving their garbage cans out in front of their homes for days. And I actually witnessed it at a few places as well. So I just want to remind everyone about the ordinance . We're all, you know, try to take care of our properties and we take pride in our City, just a reminder about that. And also now that it's getting warmer out, there's a lot of people out walking , a lot of people out running , jogging , riding bikes all over the place around town. It's great where everybody is finally able to get outside . I just want to remind everyone -- I think at times we're all guilty of this to just slow down a little bit and be aware of our surrounding s and understand that there's a lot of people out now that the weather is good and please be careful so that everybody stays safe. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Any other announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I had two. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Green Ridge Neighborhood Association reached out to Council I think yesterday . And they had a couple announcements that they wanted us to put out. There's a cleanup at Pretzel Park on June 4th. It's going from nine to noon. It's going to be part of the City of Scranton Pride as well as a fundraiser they're going to have on May 22nd from noon to five at Andy Gavins. The cost is $25 per person. They did make a couple other requests for signs and things like that and an address to be looked into by City inspectors . But I'll send that over to you, Frank. But, yeah, Pretzel Park cleanup June 4th, nine to noon and a fundraiser for the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association on May 22nd from two to five. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I had one. I just wanted to plug the Greenhouse Project over in Nay Aug Park. They are doing their spring flower sale. They have plenty of plants available inside the greenhouse . I was there over the weekend . And I was able to pick up some potted plants because I'm too lazy to pot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 them myself, but feel free to stop by. The they are usually open Thursday s through Saturday s, 10 to 2 for the month of May. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I have a few. Just a reminder , next week's regularly scheduled Council meeting for Tuesday , May 17th has been rescheduled to Monday, May 16th at 6:30 due to Primary Election Day and just a reminder , City Hall is closed on Tuesday , May 17th. Another one I have is Penn Paper and Supply Company is going to be celebrating its hundredth anniversary celebration . They're going to have a ribbon cutting ceremony and a light reception on Friday, May 20th at Penn Paper Scranton office, which is at 215 Vine Street and that starts at 12 noon. Also, the Scranton /Dunmore Fraternal Order of Police is holding a Heros Helping Heros golf tournament on Monday, June 6th at Mount Airy. All proceeds benefit the Gino Merli Veteran 's Center Resident Welfare Fund. The Residents Welfare Fund is used solely for the residents of the Gino Merli Veteran 's Center. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Anyone who is interested could reach out to the Gino Merli Volunteer Services Resource Coordinator , Janus McAllister at 570-961-4380. And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list this evening is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Today's May 10th. It is day 130, 36 percent of the year is gone. And how do we stand on union contract negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : To the best of my knowledge , negotiation s are still ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : Did I hear correctly in the past that negotiations did not begin until this year after the contracts had expired ? MR. DONAHUE : That was the information that was sent to us. MR. MCANDREW : There might have been some -- maybe one or two preliminary or early bird -- they refer to them sometimes -- negotiations . There might have been one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 meeting in June that I'm aware of. But that's all I have. MS. HODOWANITZ : When can we expect to see some written information coming down in Third Order on the status? Is that coming in the near future? MR. DONAHUE : So we did get the dates in which negotiations were held. We're hoping to put that in Third Order for next week. And we also discussed in caucus about the billing from the labor counsel as it relates to activity in the first three months of the year. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I hope so because we're not asking what did they discuss . We're asking when they met because this administration like many of its predecessor s, has a systemic problem with keeping on top of coming events. How many times do we see emergency certificates ? Oh, here comes the insurance policy; it's got to be renewed . And, oh, you got to do it because in two days we'll have no insurance . This happens again and again and again. There is such a thing called suspense file. There's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 something called backward planning . And I don't know why the administration can't do that. We're not talking having to have a degree in finance or IT or anything else. This is common sense planning . And I'm a little tired, which brings to me another point. Three weeks from now is May 31st. According to the Home Rule Charter , that's when the audit for 2021 is due. Is the City even working on it? MR. DONAHUE : We have requested an update -- or I have requested an update on the audit for 2021. And I haven't received anything back yet. But once I do I'll put that -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I'll give you a hand. I think it's time to start putting in right-to-know requests . This is unacceptable . You cannot say you support transparency and full disclosure and then when request for information as simple as this is made, it's no word. Is this what the taxpayer s are paying for? Is this Monopoly money time again? I'm tired of it. Also, last several weeks and even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 months, a lot of grants have been coming through Council . And I don't know who's doing all the grant writing , but I do think that whoever is doing it, you should be complimented . I've seen one name Sherri Frable. Is she the head honcho? MR. DONAHUE : I believe so, but I believe there is another one as well. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, whoever is doing it, I think that's commendable . The only thing I would request is when OECD in particular puts out its legislative backup sheets that go in with the legislation in Fifth Order, they need to be a little bit more specific . As you discussed in the caucus this afternoon , the Nossaman agreement for Federal Government Affair Services , 5-C, is $4,000 per month. Doesn't say how many months. Didn't say specifically where the money was coming from. It said City funding . Now you said you think it's -- MR. DONAHUE : I was told it's professional services under business administration .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MS. HODOWANITZ : But what I'm saying is, these legislative sheets, those are common sense questions . Okay, you don't need an MBA to be able to do that because it's happening time and time again. I get up here and I say I need more information . And I'm happy about the money for repairing City Hall, 5-B. But I remind you it won't make a bit of difference if the City does not have a long-term maintenance plan. We'll just be digging another hole. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . I know that the property owners had to see the new water and waste hikes, $35 a month was their estimate . My electricity is up about $30 a month. My gas budget went up $35 a month. My house insurance , $44 a month. That's about $150 a month this year that I didn't have last year. And that's what, $1,800 a year. That's not just me. That's everybody . Everybody is not going to have as much money because what do you think? I believe it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 because our Governor gave the utilities a carte blanche just to do what they wish. This has been going up and up and up. You know, everybody is complaining and saying they're going to do something about gas. They can't lower the gas. The gas tax is what's paying for the road and bridges . And now we're getting the electric cars that aren't paying for nothing . I happen to know a friend that's got an electric car. I forget what it was. It's General Motors. And he's very displeased with it. He says when you turn on everything , you don't get nearly 300 miles. He said when it's a couple years old, they told him he'd need battery replacement s which will be almost what the car is worth. Now the City is going to end up with that. Who's going to go repair these things and they're far from being perfected . It takes some experts to work on electric cars because I read my car books I get from everybody . Even this new Cadillac is a joke. I don't know, people. How can you people up here listening, how can you just keep allowing this to happen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 to us, up and up and up and taking everything away from us. You know, I spend a lot of money on things. I buy apples for the deer down there. They've gone up twice as much. I buy a pound of peanuts oh, I don't know, like five pounds of peanuts -- six, eight pounds of peanuts that weigh -- three, four bags. I spend a lot of money foolishly . But gee whiz, the expenses for a common person like me are just gotten out of hand. It doesn't make sense. I dropped the Dish and I could afford to keep it. Two and a half years ago I signed a deal for two years for 80-something dollars . Nothing changed , I didn't add or subtract . My last bill was $192. And I could bring it and show it to you if you think I'm making it up. So I dropped it. I got a rotor thing that gets everything that I need. And I miss it, but I feel like a chum paying a hundred -- that's $2,000 a year to watch television . And I really don't watch it that much. I go down to the Taurus Club and watch their television . It's just as easy. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 What are we going to do, you know, the City is not -- last week you talked about Nay Aug. What happened to the budget money to fix Nay Aug? There's a jewel for the City going to pot. Where is the budget money to do work there? That bridge under -- got plywood holding it together . The banisters are laying there. And I love that place. It's sad. It's -- what's the money being spent on, you know? I don't know. I told you all that I'm about through . Somebody keyed my car a couple weeks ago. I don't know. I imagine it's my big mouth up here. That was the last straw. Last summer I gave Billy Grippo $2,000 to get my dents -- my dents out of it and everything else. Now it's keyed. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I blame it for what I say up here. And, Kyle, I got one thing. Patience and fortitude concur all things, don't they? MR. DONAHUE : They do. MR. ELLMAN: I saw that on a milk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 carton years ago in San Francisco . I remembered it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list is Frank Dubas. MR. DUBAS: Good evening . I didn't come here with the intention of speaking . So I don't really have a platform or something to say, but let me try. I grew up in Jessup. And I graduate d from the University of Scranton in 1975. In 1975, my dad put me on a bus to New York City. I have never been there before. And I worked there for 42 years. And I had a great career. And I retired. And I came back and I decided that I want to get to know Scranton again. And although I still live in Connecticut , I maintain a residence on Lackawanna Avenue in Scranton . So I'm here quite a bit. Several years ago I was walking down Cedar Avenue the -- in particular the 700 block. And I saw a for sale sign on a piece of property there, an empty lot. And I called the real estate agent. He came over immediately . I ended up buying the lot. And I ended up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 talking to the people in the neighborhood . And I found it to be a very vibrant and a wonderful neighborhood , the Cedar Avenue neighborhood . The people are nice. There are a lot of immigrant s and some of them are refugees . They're just nice people. So I created a not for profit and I donated the lot to the not for profit. And this morning we start building a community garden on that lot. It's a small lot, but it's going to be a community garden that I think -- I hope that you will be proud of. I'm very happy with the partner ship with regards to the City that I've had in getting this through . There's some LSA money involved . There's a lot of private money involved in it as well. But the City has been a wonderful partner . And I'd really like to thank the City for the way they have respond ed to what I consider to be reasonable requests . This community garden is going to be unique in that it's going to take the shape of a maze. You might consider , you know, typical community gardens where you see, like, let's say boxes or people. Well, this is going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 a place where mom or dad could take their child or children . They could be five or six years old. And they will be able to walk -- you might want to consider it something like follow the yellow brick road. And they will be able to walk in a maze right through the entire thing. They will make some mistakes because in a maze you make wrong turns. But they will be guided back in a way that they will eventually come back to their parents. And they may go through corn. They may go through lettuce . They may go through a number of things. But the beds themselves will be raised 16 and a half inches high so they can't really get in trouble . So I don't have much else to say other than the fact that I do enjoy the support that I received from the City. It's been a welcome after being away for 42 years. It's been a welcome trip to be back here or experience to be back here. So thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Thank you for your contribution and your interest in the City. Appreciate it. That exhausts the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First I'd like to question -- put out the question for Fifth Order. I had requested prior that the City had hired a health -- that we know that the City had hired a three-year health coordinator . And being 130 days into that health coordinator doing the position , it will be nice to get an update from that job position of health coordinator at least bullet points of what they've been involve d in and what benefit they have to the City because eventually if we're going to continue this, we are mandated to go back to the suppliers of that fund and supply them with the information of how they have actually supported and been beneficial to the City. DR. ROTHCHILD : I had given that update when I met with Dr. Saxena recently . Were you looking for something written from her? MR. COYNE: Just some bullet points of what she's actually done. And could you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 address that in Fifth Order, please because I do have a few things. I am trouble d. First I circled back to DUI of Officer Dougherty . I asked if he or the other officer was arrested for the DUI was still on duty or -- and I was informed that they were on duty and awaiting return of the blood test. I'm not sure if that is still correct , but I assume that is. This brings me back to an oath sworn under Title 53. "I do solemnly swear or affirm that I will support , obey and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this Commonwealth and that I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity . It was disclosed in the paper on the breath test the officer was three times the legal limit as reported . But that lacks clarity . The call went out looking for the car and a Dunmore officer was in Scranton for an unrelated incident heard the general lookout call. He spotted the car and was -- not only was the officer crossing lines on Green Ridge Street, but he came to a halt at the red light fully in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the opposite lane head on head with the Dunmore Police Officer . And then as the red light changed , maneuvered around him. That may be disturbing enough that the officer was not suspended . But the comment from the Dunmore officer is just as disturbing . The officer stated he was placed in an uncomfortable position . Funny how it's an uncomfortable position when it's only police pulling over police. And it's not an uncomfortable position when it's a police officer pulling over a regular citizen . Also disturbing as he was pulled over in Scranton by a Dunmore officer who was assisting and the case was transfer red to the Scranton Police Department . I would have figured the Dunmore Police Office might have been the right place because this is a direct conflict of interest , but, no. On a second issue, prior to this we had a mayor pulled out and charged by federal officer because of hidden deals that have always been an issue. But we are not devoid of this. I have reached out for clarity on the trash fee 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 and received double talk. We are not following the law. We are aware we are not but we can't talk about it because of legal challenges so we will continue to violate the law in direct negligence . I have reached out about the participants of the meeting s related to the rescue plan, one-on-one community members and 45 to 60 community stakeholders. I asked a simple question . Who were these people attending the meeting ? But it seems the City needs 30 days to know who attended those meetings . In the land of open working records and clarity , I seem to be running into closed doors, locked City Hall, and records that somehow do not exist. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. SHAW: Good evening Council , Darwin Shaw, Scranton resident . Wow, I didn't know a lot things that were going on. But there is good news, Mr. Donahue , congratulations on your position that you were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 deciding to run in. I do have an issue though. I do have an issue. On Beech Street and Donnelly Court there are little children at play. And there are watch children playing signs there that are spray painted over. I was just wondering if there would be a possibility that if not big infrastructure can get done like the roads, traffic lights, things like that, at least can we get the signs fixed pertaining to children playing around anywhere in Scranton ? MR. DONAHUE : Is that the 400 of Beech? MR. SHAW: Yes, yes, thank you. Also, number two, mister -- the new City Solicitor , if you don't mind because when I was here during the caucus there has been a discussion in the past about legalizing fentanyl test strips. And you can't give legal counsel . You're not allowed to but I am going to ask the question . You don't have to answer it. Is it illegal for local law -- does local law supersede federal law? MR. DONAHUE : So I could actually answer that. So we were going to -- we were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 going to actually -- we're looking about a year ago, six months ago we were looking at legalizing fentanyl test strips in coordination with the District Attorney 's Office. But when our previous solicitor looked into it, state law preempts any local law. So state law is still -- is higher. So what -- the resolution that we discuss ed in caucus that should be coming down would be in support of -- and I don't have the Senate bill or House bill on top of my head. But in support of a Senate bill and a House bill that decriminalize s fentanyl test strips statewide . MR. SHAW: Yeah, wonderful , wonderful . Wow, wonderful , yes, yes. Number three, flood mitigation has been a big problem in Scranton , Pennsylvania . I am going to raise Scranton -- preferable if we're going to look from the top down, East Mountain . I was a child that attended Friendship House. And they helped. Thank you again too for accepting their application for them expanding resources , especially to the citizens of Scranton . It is a good thing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Can we do something about flood mitigation instead of kicking the can down the road for the next 10 years? Can it be handled properly because we are borrowing a lot of money and it is not proper that the City itself, not City Council , the administration -- the executive administration will put out a survey and ask the citizens what we wanted, preferably pertaining to what my platform revolved around when I ran for Mayor, the roads, utilities , safety for the children . And the citizens said what they wanted and we're still going with what the administration decides. That is not listening to the voice of the people. That is ignoring people and utilizing their power in an unfair manner. And I would like to know if there is anything that I could do as a citizen to help. Who do I need to complain to? Who do I need to talk to to get this ball rolling because East Mountain alone has been going through those problems for a long time with the sewer lines, you know, the flood mitigation , the fact that our sewer drainage does not hold a 100-year storm. They don't even hold a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 20-year storm. The pipes are too small. And we are lacking in proper funding . And I do understand that. But it is not okay for us to act like we're billionaires because we are getting grant money that is actual borrowed money. And we don't have the ability to perform natural revenue with only our citizen s. And it is not cool that within the next four years it looks like the property tax base is going to expand by 25 percent . That is not okay, especially for inflation . And citizens now struggle to feed their family. I would like if something could happen with the Mayor's tax policy group, Mr. Donahue , if you could put the feet to the fire because you are going to be the state representative . And I am going to step down not only as a citizen and also as a father because it's a beautiful thing to grow as a person in your community . And I want to start here. I don't want to blame the Mayor. I don't want to do none of that. I'm going to start here and I'll grow where I need to grow but I want to fix home first. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 So, please, can we concentrate on flood mitigation , helping the citizen s in the summer because if there's nothing for the children to do, crime is going to go up. And it's not -- it's not family sustainable or safe anymore because everybody , everybody is working hard. And for us to go backwards due to individuals not wanting to get proper documentation or individuals want to think their authority outstands others, it's not okay anymore because the Mayor and the Council work as a joint unison. They are. So you have exactly the same amount of power that she does. So it's time for you guys to command -- not command but ask in a positive manner for the proper document ations that you need. And she must give them to you or we're going to have a bigger problem because I am going to run for Council . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Shaw. Appreciate it. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn . Okay, I just ask people to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 realize that we're kind of at the mercy of the federal government and when they're going to come up with the money for this. In a lot of instances cities were built with very little consideration of flood control . And now the problem has gotten -- chicken s are coming home to roost. But I think the Mayor is doing a fine job right now. And last week we had a little sermon on Supreme Court decision s. So I brought back a letter. Comment s were made about the Mayor and certain Council members attending Planned Parenthood rallies . My opinion is that USA should have introduced family planning globally 50 years ago, all of them willing to participate . There's been consternation about doing that for years. We're still not allowed to do that. And I have heard estimates of 2 billion people could live on a western standard of living without severe environmental degradation . Many of these same commentators express opposition to social program s and suspending to sustain US citizens in time of need. We had (inaudible ) starting in the 80s. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 They go to industries all over the valley and all over the country . Now we have supply line problems . Whoop-de. What was wrong with when it was in our backyard ? I have support ed free choice and personal responsibility all my life. People should not be required to put up with intrusion into their personal lives by the government at the behest of others religious fervor. These issues have no place in the constitution of democracy . Regressive legislation disenfranchisement , incarceration , and ethnic cleansing are often the final result. Over the years I have seen the same individual s comment on many issues that are not their legitimate concern . The 14th and 15th Amendment to Bill of Rights have ensured free choice in matters of social nature. We need not return to 1859. I have had my own issues with these people -- and well, I'll skip that part. My suggestion is that they should accept the will of the voter and mind their business . In Colorado , the state instituted a broad avail of birth control and eliminated 55 percent of all unplanned 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 pregnancies and 65 percent of all abortions . Excuse me if life taught me at 68 years that half a world is better than none. It appears that some people love their imaginary reality but no good will prevail. And on studying this Judge Alito on the recent leaked went back to Sir Edward Cook back in the 1540s and he was instrumental in witch trials and the death penalty for witch trials. And what kind of crazy people do we have in the Supreme Court? The only reason you have freedom in this country is because we have a secular constitution . Jerry Falwell , moral majority . He was a segregationist in the 50s. Segregation now, then, and forever . Republicans , as far as inflation is concerned , all I expect from them if they get back in power is to yell in my face that I'm an ingrate and I should shut up. Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. KING: In reference to Mr. Shaw's discussion about stormwater , I know that we had our ARPA presentation recently with Anser. 34 percent of the ARPA funds -- so we're getting 68 million dollars . 34 percent of that is going towards stormwater , which is about $23,120,000 to remediate the stormwater issues throughout the City. So hopefully that will hit a large portion of what we've all been experiencing , not only on East Mountain but on West Mountain and the Hill Section and actually throughout the entire City. It needs to be addressed . So I just wanted to point that out. And I have something later about 5-C also. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Only one comment , the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association sent over an address of 1107 Woodlawn Street if we can have City inspectors check out that address saying the property maintenance is poor, rodents , things like that. So if we could send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 that address over to them. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have two comment s. First, I wanted to thank Mr. Dubas for coming and saying a few words about the Garden of Cedar and updating us on the progress there. It was some time ago that I attended a groundbreaking ceremony . And I know that things take time for grants and for planning . And I'm happy to see that work is being done now and it's something that the community will be able to take enjoyment . And I would love to bring my daughter some time and see her walking through the maze there and getting to teach her about the different things that are growing there. And then second, I wanted to address something that Mr. Coyne brought up about the public health coordinator . Back in February I met with Dr. Saxena and then provided an update during a Council meeting on what we discussed . And I know there are a number of activities planned for the springtime, some public health fairs that the City was participating in.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 So I'm happy to ask her again for an update, perhaps something written or maybe at some point if there's the desire from Council to have her come in for a caucus to explain the activities of her office. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, I have a couple comment s that I want to report out on question s that I posed last week to the administration . So one of them was a question I asked a couple of times in the past two years. Do we have an employee handbook? All right. So I remember a year ago, a year and a half ago we're working on it. And that was a former HR Director . So I received an answer that the new HR Director is working on them. So I hope they get done. And then in line with that question I said, you know, within the handbook we have information that would answer other question s that are posed to me. So next, last week I asked about an FMLA policy, the City's policy not the federal policy that, you know, we have to follow. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the response I got is, the City has no formal City policy, rather we follow federal rules and regulations , which, of course, they have to. Everybody does. But we believe that our practice should be called into an actual policy. So I hope they're creating a policy for that. It would be embedded in the handbook if that ever happens . And also while I was asking that question , I asked another question I asked the past two years. I asked if -- because the past two years in the proposed budgets we receive from administration , there was large raises based on performance . That's what we were told. You know, we didn't agree on them raises. But they were based on perform ance. And I asked a question , well, are employee s evaluated ? Are any employees in the City put through a formal evaluation process yearly? And I was told no, all right, that they were going to start that process . So I reiterated that question and sent it over and I got a response . The response I got is not the answer I'm looking for. So I'm going to have to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 back and ask again. But here's the response I got. "Employee evaluations are not policy." All right, well, they should be. "And are handled by respective department heads with input from HR Directors as needed." So my question is, are they being done? This is two years in a row I'm asking the question . Are yearly evaluations -- formal evaluations being done of employees ? So could you please ask that question again -- or pose that question just for clarification ? Are they occurring ? This doesn't answer my question that they are occurring because I was told last year they would do it this year. So, you know, we're well into the year. I'd just like some clarification . I don't need to know who's not doing them because they're saying department heads are supposed to do them. I just want to know if they're actually being done, simple question . Thank you very much. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I just have two things tonight . Last week we did bring up an e-mail I believe we all received 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 regarding a petition for permit parking on the 1500 block of Pine Street. That petition was approved and permit parking does qualify for the 1500 block of Pine. So they'll be working with -- Police Department will be working with DPW and the residents to get those signs up for the permit parking . There was also a request for a stop sign on the 1300 block of Pine as it meets Taylor Avenue. That request was denied. The SPD traffic officer stated that that was not warranted in that position . And I did get one complaint this week, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could pass onto DPW regarding a drainage pipe on Moltke and East Locust. I guess DPW went out and fixed the pipe. But where the water flows out from, there's a lot of overgrowth there that's in a City right-of-way and so the water is not properly funneling down the mountain , if we could send that along to DPW. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : And that's all I have for this evening . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE CAPITAL PROGRAM (“RACP”) THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA ’S OFFICE OF THE BUDGET IN THE AMOUNT $1,500,000.00; IF THE APPLICATION IS SUCCESSFUL , ACCEPTING AND DISBURSING THE GRANT; AND COORDINATING THE USE OF THE GRANT FUNDS FOR THE PROJECT TO BE NAMED THE “SCRANTON MUNICIPAL BUILDING RENOVATION PROJECT ”. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR, OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OFFICIALS , AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH NOSSAMAN LLP TO PROVIDE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SERVICES . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , similar to Mrs. Hodowanitz , I was reviewing that as well. And I was thinking the same thing. So where is the funding coming from and you indicated earlier that it's coming from the professional services ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. KING: But how long are we expected to work with this team? MR. DONAHUE : So just a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 question s that did come up in caucus that I am going to pass along, one is what is the length of the contract ; do they get a percent age of what's brought in or just that monthly fee; and when is the actual start date for the contract . MR. KING: And when -- okay, yeah, I guess -- is there an end date to it? MR. DONAHUE : I believe it was two years. But I am going to check on that too. I don't remember if that was just conveyed to me or if I saw that in the legislation . MR. KING: And once, you know, whether they're successful , is that it? Then they've done their job and we move on with the funding or is it -- the plan to continue to work with them after that? MR. DONAHUE : I think it's just, you know, see what happens and see what they're able to bring in additionally in terms of federal money, especially with some of the infrastructure money coming up. MR. KING: Okay. I'd appreciate it if we could get some of those answers . MR. DONAHUE : Does anyone else -- anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I had asked those questions in caucus as well. And I do agree with the suggestion to have some more of that information in the legislative cover sheet because to look through , you know, 150 pages and a backup and a lengthy contract , it is difficult to find that information . So it might be in there, but I have trouble finding it. So I would like to know what the length of the contract is so in future legislation if we can have that included right in up front, then that I think would be helpful for the public and for us. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I share -- the concern I had and you addressed it, President Donahue , which I'm glad is, you know, when people get grants a lot of time they get a percentage . I mean, that 4,000 a month doesn't sound like a lot. I mean, it's money we probably don't have. I understand that. But, you know, in their backup they're like, we have 10 million here, 20 million there. So and then we don't know how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 long the contract is. We need clarity for that. And then like Councilman King said, what happens at the end? I would like to see a report card, obviously , and see if it's money well spent and they're going to do what they say they're going to do. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : In addition to all the question s that other members had raised, which I had myself coming into this, can we please get some examples of possible actions that this company would do to justify the 48,000 we would spend for a year? And another thing, I did mention in caucus I always worry about addition s to the budget. I feel like, you know, we're looking at death from a thousand cuts. You know, we're trying to keep the budget at a suitable size, yet we're getting some new position s. We're getting some new raises. And, you know, like this one here, it's an addition to the budget. I think we have to take all of these things together and just watch how much we're adding to the budget. I think getting a few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 examples of what kinds of actions this company can do that we can't complete inhouse that would justify this money would be also helpful with this legislation . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I just have two things to add. In the backup from the firm they did include that they would be willing to provide Council and the administration with regular quarterly updates or monthly if we needed that. So I would be interested if this was voted on and they're hired that we would be able to receive those updates on their activities . And I believe the second thing I wanted to say was that this may have come out because the infrastructure bill that -- and the funding that a lot of cities like ours will be competing for on a federal level and it would be helpful for us to have a firm to help us to get those funds. So I'm not sure -- I don't know what the long-term plan is for this company . I would like to know that too. But I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 that's where this is stemming from the anticipation of those funds and being able to compete for them. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I would just, you know, I think they are all good points brought up. I'd just like to add, you know, if we're able to spend $40,000 to bring in an additional five, six million a year, I think that's money well spent. But I think we do need to explore the question s that were asked and hopefully we can get answers for those for next week. MS. SCHUSTER : That's also what I was going to say, President Donahue , if we can make sure that we're adding a time constraint on this so we do get it prior to Seventh Order. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ?

MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , I know one piece of equipment that I believe will have to be replaced in the coming years is the police body cameras. So I believe this will be a grant that could be used for that. The police body cameras the City currently has a more first generation where newer generation ones -- and they actually require to be turned on and off. The newer generation ones will actually automatically turn on any time an officer either unholsters their weapon, unholsters their Taser. So there is more safeguards on that front. So I'm happy to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 support this to give the police department the resources they need to do their job safely and effectively .
