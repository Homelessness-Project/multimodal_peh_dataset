MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou, Mr.McGoff,justafewitemsthisweek.On Saturday Ihadthehonorofmarching with Mr.McGoff intheArmedForcesDayparade. Theweather hadhampered theturnouta little bit,butthepeople thatwereatthe parade sawagreattribute toourarmed forces.Ithinktherewasover75 participants ofdifferent groups andbands andthings likethatandaswewalked the routeyoucouldseewhatagreatimpact this parade hasonthepeople thatwerein attendance .Wesawpeople veryhappytosee themarching andwealsosawpeople that weretouched emotionally thinking about theirlovedonesthathadeither served or gavetheultimate sacrifice intheirlife, soIwouldliketocongratulate the organizers fortheparade. ThisweekIwascontacted byafew residents withsomeconstituent concerns . OnewasonOswald Avenueandtheotherwas1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 onDavisStreetsowewillbeworkingon thosewithMs.Reedandtheproper authorities . I'vealsobeenincontact withthe Treasurer 'sofficetrying togetahandle on theamount ofdelinquent garbage feesthat existinthecity.Afewmonths agoImet withtheNRS,Northeast Revenue,andthey wereplanning todoamailing forallofthe delinquent taxorgarbage feepeople.To date,thatmailing hasnothappened .The plansrightnowareforthattogooutsome timeinJune,butspeaking withthemthere isatremendous amount ofdelinquent garbage feesoutthereandI'mtrying togeta determination onthedollar valuesthatare outthere.Itseemstomelikeit'sahuge amount ofmoneyandwehavetostartworking onfinding awaytocollect thatmoney.It wouldbequitehelpful tothesituation that weareininourcity. Finally ,afewmonths agoMichelle Dempsey washerewithavision ofsome different ideasforsomelandmarks in Scranton .Oneoftheideasthatwewere1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 interested inseeing whatwecouldpursue wasturning theHarrison Avenuebridge into apedestrian -typeofapark.Wecontact ed PennDOT and,unfortunately ,itseemsunless wewanttopursue itadifferent wayPennDOT doesnotrecommend thatthatbridge be maintained asapedestrian park,and theywentontoexplain touswhy,I'lljust readbriefly inthesummary ,buttheysaid, "IftheCityofScranton elects topursue thisconcept,theCitywillhavetotake ownership ,makethenecessary repairs and maintain thestructure .Coordination and approval bythePublicUtility Commission willalsoneedtobeperformed asthe railroad underneath isastakeholder inwhat happens withthisexisting bridge.The Department ofTransportation understands yourdesiretokeepthishistoric and symbolic bridge,butitdoesn'tseem feasible basedonthecurrent condition and cost.Asignificant amount ofmoneywould beneededforrehabilitation andthebridge wouldcontinue tocostthecityoverthe yearsasitwillhavetobeinspected in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 accordance withnational bridge inspection standards andmaintained ." Ithinktheconcept ofthisideais verygoodandtherearegoingtobealotof ideasthatcomeoutandasweworkonthis toseewhichonesarefeasible andwhich onesarenot.Ithinkwecanstillkeep thisideaontheburner,butIthinkperhaps weshould startlooking atotheravenues and putting ourefforts intheresothatwasthe opinion thatthestatehadonthebridge. Andthat'sallhavetonight ,Mr.McGoff. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,anumber ofitems tonight .I'dliketofirststartoffby congratulating theelection winners, Councilman McGoff. MR.MCGOFF:Thankyou. MR.ROGAN:Forhiselection .Tim Perryalsoforcitycouncil ,andourcity control lerRoseann Novembrino .Onthe county levelIamverypleasedthatit appears wewillhavetwocommissioners from theCityofScranton .Forfiveyearsmyself andIknowmembers ofthepublic andmembers1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 ofcouncil havebeenpleading withthe commissioners todoareassessment countywide.It'sbeenfartoolongand everytimethePennsylvania Economy League comesinoranyoutside advisors a reassessment ispartofeverysingle recovery planthatisputforward forthe citybecause it'staxesneedtobefair. Twenty someyearsago,30yearsagothe values aren'tthesameastheywerenowand somanyofthemareinaccurate .Wesee everyweekwegetreports fromtheTax Assessor 'sOffice wherepeople filetohave theirtaxesassessment reducedanditseems tobearacetothebottom.Thetax assessments needtobefairandnowwithnew incoming majority commissioners Ithinkthat nowisthetimetohavethoseitemsmoved forward . Also,Iknowalandbankisanother itemthatthecounty commissioners willbe heavily involved inandveryhopeful that withthechange inleadership thatthe Mr.O'Brienmaybefromtheprivate sector andMr.Wansacz beingdefeated atthepolls1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 thatwewillnowseemovement onthose issues. Secondly theNorthScranton Junior HighSchool project ismoving alongas scheduled .Anyone whodrives bythatarea seesaflurry ofaction onthatproject .I actually sawjusttheotherdayonFacebook pictures of--Iguessbefore pictures from inside ofthebuilding ,andit'saverynice building andI'mreally looking forward to thatproject beingcomplete dandgoing through andtouring itwhenit'sdone. Next,whilevoting onelection daya resident contacted meandstopped meonthe 300blockofNorthSumner Avenue.Thisis anongoing problem foractually fouryears. Therewasachimney repair thatwasdoneon ahouse,andIwillprovide theaddress , Mrs.Reed,therewasachimney repair that wasdoneonahouseandscaffolding wasput uptomakethatrepair.Thatwasfouryears agoandthescaffolding isstillstanding andthewoodisvisibly gray,anumber of theneighbors fromthatblockmentioned it tome.WhenIwasoutlooking atitthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 gentleman nextdoorcameoutandmadea pointtosayhowmanyyearsitwas.Soif wecouldletPatHinton andhisoffice know aboutthatissue. Oneofthespeakers brought upthe Housing Authority ,andthiswasonauthority another matter,butonEarthDay,andI apologize forthisbeingalittle bit delayed ,aresident wholivesintheHousing Authority contacted meandtheywereupset because theyareunable torecycle soI thinkifwecouldcontacttheHousing Authority andaskwhattheircurrent recycling policy isandwhatchanges canbe madetopromote recycling forthosethat liveinHousing Authority developments . Next,theItem7-Aregarding the saleofthedelinquent realestate taxesI willbevoting against thislegislation .I doappreciate thethought beingputforward andthemoreconservative approach thanwas takenwhenthishappened undertheDoherty administration ,butI'mstillnotcompletely soldontheprocess .Obviously ,lasttime itdidn'tworkoutforthecityandif1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 thegoalistohavealittle bitmoremoney upfrontthethought oftaking outalittle bitalarger taxanticipation noteatthe endoftheyearIthinktheinterest rate wouldbemorefavorableonthatthanthe6 percent thatwewouldbepaying regarding thissale. Finally ,Iwasveryupsettoreadan article inthenewspaperfeaturing AlBoscov talking aboutthemall.Mr.Boscov criticized andevenpokedfunatmanyofthe greatideasthathavebeenputforward by theresidents ofScranton torehabthat building .Obviously thecurrent formula thatMr.Boscov hastheleading rolein isn'tworking .Iwasjustatthemalllast Tuesday anditis,unfortunately ,aghost town.Thereareveryfewstores remaining andsomething needstobedone.Ifirmly believe thatMr.Boscov'sstoreshould have aplaceinwhatever development occurs at themall.Hisstoreisverysuccessful .We certainly don'twanttochasehimoutof townbecause it'sastorethatpeople like, buttheoverall mallconcept isnotworking1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 indowntown Scranton . Theideaofahybrid --having,you know,afarmer'smarket,amarketplace mixedinwithretail isveryappealing toa lotofpeople thatItalkto.It'spicking uptraction onFacebook,it'spicking up traction inthenewspaper ,andIknow numerous people Italktoembrace thatidea. It'sworked otherplaces.Obviously ,we don'thave,youknow,thepopulation that Philadelphia haswiththeReading terminal station ,whichisgreat.It'sagreat place,youcaneatanything youwantthere. Youcangothereandbuyanything youwant. Thatcouldcertain bedoneonasmaller scaleintheCityofScranton .Andby increasing foottraffic intothemallthe retail component ,whichcouldbeMr.Boscov, maybeanother anchor store,willsee increased wouldrevenue because thereis morepeople thatwillbewalking through the door. Ibelieve thatwasthethought behind putting theSingle TaxOffice inthe mallwasthatwhenpeople wouldcometopay1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 theirtaxestheywouldgoandspendmoneyin thestores inthemall.Again,withthe change atthecounty commissioner levelI hopethattheideaofconsolidating county offices inthatbuilding willbescraped . Thatbuilding needstoremain commercial spaceandit'sprimecommercial spaceinthe city.Wejustneedadifferent vision in ordertobringthatthatproperty backto whatitoncewas.That'sallfortonight . Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.Onalighter note,Iwouldliketotouchonsomething thatMariebriefly discussed .Ifanyonewas traveling lastSaturday morning between the HillSection andSouthSide,theywere treated tosomething verydifferent happening ontheoldHarrison Avenuebridge. Myself andsomededicated volunteers were yarnbombing therustymetalfenceonthe southsideofthebridge withcrocheted flowers .Weknewweareontosomething special because asthedisplay started to takeshapeeverycarorpedestrian would1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 stopandoffersupport andsay,"Greatjob. Itlooksterrific ."Something youdon'tsee everydayinourcity.Evencarsentering thecityontheexpressway belowwere blowing hornsandrecognizing thatsomething interesting washappening abovethem,soit wasagreatmorning .Andthenitjusttook offonFacebook thatpeople camebyand posted pictures oftheflowered fenceon theirpersonal pages.Thebestcomment I heardwas,andthiswasrepeated often,I drivebytheflowers andtheybringasmile tomyface.Forthatreason aloneweare proudofourlittle project ontheHarrison Avenuebridge.But,mostimportantly ,I wanttopublically recognize thoseinvolved intheproject ,thededicated womenwho spentthewinner knitting andcrocheting flowers orEllenMuzzi,CathyUngvarsky , SusieConnors ,Jessica Batton,andSandy Batton.Ofcourse,thecrewthatinstalled theflowers weremyself,NancyEvans,Ellen Muzzi,SusieConnors ,MayorJimConnors , DonnyO'Boyle,AdamDavisandAnnChamber . Also,theGreaterScranton BoardofRealtors1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 waskindenough topayforallofthe materials thatwereneeded fortheproject soforbetter orworseallofareusarenow called yarnbombers.SoIwouldsaystay tunedbecause theremaybeanother yarn bomberinaneighborhood nearyou. AlsolastweekPresident McGoff mentioned arequest forameeting inthe formofapublic cause,whichwetalked earlier ,withHenryAmoroso andhisstaffas wellasthemayorandsomeofhisstaffto getahandle onwhatthestatus isof several important issues facing thecityas wellasseveral mandateditemsinthe recovery plan.Citycouncil hasbeen extremely proactive trying tomoveforward numerous initiatives soIfullysupport that request . Citycouncil andtheadministration needtoputbenchmarksandcreate timelines forthecompletion ofmanyofthe initiatives within therecovery planand otherimportant legislation thatmaybe outside oftheplan.It'sasoundbusiness practice andoneweshould embrace and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 adopt. Also,lastweekCouncilman Wechsler mentioned thattherewasseveral bills presented inHarrisburg thatcould dramatically effect thecityandits taxpayers .HB-504addresses property tax reform,something veryimportant toour property taxpayers .Fortherecord,State Representative FlynnandFarina voted"no" against thisproperty taxreform.Onthe stateSenate sidetheirwasabillpresented addressing pension reform formunicipalities specifically ,again,veryimportant tothe CityofScranton .Fortherecord,ourstate senator votednoagainst thispension reform bill.However ,Iamstillencouraged because theconversation andadialogue has begun,solet'shopesomehow thosein Harrisburg canfindawaytoputaside partisan politics andbegintoworkto tackle thoselargeissues thatweso desperately needaddressed .ThatisallI haveatthistime.Thankyou.

MR.MCGOFF:So,again,well,your opportunity totellajokewaslost,but again,agoodcauseandalittle bitof humortoagreatcause. Justtomention somebody brought up theScranton Parking Authority debt,just forinformation 'ssakethepayments onthe SPAdebtincreased byabout$800,000per yearfollowing theforced default ofthe SPA,soandplusthecredit rating ofthe citywaspretty muchdestroyed because of that,sotheremayhavebeenotherwaysin whichwecouldhaveaddressed thatproblem . Anongoing problem and,againit's beenspoken aboutbyalmost everyone on council istheparking --wrongsideofthe street parking .Idon'tevenknowhowto phrase it,buttickets arebeinggivento people thatparkinginthewrongdirection onthestreet andthispastweekjust received another series ofphonecalls concerning itmaybebecause thepeople giving outthosesaycitations werenowin SouthSideasopposed to,youknow,West1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Scranton wheretheproblems existed before.

Andlastly,Iwouldliketo reiterate whatMr.Rogansaidconcerning Boscov's.IshopatBoscov's,it'sagreat store,butI'llsaythatIbelieve that Mr.Boscov couldhaveisagreat businessman .He,youknow,puttogether a series ofstores thatareverysuccessful throughout theStateofPennsylvania andthe northeast ,however ,Idon'tthinkMr.Boscov hasbeenverygoodfortheCityofScranton .
