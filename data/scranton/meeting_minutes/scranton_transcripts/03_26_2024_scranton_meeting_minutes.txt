MINUTES OF THE COMPOSITE PENSION BOARD MEETING HELD FEBRUARY 21, 2024. 3.F. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS REGARDING RUBICON UPDATE RECEIVED MARCH 19, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one on 3-A. So in the past two meeting minutes that we received , this one is from February and the one from January , there's still a vacancy on the Pension Commission . And I guess, you know, three names were requested and three names were provided . And I guess there's been a vacancy for maybe at least a year. So, Solicitor Gilbride , can you please send a letter over to administration , ask what the status is of this? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yes, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? If not, received and filed. At this time I'd like to congratulate Jessica Rothchild and Bridget McIntyre on the birth of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 their child, Caleb James. And Jessica will be back next week. Do any Council members have any announcements at this week -- at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. I just want to wish everyone a blessed and safe Easter season. That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I might as well go with both of those. Have a Happy Easter and also congratulations to Jessica on the birth of her son. MR. KING: I also would like to congratulate Jessica and Bridget on the birth of their baby boy on Thursday . I hope everyone is healthy and happy and we look forward to her return next week. I do want to thank everyone who came out on Saturday evening for the fundraiser at the Waldorf to support Detective Kyle Gilmartin . It was a great turnout. And it was great to see Detective Gilmartin . It's the first time I had the opportunity to meet with him since that terrible horrific attack on his life. So that's all I have at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First on our list, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I assume Dr. Rothchild is probably watching this on TV or she'll be watching it later on. But congratulations on the birth of your little boy. And when you come back next week, please bring lots of picture s and be prepare d to stay late. I have an interesting invitation to the people who live downtown Scranton . The Scranton Public Library is going to host a solar eclipse event on April 8th, which is a Monday. The event will start at 2 p.m. They are going to have a live feed which they'll have a large TV screen in the Henkelman Room. The live feed will be coming from NASA. And they also have solar eclipse glasses . So between 2 and 3 p.m., you'll be able to watch it on the large screen and also go outside assuming that it's not cloudy and raining and able to watch the eclipse itself. So there are -- you have to register 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 for this event, just call the library , 348-3000 and press number five for the option to get the reference librarian and get yourself registered . Right now there are about 20 solar eclipse glasses left. So I registered and hopefully people who live downtown , especially the elderly retirees , all you have to do is walk on over and have a good time. And it should be very interesting . I don't think most of us who are, you know, sexagenarians and octogenarians will be around to see the next one so you might as well come on down. Once again, the union contracts are not on the City's website , firefighters ' contract 358 days old. It's coming up on its first year anniversary . Police is 242 days old. Love to see what's inside those contracts since it's taxpayer is funding the salaries and other benefits . Remember the RFP for financial forecasting when we were looking for somebody to come in and do some long-range planning for us, is the administration getting ready to send any names down or companies for that RFP? MR. SMURL: Yeah, I believe they are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 down to two. We should get something soon. MS. HODOWANITZ : We're getting close. And also, remember the 36.2 million dollar bond that we had PFM in here in a caucus briefing us on that; and they were waiting for an interest rate which they assume would be decided by the middle of March. Well, now it's March 26th. Do we know what kind of interest rate we're going to get vice the old 5 percent interest rate? MR. SCHUSTER : So, Miss Hodowanitz , I asked that question last week. And we did get an answer. It was a very simple answer which I'm happy about, 3.27 percent . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, that's much better than five. You know, hey, any savings is -- do you know how much that translates into moneywise? MR. SCHUSTER : At this point, no. I just received these answers a few minutes ago. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, we'll figure it out. But that's good news. How is the 2023 audit going -- MR. SMURL: It's going along. MS. HODOWANITZ : Have they have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 good working relationship with the Parking Authority and the Sewer Authority to get those audits in? MR. SMURL: There's a financial meeting tomorrow afternoon . So we'll know next better for next week for you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Good. And I too wish everyone a safe and healthy Easter week and Holy week this week. And I'll see you all next week. And, Jessica , don't forget to bring your pictures . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I just want to start tonight by congratulating our students from the Scranton -- the basketball teams. I'm a basketball lover. I like seeing the high school play basketball . So I enjoyed watching them, the boys and the girls as they advanced through the ranks of playing basketball . So kudos to you guys out there and for you that are seniors , you know, this probably was a great year for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 you. So I hope you enjoy -- you enjoyed the run they had with basketball and as you move onto higher things later. So congratulations . I also wanted to mention and read about a fish fry that's going to be held at Shiloh Baptist Church. And if I could just read this, it's their annual Good Friday fish fry at Shiloh Baptist Church at 1936 Wayne Avenue in Scranton , Pennsylvania . It will be March 29th from 12 to 5 or until they're sold out. It's $15 per meal, take out or eat in. And you could call and place an order. And that telephone number is 570-347-3718. And that's to support the Shiloh Baptist Church there in North Scranton . The other thing I wanted to talk about tonight was I was away for a few days. And when I'm away I do keep my -- ask my newspaper guy to deliver my papers when I get back, which he did and usually there's not too much in it. I'm sort of disappointed in how the newspapers are going now. But something caught my interest . And I thought , wow, this is really terrific . And that was an article that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 was written about the traffic lights that are going to be installed within the City of Scranton . And it seems that there's three locations that they are zeroing in on in South Side -- I think it's South Side. And I thought it said as I read the article it took years for those traffic lights project to come to fruition . So I'm thinking , is that what it's going to take with the street signs, years and years and years? I've been talking about the street signs for five years or six years. So as I read this article , I thought it would have been great if they could have worked together . And I know there is a PennDOT project . So it's not a city project . It's a PennDOT project . But they talked about the arms that hang out over traffic . And there's some of the traffic lights don't have that arm and they sort of waive in the breeze. So they're going to be replaced and the arms are going to be put there. And I thought it would have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 great if they worked with the City of Scranton . And as they have that equipment to put up the street signs as they're doing it. So what's the sense of putting up great big wonderful traffic lights and you don't know where you are. I have had people from West Side text me and tell me that there were some street signs put up in West Side but they are very, very small that they're not their regular -- it doesn't seem like they are the regulat ed street signs. So I haven't gotten out there yet. But I will be driving around as I usually do and make a list of those that appear to be updated and new street signs. So my thought is, again, as to why we couldn't partner with the PennDOT to get our street signs up as they put up the new traffic lights. That's all. And I do wish everyone as well a Happy Easter and whatever your, you know, if you're going out for Easter egg hunts. Enjoy. Talk to you soon. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 The first thing I have here is that, you know, walking up to Council today I walked by a law office with a condemned sticker on it. You know, as you wonder through the city it seems like inspectors are just walking up and putting condemned stickers on buildings . Council was going to look into the training of -- they sent a letter to somebody about inspectors condemning homes when they didn't pass the test and they weren't qualified to do condemnations . I don't know whatever happened to that. But, you know, we really need a real change of direction in our city. I mean, I don't know if it's ever going to happen. You know, we just had a discussion about street signs. That was Chris Doherty 's great plan. He took down street signs that were here for decades that everybody could read and put up those plastic signs that fade because , I guess, when you're using somebody else's grant money it really doesn't matter what you do. And no matter where you put those signs, they fade in the sun. But the street signs that were here when I was a child never 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 faded and they were always -- could be read. So we took something that weathered quite well in the city and since we could throw grant money at something , I guess that was the better plan because we can, I guess, probably support political supporters of the Democratic party in the city by accomplishing that task and, you know, making the situation just much worse. And as we look at this city, our city needs some real leadership change. I mean, I haven't heard anything from Council that gives me any idea that they have any concern for anything that's going on in Licensing and Inspections . And I'm just waiting for Judge Farrell to set my hearing up. I'm probably going to invite the Council members to come so that, you know, they could maybe explain to the Court why they haven't intervened because , Mr. Smurl, you know, you are right. You are a legislative body. And all the damage that's ever been done to this city has been done right here in this chamber . You redid the quality of life. And your signatures are on it. But there was never any protection 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 for the residents . Ron Ellman came here last week and spoke about how he got a quality of life ticket again because they thought his window was a door. I mean, and when you look at the abuse that's taking place, I mean, I've never seen a group of alleged leaders duck and hide as much as this Council does. I think the resident s of our city deserve a lot more. And I think that it just proves the fact that, you know, you could elect anybody . But will they really do their job and will they show concern for the citizens because in America , the citizens are the sovereign s. Elect officials are not sovereign , but the citizens are. We are suppose d to be served by you. And we can't even get you to speak words. You just sit there and then you want to respond at the end of the meeting instead of having a dialog, not just with me but with everyone . And when we look at where our city is, I mean, you know, you just have to see that over my lifetime the population has seriously dropped . We've spent a lot of money. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 none of it went where it had to go. It went to wherever , you know, the Council members and the Mayor divvy it up -- the grant money and determine where it's going. But does it ever go to where it really needs to go? And the resident s need to ask how much longer can we play these corrupt games with alleged public money because this money isn't free. People either across the country pay taxes on it or the residents themselves pay tax. But we haven't had any relief from the 2.4 wage tax that the city levies on people. And, you know, you wonder what's going on with our country when you have homeless encampment s around every city and every population center in the country . And all the jobs are in China and Mexico. And yet, the people we elect to represent us, they put on cheap suits and get elected and nothing happens for the people. And it's not a cheap shot at the Council . You must have ran with an idea. And why, you, the legislature can't pass laws and protect the citizen while you protect the city, that's a different question because I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 understand in the qualify of life why there wasn't some kind of protection s for residents like Mr. Ellman. Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner. Last week when I was here I talked about registering my rental property . And the woman who registered me asked if I lived there. And I said, yes, I do. And she said who lives on the other side? I said my daughter . And she said, well, if she moves, you have to pay a fee. And I disagreed . But I didn't get in an argument with her. And I'm going to read something from the ordinance right here because I think as long as I live there, I don't have to pay a fee. It says rental ordinance occupied by immediate family will continue to be exempt from fees but must be licensed . Now, Mr. Smurl, could you ask Attorney Gilbride if he thinks I'm correct or not? MR. SMURL: Correct in what? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MR. SPINDLER : I think as long as I live there I don't have to pay a fee. MR. SMURL: As long as you live there, no, you shouldn 't have to pay a fee while you live there. MR. SPINDLER : Well, the woman who registered my property said if my daughter moved then I have to pay a fee. MR. SMURL: If your daughter moves and someone else moves in? Into that apartment ? MR. SPINDLER : Yes. MR. SMURL: Then you would have to pay a fee for that apartment . MR. SPINDLER : That's not the way I read this here. MR. SMURL: Well, that's the way I understand it. Attorney Gilbride , is that the way we're reading it? ATTY. GILBRIDE : That's my understanding as well. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Do you know what section that is, Mr. Spindler ? MR. SPINDLER : What's that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. SCHUSTER : Do you know what section of the ordinance that's in, Mr. Spindler ? MR. SPINDLER : No. It was in the letter I got. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. I have the immediate family exemption from the question you asked last week. Residential rental units occupied by immediate family members of the owner's family shall be exempt from paying the rental license fee or individual regular inspect fee. The exception only applies if not more than two unrelated individuals in addition to the immediate members of the owned family occupied the residential rental unit at any given time. The code official shall have the authority to determine whether this exemption applies in any given case. So yourself and your daughter are fine. Now, did you have -- it didn't reference another -- MR. SPINDLER : No, if she moves out then I would have to pay a fee? MR. SCHUSTER : We continue to look.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. SPINDLER : Okay, whatever . Next thing, I saw in the paper today Pennsylvania American Water was unaware that they polluted Roaring Brook and Lackawanna River. I think that's a lie. How could they not know that all that sediment got into the rivers? It's unbelievable . And all they got was a few citations from DEP. That's like a slap on the wrist. They should have been fined a million dollars for what they did. It took years to clean up the Lackawanna River. And just in the matter of days maybe, the American Water pollute d it again. They can't even stock trout in there this year because of what they did. The American Water Company gets away with murder. Lastly, a lot of people have been talking about the homeless situation . And coming down to McDade Expressway getting off the Providence Road exit going towards Redner's if anyone is familiar with that, about 100, 150 feet from the red light where Redner's on the right-hand side it looks like there was a homeless camp there. And now it's just a bunch of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 garbage . You can't miss it. It's all over the place. There's garbage everywhere . So I don't know if PP -- if DPW could get over there and see if they'd clean it up because it's an eyesore . It's before you get to Redner's on the right hand side before the traffic light. You can't miss it going down towards traffic Providence Road. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mark Margavitch . MR. MARGAVITCH : Good evening , Council . I think I followed the tallest person in here, Les. But what he was talking about with that, I just want to bring your attention to the definition section for the residential rental unit. It does say residential rental unit shall not include any -- it says a dwelling in which the landlord resides with one or more tenants . I don't know if that means inside your own building -- your unit yourself or if that's the building because is says the dwelling .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 So I think that may make it exempt. But anyway, about my issue about the rental registration , has anyone got an answer yet for the years that they are enforcing ? MR. SMURL: No. MR. MARGAVITCH : No, okay. I had tried to reach out to Eileen Cipriani . She did have Robin Selemba e-mail me all of my statement s but that didn't really help me. So hopefully someone gets back to me. I guess my question is, if we do make a timeframe of 2023 up, what are we going to do about the people that maybe sold their place -- or if we go 2020 up, what are we going to do about the homeowners that sold their place in 2022? How are we going to collect off them if they no longer own the building ? So I don't know how that's going to work out. But, of course, we all saw the news today about what happened to the OECD Director . I'm not going to really comment about her charges because they are only charges . But I was upset that she was still in this position after she was known to not have a license and continued to drive the vehicle for the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I know, Mr. Smurl, last week when somebody mentioned something about Mr. Etzel, his shop, that was a guy who had the detail shop that said he was shut down by zoning. I know you said you don't have any factual proof. And I guess my question is, if you did have factual proof, would you act on that against Mr. Oleski? MR. SMURL: That is not my job. That belongs to Licensing and Inspections . MR. MARGAVITCH : You can't ask him that on his own position now. MR. SMURL: Pardon me? MR. MARGAVITCH : I said you can't ask, you know, if someone brought an allegation against that department , you can't expect them to investigate their own department . MR. SMURL: Well, we are meeting with the administration about Licensing and Inspection , probably in a week or so. So I'll hold my comment back until then. MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay. I know even my own situation I know it was many years ago, but is anyone confused about what Mr. Oleski took away from me 13 years ago, not only the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 money but the time from my family because I had to work another job to try to make up what he did. Anyone concern ed about his -- I could prove that case but no one ever asked me to give them the documents . Anyone concerned about his past behavior or is that not relevant today? Okay. Well, so I guess we'll move onto then to the text message . The text message was sent from one code enforcement official to another . I did remove all the names that were not members or -- employees of the City of Scranton . And I also did cut out one vulgar word. But I'll read it first. I have enough time. So is says -- this is from Evan Harbert to Kristen Czyzk. And it says, So how about this? I just saw -- and I wrote Scranton resident number one -- Crystal who was another former code enforcement official , Crystal gave him a stop work order at one of his rental properties for trying to fix broken stairs which is the proper thing to do. Scranton resident one talked to Tom about it. Tom just told him to do the stairs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 on the weekend . And, of course, Scranton residence number two pulls a permit for him via recommend ations. That's blanked up. And the other person wrote, what? And then Evan wrote back, yes, yeah, I was shocked as well. This is the text message . And this is recent. My allegation with Mr. Oleski was 13 years ago. I just wonder when are we going to not let this person continue to do what he's doing? I know I spoke to two other members about -- maybe three other when I went to go purchase a house and I had to speak to Mr. Oleski and I was told that the lead abatement was done. The asbestos abatement is done. That house is still -- as good as demolished . That house still stands today. I would have liked to purchase that house back in the day. Like I said, it's either a lot of incompetence or it's just corruption . Either way it's not good. I believe he gave me bad information on purpose . And that was many years ago as well. I still don't have my license . To 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 be told I need a letter of recommendation , it's kind of crazy when I've been on my own forever . But obviously we'll let Dr. Rothchild heal and get back and maybe she could address that. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Aaron Lee. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I'm sorry, I guess I was daydreaming . I wasn't going to come tonight , no particular reason. But again, this newspaper printed a letter from this Sidatti {phonetic } of his hate and anti-Israel, anti-Jewish, racist garbage that I can't comprehend why a vehicle like this newspaper again and again and again allows such evil to be in print. You know, nowhere in his past letters has he ever of asked for acceptance of Gaza, donations or food to send to Gaza, food packages , just continual evil hatred of Israel and the desire to overthrow it. And this is Chris Kelly's close friend that he just bragged about in his article . I think both of them could just climb under the rock they came from. And about my door, there's no doorknob . It doesn't even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 look like a door. It's a window. It doesn't bother me. I just sort of accepted that this city could use a code enforcement and a traffic of bureau. Maybe our next mayor would do something about it. I noticed this is something weird in the -- I think Saturday 's paper. They print state liens. There's a lien for (inaudible ) automotive at 2110 North -- by my house -- North Main. That's a complete residential neighborhood . If we had some kind of code enforcement , why would this be a business address ? You know, this city just -- I have a friend Birmingham that watches this once in a while. And he says this is almost like entertainment for him. This is supposed to be a business . Our Mayor should come every once in a while and sit here and listen to the comments and suggestions people have. A couple weeks ago -- last week I was in the Abingtons . We buy some dog food up -- cat food up there. And a lady came over and told me our Mayor lives up there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I said I thought she lived -- well, I knew where she lived off of Main Street back in the houses. She said, no, they have a house up there. Is there any truth in that? I'm not trying to cause a problem . But she was adamant about it. You know there is -- this city's got waivers for half the people working here. If they want to live someplace else, they should have to pay a high tax like we do. My taxes, I got them a couple weeks ago like everybody else. And they are just getting outrageous . They're over three times what it was when I bought my house. When Jack Liptai was in my neighborhood , it was a prime neighborhood like Nay Aug. Now, look what's been allowed to happen to our city. I got businesses a block from my house, cars on the sidewalk . Yesterday I was behind a school bus. The little kids -- I was four or five cars behind it on the 2100 block. The little kids were in the street because of a big truck parked with all four wheels and the ground was muddy. Nobody seems to care about the children or the future of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 this city. They're the future of this city and they're walking in the street where cars are going 70, 80 miles an hour 24/7. I wish you -- like I said last week, I wish the people would start thinking about some qualified new people for our administration and Mayor. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Chris Czyzk. MS. CZYZK: Good evening , Council . My name is Kristen Czyzk. And I am a previous employee of the City of Scranton Code Enforcement . I am also the author of the seven-page resignation that you have all receive d as well as it has been discussed here at Council numerous times. I am here tonight to speak on my behalf. Before deciding upon residing, I reached out to numerous entities within the City of Scranton to try and get some help. With no surprise , I did not receive anything back from anyone. I was trying to report the misconduct that I know was going on within the building . I also reached out to the people seated before me in August of 2023. Again, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 nothing was done. And I heard nothing , except for Mr. Voldenberg when I followed up with him who verified with me that all members of the Council received my e-mail. When I went to the HR Director to give the same report, instead of looking into the misconduct I was reporting , I was harassed and was then painted as complainer via e-mail by the HR Director . Her harassment and constant e-mails and closed door meeting s within her office and just unwanted contact all together continued up to three weeks after I had already quit. And it did not stop until I advised her I was going to the police if she did not stop. She questioned me about a 20-minute time slot on my time sheet for November 14th, 2023 because an individual who I already reported having problems with, which my desk had to be moved because of, stated they saw me at my house during that time. Meanwhile , this same individual was not in his section of town that he was covering and that was okay. I had a disciplinary hearing on December 4th, 2023, no write-ups or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 discipline leading up to this meeting. As a matter of fact, there was nothing in my file at all. Funny thing is, this occurred after I reported the misconduct that is going on within the city. A target was placed on my back and the work environment became very hostile and toxic. I reached out to the Mayor to try to schedule a sit-down meeting with her and I was told by our very own Mayor via text message that I should take my problems up with my union representative , instead of her also looking into the misconduct that I was reporting even though the misconduct was from her administration . The former OECD Director was praised and protect ed. And I was told what a great person she is after making reports about her as well. Meanwhile , as it became public knowledge today, she is being charged with four felony counts of crimes she committ ed while being a public figure in this very city. She on numerous occasions pulled me into meetings and threaten ed my job and penning me as the problem . And now it's clear that she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 was just trying to cover up her own faults. She knew I was taking my complaints to outside agencies such as the DA's office and as well as the AG's office and did not -- and did her best to try and stop it knowing what she herself was doing. During my almost two years employed by the city, I was painted as the problem . I was told that I am a frequent flier in the HR Office and none of my complaints are warrant ed. Numerous HR meeting s to threaten me and my job just to continue to allow the misconduct and illegal activity to continue . They wanted me to shut my mouth to protect themselves . This Council needs to finally open their eyes and see the issues that are truly happening inside these very walls. This very Council put their trust into Miss Andiappan and look where that got you, another story in the paper. You should be so proud -- you should be so proud. Individual s come up here week after week after week and advise you the situations that have occurred and that are currently occurring and you turn a blind eye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 The news report today should make you go back and read my resignation and maybe take the information provided about the other individuals and do something about it. This administration is placing blame on the people trying to make good and protecting those in the wrong. Open your eyes and for the sake of the taxpayer s of the city do the right thing and fix it. MR. SMURL: That's all for the sign-in sheet. Anybody else? Anybody else want to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . So we have Easter. And we have a temple of gold, a sacrosanct walking trail of gold. So in the spirit of the holiday season, we eject the homeless and the unclean because a walking trail is a treasure that might bring us 30 pieces of silver. In the spirit of the season, we have gone from my brother 's keeper to my brother 's kicker. How disappoint ing and how very unchristian . Now off to other issues. There is lot to unpack today. We supposedly have a committee for the homeless that was announce d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 in here. How many times have they met? Who comprise s it and are there any minutes for that meeting ? We heard that it exists out there but we have absolutely no website , public exposure , anything set up for it to say that it exists at all other than knowing that the police put do not trespass for the homeless on that path -- on that walking trail. Can we get some information of who is on that committee and what it actually entails and when they meet? MR. SMURL: I'll send that request in, Tom. MR. COYNE: Thank you. We've been talking about corruption in City Hall. We've been talking about local government corruption . We've been talking about the bodies that shield them. We have a former Mayor arrested and jailed. We have an OECD Director who not only lists the city cases -- has been prosecuted and the city has lost on cases from vicious enforcement of the codes. But we have them making contrary statements in affidavit s under oath to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Office of Open Records . One saying that documents can't be release d because of security issues and then a second that says no documents exist to be released . Both of them were under affidavit . One of them is a lie. It's amazing that the documents turned up afterwards after the second one where they said they don't exist. But that's okay because lying under oath is something that is ethically accepted here in the City of Scranton . We have a park director who was installed properly and then on assurance he would move here and he would get lifeguard certification , he did neither and was granted a waiver of residency after a six-month period when it says on the moment of the sixth month the employee is terminated by the City Charter. But we don't pay attention to the City Charter . Then we have an executive session of Council because there's a lawsuit in the case handed out. But that was pulled out of court three months prior. And the executive session could not have been covered by that because an executive session is designed in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 legal excuse to restrict information that may cause impact or risk of a legal strategy or negotiation . It's not an excuse of we've done something bad and we want to keep it closed doors from the public. That's not how an executive session is supposed to be. This all looks like a black eye, so not talk about it and will not address it and we'll sort of address it in Fifth Order or just refuse. And that moves us to our former OECD Direct Miss Andiappan . Rocket her up and put in the position because we needed the best of the best. No time to think and look. Shove her in, but will not talk about the driving with a suspend ed license . We'll turn and look away when a warrant is filed because of failing to pay court costs and we will 100 percent not tell the public when she resigns because the person who is in direct control of 60 million dollars resigned because they are about to be charged with false -- with forgery , false statement s, and fraudulent stealing thousands of dollars from public assistance . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 This is who we trust with our financial deals. City's response , we have no reason to believe that the alleged misconduct occurred in her official capacity or the city was impacted in any way financially or otherwise . I guess all of this looks good on the city. Justice is not blind, but City Hall and its ethics is. We need a change. And it's not hiding behind and saying we can't look at it and we can't operate it. We can't make laws. We can't make legislation s. And we can't bring people before this body to get answers for what they do. But it seems that's all we get. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. SCUTNICK : So before I even start, anybody want to look back and apologize to Kristen for your negligence ? No? Anybody ? Because you all ignored the e-mails, right? Anybody ? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Scutnick , we've said this several times before. We got the e-mails. They were turned over to the administration and the administration is taking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 care of it. MR. SCUTNICK : Taking care of what? MR. SCHUSTER : It takes time. We were told that they are taking care of it. Council did send it over to the administration . MR. SCUTNICK : But even though you guys knew about the warrant for Selina, you still put her in charge of housing at the time the warrant was active, right? You guys voted on it, right? MR. SCHUSTER : This body did not vote on putting her in that position . MR. SCUTNICK : It was brought here at the meeting s. MR. SCHUSTER : This body might have voted on a waiver. But this body did not put her in a position . MR. SCUTNICK : You guys didn't make motions for her to move forward onto some board? MR. SCHUSTER : And I voted against her waiver. MR. SCUTNICK : What about your friends? Anybody want to take a little bit of account ability ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. MCANDREW : (Inaudible ) we did see it. And we were told there's an investigation . And we're still waiting for the finding s. MR. SCUTNICK : The investigation of what? MR. MCANDREW : Of all the compile d e-mails from not just you and her but some other people. MR. SCUTNICK : Well, I was kind enough today to reach out to the OIG office that was doing the investigation that handled Selina's charges today. So I'll pass it along to everybody in the room. If anybody wants to talk, the lady will gladly speak to anybody here that has information because OIG decided to open up their own investigation into Oleski and the first question they continuously asked was, was the administration aware and was Council aware? That's their big questions because you guys all turned a blind eye. So did the administration . You guys sat here telling Mark that Tom Oleski should be the one to investigate Tom Oleski. Does that make any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 sense to you? That's like asking Nolan in the back to go pull himself over for running a stop sign. Sounds pretty stupid, doesn't it? Does that not sound absolutely dumb? So you are going to have Tom Oleski investigate Tom Oleski's fraudulent business . I'm sure you're going to get great results out of that, right? And then the text message , everybody 's aware of that. Did anybody see that text message previously ? Did anybody see that text previously ? There is four of you. Can anybody answer? You didn't see it, Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : (Inaudible ) saw it. MR. SCUTNICK : No? Hold on. Let me pull up the e-mail I sent you. I could pull up the text message s where you asked me to put it in an e-mail too. So now do you want to say you didn't see it? MR. SCHUSTER : I don't recall seeing it. You sent countless things over many e-mails, many texts. There's a lot of stuff there. It was sent over to the administration . MR. SKUTNICK : But you just said you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 didn't see it. You asked me specifically in a text to put that in an e-mail to you directly. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. I don't recall it. MR. SCUTNICK : You're just as good as Smurl in this. MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I am. You've sent many things. MR. SCUTNICK : Because there's many problems . But you guys ignore many problems . Is that not correct ? Like you're keeping a guy in a position that you know he's violating public trust. So you keep him in a position of public trust. You had Selina in a position of public trust, where every time something was presented by anybody , everybody vouched she's a great person. She's an asset to the city; with what, getting arrested ? Which arrest do we want to count; the first, the second or the third arrest before we say that she's probably not a good fit. But we saved 15 bucks on the background check at least, right? That's a positive because that was what, two weeks ago? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. MCANDREW : It costs 1,500. And I've been pushing for background checks for four years. MR. SCUTNICK : You are. But we're a little late in the game now, aren't we? I mean, we promoted her with charges and a suspended license . We ignored Virgil's constant OOR request s asking for a list of city drivers or city vehicles while one was parked at her house for a while and it was ignored because the city didn't want to say, yeah, we gave somebody with a suspend ed driver's license a vehicle . I mean, all you're doing in that position is, I don't know, whoever gave her keys to a car that the city operates , you are nothing but putting the city liable for the damage she was -- could possibly do. MR. MCANDREW : We inquired if she was driving a city vehicle . We were told no. MR. SCUTNICK : Yeah, your city official s seem very honest. So I would take their word for it instead of looking into it. MR. MCANDREW : Well, I'm just telling you what we were told.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. SCUTNICK : That's like asking a 3 year old if they colored on a wall. No? Crickets again. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , taxpayer , resident . Okay, over many weeks the pothole patcher has been mention ed. And what I know about it is this. We bought a pothole patcher . It seemed to work. I never seen it in person. But whoever we shared it with left either -- left it go to waste with concrete inside or something . And was it was -- sat down the sewer plant for years. And whatever happened to it is beyond me. But if we ever go in the pothole patching again, we sure could use it. But don't lend it out to anybody . Don't share it with anybody . Let them buy their own. You know, the town has one of our fire engines and they get free trash removal and there's hardly any taxes. And about two weeks ago somebody was here about affordable housing . Well, how do we have affordable housing when we put up a 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 million dollar building , not in Scranton . It was the SLIPCO -- the Chamber of Commerce . And it gets tax free for 10 years. And on the 11th year they decide they don't need it and it gets torn down. You know, how much 20 million dollars -- how many affordable houses could that have been? And with code enforcement , be careful with both issues. I got into one heck of an argument with somebody over that quality of life business . And I never felt that it was a good idea to really gravel about neighbor s and people like that. You create hard feelings . And maybe the person is just somebody trying to get by. If they're totally attached to the last five cars they own parked in their yard, yeah, so be it. You know, get them out of there. There was an article a few days ago in the paper predenial for leachate permit jeopardizes plans. Here we go again. Now, hopefully you people will stop on the way home and pick up a couple gallons each of the proverbial gasoline and dump it on this because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 we don't need leachate going into -- the falls at Nay Aug is on the national landmark . And it's listed on the national landmark . And here these guys want to turn it in a sewer. I've had enough of this business . It's like our interest don't mean a hill of beans compared to their concerns for earning money. And, oh, by the way, you can keep paying $120 a month sewer bill for two old crows that live in this house and don't use much water, you know. It's like really beyond comprehension . I'll take some of the stuff I heard with a grain of salt. There may be personnel problems there. And, I mean, the point being if you holler about blight, then the people are going to -- every little thing, the people that are enforcing the blight code -- get under pressure to enforce it. And they may not be fair. And then you have another problem where somebody is getting booted out of their house. I went to the doctor's office yesterday . He gave me a pile of samples that were worth 22 bucks a pill. And there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 condemned stickers all over his office up on Mulberry Street. So he didn't ask me to mention this. And finally , don't rag about the flag. Ask Congress to pass Ukraine aid and call outside to other U.S. reps. It's ridiculous . That was due four months ago. And 30 years ago they had to turn over their land based nuclear forces to Russia. And we agreed to give them help if they needed it. Thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , resident and taxpayer . I'm going to skip anything tonight other than the fact that I believe that you are going to need a very big broom. I'm not sure they could make one big enough to clean this mess up and get back on doing some things for the people. But one thing that was done -- I will ask you, did anybody try to find out how they are addressing the stormwater with -- at the new University of Scranton building ? I guess not. Okay. What I do want to say is about a year or so ago my young friend came 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 with me and asked that something be done with the divider on the Spruce Street bridge because there have been accidents . And finally I was downtown this morning and I went across the bridge, and lo and behold the state department of transportation was there. They have painted quite a bit with a bright yellow. And they put reflectors on it, a lot of reflectors . So when I picked him up from school today, I took him down to show him and he was very happy and so should all the people who are using that road. So some things can get done. But unfortunately it was done by calls from outside of this group. So wait and hear what you're going to have next. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. LABROSKY : Good evening , Council , Lynn Labrosky , life-long city resident , homeowner , small business owner. I wanted to first mention some great news. A group of volunteers gathered together over the weekend and they worked really hard. And they did clean up part of the Heritage Trail which was long over due. This group of volunteers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 came out in the pouring freezing rain on Saturday , the freezing wind on Sunday and none of them were afraid to get their hands dirty. It was very inspiration al. In that group, I don't want to mention names because nobody wanted recognition which was great. There were two elected city official s that showed up, one elected city official that donated but couldn't be there. There was a Scranton School Board member that showed up. And there was also an attorney from the DA's Office that showed up. There was a nice woman by the name of Tricia Doherty . She lives in Tripp Park, very nice woman. She likes to walk the trail with her mom. Maybe Mayor Cognetti can knock on her door and tell her thank you because she's one of her neighbors . Also, there was a West Side High School honor student . He's a minor. So I won't mention his name although I'd love to. And he's a future University of Scranton student who was earning his community service that day so it really did work out. In spite of the weather we got a lot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 done. We receive d a lot of donation s for this project . Mr. Louis DeNaples was kind enough to donate a 45-yard dumpster including delivery and pickup. Depending on the weight, probably 1,500 value that we saved the city. Renee from Scranton Napa store donated work gloves, LJC Janitorial Distributors on Cedar Avenue in South Scranton donated 200 trash bags and four boxes of rubber gloves valued at probably about $200. Bruce, a local ambulance driver donated two large sharps containers . Joe from Pica HVAC on Pittston Avenue in South Scranton , came by and donated gloves, Lowe's in Dickson City donated $300 worth of shovels , rakes, and gloves. Angela from Wal-Mart donated a $50 gift card which was used to buy additional rakes and water. I reached out to a local counseling center in our neighborhood and they were kind enough to send out a mass e-mail to get some people to participate . So that being said, I would like to set the record straight . That day there were no complaints , no agendas and no politics . Everybody got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 along. Everybody worked together and we did that for a purpose . Our purpose was not to harm anyone or be uncompassionate . We were there to clean up garbage . That's exactly what we did. I don't think we took any belongings from anyone that was homeless because the items we picked up were frozen clothing and just garbage . It didn't belong to anybody . As a matter of fact, my husband when he was helping up in the wooded area, he met a guy that sat up and he laid back down. And then 20 minutes later he sat up again and he cleaned up his spot. And he was kind enough to drag a blanket down and throw it on the trailer . So he actually helped. So where do I go with this because I have a minute and a half. I took time out of my day today and run a small business . So that's not easy to do to pay the meter and come to a mingle with the Mayor at 4:00. I don't think we really mingled though. When I invite somebody to my house, I open the door. I greet them. I offer them a drink, maybe something to eat. I don't know. But she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 wasn't at the door. She did eventually make a debut. And when I present ed my concern s to her, she said that I was rude to her when I seen her at her neighborhood , which I don't think I was. But, okay, if I was, I apologize . And she rolled her eyes at me and then walked away. She was done with me. So way to lead by example . You're calling me rude while you're being rude. That's just my opinion . I have a lot more to say. I'm probably going to run out of time. I'm going to have my husband come up here and speak about something else because I didn't get to do it. But if we add all that stuff together , we really did save the city a lot of money. We made the trail look prettier . And I actually think the homeless people appreciate d that. We need to give these people a purpose . We need to find solutions . And nobody went there with any agenda but to just clean up and do their part. And I thought it was really fantastic . So I don't know, there's going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 more cleanups to come in the future. So I hope more people get involved . And we need some leadership in this city. Somebody has to stand up or step aside. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. LABROSKY : Jeff Labrosky , city owner, property owner, business owner. I tried to yield my time to my wife but apparent ly you can't do that here. So the little league up on behind Burger King there, I believe it's South 8th Street there. They are in need of a defibrillator . I don't know if I'm saying it right, but I tried my best. There is a person that we deal with through NAPA. And they have a memorial set up. It's called the Joshua Tippet Big Heart Memorial . If anybody would like to donate to a defibrillator to that cause, I'm sure you could do it through the little league. But also she would be able to take donations too. So if anybody could help, anybody in the city. These kids, they're playing baseball out there. What if one of them, God forbid, has a problem . We need that there for them. And when my wife asked the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Mayor, you know what the lady said from OECD, I believe she said. You could quote me, Lynn. What did she say to you from OECD today when you said that the little league needed help with that defibrillator ? MS. LABROSKY : They manage their own field. MR. LABROSKY : They manage their own fields and there was, what, no funding for them or was there funding -- well, that funding is probably in their pocket, but whatever . So we also had a problem with Tom Oleski too. Since I'm up here I might as well just get it out. We had a lot of problem s. We had a place behind us that was trying to start a junkyard . We called down the city. We were told that we were conspiracy theorist . We were -- when we asked the Mayor's office, the guy that was answering the phone at that time was Chris. And he said we. So my wife said, well, who's we? And you know what his answer was? "The royal we." Do you have people think -- not you, but does she think she's really royal? Because she works for us. We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 pay you guys to come here and do what you're doing. And I asked the city, the guy that was helping us out. And I don't want to mention his name. But he'll know who I mean. I said to him thank you for coming and helping us on this Heritage Trail. Do you know what that man said to me? He said, thank you. But it's my job. That's what the rest of you need to do. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hi. My name is Rick Little. I lived 14 years at Scranton Housing Authority . I was recently evicted on the 5th of February . I got a lot of information about the homeless situation . When I first got homeless , I couldn't get any information because I couldn't get my mail. And, you know, I couldn't get a lot of things because I didn't have my license . I had to renew my license . I had to take my (inaudible ) move the stuff to Dunmore in a storage space. I had to rent a truck. I hadn't driven in 20 years. And I just got exhausted . So I'm not thinking about where I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 going to go and I'm done. And I remember the attorney here saying that my landlord 's building is owned by HUD. And I've been asking this for years and years. I went today and I said to, Sean, can you tell me where I could get that in writing ? And he goes tax assessor. So I went to the tax assessor. I got the tax assessment of who owns Scranton Housing Authority . And it is the January 1st, 1900 deed. Now -- and then there's other deeds. It was reorganize d many, many times, 76. The main time it was reorganized was March 6th, 1996 when they made my lease that they evicted me for lease violations . Now, this is -- I'd just like to explain about how judicial -- how this is the biggest abuse that could ever happen. And it's coming from the District Attorney 's Office who runs Scranton Housing Authority . They have a -- first off, they say they're HUD because they want people scared, scared that they're going to be evicted . There's hundred s of signs over the years, do this. You're going to evicted . Do this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 You're going to be evicted . Do this. You're going to have to pay the court fees. The Court I discovered it's a business in itself. And everybody who runs SHA, most of them are judges or lawyers . They have so many. So when they do take me to court, they got the finest lawyers in the area. The same lawyers Scanlon, Howley, and Doherty who defend the Scranton School Union. They have millions of dollars . Where does the money go? And I found where the money goes. And I also found out about the homeless situation . There's nothing for me because I'm over 65. I mean, there is the Andrews Home Shelter and I certainly did there. And it's crazy all the papers they made me get. They made me go to my storage area and get my original license because that was a -- it's like go out and get this paper and this paper. And that's the nature of the whole city with all the 5013Cs. You go to Area Agency on Aging and then, you know, here's your job. Go out and get this paper, this paper, this paper. You got to go to Social Security and get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 printout . Well, the most absurd thing I got and I showed this to Paige Cognetti , you know, because she's telling me about, you know, there's the CIC, which is where everybody is complaining about all the people homeless people being. That's not all the homeless people. I'll tell you that. And then there's another -- the St. Anthony 's Haven. And, you know, they got 20 beds. It's in the basement . It's a big building , 600 Wyoming Avenue. But what's crazy to me is how this town was built. It was built by Presbyterians and Methodist s. And I look at this original owner history of SHA. And they don't even write the, you know, they don't even write, you know, the address . They had addresses then. They made all the streets up in 1886, I believe . And, you know, they just say Vine and -- Vine and Adams. And then, you know, there's all kinds of things in here, you know, for total taxable value for land and building . And all day I'm going around the Globe building . But the key thing is when they cut my rent -- when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 they cut my Social Security off in New York State -- and I heard about this ERAP, and I could not find anybody in Lackawanna County. Finally from -- I found out is at Catholic Services down there by the veterans thing on Penn Avenue. So I applied for it. And then later on I have to apply for it again at Agency on Aging. And they farmed out their application thing to a private company called Capital in Philadelphia . So I applied for this thing four times. And I go in front of the Judge Moyle, oh, all the money is gone. When I'm in court watching Judge Moyle, every case was SHA and talking about ERAP money. We're talking about ERAP money, whether we're talking about the Affordable Rent Act. I mean, David Coyne, first thing he said, Mr. Little got his stimulus check. That's not true. They know how exactly how much money I get from my bank account because I signed the thing. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Little. Thank you. MR. LITTLE: Okay. You know, five 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 minutes is never enough. MR. SMURL: I know. MR. LITTLE: And, you know, if you would expand it, the people watching this would know what's going on because no one knows what's going on. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . First and foremost, I'd would like to thank Kristen Czyzyk for coming out here tonight being brave and speaking out against this administration and their wrongdoings and the way that they treat people who truly care. You know, with any type of business or anything that you do in life, you are only as good as the people you surround yourself with. We need more employees like Kristen Czyzyk. I understand that this body really can't say much because of the ongoing investigation , much like Marty Flynn's mother, same demographic applies . We have a Mayor from out of town who chooses to use the City of Scranton as a stepping stone towards Harrisburg or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Washington . Neither is going to happen. Look at these roads, mention ed last week your ordinances are in place. What we need to do is we need to push those ordinances as far as the utility companies and how they progress with cutting our pave hole cuts. They back up a truck or they pack it down with a shovel. It's not good enough for me. It's not good enough for the citizens of the City of Scranton . I don't think it should be good enough for you. Six, that's the number of times that I actually had a possible encounter with our Mayor. Since my son's passing I started the Nevaeh Project . And it's to look into education , prevention , and awareness to our opioid crisis. This Mayor is putting lives at risk, her police officer s at risk. I'm requesting that this Council send a letter to the Mayor asking her to request three additional canines for our police department . We only have two. There's 168 hours in a week. Our police officers are taxed to the limit as far as the number of hours that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 put in. Being short certainly doesn't help the situation . So six was the number of times that this Mayor and I had the opportunity to talk. She chose to say nothing , nothing as far as my son's passing , nothing as far as sorry for your loss. Seventh interaction was today. As opposed to saying sorry for your loss, what she did was, Mr. Mancini , I see you have some Monster bottles in your hands. Well, my reply was simple. Needed to jacked up for tonight because in a matter of five minutes , there's going to be a heck of a lot to say. Tom Oleski, learn the letter S. If you don't want to be page one, I suggest you shut yourself down because the EPA and the DEP are on their way. You have an illegal business and, like I said, if you want to be next on page one, keep it open. I suggest you shut it down. Now, as far as this administration goes, there's not a lot to talk about in the ways and means of our future. You know, it's unfortunate that we're getting all of these calls, these police calls, code reds, things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 like that. Since my son's passing the day after his birthday on May 20th, I -- it's really affected me. Somebody , an 11 year old not too far from where I reside overdosed not too long ago. These canines are very important , okay. We need to protect our citizen s. And next May 20th is the primary . That's when she's up for reelection . At this point, we need to do better. We truly do. We need to bring our communities together . We need to work on our neighborhood watch program s. We need to get to know our neighbors better. I've given this Mayor an opportunity to speak with me tonight . And she chose not to do so. Snide remark. Arrogance at its finest. Well, guess what, Paige Cognetti , come next May 20th, you're going to be out of office. And the conversation you and I have, it may be at the University of Scranton . There may be other people at the table but assure you there will be another suit. The city belongs to the people. We could do better and we will do better. Thank you, Council . Oh, by the way, Mikey, I'm going to leave these downstairs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 for you. You could grab them when you come in the office tomorrow . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? No one else. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few. I would like to request -- I know that you have weekly meeting , Mr. Smurl, with the Mayor. If you could discuss the request for the additional canines , I think that is something that is greatly needed in our city and see if we could find some funding to try to look into purchasing and training , you know, some additional canines and officer s to work with them if you could do that. MR. SMURL: I will. MR. KING: Thank you. As indicated earlier by Mr. Schuster , we obtained the interest rate for the refinancing of the bond which is 3.27 percent which is extremely favorable in this market. So that's a good thing for the city. I'd also like to request , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 Mr. Voldenberg , if you could ask the administration if they could put an updated paving list on the website so that the citizens know exactly -- and I'd like to see it broken down almost like in the spread sheet that just indicates what streets , the blocks that are being paved like 800 to 1200 or what have you, so that the citizens will know whether or not their street is getting paved this spring. I know that sometimes that list moves a little bit because of UGI project s or Pennsylvania American Water projects . But I really appreciate if we could get that list updated . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Also, we did get an update on the street signs, Norma. Apparently we received $335,000 in a grant recently . I believe that that work is going to be outsourced. And they're going to be moving forward with it to continue to get more street signs in the city which has been a work in progress over many, many years. And we'll stay on it and continue to ask them to continue to updating that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 I attended a meeting last night at Robinson Park. The members from the Deutsch Institute were there. They were doing -- the Deutsch Institute had -- they had got quite a number of grants to update that building up there. And a lot of work had been done. But still the roof, apparently they still have a leak up there. So they're working on that. They're going to have a fundraiser , the Deutsch Institute on April 19th at Waldorf Park. And as I gain more information on that, I'll let everyone know. But Scott Gassenmeyer was there last night. And he gave an update about all the work that's going to go on at Robinson Park. It's going to be -- it's handicap accessible . Most of the equipment for the playground has been purchased and delivered . The work is out for bid right now. We expect shovels in the ground by probably mid to late -- probably late April, early May. And we're hoping that project will be completed by the fall of the 2024. And furthermore , I had the opportunity to go by and see the updates that occurred over at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Oakmont Park. And that looks fantastic . It's very close to being finished . They just kind of have to finish some of the walkway s that go around it, all the playground equipment over there has been updated and the basketball court. So we're looking forward to that being completed . I think it's also important to note that while sometimes it seems like we're complicit or we don't respond . Any time that personnel issues are mentioned , it's important to note that that doesn't mean that things aren't happening or things aren't being looked into. Typically we don't comment on personnel issues. But it doesn't mean that things aren't happening in reference to those issues. So I think that's important to note. Also, just I got some responses on some question s that I had asked last week. The audit, the city is currently providing the requested document s, the CLA. The CLA will perform the preliminary testing not in April followed by field work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 this summer. The target for completion of the 2023 audit is August 31st, 2024. Also, a request for a resident , the city -- if we could review and address deteriorating condition s and graffiti on the lookout on 307. And I believe that was Marie Schumacher . The response I got was the Parks Department has been and will continue cleaning the lookout almost daily for the trash and debris left there. This is a daily concern of the department . They are also planning to clean up below the lookout once the weather breaks to trim vegetation and clear large amount of dumped garbage . That area is currently difficult to access. So clearing a safe path for year round cleaning and upkeep will be one of their tasks. They are also going to address the graffiti, with the use of pressure washing and graffiti remover. Age is also a factor in the removal of different graffiti markings . The longer it's been there, the more difficult it is to remove. And finally , they plan to begin mortaring and replacing the rocks that have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 been dislodge d and damaged. And that's all I have at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. I was able to attend the zoning board -- the last zoning board meeting and I had some observations that I witnessed while I was there. A lot of the applications that they are getting on the zoning board seem to be subpar or not complet ed. I don't know why the city zoning officer is accepting these. Another thing that was mention ed at the meeting was that neighbors when a variance or some kind of issue occurs, the neighbors are informed about it. From the meeting it was neighbors within 200 feet. The city zoning officer did state that he sent out letters to homes and resident s that were affected within 200 feet, yet none of the residents received any of these letters . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could just ask them to contact the zoning officer and see how many letters went out and what is the usual process 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 when a variance that affects the neighborhood is occurring that the neighbor s could speak their mind at a zoning board meeting . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get those specifics . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. We have a garbage update for Easter. The DPW will be picking up trash and recyclables on Good Friday, March 30th. The DPW is working Good Friday. But they do have Easter Monday, the first off. So they will be picking up garbage on Friday although the date is wrong, but they do have Easter Monday off. So there's going to be no trash pickup on Monday the first. But they will be picking up on Friday. We did have a resident ask about the Engine 15 building on Ash Street. So to give an update, we asked if there are plans to advertise and possibly sell Engine 15 on Ash Street. And the administration responded there's been no new progress on plans for the Engine 15 building on Ash Street since they last spoke about it on March 4th. The animal control officers are utilizing the former Ash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 Street fire station at this time while space at the Serrenti Center is being completed . We've gotten an appraisal for the Ash Street property and will continue to take steps towards a possible sale. So they got an appraisal and they might be looking at a sale. But that's as far as we know at this point in time. One last thing, Mr. Voldenberg . I think I know the answer. We asked for a caucus on the Serrenti Center to get some updates. Did we ever get a date on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : We don't have a date as yet, but they did agree to come in and speak. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a few. So I got some responses to inquiries that -- and requests for information over the past couple of weeks. So the ANZ Hotel property on 300 Meadow Avenue has been having a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 suspicious behavior reported to me by residents -- concerned residents and valid concerns . So in addition to all the inspection s that I was asked about, because there was a change of hands of ownership . So there was a health inspection complete d. I could report that out. There was a fire inspection complet ed and passed. I could report that out. In addition to that but, you know, the main concern was the suspicious behavior and how this falls into the nuisance ordinance . That wasn't clearly explained to -- I didn't get a clear answer on that. So what I did get was, the 300 block of Meadow Avenue is a highly travelled thoroughfare due to its proximity to 81. We understand that and that's why there's -- it's easy on, easy off for all of these actors -- bad actors that are having problems there that we want to take care of. Through a combination of proactive police patrols of properties in the vicinity and responses to service calls, the Scranton Police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 Department has reported 87 incidents at 300 Meadow Avenue from January 2nd of 2023 until March 16th of 2024, this month, an average of less than six incident s per month. Of those incidents and during the same timeframe , the SPD has investigate d 30 cases that have ultimately led to 19 arrests. So thank you to our brave police department and their great work. But my question still remains , Mr. Voldenberg . So could you please inquire again, how does this property with the amount of calls, with the amount of arrests , how does this fall in with the nuisance ordinance where, you know, I know there's criteria that has to be met and to see what else can be done with this facility in regards to that. So please check on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : On behalf of the resident s. And again, thank you, Scranton 's finest, for taking care of that one. So last week Mr. Voldenberg I expressed concern s brought to me by residents of that big hole at the top of West Side hill. Has it been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 determin ed whose hole it is? Is it the water company ? Is it the city's? Is it the owners? But it's a huge safety issue. So I don't think we got a response yet. Did you -- MR. VOLDENBERG : We did not. MR. MCANDREW : Can you please follow up with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So in addition to that nuisance property since I'm talking about nuisance property and potentially nuisance property , there is a property on 125-127 South Francis Cabrini Avenue I've been bringing up for years. And I know that every time -- we've gotten two responses recently that code enforcement and the police department are looking at this. But as we're sitting here tonight , I get a picture sent to me that the police are there again as we speak. And I forgot to tell you the other day I got a couple pictures or texts at this same property there's kids running around with a machete . So this is definitely a nuisance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 property . I think it's getting worse than better. Also, can we please ask for an update? I know there might be an investigation , that's fine. But, you know, they don't need to disclose that to us but just an update because , you know, the concern ed resident s are really getting scared over there with a machete running around. I know I would be. Street signs, okay, so we get a $300,000 grant. That's great. What does a $300,000 grant cover? How many signs? I know since we're subbing it out, can we get a breakdown on what $300,000 buys us for this year? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Is it a 100 signs? Is it a hundred streets ? I don't know. So I think we'd all like to know what that equates to because last year's grant wasn't enough. We definitely know that. So let's see here. Mr. Mancini brought up paving. I'm going to bring it up too. So Mr. Derek Raines who comes here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 all the time, lovely gentleman who is disable d and struggles on his street for years -- not four, for many years issues with his street not being paved and issues at the corner, issues in front of his where he can't even get a van in there to pick him up to go to therapy because of the situation of the road. Last year it was suppose d to be paved. And all of a sudden it was off the list which is horrible . So but in recent communications I've seen that something might happen. So Mr. Raines reached out to me again today and I want to reach out to you, Mr. Voldenberg , because I know there's been some communication . I know that the water company who is responsible for paving it said, okay, it's on for 2025. Wait a second. Now maybe we could find some funding and get it done this spring. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MR. MCANDREW : I don't want to give this guy false hope. We do it every year. And it's not fair to him. But the last -- has any other correspondence been had since that e-mail from a couple weeks ago?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 MR. VOLDENBERG : No correspondence , but the Mayor has spoken also directly with Mr. Ozalenski {phonetic }, the senior superintendant for the water company . And she stressed the importance of the project . And he's going to get back to all of us. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So as soon as he gets back to you, me, whoever , if it's you first, can you please relay this to Mr. Raines? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. The canine unit, okay, as Chairman of Public Safety, I agree with Mr. Mancini and Mr. King. I know we have two canines. I witness once, maybe twice a week at the Career Technology Center. It's a wonderful resource. This dog is fantastic . He has a skill set. But I know there's different dogs with different skill sets or training . So I too agree that we -- that we -- you know, send a message to the Mayor, inquire that they could explore , see what it takes to add three more canines to help protect not only the community but our very brave police officers . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 Let me see. Is that it? I hope that's it. Let's see. I don't want to miss anything . I think that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Last week the unit block of South Webster Avenue formally Jacobson Hat warehouse , I believe it was turned into a residential supply company . The zoning board has been there and the police department have been there and it is currently under investigation . And I believe they closed it on Monday. The 600 block of Donnelly Court, code enforcement notified of the garbage and the trash there; 614 Willow Street, again trash, appliance s, garbage . They were issued a citation March 13th. And they will follow up again this week. Cedar Avenue and Hickory Street, we submitted a request to Scranton Police Department for review and replacement of a security camera on the southeast pole of the intersection .

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 14, 2024 – CONVERTING A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE 600 BLOCK OF DEACON STREET FROM A ONE-WAY STREET TO A TWO-WAY STREET FROM 625/628 DEACON STREET TO ITS INTERSECTION WITH SANDERSON AVENUE. MR. SMURL: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. KING: Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , I'd like to propose that we table 7-A because we have put in a question to have a study done. We had at least four or five citizen s here last week requesting that a four-way stop sign be put in there. There's presently two stop signs. So I don't think anyone is against the legislation . But what we're hoping is that this traffic study would indicate that possibly four stop signs will be put in at the corner of Sanderson and Deacon. So I would like to table this until that study is done so we could determine whether or not, you know, they are going to require or they're going to recommend four stop signs. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SMURL: All right. We have a motion and second to table Item 7-A. All in favor -- on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I agree. We listened to the resident s. Their needs are few. There's already going to be two stop signs. I think adding two more will provide just more safety. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 So I agree to table this until we get the information and the findings from the study being done. MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, also on the question , I think we're all in agreement with this. I think getting that traffic study back would have all of our ducks in a row before we make the decision to move it to a two way. Everything will be put in place before we moved in that direction in terms of public safety. So I'm in agreement as well to table. MR. SMURL: Thank you. All those in favor to table Item 7-A signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? MR. KING: I think that we need to do roll call vote in Seventh Order. Maybe I'm incorrect . MR. SMURL: We'll do a roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 MR. SCHUSTER : This is a vote to table, correct ? MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Yes to table. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. So Item 7-A is tabled. MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-B.
