AGENDA FOR THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS MEETING TO BE HELD SEPTEMBER 11, 2019. MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I have a couple. This Wednesday , September 11th marks the 18th anniversary of the terrorist attacks against our country . It's a day now known officially as Patriots Day, a national day of service and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 remembrance which commemorates the catastrophic events of September 11th, 2001. Thousands have died in those attacks on our nation. And it's a day to honor their lives, their courage and their memories . It is a day of remembrance . So this Wednesday as we remember that day, let us perform an act of service , an act of kindness as a way to honor those we lost, a way to claim that spirit of unity that followed 911. Also the City of Scranton is preparing their five-year consolidated plan -- Annual Action Plan and its analysis and impediments to fair housing choice. The City needs to develop a five-year plan and how its Community Development Block Grants, Home Grants, Emergency Service Grants. The CDBG Program is intended to support local activities that benefit low and moderate income individuals and households . As part of that planning process , the City is conducting a survey to identify resident 's needs in the community and ideas on City residents would like to see funds used 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 under CDBG. Please take a few minutes to complete the survey which could be found at the top of the City's website Scranton PA dot gov. And that's all I have tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I have one statement and one announcement . I just want to say that my prayers go out to Mr. Ungvarski's family. I was so sad to see his passing in the paper this weekend . Mr. Ungvarsky was somebody who since I've been on Council has come to these meeting s faithfully. He had health issues that never deterred him. He was the type of person that would always, you know, talk to you after the meeting even if he disagreed with you. And I appreciate his dedication . I appreciate the fact that he performed his civic duties exceptionally well. So God bless him and God bless his family. I also would like to read very briefly just a note on a benefit that's being held for my two uncles. The benefit is called Together For The Trentlys . This is a benefit supporting John and Billy Trently. Friends and family have planned a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 benefit for John and Billy Trently . Both brothers were diagnose d with cancer within two weeks of each other. John has advanced prostate cancer and Billy has multiple myeloma . Together along with their families , they are facing this battle. The benefit will be held September 21st from 4 to 8 p.m. at St. Mary's Center in Scranton to help defray the cost of treatments and travel expense s to Sloan Kettering Hospital in New York City. Tickets are $20 and available at the door. There will be basket raffles , basket of cheer, 50-50, entertainment , food, wine and beer. Please come out to support two wonderful men and their battle with cancer. Thank you. ATTY. DEMPSEY : I as well have some announcements . Good evening everyone and thank you for coming. Number one, St. Joseph's Center in Scranton , an institution that just does an amazing job with taking care of individual s with special needs is having a chicken dinner on September 22nd from 12 to 4. Tickets are $10. This year they're actually having the barbecue chicken out in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 their lot so you can get it hot and fresh. It's on September 24th of 2019. So you have plenty of time to get your tickets . But it must be advanced tickets . St. Joe's is also the cause that I believe the Scranton Marathon is run for. Also, I was advised by the Scranton Recreational Committee Mr. Gattens contacted me. They are selling wreaths for Nay Aug Park to add to the additional decorations that they have. They're $50 each. You could purchase them individually , for your business , or in memoriam . You decorate them yourself . And then they will be hung on a light pole which is really going to add to the festivities up at Nay Aug. So I think that's a great idea. Mr. Gattens would be the contact on that. And I actually found it on Facebook . I would briefly also like to say that St. Paul's Church out in Scranton it's on Penn Avenue is having their block party as well. It's actually this weekend on Friday, Saturday , and Sunday. That being my home parish, I could attribute to the fact it's a wonderful evening . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 There's bands on Friday and Saturday . And they also put out flat screen TVs so if there is anybody who likes the football games, you could sit there and watch your football games. And I do believe there's a beer tent as well. Saturday afternoon from 2 to 4 they also have the -- it's a 3 on 3. It's named in honor of Meg Cullen Brown a long-time parishioner and former chair of that block party. Although it's a 3 on 3, you could have up to five people on a team. It's $20 per person. You do receive a T-shirt. Prizes will be given. And it's for grades one to eight. So I also would ask you to check Facebook for that under St. Paul's Block Party. But Michael Scoff is also running the basketball part of it. So that's going to be a fun night as well. And very briefly , well, it doesn't touch on Scranton or Lackawanna County, I think we would remiss if we didn't send out our thoughts and intention s to the people of the Bahamas . Anyone who's had the opportunity to travel there knows what warm and loving people they are. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 And the devastation and destruction that they've seen in the last week is really horrifying . I think the death toll is up to 44 people. So I would just like to send our thoughts and intentions to them at this time as well. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . The following speakers offered public comment on City Business and/or matters of general concern : Joan Hodowanitz Robert Bolus Less Spindler Ron Ellman Norma Jefferies Marie Schumacher Joanne Williams Dave Dobrzyn MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I'd like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 first start off by welcoming Council woman Dempsey on her first official Council meeting . She's hit the ground running over the last month. And she'll be a tremendous asset to this Council through the remainder of this year. I would also like to thank Mayor Evans and his administration for their increase d communication with Council since Mayor Evans was appointed . I had the opportunity to represent Council along with Councilwoman Dempsey on the Mayors Leadership Council which is focused on coming up with solution s that could be achieved before the end of the year. Included in those discussion s was something I've been pushing for which is a guide to opening a business in Scranton that includes a checklist of what needs to be done through the City to get necessary permits and inspections that are require d to give potential business owners guidance on what they need to do first, second, third. The administration is also working on simplifying the process for popup vendors to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 obtain a peddler 's license in preparation of the upcoming holiday season. I'd also like to congratulate the owners of Lafayette Street Deli on Lafayette Street in West Side. I was at their grand opening this past Friday. Sergio and his family did a wonderful job with both the exterior and interior of the building . He also unveiled a memorial plaque that will be permanently displayed inside the building honoring Officer John Wilding . I would just also like to thank Sergio for investing in the community . I wish him best in this endeavor . And I encourage everyone to stop in and check it out for themselves . Just a couple replies to what was brought up during Citizens Comment . On the payroll prep tax, we're looking to have a public caucus with the School Board, the Pennsylvania Economy League to discuss how we're going to move forward with that. Miss Jefferies , on the SeeClickFix , I did talk to Mayor Evans at the end of last week. And he is looking into ways to implementing that before the end of the year at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 least on, you know, on a department by department basis. And also on the census, the City will be holding -- we're going to hold a workshop in the first or second week of October . As soon as I get that date locked down, I'll let you know. And, Mr. Dobrzyn , talking about the space of, you know, heavily travelled with LIPS upstairs. A space study on how we use our space will be a part of any renovations we do moving forward . A couple requests I have for LIPS, 619 Crown Avenue, the structure of the house is pretty rundown. And there's been zero upkeep on the property . I also received complaints from the neighborhood in that area that they see and/or hear animals such as squirrels inside the house. Also, 331 North Bromley Avenue, I received complaint s from neighbors about the condition of this property also. According to the neighbors , the structure is occupied . But they could see squirrels coming out of the holes in the roof 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 on a daily basis. A couple of stop sign requests for DPW. There's a stop sign on the corner of Breck and Pittston Avenue. It's sort of just tilting away from incoming traffic . I believe one of the bolts tying the holes together just popped off which is what led to the tilt in the stop sign. So, Miss Reed, if we can pass that along to DPW. And also, neighbors on North Grant Avenue wanted to request a four-way stop sign at the corner of Price Street and North Grant Avenue. I was told the intersection recently went from a two-way stop to a three-way stop after a car hit a child on a bike at the intersection . That has helped alleviate the speeding going north on Grant Avenue but there's still a problem with speeding cars going south on Grant Avenue, which is -- a four-way stop would help alleviate . And lastly, I just want to briefly touch on Northeast Revenue Services . It is completely unacceptable that the company that was revealed in a federal indictment to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 engaged in pay to play scheme with the former Mayor and two months later is still doing business in the City through the City Treasurer 's Office. This conduct cannot be tolerated any longer, especially since this is not the first time that this particular company has been named in a federal indictment . This wasn't a one time lapse in judgment . Paying to play is the way this company does business . Therefore , I would like to make a motion that Council send a letter to the administration requesting that they terminate the contract with Northeast Revenue immediately and enter into an intergovernment al cooperation agreement with the County Tax Claim Bureau for the collection of delinquent tax and refuse collection services as soon as possible . The former head of the Tax Claim Bureau Ron Koldjeski pitched this idea to Council four years ago. Now is the time for action, especially if we're going to begin to restore trust in City government . MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? On the question ? I would just -- I would just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 like to remind Councilman Donahue of the rules of presenting motions prior to -- in public at our caucus. I'm in agreement with the sentiment of the motion. So I will vote yes. I know we all received the confidential memo that we're not able to discuss freely regarding this issue. But there are plans in motion on the administrative side to move in this direction . Obviously , we are under a contract . So there are issues with unintended consequences with pulling out on no notice. I am in full agreement with the spirit of the motion. So I will support it. But it's not something that can be done on a moment's notice. It is something that has to be done in a planned out manner specifically regarding there's a lot of data that Northeast Revenue has. And it's very critical that we retain that data for back bills that are owed, specifical ly on garbage fees which has been a big issue before any of this other business came. So I am in agreement with the spirit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 of the amendment . But I do not think it's something that could be done immediately . I know that the Mayor -- MR. DONAHUE : I could change that to as soon as possible . I'm fine with that. MR. ROGAN: Yeah, I think that would make it a lot more -- a lot more -- I can't even think of the word. MR. DONAHUE : I'm fine with that. MR. ROGAN: That would make it much more palatable for me. Anyone else on the question ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yeah, I spoke before the meeting I am in complete agreement with that. I do believe that the actions of the contracting service that we're with do constitute malfeasance under the terms of the contract . I also -- this may or may not be the time. But since I'm new, I'm going to give it a shot and they could tell me if it's not. In the event they are not let go as soon as possible , I also have pitched to Mayor Evans what I consider to be a somewhat aggressive plan to collect delinquencies . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 I'd like to file suit against them to be quite frank with you. I'd like to file -- set a financial threshold and anybody -- especially these people who earn six figures who have repetitively disregard ed this fee that the rest of us have religiously paid and let them go to court. Let them get a lawyer. Let them pay a lawyer. Let them defend themselves . And let the judge or jury make a decision on that. The smaller amount thresholds could be taken to a district justice . Something has to be done. A lien on their properties is just not sufficient anymore in my eyes. And I do concur with this. And I do understand Mr. Rogan's concerns . This is not something that can be done on a moment's notice. There are a lot of moving parts. And there are a lot of logistics associated with it. But like we said, I think we all agree with the intent behind it. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I also agree with Mr. Rogan. I think there are a lot of details here that need to be flushed out first. You can't just terminate a contract 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 without a plan to move forward . I do know that there are conversations taking place with the Mayor and the administration on how to move forward . I would like more details on that so that we understand what the City's going to do with the county, what that looks like. Again, I think we do need more details. I would agree with Mr. Donahue in the fact that any company who engages in pay to play, whether they are charged with any wrongdoing or not in my opinion should not be doing business with the City of Scranton . The days of pay to play politics in the City hopefully are over. We need to do everything in our power as a Council and as a body who has oversight of the administration as a check and a balance on the strong-mayor form of government that we have to make sure that pay to play politics ends. People are tired of it. We're tired of it. Everybody is just tired of it. It's gone on for far too long and it needs to end. So I do think that we need more details on this as I said. But I do agree with the spirit of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Councilman Donahue 's motion. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : No motions but I do have a few comments if people would bear with me. It's been three weeks since I've been sworn in. And a lot has happened during that time. And I would just like to give a brief summary of some of that. And then once we get back on a weekly schedule , I don't think I will be as longwinded. I would like to say that Crowley Park out at the very end of North Washington Avenue near Marywood has -- the renovations are finally coming to a conclusion . If anyone's familiar with that park, we've been without it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 for at least two years. It may even be three or four to be quite frank with you. But what I will say is, I was there on Saturday for a cleanup. And it really looks amazing . I want to commend and thank any of the architects , the contractors , the City for finalizing that. I also want to thank the Board of the Lackawanna River Conservation Association . One of the gentleman who is the president of the board -- I believe it was Dave, but his name escapes me, was up there that day. And it's beautiful . In the back they have a little pond with an echo system where the kids could learn. It's really, really nice. There's two basketball courts, a huge playground and that gentleman also told me that Becky McMullin from the City was very assistive and instrumental in helping that take place. So I wanted to note that. Like I said, I was at a lot of meetings. And one of the ones that I thought was very interest ing and important and I just kind of happened upon it was a meeting of the Lackawanna Regional Planning Commission . And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 believe it was open to the public. And they were going to have 12 meeting s throughout the county. This was the Scranton one. We were in the Governor 's room next door. But people don't realize -- and I will admit to you I didn't realize either this is the basis for all of our zoning regulations going forward and our city planning . And these gentlemen and women really have a jargon of their own. But I started to pick up on it a little bit. Mr. Don King was there on behalf of the City as was Mr. John Pocius. And they really were very eloquent on the topic. But if anybody follows the zoning hearings, you'll also know that they really tackled a lot of difficult issues in the last two to four years here. We've had issues with Airbnbs, bed and breakfast . I think there was just something about billboards , adult bookshops, the project out at North Washington Avenue that people are talking about. So it's very interest ing to attend one of them. I would encourage attendance because it's one of the times you have a chance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 to say or make a change before the rule or regulation of law goes into place. Kyle, you spoke about the Mayor's Leadership Council . That was very informative . It was an amazing group of people who were 100 percent dedicated to the City. And it's interesting because one of Mayor Evans' -- Wayne's goals is what can we get done in five months. And I really admire him for that and he's really trying to fast track a lot of items and a lot of good ideas came out of that. We also gave credit that day to the bicycle race that we had here, the Electric City Classic I think it was called. It really brought a lot of energy to the City. And if anyone was down there, there was people. There were families . And one of the gentlemen who was at our meetings said he expected attendance to at least double if not triple last year based on the response he got. Another interesting thing I liked about that is they did not bring in food trucks. He basically said they wanted to let the brick and mortar business of Downtown 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Scranton take the -- you know, take the economical -- economical hit for that and be able to gain customer s and be able to make money on a Saturday . So I was pleased with that. One of the main things besides the garbage delinquencies which really drives me crazy that I really wanted to focus on on the five months that I'm here are the neighborhoods . And I was invited to the South Side neighbors , which is currently under the leadership of Tom Pattison [sic] and Cathy Mazdin. And they really had a lovely group of people the day I went over. It was about 20 to 24 people. Chief Graziano was there. Kyle, you were there as well. I think one or two cops came in. But what I'm starting to learn as I go around the city and speak to more people is, no what matter neighborhood you live in, we really share all the same problem s. We're concerned about crime. We're concerned about blight. We're concerned about condemnations . We're concerned about safety. And that is a lot of what we talked about over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 there. We -- Kyle, you sent a list of properties up to Licensing and Inspection . Chief Graziano was more than receptive to the complaints that were made there. They knew that there were a couple houses that they felt drugs were being sold out of. He put that on the top of the list. So basically I would like to make sure that I get to speak to each of the neighborhoods . I've been kindly invited to the Hill Neighborhood Association by their president Tim Swartz. I will attend that meeting on September 25th. And, you know, just to see again in this five month tenure, what can we do, what can we accomplish . And again, if anybody is listening or watching who wants to contact me, please do so. And one final thing regarding neighborhood associations . At the last Green Ridge Neighborhood Association meeting , Mr. Foley offered to sponsor a meeting of all the neighborhood leaders , kind of like a state of the union for neighborhoods , which I think is a magnificent idea. I'm going to try to work on some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 the logistics of that. I got the names and e-mails and phone numbers of many of the neighborhood leaders. Then they could report back to us almost like I'll call it a triage of what are the main problems facing the neighborhoods and what can we on Council do to address them. Someone asked in Third Order I believe when I took over Mayor Evans' seat did I also take over Chair of the Finance Committee . And, yes, I did. Kyle and I attended a recent PEL meeting or one today was cancelled . But they updated us on the Act 47 recovery efforts . And they went over some final actions that were required for compliance . As you all probably know maybe from reading the paper, Council also asked for that gas card audit to be conducted . We have not received the results of that yet. But we are sending a second letter as a followup to see when we can expect that information . And we've already received , I believe , a preliminary of our budget which is about one to two inches thick. So, of course, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 over the course of the next couple months we'll be looking at that. I think I already talked about the garbage delinquencies . I don't need to go too much further into that except to say that I really feel strongly that an aggressive approach is necessary here. I don't like the people who have continuously disregarded this garbage fee and have gotten their amounts up into the 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, $120,000 level to me is unacceptable . I reviewed and studied the Code of Ethics in detail. And I am thrilled that this board will be up and running . I think we're going to be making some appointments tonight. And I've looked at them. And I know they're going to be good people. To me, this is another concrete step towards accountability in municipal government at all levels. I did make the recommendation when I was speaking with the Mayor I do believe one further step in addition to having the Code of Ethics and in addition to having the board, I would really like all City employees including the five of us sitting up here, solicitors , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 board members , and regular employees to sign that document and to certify that they have read it and that they understand that they are bound by it. Because what I do not want to see at a later date and what I have encounter ed in private practice is someone saying we're not aware a policy existed or they were not aware of what a policy said. So again, I know this is one step forward . I recommend -- I mean, I commend the board members who are accepting these important appointment s. It's certainly important for the City and I know it's going to bring back integrity , credibility , and accountability . One final thing -- and I'm taking you back three weeks now, but on August 17th of 2019, some of you may remember this, a very, very bad storm -- I sound like President Trump, very, very -- blasted through the City. It mainly affected the Pine Brook section of the City, the Plot and the Green Ridge section . I was not there that Saturday . And I was looking at Facebook photos, which quite frankly , did not even begin to do it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 justice because I came home that Sunday to make sure I was there to look around. When I looked around, I realized that we were in dire need of help. There was already people on the scene, fire, police, and DPW. We had a woman entrapped in her home on the third or second floor with her dog. We had a group home that was serving adults that actually has been condemned now due to the severity of the property damage it took during the storm. What I want everyone here to know is, I did not know Wayne Evans before that day. And at 9 a.m. on Sunday, I thought I need to call him because what I'm seeing here I want him to know more about. And the rest of the day he and I were back and forth via phone call and via text. And when I told him what needed assistance, he responded . He listened . And he cared. And he was responsive . And I want people to know that. We had major thoroughfare s that were closed, Wyoming and North Washington Avenue. He also signed an emergency declaration for us which allowed us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 to get third party contractors up there to clean up the streets because quite frankly , our personnel just could not do it in enough of a timely basis. My final point on that matter is as I was walking around that Sunday, most of all I saw DPW workers. I did see some police and firemen . And I spoke to them. And the one gentleman said he'd been there since six that morning and he planned to work until about 10:30 that night. I actually went and wrote a letter of commendation . You know, the system worked on that date. And I know we all have valid issues that we come up to the podium with. But on that date, the fire respond ed. The police responded . DPW responded . Our Parks and Recreation responded . And when I walked around to neighbors , without fail each one of them were grateful . And whether they had damage to their roof, to their deck, to their car or to the streets , each one saw that there was help being sent and each one was glad that nobody was hurt.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 And I'm going to conclude by thanking a few people. I would be disingenuous if I said there was not a learning curve in this position and there was. But I've done my best to encounter it and to overcome it. I want to thank the employees of the City Council office, Jamie, Kathy and Lori, especially you. I really don't know what I would have done. You have been extremely , extremely helpful to me during this transition . To the gentlemen to my right, I want to thank each and every one of you for warmly welcoming me to this board. You answered questions I had. You've helped me make the -- any questions I've had. The adjustment has been easier. And I want each one of you to know that I don't take for granted one minute the trust that you placed in me during this critical transitional time in the City. And I want you to know that I will not let anyone down and I look forward to many product ive and industrious days until January 6th of 2020. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Council man 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. I too would like to welcome Attorney Dempsey to City Council , looking forward to working with you over the next few months. Just a few things I have here. Obviously , we're going to have a lot to say tonight because we've been away now for a month. The recovery plan recommendations , I brought this up in the caucus. If you remember back in July, Council had a caucus with the Pennsylvania Economy League. And I have been asking now for quite some time for an update on all of the recommendations in the Recovery Plan, the status of those recommendation s. I was not satisfied with the response I received from the Pennsylvania Economy League. I would like a more detailed response . So I would like to direct that now to the Mayor and the administration , not only if the recommendation is in progress or underway but when they expect to complete the recommendation and how far along they are. I would like more details on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 As you all know, we are schedule d to exit Act 47 in August of next year. There are still important items on the table that need to be completed . So I want to make sure that these things are -- if they are in progress what -- where are they and when will they be complete . I had an eye-opening meeting a few weeks ago with our City Engineer John Pocius, Representative Marty Flynn and many other City and State official s about our bridges in the City. Several of our bridges have a deficient rating at this point according to PennDOT . I do have a spreadsheet if anyone's interested . I won't go through all of them. But the -- really what the culmination of the meeting was is that working with our state reps, our City official s, we're making sure that all of the bridges are included in state legislation from the house transportation committee for funding so that they could be replaced and rehabbed . There are 13 bridges total. New bridges that have been placed on this list, 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 are going -- are up for replacement -- total replacement. And two of them are going to be rehabbed. To give you an example , the Poplar Street bridge has a rating of 31.4 out of 100. There are several other bridges on there that if we had to close them it would be a major concern from a public safety perspective and from a traffic perspective . So I would ask and we did bring this up in the caucus, Mrs. Reed, if you could send a letter to Mr. Pocius who as I mention ed in the caucus is an encyclopedia worth of information on this topic if he could come in and brief us as well I think that would be very helpful because this is important . The other thing that was mentioned at this meeting is the City has to provide , I believe , a five percent match. So I know Mr. Bulzoni is working to figure out how we're going to come up with this money. I believe with all of these bridges we're looking at over a million dollars . This is a great investment because it needs to be done. Again, if we go any lower or we wait any longer and we didn't have all of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 these people working together , we would be in trouble possibly closing some of these bridges . As I also mention ed in the caucus I would like an update on the 2019 Paving Program . The bids have been opened August 19th. We still have not received any legislation yet. We have not received the paving list yet. We are now in September . It is getting late. I cannot remember in the five years I've been on Council it being this late and not voting on legislation . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could send something to the Mayor and Mr. Gallagher I would appreciate that. Mrs. Jefferies asked about the Sign Management Program . I do have that on my list or update. The last I was told in July was that the employee s of DPW are being trained on that program . And they're going to methodically work their way through the City and replace those signs that need to be replaced . The whole crux of that program was to identify the signs that need to be replaced that were in bad shape. At night they weren't reflective and you couldn't see them. To 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Mrs. Schumacher 's point, I do believe that all the signs should be uniform . So it's going to take a little while but you will eventually see that process come to fruition . Also, one of the things that I asked about months and months and months ago was the Keyser Valley Pumping Station . As part of the 2019 budget, I believe there was a million and a half dollars to upgrade and improve this pumping station . As those of you who come to the Council meeting s or watch the Council meetings know, when it rains, Keyser Valley gets slammed with flooding problems . And it was my understanding that this pumping station may have been an issue. It has not been upgraded for decades . I believe that the money was earmarked for that purpose . The last time I looked at the Controller 's audit or the Controller 's report there was still a million and a half dollars left in the budget. So, Mrs. Reed, if we can get an update on the status of that project , I would appreciate it. Also, one of the things -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 I won't harp on this for too long, but the Street Sweeping Program , we do now have a new street sweeper . I thought that it was great to see that going through the City. But as I've mentioned before there is one issue that I think needs to be address ed and I would again urge, you know, this administration to start thinking about it and the new administration whoever they may be coming in to take this project on. And I will certainly help them with that. We need alternate side of the street parking . It makes no sense. I will repeat, no sense to have street sweeper s and make an investment in new equipment and then have a street sweeper come down the street and have to zigzag between cars. I was on this issue three or four years ago and was told by the administration that it couldn't be done. It would be -- it would take too long, too confusing. Then I look at other cities. Other cities do it. We're a city of 76,000 people. There are cities of 100, 150, 200,000 that do it with no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 problem . So I do think that if we're going to have this program again next year, we need to make sure we have alternate side of the street parking so we can correctly sweep the streets. And again, this would help us with stormwater management as well. In that vain, we received the recycling report. If you remember from a few months ago we had met with Tom Lynch the recycling coordinator and Joyce Hatala who's our recycling consultant . I did ask Mrs. Reed and Council concurred in the caucus to put this report in Third Order so it will be on the agenda for next week for the citizens to view next week if they are interested . There is a few issues in this recycling report that I want to mention . This is nothing new now. This has been going on for quite a few years. The first one is that the City's ordinance requires that commercial establish ments, businesses , large apartment complex es to recycle . The report says that the ordinance require s this but the City never enforces the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 ordinance . We are leaving money on the table here in terms of grant money that we receive from DEP. We invest that grant money in a lot of different things, one of it being equipment which we are in sore need of. The Performance Grant for 2017 we received $47,361. We can get more than that. Again, we're leaving -- in my opinion we're leaving money on the table. One of the other things that continues to be a problem that I instructed Mrs. Reed with Council 's concurrence to send a letter to the Scranton Housing Authority . The Scranton Housing Authority has not recycled in many years. According to this report the recycling consultant and coordinator are making it a top priority to work with them over the next year. The PA -- the Pennsylvania DEP has stated numerous times that Housing Authority is mandated to recycle . It's in our ordinance . We are not enforcing it. So recyclable s from the Housing Authority can be included with our recyclable tonnage to increase our performance grant; again, leaving money on the table. So I hope 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 we can meet with the Housing Authority and we can correct this problem so we can continue to invest these grant dollars in our fleet. One of the things that occurred over the month of August was the abuse of a City vehicle with the fire chief taking it to the beach. One of the, you know, things that came out of that was an audit. And we're hoping to receive the audit soon. As Attorney Dempsey mentioned , we're asking for an update on that. The other idea I have which I relayed to the Business Administrator and the Mayor and they assured me they are going to look into and see what the cost of it is is equipping all City vehicles with GPS devices. At this point an audit is great. But if you go to any -- if you look at any private business , if you look at PennDOT , almost vehicle s are equipped with GPS. I think two things will occur here. We can make sure that we're more efficient . We can make sure our vehicle fleet is efficient . And we can guard against abuse of City vehicles and taxpayer dollars . One of the great things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 I think for citizens if this ends up happening is look at PennDOT . If you want to know where a plow is, you can go on their website. And it's GPS. You could see where the plow is, when it came down your street. We all get calls. And let me say that the DPW does a phenomenal job. The truck drivers do a phenomenal job. There is a lack of communication sometimes . People call. They're waiting for a plow. A plow comes down their street. They don't realize it, so on and so forth. I think this would eliminate that problem . And it makes the whole process much more transparent. So again, I would call for that and hope that the administration would, you know, let us know what they find from their research . The other thing I really want to mention , Nay Aug Park came up tonight . Bob Gattens and the Recreation Authority Board are doing a fantastic job with Nay Aug Park in my opinion . I do think that the reality of the situation up there is that Geisinger is not going anywhere . Nay Aug Park is not going anywhere . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 So there has to be some happy medium where they can coexist. I don't think we can get to a point where we're confrontational with the hospital . That never seems to work out. I do think the agreement that they came to with the lights was a good agreement . I wasn't involved in the negotiation s. But I think it worked out for both parties . For those who have complaints about Nay Aug Park, I know that this Recreation Authority Board is very transparent and very open. They have meeting s. They invite people online. They're doing the best they can to take your complaints and your requests and they are actually acting on them. So I do have to give Mr. Gattens and the rest of the Recreation Authority Board credit in that vain. And again, I would encourage anyone who has any question s to reach out to Mr. Gattens . Just a few citizens complaint s to wrap it up here. 95 Winwood Ave, Mrs. Reed, the gentleman that lives there, he's been to Council before. We received several letters and correspondence from him. Still not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 satisfied . So if we can follow up with the DPW on that. Also, 1326 Watson Street, the alley behind this gentleman 's home is caving in when it rains, major issues here. This alley behind their home or place rather is the 1300 block of Smith Place. So if we can ask for an analysis of that by the DPW. Also receive d a complaint about the 800 block of Palm Street, has not been paved in decades. It's riddled with potholes that are never patched . So if we can make a recommendation , Mrs. Reed, to the DPW to put that on a future paving list and in the interim see if we can get that block patched . Also to end on a positive note, we are going to be interviewing a potential intern. If you have been listening over the past few months, City Council has entered into a partnership with the University of Scranton to get interns from the school. And then we might open it up to all the other local college s. We're using the University as a guinea pig. So we do expect to have an intern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 in Council 's office within the next few weeks. So we'll update everyone on that. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple items. I didn't plan on speaking on this many. So many came up today. First, on the payroll prep tax came up a little bit. And it was publicized in the Scranton Times over the break. I would really like to encourage the Scranton School Directors to reconsider their decision regarding the payroll prep. For those who haven't been following it, this is in replacement of the business privilege and mercantile tax, which have been two of the most oppressive taxes to business owners in the City of Scranton for decades . We really only have one opportunity to get this replaced. And that opportunity is now. The City of Scranton loses its ability to switch from a business privilege mercantile tax to this prep tax once we leave Act 47. The school district has an opportunity to act. And I know Senator Blake has been very active in this issue. And he's been doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 a great job advocating for this switch. And the idea of putting it on the ballot is the exact same thing that the County Commissioners did when they put having a reassessment on the ballot. It's designed to fail. Because people when they see it on the ballot they're going to think it's an additional tax to them when, in fact, this tax is not paid by most residents of the City. Unless you own a business in the City and you have employees working for you, you're not impacted by it. But it does impact everyone in the grand scheme of things when we're trying to attract business es in the City. And one of the biggest impediment s has been our tax structures , specifically the payroll tax -- or specifically the business privilege and mercantile tax for the last 20 years. That's why you see so much development right outside the City limits. So I would encourage the school directors to reconsideration that decision . Again, it is revenue neutral . So it is not a situation where the City could bring in additional 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 revenue compared to what we brought in the previous year on the business privilege and mercantile tax. So it would be revenue neutral for the school district as well. I know they have concerns about it being revenue neutral because they are on such a tight financial squeeze . But the only way for them to get out of their predicament and the City to continue to improve is by growth. And it's by bringing in new business es and making Scranton more business friendly . That brings me onto my next point which is again the zoning board was brought up a couple times specifically in reference to development in Green Ridge, development on East Mountain . Without getting into the projects specifically , I do think the City overall has been putting far too many burdens and regulation s on people who want to come in and do developments . The zoning board is very important in this process . But there are also other impediment s outside of zoning, particularly the Licensing and Inspections Office, which I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Mayor Evans is committed to having that deregulated and making it a more streamline process during his short stay as Mayor. But I do think it's critical that as a whole we continue to encourage new development in the City from our zoning boards to our Licensing and Inspections Office to our tax structure , that is the only way the City is going to improve is through growth. So I'm hopeful that with this unique opportunity to strip away some regulations through zoning, through Licensing and Inspections , changing from the oppressive business privilege and mercantile tax we're finally going to be able to make Scranton a little bit more business friendly. Council did take a big step in the right direction on this and the school board as well by passing a ten year tax abatement for anyone who builds new construction in the City, whether it's a business or residential . It was a good first step. But these other items need to be addressed in order to really have our economy in the City take off. One last point, we received a letter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 in the mail from the Chinchilla Hose Company . I'm not going to read the whole letter because it is pretty lengthy . But there are some items that I do want to reference in here. I know approximately about a year ago we had representative s from Pennsylvania Ambulance and Commonwealth Ambulance come in and talk to Council about our current ambulance structure within the City of Scranton . So this letter starts off that he's -- I'm writing about an issue of concern that I have and the issue being made aware of specifically the ambulance coverage in the City of Scranton . It's been more than 30 years since the City and the fire department provided any type of BLS, which means basic life support . These are your more low level ambulance calls in the City of Scranton . In that period of time, the City has relied on a series of private companies to provide care within its boundaries . And then it goes and lists the companies . It goes onto state that they've worked with -- this entity has worked with all of these companies . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 They harbor no ill feelings towards them. They provide professional and good patient care. I do not believe that you, the City of Scranton are getting the prehospital EMS coverage that you think you are for your residents in terms of vehicle availability and personnel coverage since the Lackawanna County 911 Center routinely dispatch ed ambulance from outlying communities into the City of Scranton to cover 911 requests when there are no vehicles from these two companies available . I could provide multiple example s of times when outlying area ambulances have respond ed into the City to handle EMS calls. One recent request for an ambulance resulted in outlaying ambulance company being requested along with an ALS unit, which is advanced life support for a more serious issue from the Cottage Hose Company which is the group that he works with based in Carbondale . While the outcome was favorable for this patient , it may not be for the next one. This is also not an isolated incident . It has happened in the past and I'm sure it will happen again in the very near future based on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 way that the system is working . There have been times when ALS units from Luzerne County have been request ed along with outlining ambulance companies to respond to calls in the City of Scranton when no ALS units were available . When a local city based vehicle from one of these companies becomes available , the Luzerne County units have been cancelled . There may have been times when they had to come into the City as they were the only available unit. The letter goes on -- again, I'm not going to read the entire letter. But it closes with, again, I have no intent in disparaging either Commonwealth Health EMS or Pennsylvania Ambulance or the services they are providing . I believe that the request slash demand for services will only increase as time passes. I will urge to be proactive in looking to address this issue as opposed to being reactive and putting into place a poorly planned and executed response after an unfortunate incident . And it says feel free to contact me if you have any questions , Chinchilla Hose 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Company of South Abington Township , EMS. I do know that Mayor Evans was copied on this. But if everyone is in agreement , I do think that this is something we should take another look at. I know Council looked at it about a year or so ago. It was sent to Mayor Courtright at the time and the issue kind of died on the vine. But I do think that this is something that we need to look at. Whether it's selecting one of these two companies to be primary for the City of Scranton or whether the best option is to keep the current system in place, which it appears from this letter is opening us up to some serious response time issues. So if everyone is in agreement , I do think we should continue to look into this, ask Mayor Evans for what his opinion would be if any action is going to be taken. I do know that the fire chief was copied on this as well. I do think it's important to include our police and fire department s in any communications . This is a very important issue. Again, the City does not run an ambulance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 service and the letter states we haven't in 30 years. I'm not advocating that we begin to do that again. But I do think we do need to take a very close look into what's going on with ambulance response times in the City. MR. GAUGHAN : I just want to make one comment on that. I actually do remember when this was an issue I think two years ago now. And my concern at that time was that -- and again, I don't mind revisiting it and looking at the facts and the figures . But I believe that we had Pennsylvania Ambulance in a caucus and then Commonwealth in a caucus. Pennsylvania Ambulance wanted if I'm not mistaken to be designated the sole provider . The issue I had there then and I still, you know, believe now is that it's better to have competition to have two companies . So I don't mind looking at it further and asking the Mayor to weigh in as well if this is an issue. But I remember thinking back on it my concern then was to designate one company you're taking out the competition and you're making them, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 the only show in town. So that was my concern . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: And I'm not advocating for that either. I just think it's something that needs to be looked at whether it's -- and I don't know if it's possible to have an agreement with both firms to have at least one ambulance in the City of Scranton at all times. But something certainly needs to be done about this situation . That's all. MS. REED: 5-B.

I am fully supportive of this grant. Again, I think -- and I say this all the time when we get grants from the police department , but the Chief of Police Carl Graziano and the police department and Maggie Perry as the grant writer there has done a phenomenal job over the last few years in identifying these grants and then being aggressive and really going for them. I hope that we do get this grant. I think that another automated license plate reader is a tool that the police department can definitely use and as is explained in this legislation , it made quite a difference in the after hours nightclub shooting in North Scranton a few months ago.

But if you look through 5-I to 5-P, which is the appointment s to the Library Authority Board, someone questioned why there are non City resident s being appointed . There is a reason for that. Non City resident s are appointed because the Scranton Public Libraries are actually part of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 the Lackawanna County Library System.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF ANNETTE PALUTIS , 703 NORTH REBECCA AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18504 AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF ETHICS FOR A ONE (1) YEAR TERM, EFFECTIVE AUGUST 29, 2019. HER TERM WILL EXPIRE ON AUGUST 31, 2020. MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-S be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I just want to take a minute to thank all of the people who are being appoint ed to the Ethics Board for their service of this board. If you remember back two years ago I had asked the previous Mayor why no one was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 being appoint ed to the Ethics Board, never got a response . It was clear that the Ethics Board and ethics was not a priority . The City was not taking it serious . The board was basically defunct. So this Council had taken it upon themselves to restore the board to basically rewrite the Code of Ethics using the City of Reading and the spirit of their law which I looked at very closely along with Solicitor Minora. I think that these appointments are the first step in restoring trust, restoring confidence in City government . Appointing these people to the board, the board taking their seat, it's not going to be enough to certainly restore confidence in the City and credibility . This is going to take time. And it's going to take an awful lot of work. But it has to be done. I could tell you that it has been very difficult to be an elected official over the last few months since all of this news has broke. At one time being a public servant and being an elected official was a revered position which command ed respect 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 from people. At this point the reality of it is that you're either the butt of a joke, people think you're corrupt just because you're in politic s and you're basically wearing a scarlet letter. And I'm fine with that. But it really, really upsets me because as I mentioned before we went on the August recess I had never and with all the things going on, I have never been more confident in this City, never in five years being on Council because I think that there is hope here. I think despite some of the things that go on, despite some of the negativity which is warranted , there are a lot of positive things. This Ethics Board is the first step in the right direction . And I think that we can restore trust. We can restore confidence . We can restore credibility . So I want again thank every single person who is being appoint ed to this board. I wish them well. And I thank them for their service . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 MR.
