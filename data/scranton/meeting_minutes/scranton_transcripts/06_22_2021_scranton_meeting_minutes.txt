MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed away recently in our community recently especially Bill Walsh of Minooka . He passed away Sunday, June 14th. Mr. Walsh was a Scranton Police Officer who retired as a detective after 35 years of service . And let's also remember all those suffering due to the pandemic .

Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have two comment s. So it was brought to our attention 3-B, the Single Tax Office financial 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 statements , there may be pages missing . It jumped from page two to page four and then to page eight. So Mr. Voldenberg is going to check that out before next week. And if there are any additional pages missing we'll include that in Third Order in full. The other question that was brought up during the caucus was in regard to the Controller 's report. There was a significant expenditure in the amount of 9 million dollars and Council would like an explanation on that and what that was -- what that was for before next week. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one quick one. PennDOT will be holding online public meeting s on the West Lackawanna Avenue bridge and Elm Street bridge replacement project s on June 30th. The Elm Street bridge meeting will take place at 5 p.m. And the West Lackawanna Avenue bridge meeting will take place at 7 p.m. The public can register for these meetings by contacting Michael Grantnor {sic} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 project manager for both project s by calling 215-913-5998. The public can also submit comment on each project until July 16th by contacting PennDOT 's project manager Summer Koziel at SKOZIEL@pa.gov by calling 570-963-4048. The plans for each project can also be found at the bottom of the DPW page on the City's website . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have one. Last week I believe I failed to mention over the weekend there was a celebration held for Juneteenth on Saturday which has now also been federally recognized as a holiday thanks to President Biden. And the celebration I think was a success despite the weather that day. But it was also to celebrate the soon to be opening of the new center for the Black Scranton Project . It's also going to be an art center. And that's located in North Scranton on Main Avenue and West Market. So that was an exciting day. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 just wanted to congratulate Black Scranton and the success of their project . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : The first speaker for tonight 's meeting is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . First order -- first thing is old business . And if you would respond during Fifth Order I would appreciate it. The first thing you and I talked about the status of Leach Creek and the undersized pipe. And I've gotten the folder from the City Clerk which will take some time to review. But if you could in Fifth Order just let the general public know what's happening with that situation . Next, has there been any progress in the City's ongoing dispute with the County Tax Claim Bureau? Have the City and county representatives met to discuss a new agreement to reduce the 10 percent charge that the local taxpayers are paying for legal fees. If you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 could give us a status on that if you know if there's been any progress or any communication with the county. I don't think it's fair for taxpayers who may have lost their jobs to be hit with that kind of a legal fee. Next, what is the monetary value of Robert Saul's gift of the furniture for the Mayor's office and has the gift been reviewed by the City's Ethics Board? I do think that would fall under the provisions of the Ethics Code. Next, when will the current Collective Bargaining Agreements for the Single Tax Office and the firefighter s' union be posted on the City's website ? About a year ago I personally asked Mayor Cognetti to post all the union Collective Bargaining Agreements on the website . And she did that mostly. Firefighters union only had an MOU. But since then, the firefighters ' MOU has completely dissolved . It's been deleted . And the Single Tax Office, their document has been deleted. And I think since the taxpayers pick up the bill for the salaries and wages and benefits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 for 90 percent of the City's employees , they should be on the website for their review. And next, will future Collective Bargaining Agreements with the City's unions be reconcile d with the City's Ethics Code? I don't understand the logic of having an Ethics Code. And it does not apply to the vast majority of City employees . Now, under new business , first, yes, you and I did talk about the fact that the Single Tax Office's financial statements were missing several pages. I think it's incumbent upon the public as they look at the agenda as it's posted on the City's website to pay attention to little things like that because the financial statements make zero sense with that many pages missing . Next, with regard to the resolution for the $225,000 grant for the Serrenti Center, I'd like to know how much money have we spent on the Serrenti Center up to this point and how much more money do we need to invest for its renovations ? This has been going on for well over a year. And I think it's time for the public to have an update. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Next, with regard to the Controller 's report, as you mentioned on page two there is a nondepartmental expenditure for special items for 8,975,803.95. This entry demands a footnote . That is a significant part of the City's budget. And I've made this comment before that extraordinary entries like that should not just be dropped and walked away. They need footnotes . And finally , I don't have a problem with the Mayor's appointing Dr. Saxena as Public Health Coordinator since the Moses Taylor Foundation is picking up her salary for the next three years. The question is, after three years, where is the funding going to come from or does that position go open or will it be added to the budget? And I'll await your answers in Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Next speaker is Jack White. MR. WHITE: Hi, Jack White. Beautiful -- accepting Hill Section , Scranton . Doctor, misters , good evening . I hope you all had a great, healthy , safe Father's Day. For 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 those of us who aren't biological parents, it takes a village . And I hope your village is safe and loving and kind and healthy . Let's see, there still hasn't -- oh, nice stopwatch by the way. No more time debates . There's still no street washing in the Hill anywhere . Noise pollution continues louder and longer than ever. Safety situation at Lackawanna and Wyoming continues . Chewing gum on the sidewalk under the mall bridge on Lackawanna Avenue. It sticks to your shoes and then goes to your home. Children playing eat it saying, "Mommy, this is so good. I want more." Have a good night folks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I'm just wondering if any of the Council members have a copy of the request I made of Council and the Mayor? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, we do have it. MR. MORGAN: Okay. What's your opinion on that, Mr. Gaughan ? Do you think that the Mayor and the Council should put that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 on the ballot for the resident s of the City? MR. GAUGHAN : Well, let's put it this way. You sent this letter in March of 2020. And number one here says abolish the Home Rule Charter . So there -- it's not as easy as just abolish ing it. There's a process that you have to go through as you probably well know. So we are having our solicit or look at that process and what that entails. But it's not just as easy as, you know, lighting a match and letting the Home Rule Charter burn. MR. MORGAN: No, I do understand the process . MR. GAUGHAN : And like with anything else, with something of that magnitude , you have to put some thought into it. And I would do that before I would make any comment on making such a drastic move. MR. MORGAN: I understand that. But the Home Rule Charter can be put on the ballot by the Council and the Mayor without collecting signature s at this time. And whether the members of the commission and that sit and meet and discuss the charter and City resident s who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 make determinations on what they want from the new charter or whether they want to abolish the charter or whether they want to change Council 's role in government or the Mayor's or abolish any office or change the way business is conducted and the ability to tax wrapped into that charter , that's one of the most important tools the resident s of this City could have because we can all say that we represent anybody . But that's not necessarily true. I've been in this chamber for 30 years. There's a host of former Council members that just pass atrocious things through Council and then left town. And the resident s are still left with the mess. There was a commission that sat previously but they just didn't put a charter together that had any real teeth. And I think that this City could never change. And I think that without the input of the residents and I -- and my only personal opinion is that the resident s are severely overtaxed. And, you know, all of these reassessments and all -- I mean, look at your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 own agenda today. You're moving money from one account to another . You're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars . We've got a President of the United States talking about spending trillions . And we're already in debt to our grandkids and they're not going to get any benefit from any of the money that's being spent now. And our standard of living continue s to erode. So the people need a Council who not -- who needs to stop saying they represent the people that elected them if at this time they're going to force people to go out door to door and collect signature s after we just went through COVID. I think it's ridiculous . I think it shows just the amount of contempt that the government has for the residents . The Council and the Mayor could have looked at that letter much sooner. But now you know that I didn't lie to you that I had present ed it. The Mayor talked about it on the radio and said she was totally too busy at that time. You know, something 's got to do something for the people in this City. We're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 losing our elementary schools . And then people are leaving the School Board and coming to this body and abandoning the children and the neighborhood s. It's just atrocious . And in regards to your comment , Mr. Gaughan , about speaking at this podium, I think the only way to determine whether you could do what you assume to think you could do is to walk down to the Lackawanna County Courthouse and have you stand in front of a judge and you tell him. Because I asked your clerk where the judge's ruling was that says you can't do what you just tried to do to me last week. And you should ask your attorney what (inaudible ) indifference to a judge's order means, okay, because your role as President of this Council doesn't give you the ability to stifle any free speech here. And no one needs your permission to speak on any issue. And the policeman you had standing here the other day, he doesn't have the authority to take somebody from this podium that you don't agree with. Keep that in mind. And if I have to go down the courthouse , I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 spend the money and I will bring you down with me, okay. Just keep that in your mind. Do you want to say anything ? MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Look forward to it. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner, taxpayer . Once again we talk about my favorite subject pave cuts. The gas company was on my block again last week, made the fourth cut on that block in like maybe the last month or two. And as I said last time they don't fill it in good. Already , the four cuts they made there's like potholes in them already . You have to slow down to go over them. And the cut they made last week, they went way past the curb into my neighbor 's property and to dig up a sidewalk , they threw blacktop in where the walk was. Now, I'm not sure if I know the law on it. I think they have to replace that sidewalk . Maybe they will in the future. But I know if that was me, I'd be screaming about it. Okay, I don't know if this is City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 business or not but I think it is because it affects everybody in the City. I was glad to hear about our legislators are asking to pass the Juneteeth holiday as a national holiday . I think the republican s are hypocrite s because they passed that law and they're passing bills to limit the voting rights of the people who celebrate Juneteeth. So I think they're all hypocrites . And I think the people of color when the next election comes up the next year, they should remember that when they go to the polling place. Lastly, I guess next Tuesday we won't have to wear masks anymore because Monday is the 28th. And that's when the mask mandate ends. MR. GAUGHAN : No, I believe it was when Pennsylvania reached 70 percent -- MR. SPINDLER : No, it was the 28th or 70 percent . MR. GAUGHAN : Well, we'll follow whatever the state says that. And if the state says that, then we'll be happy to -- MR. SPINDLER : They said it's the 28th or 70 percent whichever came first. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, well, there you go. MR. SPINDLER : If you don't reach the 70 percent by next Monday, you don't have to wear your mask. MR. GAUGHAN : You said it. There you go. Thanks. Thank you. Have a good night. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , City resident . And the first thing I wanted to talk about tonight was I think I mentioned it before and Les has mentioned it as well is the intersection of Clay and Vine Street. And I'd like to give you a copy of it if I can. And what I did was, I took a picture of it to sort of mark on the sheet what's on the ground. There's no markings on the ground at all as you could see from the picture . So I could understand why traffic and cars are parking right up to that corner. And I'm sure that anyone that lives in any section of the City and goes up Vine Street has a difficult time getting out of that intersection . You're halfway out in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 intersection and there's a right of way. We have to stop on Vine Street. But coming up Clay Avenue they have the right of way. And because it's coming up a hill, they're really gassing it to get up that hill. So I also looked to see around that area and there's quite a few updated marking s on the ground as far as the street crossings and the markings that go up. And I couldn't understand why they skipped that area and didn't mark off no parking at that intersection . And then I thought maybe it's the University 's property because it is close to the University and all the University living around there. So I thought well, maybe it belongs to the University . But if somebody could find out about that for -- it's not only me but anyone that's travelling up that street. And I've even had neighbor s come up to me and say, Norma, can you speak again about that, you know, so here I am. The second thing I wanted to ask about -- me and my street signs, I haven't seen any updated street signs on the street. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 And I was just wondering how that's coming along, what's the advancement of it? Is there a map? Is there a timeframe as to where the streets are going to be just like you put in the -- on the City's website about the paving streets and when the streets are going to be paved? So I was wondering , I said, maybe we could see a list of where the street signs are going to go up because I haven't seen any. And I keep locking because that's my hot button is the street signs. And the third thing I have on here is I just wanted to give a thank you to anyone that was involved with the Juneteeth celebration that was this weekend . It was more than I had ever expected . And I know that a lot of people probably don't know or did not know about Juneteeth because my I myself only found out about it about 10 years ago. They were having a festival in Philadelphia . And I thought what is that? So because I didn't know I went and found out. So as a black young lady, you know, mature adult, I thought , okay, I have to find out. So I did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 go to the library and to find out about it and learned about it. And I was just quite amazed that they didn't teach us that in school. Nothing was ever taught to us. I was educated here in the schools of Scranton . Nothing was ever taught. I went to Lackawanna College and then I went to Arcadia -- well, Beaver College which is now Arcadia . And nothing was ever talked about. So it's been 10 years ago that I learned about it. So I'm asking and just so I want to thank all the people that were involved this past week. It was wonderful and anybody that didn't get a chance to go, over this next year I would suggest that you Google it and find out all you can about it. Go to the public library and get books and read about it and so that next year when we have the Juneteeth celebration , you'll be more informed about it. And one final thing I have to say is that I just -- my hat off to Glynis Johns. I remember she stood here at this podium. I was just back in town then so I didn't know who she was. So I was asking my family who is she? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Who is she? Who is she? Since then I found out who she is and what a dynamic job she's doing. And I just think she deserve s the whole support of the City and anyone as she asks for donations , I mean, I give a little $10 here and there. But every little $10, $5 helps that organization . And I'm only speaking -- I'm not on the board or anything . I'm just speaking as a very proud citizen of Scranton that we had just a great turnout on Saturday . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Miss Jeffries . And, Mr. Voldenberg , can you inquire about the issues that Mrs. Jeffries raised? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council , Ronnie Ellman. First off, I would like to thank brother Bill for his objection s to the extension of the lounges . This is -- this is an asinine idea. It's not thought out very well. It's -- it means nothing but more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 problems that the City doesn't need. Alcohol has touched my lips before. And you think you want me to sit down when my time is up, at 2:00 they put me outside the Taurus Club so fast, you know, sometimes my coat and everything is inside. That's all somebody needs. Again, the editor in the paper had this nonsense about reassessment . He printed an idea that we should use half the income and 40 million dollars for reassessment in a City that every inch needs something around us. They are so obsessed with reassessment it's just -- there's not a house in this area that hasn't been taxed two, three, four times over the year. I talked to a fellow a couple -- few months ago. His family has lived in the house, the same property since 1946. And he was telling me the taxes in 1946 whatever they were, they are about 10 times higher now. That's how everything -- my house -- my house is pushing three times what it was when I bought it. And I worked then. Talk about working , I saw in the paper today all these do-gooders marching all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 over town wanting the environmental . You close that landfill , $300 tax bill will seem like a blessing when you have to start shipping it out to Higgins or whatever . People are not thinking . I sure something equitable can be worked out. The problem , the landfill has been there over a hundred years. You know, it was -- next door is where it used to be. Sedwick {sic} -- Sedwick ? Is that his name? Sedwick, he built a bunch of houses on a pile of slack coal. They are so poorly built, a few years ago when the expressway -- they were working on the expressway , they had to stop because of damage to the houses. There's the problem . The Friends of Lackawanna want the rest of us to fight their battle for them. I don't know how to say it without getting somebody mad. But these people -- these people bought property -- it just -- they just weren't thinking right. I seen those houses before. I remember the field down there before it was built behind the big garage there that I used to go. My kids used to ride there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 They had a three wheeler then. I don't plan to fight any battle for the Friends of Lackawanna and have my taxes raised because of a landfill and it won't be long we'll have $5, $6 gasoline probably in the next few years. You could imagine the expense it's going to be to start shipping it to wherever. And I thank you again for -- I hope something pleasant happens about closing the bars at 2:00 is long enough. You all keep this battle up and don't allow it in the City. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I understand the frustration with the Home Rule Charter . I think it is a frustration that we have with every government body that (inaudible ) when the community supplies a governmental body with the ability to tax, appropriate and spend. Then it gets to the point where we originally put them on to represent our best interests where the public's best interest start to take a sideline and -- because of obligations put before the governing body, they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 tend to become shortsighted on what is really impacting the people of the community . Government has always had the problem of I have a blank check. I don't have to balance my budget because if my budget has a shortfall , I don't have to go out and make more money. I just tax more money. It's an endless trough of digging into someone else's pocketbook to fill the need to -- fill up a bucket that is -- that you're spending without the City's -- without the -- you're taking money from the people without actually being able to ask is this what we really need. And I think it angers the people because of blank check mentality that all they are is a pocketbook to continually go in. So I understand that the Home Rule Charter there's an issue with the ability to tax people uncontested and unreigned as it's gone through court where they are state regulations . But the Home Rule Charter gives the exception s to that. And I don't think that was the original intention of the Home Rule Charter because it's expanded beyond its scope. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 think that is a legitimate issue that people may have grievances with. The second comment is this position for -- that has been proposed . When I took a look at it, I said perfectly fine we do need a public safety or whatever the position is. And in looking at that documentation I went this person is being hired for the City and they are in South Abington . Last time I remember , South Abington isn't part of the City of Scranton . And anyone who is employed by City of Scranton has to move to the City of Scranton within a six-month period. There's been no exception . We're no longer in an emergency . And now we're looking to hand a three-year contract over because -- Dr. Rothchild cannot have it because Dr. Rothchild is on this body here. And obviously there is no other competent doctor in the entire City of Scranton who could fill this position . We need to go to other cities because all Scranton doctors are incompetent . That's the only -- that's the only path I could think of that our area is so devoid of intellect that we need to constantly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 go outside of our City boundaries , ignore legislation that says when we hire them, they have to stay here. They have to be from here. There is the excuse of well, we're not paying for this. That doesn't matter. If I move to Philadelphia and I decide to have a position here in City government as the arbitrator of City Council and because someone else paid for that position it goes through and now I have fiat to void any Council positions just because we don't have to follow the laws and structures . We don't have to follow procedure s because someone else paid for it. That is a serious problem . It doesn't matter where the money came from. And there may be good intentions behind it. But again, there has been a constant push to put forward people into office, to sign them in there and give them an excuse for living elsewhere and not following the rules for specific parties . And in looking at the documentation today, I noticed that Mr. Deeley was on some of the stuff for the governing body of the City. And I thought he was IT. Which position does 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 he handle at this point because it seems to be on operation s on some of the documentation 's signed. And I thought it was IT as well. So is he doing both jobs? Is the new person in that position not doing it until -- I just don't understand where that position has been cut off from. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Coyne. The next speaker is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . I'm sure you could hear me. I keep my mask on in protest for the people that don't want to get their vaccine . Last week we had an issue here. And it was here again this week, but the same subject wasn't raised. We got three school -- former school directors here. And I have a question . How much annually is the Scranton School District shorted in subsidies which I presume are based on income and various other matters in the City and the income of the parents ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe it's somewhere between 32 and 40 million . MR. DOBRZYN : How much?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. DONAHUE : It's somewhere between 32 and 40 million . I don't have the exact number. MR. DOBRZYN : 40 million , yeah. Yeah, I thought it was that. And I just wanted to -- now when did it start under Mr. Corbett , right, Governor Corbett ? And obviously our friend that was here again tonight was a republican . Well, you people have a lot of nerve not being able to solve all the problems that the republican s created . What's a matter with you? That's all I have to say on it. I mean, it's really -- that's all I hear on TV or whatever . Now, when I -- not to mention we have 36 percent tax exempt properties , some are state and federal buildings and you name it -- defense contractors . As I left the house, I was glued to the chair because at this time and the vote's already probably taken place to put the For the People Act up to debate, not to vote, just up for debate. And once again, the republican party doesn't want to hear it. They don't even want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 to debate it. They don't want to carry on investigation s on January 6th. They don't want to have this come out in the news because people will find that it's not only just minority people, but it's young that are working -- I voted at quarter to eight several times when I lived up in Susquehanna County and I worked all the way in Moosic. It's going to be young, old, disabled , minorities , racial or ethnic and just about anybody that doesn't feel that standing in line for six or eight hours is appropriate . And then on top of it, the state legislature may vote themselves the right to overturn the ballot on top of it. So in other words, if you have a democrat legislature which, you know, I don't know if they'd overturn the ballot. But they could -- if you have two-thirds of the people voting republican , they could reject that candidate and send a new bunch of electors to Washington . And we have several , Dan Meuser, Mr. Keller building his little wall with his kiddies and, you know, with the little building 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 blocks, how cute, you know, how quaint. But, I'm sorry, that's not acceptable with me. 7 million eligible voters in Texas could have voted and did not for various reasons . Over 100,000 purged in Georgia in the -- what was it, 2018 election . And by the way, over in Iran they just held an election . And the religious council rejected probably about a dozen out of 16 candidates or more. And we have another radical in there. And, you know, it just keeps getting better and better. But call your Senators at 888-453-3211. And I called that twice today. They're suppose d to direct you to each and every center. But I think Casey got so many calls and the grief so much that he said please stop. But I did get in touch with Mr. Toomey. And I asked him to do the American thing. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SEMIAN: Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 George Semian, proud downtown resident . I could actually say that. So I have a couple questions -- concerns actually . Is Tom Oleski still in charge of enforcement ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. SEMIAN: Well, he doesn't return calls. But needless to say -- MR. GAUGHAN : I think he was out on with a medical issue or out on some kind of issue. MS. SEMIAN: Is there anyone else in that department that -- MR. GAUGHAN : There should be, yes. MS. SEMIAN: Well, here's the thing downtown . The building that was on fire, the business on the corner of Linden -- and what's that -- Penn. It's condemned to come down. I don't know when it's going to come down. But it's falling down, not only that in the back this gentleman is still operating out of the building . I've called Chris at the Mayor's office, nothing happened . This guy is there on Saturday . The building is -- it's a mess and no one is doing anything about it to get this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 guy out of there. That's number one. I walk my dog downtown all the time. So I'm -- my blood pressure is up about a lot of this stuff. So I'll be here for a couple weeks because I'm not going to get my questions out there or -- today. So that's one of my big concerns because it's just a big safety issue. The other one is if you're coming -- it's right before the Electric City Building . There was a restaurant and there's a building there. And there was a violation on the building . It's not condemned . But people are not supposed to go in there. Walk by there Saturday night, the guy's in there. They tore the thing off the window and they're operating . I mean, come on. Like, this is just crazy. And, of course, no one returns my call about it. And I feel like the police. But, you know, these are safety issues. People are going to get hurt, you know? And nothing is being done about it. The same thing with the hotel with the, you know, with the -- Red Carpet from what I understand was sold so thank God I hope. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 know, the staircase is falling off. And, you know, it's just not right. No one is looking at this stuff. The other thing is, the old My Mother's Table Restaurant on Penn Avenue, the boards are literally falling down out to the side. And Marshall that owns Tops, I mean, you know, you go to these people and you say, hey, will you do something like I'm an idiot. I'll do my best. But there is no enforce ment, you know, it amazes me because there's so many people living downtown . You can't even get a rental downtown . So that should tell you something about, you know, what we need to do. I mean, I sell real estate. I promote this town every chance I can. And the downtown has come a long way, but there are things that are just not enforced . And, you know, people say to me well, you know, the owners aren't going to, you know, they're not going pay the fine or whatever . What's the solution ? I just don't know what it is. But it's safety. And, it's just -- I'm just so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 frustrated with it. And then the other thing is which I called the county on it, the county owns the parking lot where the bakery was on Lackawanna Avenue. The sidewalk is falling apart. And I hope you people know about a lot of the sidewalks downtown . I guess in the 80s the cement was put in and there were, you know, put fake bricks on them. It's a mess. Like, and I said to him -- I forget his name, Chris? Or no, I forget his name over at the county. Oh, and Mark Dougher ; he said well let -- the City is going to give us money for grants for sidewalk . Is that true? Is there money out there for sidewalks that you guys know of? MR. GAUGHAN : I'm not aware of a specific grant for that unless -- you know, that hasn't come before Council but I will check into that. MS. SEMIAN: Okay. Because , first of all, I don't think the county should ask for money there. I mean, it's their -- they paved the parking lot. And they could fix the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 sidewalk . That's easy. But then again, in the ordinance which a couple businesses have done is they blacktop the sidewalk . And it states in there that you need to replace it with cement. And no one enforces it. I mean, you look all over town. There is macadam . It just looks awful. It looks absolutely horrible . But there is no enforce ment. I would love to do this job. I'd do it for free. No one would pay any -- pay the fines, but no one is enforcing them. And I just don't understand . And someone said to me you got to like speak out about this. Well, I'm speaking out today. But I'm going to be back because no one is answering at the Mayor's office. And everyone looks at me like what are you worried about? Well, I'm worried about downtown . I love being here. And a lot of people love being downtown . So I hope that, you know, something can be done. And that's only the surface of, you know, what some of my thoughts are. So if any of you have any insight on this I would greatly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 appreciate it. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, thank you for coming, Mr. Semian. And what we'll do is, we'll have Mr. Voldenberg contact each department and make sure that your concerns get to the right people. And we'll find out why you haven't been getting return calls. MS. SEMIAN: All right. Thanks so much. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you so much. DR. ROTHCHILD : I would like just to add as well, Mr. Semian, if you'd like to meet and we can further discuss your issues with the downtown . I would appreciate your insight . MS. SEMIAN: Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : You're welcome . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for tonight . Does anyone else -- would anyone else like to address Council ? Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just that I'd like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 thank Mr. Voldenberg for his outreach and followup on my questions regarding , first of all, the utility polls. I saw that we got some answers on the utility polls, not all of them. And we're waiting for those. Also, the sign on North Fillmore and Pettibone, I took a drive past that. It's not in there yet. So I'll be following up with you on that also lighting on Boulevard Ave., and the McDonough Avenue piece. So with that, there will just be some issues that I'll followup with you later on. And I guess the last question is, the health coordinator , it was brought up in public comment tonight about whether this position is going to go into the budget after three years. I think it's something that we do need to look into. And I expect to get that answer soon. That is all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, two concerns . A couple concerned resident s reached out to me about a property on 1210 Academy Street over in West Scranton . My understand ing it's been an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 abandon ed property for six years. All right. And the landlord doesn't really take care of the property . There's some disarray . He does somewhat -- he cuts the grass with a weed whacker once in a while which as you know, that's not sufficient . So because it's vacant there tends to be a bunch of young people smoking marijuana on this property or sneaking into the property or on the back. So there is criminal activity . There's some safety issues. There is some blight. Mr. Voldenberg , can you please check on this property for me or the concern ed neighbors and get some feedback . And they don't think it's -- they have a rental registration . So please check on that, alert the police department about the criminal activity . And I'll send all of this in the form of an e-mail too. Secondly , a few -- a month and a half ago we requested a traffic study done on St. Ann's Street with regards to angled parking . I haven't heard anything yet. I don't know where they're at with the study if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 you could please circle around and see if there has been any progress made or if they've come to some type of recommendation for us. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : And health coordinator , I have a couple concern s about that too. I'm not a waiver guy. I've demonstrated in the past I'm against them. I don't know how this is going to be presented . I know there's a grant. But does that grant include benefits ? If the benefits are going to be provided by the City, then that's technically an employee who needs a waiver or, you know, to remain living outside of the City. So I look forward to having some of them answers on that situation . That is all I have right now. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, none at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, quickly I did get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 a request from a few business owners on Capouse Avenue to see if we could look into a four-way stop sign at the corner of Capouse and Walnut. A lot of businesses have opened up there and there is more people crossing the street. And they have been having some traffic issues. So if we would be able to send that request along, Mr. Voldenberg , to the Police Department and the City engineer to see if they can look into the feasibility of that. Also, would you be able to see if we can get an update on some of the properties we sent to LIPS a couple weeks ago to see if anything moved forward with that, especially the City-owned property because I think that e-mail was sent separately on the corner of Maple and Pittston . Also, I was happy to see the county taking the first step last week to conducting a reassessment by putting out bids to see how much it will actually cost. Like I said, it is an important first step. But I would just like to reiterate I know I said a bunch of times from up here, but claims that a reassessment is a ploy to increase revenues is nonsense . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 quite frankly , that would be illegal . Any reassessment has to be revenue neutral . So, for example , the City's 2021 budget has just over 35 million for real estate tax revenue . If a reassessment was done tomorrow , the 35 million would be same exact number in 2022 as it was in 2021. It just simply cannot increase . Reassessment is about fairness and equity that you're paying what your house is actually worth, not what it was worth based off a formula on what it was worth 50 years ago. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few comment s tonight . First, just to respond again to Mr. Morgan who spoke tonight about the letter he sent back in March of 2020, one of the -- actually two of the things that he mention s in this letter is, number one, abolish the Home Rule Charter and reclassify the City from Class 2A to a Class 3A City and put these question s on the ballot and then wants our opinion on that. President Kennedy said once, "That too often we enjoy the comfort of a opinion at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the discomfort of thought ." Before you do something like abolish the Home Rule Charter or reclassify the City from a 2A to 3A, you actually have to think about it and make sure that you know what the repercussions would be. Obviously , we can't just abolish the Home Rule Charter . You have to have something in place. I happen to think this form of government , the strong Mayor and Council works. I like this form of government . I've been involve d with it now for the last eight years. Do we need to update Home Rule Charter ? Sure. Are there changes that probably have to be made? Sure. But to just to abolish it and then to throw out things like reclassify the City and then you just ask for an opinion , I -- you know, you have to think about these things. And there's a process that you have to go through before you dive into those suggestions . But I did ask Solicitor Hayes to take a look at what that process entails. The -- our Solicitor , Mr. Hayes drafted a letter to the Auditor General as was mentioned last week requesting a performance audit of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 permitting process es of the DEP in relation to the expansion of the landfill . We're going to hold off on sending that because Dunmore is also interested in joining . And there may be other boroughs as well. So it will be I think more powerful if we send it as a group rather than just the City. We did receive several appointment letters and -- letters of interest rather and resumes from City resident s who were interested in serving on the zoning board. We are in the process of reviewing those. And next week we should have an idea of who we'll choose for those and then Solicitor Hayes will draft legislation . I spoke with Mr. Preambo , the DPW Director this morning . He invited all of Council to an information al meeting to review and discuss department internal and external operations which I appreciated very much. And then we also -- Councilman Donahue invited Mr. Preambo and his crew at the DPW to a public caucus to inform Council of what's going on at the DPW and some of the operations down there. So hopefully that will occur within 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the next few weeks. We did not receive an update yet on the Meadow Brook Creek project . I do expect that soon. Several neighbors have reached out to me who were concerned with their backyard s and just a general update. So I'm hoping to have something by next week. I received a resident complaint about 2234, 2236 Brown Avenue. This is down in the plot section of the City. There was a structure that was destroyed by flames. And it's still standing there since May of 2020. It is on the demolition list. I inquired with Miss Cipriani from OECD on that. Also, I did provide Mrs. Jeffries with an answer to her question from I think two weeks ago about the amount of money received on the City's decommissioned vehicles . And that document if anyone is interested in looking at the listing can be found online on the City's website and then on the DPW page. A meeting has been set with official s from DEP and the City regarding the flooding on Leggetts Creek and Leach Creek. That will be Thursday , June 24th at 9 a.m. The Mayor, City officials , DPW, DEP and affected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 resident s will be there. And hopefully we could come to some sort of resolution . And that's all I have for this week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE - AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 10, 2020, AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO GRANT A SPECIAL ENCROACHMENT PERMIT TO CITY RETAIL BUSINESSES AND RESTAURANTS TO OPERATE ON CITY RIGHT-OF-WAYS” TO EXTEND THE TIME PERIOD UNTIL DECEMBER 31, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'll be voting in favor of this. This is amending File of the Council No. 10 from 2020 in which we gave restaurant s and small businesses the ability to allow their patrons and the businesses to operate on the City's right of way due to COVID regulations and everything else that happened last year.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And then we continue to face the struggle that small businesses face. So I think that it's good for the small businesses and restaurant within the City. This will extend it until December 31st, 2021. And it will waive all of the fees on the special encroachment permit. So I'll be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'm strongly in favor of this. It will recoup some revenue s, you know, that were lost from the pandemic . This was devastating to restaurants and area businesses . So I'm very happy to see we're going to extend this. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , as I was going through this there was a few question s that came to mind. And I know Dr. Rothchild and others had the same type of questions on what kind of vehicle s these are that we're renting -- excuse me, there was nothing budgeted for this account line item in the 2021 budget. And there was some questions as to how much each vehicle costs. And I'd like a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 better explanation I think for this item. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I just wanted to express my disappoint ment in the lack of details that we receive with some of these pieces of legislation . You know, as a Council we're suppose d to be the fiscal watchdogs. And, of course, that's why this has come to our desk. But, you know, it's a good chunk of money. And we need to make sure we know what we're getting for it and why this transfer is necessary and just have some more details on what the money is going towards . So I'd like to request more of that information from administration before moving ahead on this legislation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, so also on the question , I was glad to hear that other Council members had similar question s to mine when I was looking through this -- the documentation here. I think maybe getting some of the answers to those questions might get into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 bigger picture of vehicle maintenance when it comes to DPW. So it might help moving forward into the future with maintenance of the vehicle s. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Just on -- just one thing we could add to this too is what is the extent to -- that the current garbage trucks that these are replacing need to be repaired and what work needs to go into that? MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, also if I could throw in there I think at one point in time the City did look into the replacing of older vehicles . And again, looking at the bigger picture here it might be -- it might bring some of that to the surface as to how we're going to replace vehicle s that are in need of replacement and repair. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. All those in favor -- oh, I'm sorry, Mark. Go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : That's all right. The way I look at it is, come on, $76,800. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 It's for two vehicles for the remainder of the year. That's $6,000 a month rent each vehicle . So and it wasn't budgeted for. So I definitely need more information on it. I have zero. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.
