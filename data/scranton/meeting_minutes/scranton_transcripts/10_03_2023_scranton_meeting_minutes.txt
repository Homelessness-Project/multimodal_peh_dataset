This ordinance is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 the city's capital budget for 2024. It had been tabled until a public hearing was held last week.

OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED SEPTEMBER 27, 2023 FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY -SEPTEMBER 2023. 3.B. DOCUMENT RECEIVED SEPTEMBER 26, 2023, FROM PFM FINANCIAL ADVISORS , LLC, REGARDING THE GENERAL OBLIGATION NOTE, SERIES OF 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I have a comment for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 each of the Third Order items. For 3-A, it's been something I've been bringing attention to for some time. DPW administration overtime is at 168 percent . And at this point in time DPW refuse is at 107 with one more quarter in the year to go. Also Item 3-B, the document from PFM Financial , there's a correction . The interest rate on the fixed borrowing is 4.85 percent rather than 4.75 percent . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Anyone else have any comments ? Anyone else have anymore comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I would first like to wish all of our resident s of Italian heritage a happy National Italian American Heritage Month. With that said, I might be jumping the gun, but I don't see the Italian flag out there flying like it normally is for every other heritage months that we do. So maybe they are waiting until Columbus Day. But would you please reach out to the administration to see if that's going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 happen? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I would also like to wish Scranton Police Officers Bowman and Rowlings a speedy recover y from injuries received this past weekend after responding to a call. Lastly, there will be -- the North Scranton Neighborhood Association Watch will be having their annual October fest to include music, fun, and refreshments . It will be this Saturday , October 7th from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., at the VFW Post 25, 2291 Rockwell Avenue. And that is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Any other Council members ? MR. SCHUSTER : Well, Mr. McAndrew beat me to it. I was going to announce the North Scranton Neighborhood Association October fest. But while I have an opportunity , I guess I should say October is also German American Heritage Month. And I don't often have the time to say that but I would just like to make it known. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. Smurl? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Dr. Rothchild ? I have two things. This Sunday will be the 26th running of the Steamtown Marathon . The race will begin at 8 a.m. at Forest City High School and it will run through 14 communities and finish here in front of the Lackawanna County Courthouse on North Washington Avenue. The first runner should get there somewhere around 10:20 a.m. I would just ask we try to do a pretty good job as far as feeding traffic across the course. There's lots of support out there from the local police and lots of volunteer s working intersection s. We would just ask people to be a little patient . If you're coming into the city and you want to get around the course between the hours of 10:00 and, you know, 2:00, you could go left on Jefferson and down Lackawanna . It takes you right around the course. And Green Ridge Street is another good place to cross the path if you're going from Dunmore or Green Ridge over to North Scranton . We're excited to have well over 1,000 runners from 35 states coming to our city, to stay in our hotels, spend their money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 here and run 26 miles and raise some money for St. Joseph's Center along the way. So we're excited about that this coming Sunday. Also, I received this afternoon an emergency certificate . This is to certify an emergency exists requiring the immediate passage of an attached ordinance authorizing the Mayor and other appropriate city officials to ratify any and all documents necessary to expedite the passage of said legislation which will provide continued emergency response efforts and resources in light of the devastating storm September 9th, 2023. This request for the approval by City Council was made because time continues to be of the essence to help the resident s of Scranton impacted by the storm. Signed by Mayor Paige Gebhardt Cognetti and certified by our City Controller John Murray. That legislation will be brought up next week. That's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Derek Raines. I would like to remind everyone please respect each of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 the speaker s that come up if everyone could just sit quietly and give everyone an opportunity to speak. Everyone gets five minutes . And we'll take it from there. Thank you very much. MR. RAINES: So if somebody lets me know on the time issue because obviously I can't see the time. Derek Raines, 919 Monroe Avenue. I'm here for a couple different things today. Number one, my reoccurring issue, Mr. McAndrew , last time I talked to you about this I believe your initial response was something along the line of holy cow, I thought that would have been taken care of by now. It hasn't been. Dr. Rothchild , last time I talked to you about it you stood there and you assured me it would be taken care of and it still has not been taken care of. The recurring problem Mr. Pietreface came out, inspected everything , once again assured me that it would be taken care of. And once again it still was not taken care of. Being a person from Indiana , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 your word is your word. If you have a city employee who tells you they are going to do something , you expect them to do that. My wife and I pay our taxes because we're expected to. And I expect the same thing from the city employees . There's still holes -- I believe Mr. King we mentioned this before. There's still holes on my corners . There's still no truncated -- those paths on the corners that tell you, you know, when you're coming before you drop off the curb cut which obviously we don't have those either. And they've never been taken care of. There's still a hole which I said to Mr. Pietreface , "Why don't you just get a bag of concrete and fill it up?" And that hole is still there and that is a bus stop. And all the kids sit there every day and that hole is still there. And that's got to be just in that has to be I don't know how many years. And I just don't understand the amount of money that my wife and I pay in taxes, it's just appalling . My wife who works at the Community Medical Center, she purchased 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 a new truck because my handicap van would not be able to go through the snow in Scranton which brings me to my next thing. Does the Scranton -- city looked at what's going to happen this year? Is there any plan in place on what we're going to do with snowfall if we get 2 feet of snow? Is there anything that's going to be taken care of so people are going to be able to go out? And as I said before, my wife is the closest employee at Community Medical Center in the operating room because everybody else has left the city. The taxes and everything I don't even have to explain about that. So she bought a new truck and now she's able to drive back and forth on that issue. But my issue of the hole not being able to drive around my block or do anything , I had as I said before this chair was $42,000. I had a piece broke on my chair. It was a month I didn't have my chair. And I go into my driveway and it scrapes and it's all this filled up with dirt and garbage . And it just -- it's unbelievable to me that when you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 have a head of a department who says we're going to take care of that -- I understand why City Council have been saying oh, yeah, we're going to get it taken care of because that's just -- you expect it to be taken care of but it wasn't. And I just don't see any reason why the city hasn't taken care of it. Now, we had a couple months ago the city said, oh, yeah, we're going to pave your street and do all of this. And then it came back to well, you know, the water company is going to do it. And now it's just on a list. Is it ever going to be done by water company ? The city needs to grade probably 4, 5 inches off the middle of the road because it's just been paved over and over. How are we doing on time? MR. SCHUSTER : 30 seconds . MR. RAINES: 30 seconds, so that's my whining again. And it saddens me that this stuff isn't taken care. And to let you guys know, my son, a Scranton High School graduate is now a microbiologist . He worked for the VA. And now he's moved to Cleveland to work at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 hospital in Cleveland because he's going to get a great job there. And it breaks my heart that my son, my best buddy, Scranton graduate has left the city which is another big chunk of tax money that's gone, same with my daughter . She's got her master's degree. She moved to Mountain Top. And soon enough, there's going to be nobody left in this city but people that don't contribute to the city. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Raines. MR. RAINES: Thank you, everybody . MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you send word down to DPW to request , get an update as to the status of that situation -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Councilman King, if I could just add and just respond quickly to Mr. Raines, so as you mentioned and have been discuss ed that American Water did plan on doing a project on that street. When we asked American Water they said that they weren't quite sure of the date. They were hoping to get it done in the fall. But that was dependent on funds and things outside of our control but that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 would get to in the spring. If not and our DPW was not going to, you know, do paving project s on that street if American Water was going to tear it up, but I did ask DPW -- I believe I asked twice, if I recall correctly , if there was anything that could be done temporarily to help on the street in the meantime while we're waiting for American Water. But in addition to contact ing DPW if we could also ask American Water now on the plans for that street if it has, in fact, been pushed to the spring for that project . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thanks so much. MR. RAINES: (Inaudible ) on the curbs all over. They're not just there for the color, they're there for a person -- now that I'm legally blind, those truncated pads, they left my chair unable -- when I hit those bumps I know that I'm getting ready to drive off the curb. And they're just not there for decorations . They're there for an ADA reason just like we're suppose d to have ADA handicap 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 parking spot out back which we still do not have one that meets the ADA requirements . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Raines. Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I'm going to read a letter that I wrote to the newspaper . It was published last Friday. Flood victims deserve a break from government . Editor, my parents ' North Scranton home was condemned in November , 1963 due to a mine subsidence . Homeless for the next seven months we experienced extreme financial hardship . And even though our home were uninhabitable and beyond repair, we had to pay property taxes until the government bought us out in 1968. Homeowners who were devastated by the flooding on September 9th should not have to go through what we did. County, municipality , and school district taxing authorities should exempt them from property taxes for as long as their homes are uninhabitable or until they are bought out. If they already paid the tax for 2023, they should receive a prorated rebate. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Some will ask why should we give these people a break on their taxes, shouldn 't their insurance policies cover their losses? Not likely. Most insurance companies do everything they can to avoid paying a claim. Keep in mind that this flooding might have been avoided or at least greatly reduced if we had effective stormwater management , but we don't. And that is a subject for another day. Yes, we will lose some tax revenue but only a pittance compared to the millions that are collected each year. But beyond that, there is one fundamental reason why we should give these homeowners a tax break. It is the right thing to do and we all know it. Now, I'll be reading this letter tomorrow to the County Commissioners at their meeting . I don't have an opportunity to go to the school district meeting s. But I hope that all the taxing authorities do opt in to give these homeowners a break. Unless you've been in our shoes and lost a home, you have no idea how much money it's going to cost, okay. Your first duty, your fiduciary responsibility to the citizens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and taxpayers is to take care of them when they are in times of distress and this is one of them. And I hope this makes clear that you need to make stormwater management a priority . Yes, it's nice to have pools and parks and all the other good things of life. But stormwater management is essential . And when do you have effective stormwater management , when nobody gets flooded out. All right. Moving on, I'm looking forward to see sometime in the near future the legislation to restore the funds that we dedicated 3.79 million for those court awards. So I hope that's going to come out in the next few weeks. The firefighter 's contract , it's been 128 days. We're well past the 120 days it was suppose d to take to get it on the city's website we need to see that contract . Any update on the audit? MR. KING: Not at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : You want me to go over there and light a fire under the Sewer Authority ? I'll do it. You know the Sewer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Authority , you remember them, that's the authority that would not die. MR. KING: They're the ones that are holding it up, I believe , Joan. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And just one other thing, I saw in the paper the story about tax exempt review that we had one proposal from Rudolph Clark, LLC. I didn't see anything in about the cost of what they were going to ask for for this. Is this going to be coming down in legislation in the next couple weeks? MR. KING: I would expect so. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And can we assume that two weeks from now we'll have a draft operational budget for 2024? MR. KING: I would expect that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. You all have a good night. MR. KING: You too. Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Marie Schumacher . MR. SCHUSTER : Solicitor Gallagher , can we take a look at since Council is the taxing body of the city, can you look into the legality of tax relief for the affected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 residents ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , it will be shorter because my first one was about the pump at Merrifield and the next one was about buyout. And now I wanted to know the status of notifying the property tax exempt property owners. Are they expected to provide a payment to compensate the city for all or some of the lost property tax? Has everybody receive d a letter in that regard? MR. KING: Have all the tax exempt properties receive d -- I believe the administration sent those out. And once again, they put out the RFP to do the HUP test. And there was one -- finally we got somebody to respond . So as long as the price is, you know, within the range and they are a reputable company , we're probably going to go after that as well. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I saw that in the paper today so, yeah. And my next question is on what basis was it decided to put that out for contract instead of doing it inhouse? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MR. KING: Instead of our own attorneys or solicitor s for the city doing the HUP test, I think that they are looking for a company or a law firm that kind of specializes in doing this or has a background in doing, you know, these HUP tests. And I think -- I believe speaking on behalf of the city's solicitors , I believe that they are, you know, tied up with quite a number of other issues that they're dealing with and, you know, we want to have someone that can really focus on getting this job done, this special program . MS. SCHUMACHER : I just thought getting a letter out would be a good start. Next, I just wanted to say that I was happy that you tabled the purchase of the building next door last week because I've noticed over my many years on this earth that if there's a lot of room, it will be filled. And I don't want to see this city grow with a lot of employees . I want to see something for the citizens . And then again, this was sort of answered as happened in past years the next year's budget is expected prior 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 to the required 15th of November . And is that -- that is true, right? MR. KING: I expect they're going to absolutely meet those timelines . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then finally , what is the city's debris. I keep seeing RFPs in the legal notices for the city's -- they're debris removal . MR. SCHUSTER : So I would imagine -- and I can't -- I don't know what one you're specific ally speaking about. But in 2018 we had some water issues with that big storm in August and there were I think 49 project s that FEMA or PEMA were going to reimburse . I only know of three maybe that were done out of those, say 49. And you would have seen in the last three weeks there was two pieces that we passed that was debris removal out of the -- some of the Keyser Valley creeks. That was projects that should have been done from the 2018 storm. So I would imagine that's what that is in regard to. MS. SCHUMACHER : That's what it is, okay. Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Schumacher . Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . Thanks, Mr. McAndrew , about the Italian American flag. It's Italian American month, will there be an Italian flag flying at City Hall? If so, when can we expect to see it flying? I've asked for weeks including filing a right to know for a listing of city-owned take-home vehicles and by who, simple question you would think considering I'm a citizen of Scranton , a taxpayer , a business man and all my taxes are paid. I believe city vehicles belong to the taxpayers . I was refused by the city RTK office, so I filed an appeal with Harrisburg . The fire department , the police department , DPW, and code enforcement responded with reasons why to withhold the info. I found it very alarming that the city agencies will label a city docserve for a mere fact that he or she is concern ed with city government after having first-hand knowledge that a certain city director was pulled over and cited by the Pennsylvania State Police for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 driving with a suspended and/or revoked license . I was concerned as you all should be in the event this person has a city take-home vehicle and is involved in an accident while driving a city vehicle taking the kids to school. It's a liability that the city certainly doesn't need. What is the city hiding and who is using city vehicles after hours that is so secretive ? I'd read the affidavit s, but I'll get them to you guys. Every affidavit is the same. So how are we making out on the Serrenti Center? How's it coming along? Did we ever put the electric charging station s in there? And when will the public be able to tour the facility ? How come the dumpster at police headquarters hasn't been dumped in weeks? Chris Smith and Scott Pietreface had the laborers removing bags by hand from the dumpsters the last couple of days. Is that a violation of the union? Do you know that DPW Director Scott Pietreface is so overworked that they hired a new assistant last week? The poor guy. When 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 we stay tuned and we're waiting , do we know what the vetting process is yet for Weston Field for the homeless hotel? Do we have an answer on the vetting process yet? Well, the Mayor is here tonight . Can we ask the Mayor? Would the Mayor be able to answer that question for us what the vetting process is? Thank you. MR. KING: I don't know that there is a vetting process -- MR. ARGENTA : Excuse me? MR. KING: Anyone who is a citizen of the City of Scranton is allowed to enter there. I don't think we could screen -- MR. ARGENTA : So they're citizens . Do they have addresses , Mr. King? MR. KING: I don't know what their addresses are. MR. ARGENTA : A city resident would have an address for the city, correct ? MR. KING: Well, we don't -- MR. ARGENTA : And the CIT Center with 95 voters are register ed to vote isn't an address -- isn't an address to live there. And if the CIT Center on 5th and Linden, then let's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 have it inspected and see if it's up to capacity . There's 95 residents and (inaudible ) that are register ed to vote. How is that possible ? Answer that, Mr. King? If a young girl was raped or a woman was raped, do we know who those people are -- who those homeless people are? Do you know who's in our town? Neither do I. Terrible , terrible representation . But you had a pep rally the other night for two hours bragging about you being an alter boy and you were this and you were that. Nobody cares what you did 50 years ago. Let's talk about what you did on the Scranton School District and how many lawsuit s you had with the Scranton School District and how many billions of dollars . Do you want to continue ? Let's get the real facts out there. Help these people that were flooded . You got 70 million dollars of ARPA money. You buy them out and you wait for the money from PEMA and FEMA. How about we do that? You buy them out as the city. Sit up there and make ordinance s that count for people instead of worrying about who's parking in a parking space and who's got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 an overgrown tree. Do what you're supposed to do, represent , make ordinance . You're the legislative body. Stop the Mayor's crazy spending and these crazy tactics . You put her in her place. Have a good night. MR. KING: Have a great night, Mr. Argenta . Len Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, flood victim of Keyser Valley. First, I really want to thank the DPW workers that have come out the way they were handling , you know, all the debris, you know, all kinds of scum and mud and everything falling from giant pieces of furniture that they had to pick up and throw in the dumpsters . I really want to thank those guys. Now last week I heard the fire chief saying that the pump was running . No, it wasn't. I was there. I live there. I'm at the corner of Lafayette and North Merrifield . And I kept driving around the city or the neighborhood checking on the damage. And so many times I went by that pump house, that pump house was not working . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 You know, I don't know if the fire chief made a mistake or was saying that the pumps were running , yeah, the portable pumps that they brought in after the regular pump failed. At that pump station , I don't get it. There's a green light that flashes on that building . You know, to me just common sense that green light would tell you that the pump is working . But I was there when the pump was down and they were fixing it. And the green light was flashing , like, shouldn 't it be a red light flashing ? That's what a lot of people including myself, oh, the pump house is working , no problem , the light is flashing green. I can't understand who put that idea to work. The way also it was said that there was a meeting for the study on the stormwater at the Keyser Valley Community Center, you know, within the last two years. There was never a meeting there. Me and the neighbors would know if there was ever a meeting . So I don't know what's going on there with that meeting . But, you know, there should be a meeting at the Keyser Valley 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Community Center for the resident s in that area to know what's going on. Somebody should just look into that once in a while have a meeting right there with the neighbors to know what's being done. You know, everything we're being told what's being taken care of or the process , you know what, you'll have to forgive me but from my experience coming here 10 years, I'll believe it when I see it. In the meantime , I don't believe anything you guys are telling us because , you know, all the time, oh, we're looking into it. We're getting permits . But it's going to take a long time, even this study that's going on. It says in there the next stage is the design. How long is the design going to take now, a couple years before anything really gets done? You know, I must have talked to five different people request ing sandbags at the time of the storm and still following up on it. Nobody will give me sandbags. I could prevent a couple of houses from filling up with water if I have -- I requested five to seven sandbags that I would put on my corner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 lot that would direct the water a different way that would save my next door neighbor 's basement from flooding . Nobody comes with a sandbag. Right now we're facing a real problem with mosquitos . It's unbelievable the whole neighborhood at least one square block is filled with millions of mosquitos -- not millions , all right, but lots and lots of mosquitoes that are flying around day and night, all of these wet water laying places, you know, mosquitos are hatching like crazy. One more thing, I would like to know what chemicals , what diseases were in all of those flood waters. Who knows what the heck was mixed in there. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. Gene Besko. MR. BESKO: Good evening , Council , the gallery behind me is made up mostly of Keyser Valley resident s who live in the flood-prone areas. These people have been putting up with flooding for their property for years. This past flood was so bad that some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 resident s had to be taken out by boat. Enough is enough. Through the years we've approach ed Council , City Hall about -- and City Hall about the flooding . Since 2007 I personally have spoken to City Hall, the city engineer and been before this Council three times. The flooding issue, it still continues and nothing is being done. Why? One of the issues that needs to be addressed for the fourth time is the reconnection of a 24 inch pipe that used to go from a retention pond on the west side of Keyser Avenue directly to Keyser creek. This is where all the runoff from Newton Road and Fawnwood comes down the mountain and is dumped into that. In 2006, the lot on the corner of Briggs Street and North Cameron was bulldozed for a new home. In doing so, they bulldozed over a manhole on the 24 inch pipe going through the property . In 2007, the Sewer Authority instead of fixing the pipe directed all the water from the 24 inch pipe onto Briggs Street. Every time it rains, that 24 inch pipe dumps 187,000 gallons of water per minute. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 That is basically the equivalent of four 15-foot round swimming pools being dumped onto Briggs Street every minute. All of that water goes down Briggs Street and it actually hits through the alley, goes down Merrifield Avenue, Dewy Avenue down to the pump station . How much water can that pump station take? They actually turn into a river. The DPW and city flood control personnel have been doing a great job cleaning the storm drains and trying to maintain the pump station . But it's only putting a Band-Aid on it. The next big issue is the pump station on North Merrifield . We've been told for over 30, closer to at least 35 years that the pump station is inadequate and needs to be upgrade d but nothing has ever been done to upgrade it. Why? GPI incorporated did a study of the flooding problem s in Keyser Valley in 2021. I actually accompanied the people while they were doing the study. This was within the vicinity of Merrifield and Briggs Street. The report was finished in September 24 of 2021. In two years we have not heard one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 word about the results of this study. After 30 years of being ignored, the people of Keyser Valley want to see corrective action taken sooner rather than later. I suggest that when the city does a study once the city has analyze d the results and implemented a plan of doing it that there should be a meeting with all the people involved so that the people know what is going on instead of being left in the dark. We have several people here who live is the vicinity of Lindy Creek and Frink Street. Some of their properties had extensive damage also. I'm not too familiar with the cause of the flooding in that area, but the development of new homes, a new turnpike entrance , and clear cutting of the power line up there are more than likely contributing to the facting of that flooding. Thank you very much for your concerns . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Besko. Gene Romaldini MR. ROMALDINI : Gene Romaldini , I live on Merrifield Avenue. I'm actually Lenny's neighbor . So we're looking for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 sandbags to stop the water from going into my basement . A couple things I wanted to talk about. And it's -- I'm going to reiterate a couple of things that Gene said. The first -- one of the first problem s you have is that 24 inch line that needs to be reconnect ed because it's at a higher elevation . If that line is not reconnected , the pump house doesn't mean anything because you have to divert that water that is coming out of Briggs Street that just blows out of the catch basins, runs down our street like a river. It literally is like a river. If you stand in that water, you will get swept into the -- into the street. That's how strong it is. So the first thing that needs to be address ed is that line. That would be the first thing. That's my recommendation . The pump house based on GPI's study is about in today's dollars probably 4 million dollars worth of work. So there's quite a bit of work there. The other question -- one of the questions I have is based on what the Mayor had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 mentioned about the drawing s being in design, there's quite a bit of approval processes , like, NPDES and county approval and state approvals . Based on that design, like, do we have a schedule when that design will be completed ? Do we have like an end date? Like, is it the spring of 2024 because if this event happens again, the design doesn't mean anything . We have to get the construction started because that construction may take a year or two. So that's some of the issues that we have here. The one thing I do want to say, you know, DPW and the first responders did a great job that night. You know, the police were there, you know, put the real heros of this event are these people here. These people are the heros because they had to live through it. They had to be pulled out of their homes. They had to walk through the water and the mud. Elaine Alagrucci {phonetic }, my next door neighbor , God bless her. She walked down the street in the flood waters to pull someone out of their car. She had to break the window on his car because the water was probably 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 feet high. And she dragged him out of his car and saved him. I told her to wait for me but she wouldn't wait for me because I wanted to put my shoes on. I was walking around in my bare feet. So, you know, these people that have been displaced from their homes are the heros here. And I really feel bad because we're still in our home. You know, we have -- we have some flooding in our basement but it's these folks here that are dealing with it the most. So, you know, that's all I have to say. I'd like to thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Romaldini . Mr. Voldenberg , can you contact , I don't know, I guess it would be the city engineers or DPW to find out about that 24 inch pipe and see what the situation is as to why -- you know? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: I mean, these are two people now that seem to have intimate knowledge that something was, you know, disconnected or redirected somewhere . And it's obviously it's causing issues. So if we can try to get an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 answer on that I appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will on Briggs Street. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Frank. Jim Rupp. MR. RUPP: Thank you, Council . I'm here with the rest of the Valley. I'm representing my mom. She's 87 years old. She's living in the house that she has right now since she was a kid almost 93 years. Somebody stopped by today from FEMA and said we could give you a loan for 7 percent to help you take care of your property . All right? Now, my mom parallels Lindy creek. It kicks out at Frink Street every time there is a heavy rain. Lindy creek is responsible for the city. They do a very nice job cleaning the creek. My compliments to the Mayor for taking my calls and getting me in contact with the engineer . Again, I want to compliment the DPW at the same time. But the Lindy creek issue which I'm on the other side of Keyser creek, the water comes down and kicks out at the same spot every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 time there's a heavy rain. It's been going on before you guys were even on Council . That's how long it's been happening . The creek has to be dredged . I don't know how it has to be done. Yes, I know there's a lot of government agencies involved . You can't do this. You can't do that. Somebody has to cut the red tape. This is ridiculous . My mom can't handle another one. All right. They're going to raise her taxes now because the county just did a reassessment . She can't -- she won't be able to pay the taxes. I would like to have a tax release for my mom. That would be wonderful . But the Lindy creek issue needs to be addressed. All right. The valley is getting hit both sides. In regards to the Merrifield Avenue pump station , the station has been promise d I don't know probably 10 times that I know of. Everybody wants to say yes, this, that, and the next thing. It has to be elevated at least two stories . The young lady mention ed about a pressure transducer. All right, the transducer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 is subject to power surges and lightening . All right. It's -- it's how the electronic equipment is. All right. The pumps, you need an emergency generator there. You need a new electric service . You can't say, okay, the service tripped out because it's underground . Well, guys, every time the place floods the electric service is underground. All right. There is issues with the pump station . It's happened for years. It has to be repaired. I don't know what red tape we have to cut, but sooner or later we have to get through all these government agencies in order to take care of the people of the Valley. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Rupp. Lee Morgan. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here today is that, you know, I respect all of these residents . But honestly they've elected one failed group of leadership after another going all the way back. And the sale of the Scranton Sewer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Authority is a nail in our coffin. All the money was squandered . It was a combined system. We had a corrupt mayor who was prosecuted . And I'd just like to say that all of our lives here in the city we've been lied to. And we've elected people that have an inability to lead. And it's to our own detriment . The city really has to -- the residents have to realize that they have to rewrite the charter . I think that's one of the reasons why I had to file a federal lawsuit against the city, the Mayor, and ECTV today in federal court because it was the only way to get the Mayor to come out of the hole she's hiding in her office because we've locked -- we've locked the residents out of their own City Hall. We have a Council that answers to no one that is going to create more authorities . We don't need another stormwater authority . We don't need any of that. We need to elect people that can run a city and we don't have it. We don't even get response s from our own government .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 It's like we're serfs in our own city. I mean, it's -- you know, after -- the city was founded in 1866. And do you mean to tell me from then until now we can't collect garbage and we can't manage stormwater ? I watched all the grant money we're talking about spending here now in a county that's becoming a third world country , bankrupt , 33 trillion dollars worth of debt more than the gross domestic product in the country , children uneducated . In some places in our country none of the people have above a third-grade education . It's not in little places. It's across the whole country . And we have make-believe leaders like the ones we have here today. You know, talking about stormwater is really ridiculous . It should have been solved a long time ago and it wasn't. This Council voted to sell the Scranton Sewer Authority and then allowed all the money to be squandered and took the reserve and threw it into the property before Pennsylvania American Water took it. You just have no answers . And now the city is spending 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 money it doesn't have again. And you know when you talk about distressed , we were in distress for 30 years. We had Mayor Chris Doherty bankrupt the city. And the sad part is that city employee s and school district employees put up signs for failed candidates who can't lead. We talk about spaghetti dinners. We're going to hug and kiss everybody . But the residents -- look it, we need to get rid of the 2.4 percent wage tax. We need to cut spending . We need to redirect the city and not with another make-believe business incubator and passing around millions of dollars of federal funds and moving money through nonprofit s. It's a disgrace what's happened to our country . All of these residents here today allowed it to happen. They voted for failed candidate s. And I don't know how many of you know that the State of Pennsylvania is removing small dams everywhere. So everything that was mitigating streams and runoff and water, it's being erased. So when you have flooding , it's only going to get worse because we have a failed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 government . We looked at Democrats and Republicans and they don't have any answers because they don't serve us. They serve somebody else. And if you can't -- if the people in this room can't see that, I can't make them see it. I mean, talk about trying to talk to the Mayor. I called her office numerous times, got no response . I petition ed this Council and this Mayor to look into the management of ECTV. I asked this Council how is ECTV's board appoint ed. Nobody knew because this is just a monstrous machine completely out of control . Nobody knows anything . No resident of this country should have to do a right to know to know anything that's going on in this country . The information should be on a laptop. They should pop it open. And as a citizen , you should know anything you want to know about your country . But we've been turned into beggars in our own country . And we've allowed 10 million -- that's what the number is now -- 10 million illegal people to cross our border all living off the taxpayers . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . It's an interesting night here tonight . A lot of these people that are here shouldn 't have to be here because if we took care of this problem under the Gaughan administration and the other administration s that sat here, they wouldn't be here tonight . They wouldn't have this problem . We pushed the peas around and around and around. That's the problem we've had here under leadership . And I hate to have to come here and even open my mouth about something , but being born and raised here, running companies here, I've been all over the world. I just come back from Florida after three weeks helping something going on down there. I turned around and we donated -- and this one was Child Hunger Outreach here in Scranton . It was done between President Trump and myself. We donated disinfectant wipes to the tune of $150,000. We didn't ask for credit for it. I turned around with my fellow masons, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 they reached out and we talked about it. We donated two trailers , one went to Clarks Summit. That's at the -- it's the number four firehouse on up there in Clarks Summit. People are taking the wipes. We donated another trailer here at Weston Field so our people here could go get free wipes, disinfectant wipes. An individual -- Argenta told me today that somebody from the city said they can't have them because they're out of date. Well, these are sealed container s. They are as effective as anything else. I'm sure the doctor can tell you about disinfectant wipes because I'm sure she uses them every day at her practice . The bottom line, the people in this city are being denied because some idiot made the statement you can't have them because they're out of date. Those wipes are as effective a year from today. They're sealed containers . And he blamed the Mayor. And I talked to the Mayor before. And she said she had absolutely no idea about it. That's the last thing she would do is deny these people free disinfectant wipes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 instead of going to Wal-Mart or anywhere else and having to buy them and pay out of pocket. And it's a shame that we have idiots like that in this city. They are incompetent and they should be fired without even a hesitation for denying you people the right to have free disinfectant wipes to take care of the bacteria and the germs that are in there. And we know the germs are there because we saw an individual in Clarks Summit who died from an infection from the water when they were trapped there. So those are the things that are there. We had a person who wrote an article in the Scranton Times about me going after Bill Gaughan . Well, I haven't seen him or Bill Gaughan dig in their pockets like we have done to turn around and help them. And he criticize d my one dinner once a year. Well, it takes months to put that dinner away. And this will be the 30th year on Christmas Day. And I'm proud to say I'm a Scrantonian . And we're doing stuff here, not like the idiot that's running country that's destroying it and using us like pawns. So we got to make changes .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 There's Nay Aug Park. We could have done a (inaudible ) test and found out where the leak was instead of making it a mud pond. It happened on Gaughan 's watch. We had so many different things that happened here. And there's a federal lawsuit . And I'm going say something real quick about it. The reason I have it and it's a First Amendment right and it applies to everybody here. What we say we're governed. What you say is governed by the Rules of Council . Bill Gaughan violated them. And he did it and it was here in defense of Jessica thinking that I had something -- here, I just want to make it very clear. Nothing I said during that time was outside of my First Amendment protections . It was never a hate speech or any kind prohibit ive speech. My comment s to Jessica were taken out of context by Gaughan so that he could further his political ambition. I don't feel -- liberals don't like civil disclosures and they tried to twist this agreement and different ideologies into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 personal attacks. What I said in no way was intended as an insult to Jessica or anyone else. I have that right to speak out just like we're speaking out here. Gaughan saw an opportunity . That's why he's in a federal lawsuit with me for violating the Rules of Council that you implore and imply that protect us as you were protect ed from us to you making statements . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. MR. BOLUS: So what I want you to do is, the Mayor is here. And, Mayor, I would like if you would find out who the individual was that said these people cannot have the disinfectant wipes out of that trailer . They're free. They're from myself and the rest of my fellow masons that we're doing this as a charitable to this community to find out who it was and fire them and open that trailer up and give these people these disinfectant wipes to clear up any of the bacteria , the germs instead of them spending out of pocket -- MR. KING: Sorry, Mr. Bolus, your time is up.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MR. BOLUS: Thank you, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. Alex Lotorto . MR. LOTORTO : Hello, my name is Alex Lotorto . I've been communicating with you some time via e-mail regarding some stormwater issues on the 3000 block of Lafayette Street which has not been shown to me to not be a public street. I did some forensic investigation backfilling the washout again for two years. I have been maintain ing that section of Lafayette Street where it meets Newton Road. It's just contributing to the stormwater issues because I use 2A gravel which it's stone dust and 2 inch gravel to compact by hand with a hand damper that section of the street. And it washes out. And I could see when it washes out the municipal pave jobs, like, archeology , a subsurface , another pave job, another pave job, another pave job where the city had previously paved the road and had accepted it as a city street. My 90-year-old neighbor Joe Smith -- I won't speak for him, but he's in 239 Newton Road. If you would like to speak to him he's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 home all the time. He remembers -- his oral history that there was a lawn sign -- I'm sorry, a street sign and a salt box that was maintain ed by the city. The street sign fell over when a PennDOT plow hit it. He has it in his garage. I should have brought it today. But -- and I know in 1958 there was a vacating of Lafayette Street where the turnpike is above me. But my section of street was never vacated by the city. And I feel that after thousands and thousands of dollars and hard sweat and back pain and maintain ing that section of street and the stone washing into the stormwater system below me, it ought to be maintained by the city. I'd ask you to pave it. This weekend I put 6 tons by hand of 4 inch stone into the washout to try to maintain it. And I hope that that -- that is a ballast for the water that will be coming off West Mountain . The water coming off West Mountain is contributing -- is contribut ed by the turnpike . You have not just the agencies that were discuss ed earlier , you have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Turnpike Commission and PennDOT that could pony up some money to help us. PennDOT maintains Newton Road. There is a surface drainage of Newton Road. The drain boxes are a joke on Newton Road. You could see the church on the corner. They washed out. They need to reassess the diameter of pipe and the number of drain boxes going all the way up Newton Road towards Fawnwood. I think that that would alleviate a lot of what's happening coming down into the valley. I also think where the rock slide is right next to me on Newton Road, that's turnpike outflow. That's surface water for probably a mile, a mile and a half of the turnpike drains into this outflow and down the mountain where the rock slide was. And I think it connects to that vacated 24 inch pipe. I'm not an engineer . But the Turnpike Commission should be in charge of maintaining their own stormwater . And I think it could be redirected . There's a 30 acre parcel. I love the guy who bought it. He made some nice four wheel trails in there that I enjoy where the turnpike 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 outflow is. But maybe a basin like on Frink Street could be install ed there to slow the water -- slow the water down and hold it and let it trickle out of a retention basin. The last thing and my other hat I'm a union represent ative for the Geisinger RNs and Allied professionals . Our effort to install security cameras at Nay Aug has kind of stalled with the IT Department . The Geisinger employees in Danville had a tragedy where a woman was -- there was a homicide by her ex-boyfriend . And our -- predominantly younger women who park in the back of Nay Aug lot walk out in the dark. They walk out not knowing who will be standing there. And there is no cameras or security footage to monitor that lot. I would propose that Geisinger pay for those cameras and Geisinger pay for the pool if they want anything else in the Hill Section . They're -- if you look at their last bond statement if you do approach them, in December it was 13.87 billion dollars of liquid cash and assets is what they have on hand which is why Kaiser 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Permanente is buying them. They're so profitable a company , from 2000 miles away is buying up the hospital system. So as far as maintenance of the Hill Section , the security cameras and the Nay Aug pool, take a look the what Geisinger has to offer. If they need a favor from you on zoning or anything like that -- you can't make it transactional , but a community benefits agreement what I think is called for on that side of the city. But please help me pave Lafayette Street. I'm going to put the sign out that I ordered to replace it. And you'll see me with the sign on Newton Road until it gets fixed. I'm going to put it out on a sandwich board tomorrow . So please help me. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Lotorto . Mr. Voldenberg , I know that we've been back and forth with the city on that issue. Can we try to get some answers for Mr. Lotorto on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yeah, I'll follow up with them again tomorrow . MR. KING: Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , do we know if that piece of the street has been vacated ? I did follow an e-mail chain going back and forth. And it seemed like -- MR. VOLDENBERG : No record of vacation on that block. MR. SCHUSTER : Say that one more time. MR. VOLDENBERG : No record. No vacation . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. KING: Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hi. People have to pay attention to the details of how things are. It seems like everything is -- cross the board is just waiting for the crisis to act. Now, we got all of these lantern flies. And, you know, I have been trying to kill them to save -- and as many other people have here. If you run up to them and then they fly and you just have to put your mind into the mind of the lantern fly. They use their -- you're going to get them and you stamp and they fly about 3, 4, 7 feet. They're thinking about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 flying when they fly. Yesterday , in a half an hour, I killed 100 lantern flies right on the side of the Times-Tribune court building on Biden Street. How did I do it? I put my mind into the mind of a lantern fly. They can't be that smart. They're jumping and they're flying. The way I get them, when they jump and they land, you stamp on them within one second of when they land. And I think paying attention to details is what the problem is across the board. And everything that I see here, there has to be a record when people do stuff. And I'm talking about -- well, I'm talking about, you know, my eviction s, my many evictions . And I'm finding out all of these people are district attorneys . And what is a district attorney the head of Scranton Housing Authority and the prosecutor is Scranton Housing Authority . I mean, they're lawyers , but they're district attorneys . But in my paying attention to the details in what's happened in the overall picture that -- there's an influx that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 noticed during, you know, the whole George Floyd thing and everything where outside sources were funding district attorneys getting district attorneys on school boards. And these -- you know, you're scared of district attorneys . They are like powerful people. They're indicting President Trump in New York. I've had much correspondence with Letitia James, the attorney general . And I have been in front of -- I litigated in front of at least 50 judges in New York. And it's a fixed system. You know, family courts are a lawless courts everywhere . They are lawless here. We saw what happened with Ciavarella and, you know, making his money, putting them in prison. I went through 15 years in the family courts, did a lot of court watching , did a lot of organizing to understand how this is working . And this is coming from the top down. And the funding for the lawyers that do the work, well, they start funding the lawyer for your child, attorney for the child, 65.6 million dollars a year in to Kings County attorney for the child. This is how it works 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 because people are scared of the law. They're scared of being evicted . And that's all they do in my building , you know, don't do this. You're going to be evicted . We don't need permission to come through your door, you know, and it's clearly against the record. But no one has the record. There is zero record of the eviction cases between SHA and Judge Farrell , the magistrate court judge. I've been down there. There's nothing . There's nothing . There's no record. So I can't talk about things intelligently . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Tom Durdan. MR. DURDAN: Thank you. Can you guys hear me? First off, I want to thank you guys for giving us the opportunity to be able to come down here and express some of our concern with some of the issues that have been going on inside the community here. And I do want to apologize to the Mayor. I know sometimes you get caught in some very bad situation s that was before your time just like the Council here. I graduated . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 I spent my entire life -- I'm 38 years old. Mr. King, you were the principal there when I went to West Scranton High School. I graduated in '04. My wife sits in the back row. We met at the high school. We've been involve d in this community our whole lives. We had a chance to go somewhere else. We had a chance to pick up and move. We wanted to instill our family here. We walked into Keyser Valley eight years ago. I have a three-year-old ball of energy who is 11 now. His name is Tyler. They welcomed us with open arms. Anytime they ever needed anything or we needed anything , we could rely on each other. And I saw that during the flood. I saw neighbors come out into the streets getting carried down by water to try to help somebody else. My neighbor and myself went in there with water up to our shoulder s looking to see if there was somebody inside the vehicle . When disaster hits, people come together . And unfortunately it took some kind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 of disaster like this for the Keyser Valley to stand up. I stood in silence and I watched as flood after flood after flood took over the city -- the street, I should say, continually not worried about it because it didn't affect me. I didn't worry about it because my house was safe. Now, I'm not safe anymore. I had to tell my kid about the idea that people have to sell their houses because FEMA is going to come. I had to tell that to him while we drove to school, while we wiped away tears in both of our eyes. He wants to live in the city. He wants to grow up and be an Invader . And I don't want to take that away from him. And I don't want you guys to take that away from him. But what we need and my community needs is somebody who is going to be responsibile . We need a Council that is going to stand up and say this is the last time we're going to have someone come up and speak like this. We're need a Mayor that is going to work with the Council . And I know you're working on it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 But I can't have it for the next 10, 15 years. We can't worry about hitting 23 million dollars for FEMA. I can't watch the ball get punted anymore. We need answers. And if it's a 24 inch pipe that's going to inconvenience one family so that these people don't have to be inconvenienced anymore, then open it. If it was something that was done before with a backdoor deal that was shaking hands with the company from water and a mayor from before or a city council before, we don't care about that. We want accountability . We want to know who is going to be in charge of this. We want somebody that's going to be a point of contact . And we want to be included in it because this is not just about me. It's not just about these people. It's about the 11-year-old boy that's sitting in the back. It's about the other people with their grandchildren and their families that are misplace d. Like, I don't want to show too much emotion . And I'm sorry, but when you see your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 neighbor getting dragged out of their house crying and trying to grab onto every little thing that they can because there's a boat; and if they don't take this boat, they're not going to get help again, you start to understand what serious issues are in this city and in this world. My one neighbor who's not here right now was in fishing pants waiting for the water to go down so that he could go into his house to get his daily medication s. I mean, I watched and I've seen and I just -- it's unbelievable that anybody could allow other people to just sit there and just have to deal with it on a daily basis. I apologize for being silent in a moment when I should have used my voice and I'm sorry that it took this moment to have to use my voice. But I ask you guys not to sit silently and just watch because just as you see these people that are here, more people are affected . And we're lucky not one person was harmed in this situation . But one life is too many lives. And if we don't fix it, that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 what's going to happen. And if that's what it takes to make this situation get resolved then maybe we did get the wrong Council to be here to represent us. And I hope that's not the case. And I know that you guys care about the city. So please get a committee , get somebody involve d. Get a point of contact so we could start getting answers. We could go to somebody and we could say, hey, what about this or what about that or what about a meeting ? We want to be involved . But if you shut us out, we can't do anything . I want to thank you for your time. I want to thank you for your concern s. And, Mayor Cognetti , I want to thank you for sitting in and listening to this as well. We thank you for all the time and all the stuff that you have done but we need more. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Durdan. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Try to do everything you can to expedite for these people. Apparent ly they bought their houses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 years ago. And now somebody 's developed . We have an electrical , a relay station and all kinds of stuff where trees were stripped out. When I was young I was lucky enough to grow up in a region -- in the coal region in Central Pennsylvania . And guess what, we had a moat around the entire town so we didn't have to worry about such things. There was literally a moat of abandon ed mine working . Okay, last week I mentioned about the pension plan and certain losses. And it came to my attention that pension plans invest in a basket of stocks. And sometimes it's the -- MR. KING: Excuse me, can we move the conversation in the hallway ? Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : It's the system that this basket of stocks and my question is, are solid stocks and investments raising money that volatile stocks are crashing and burning and then they're being subsidized and more or less covered over by the gains in other stocks. So it may even require changes in the American stock market and the way pensions are invested in. And with the swim pools, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 repair first, if possible . There are -- I have mention ed before they inject grout into the Hoover Dam and it works. So it holds back all that miles of water. So hopefully we could find a more affordable way to deal with things in the future. And utility bills, now, I came up with a different term for PUC, Perfectly Useless Corporatist . We should have a class action suit against PA American Water. I mean, they just facilitated a fraud against us. It's unconscionable that your water bill should be $900 a year more just because of some agency in Harrisburg won't allow it to be priced accordingly . You know, we had 25 years to deal with the different water issues with the river and waste water and so forth. And once we got the 25 years, it seemed like everyone was interested , all the corporations they swoop in, oh, we could take care of that for you. Yeah, they're taking care of it for us. Who knows. You know, they are taking real good care of it for us. And by the way, the electric bill 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 even though I see less on the graph, that's up. Again, so it's just a point of concern . People only have so much money. And it hurts even more if you are working for it. And finally , I'm not a big fan of the streetscape deal. You know I just realized today on Wyoming Avenue within the next three blocks, most of the buildings on -- from 1 to 300 on Wyoming Avenue are tax exempt. We have cathedrals . We have churches . We have the county building . There is several other building s that are probably tax exempt. And they are paying nothing and here we go. You know, I expect my wife to survive me. That's where my issue is too. I wouldn't want to see her lose the house due to high taxation . It's just something to worry about. I might make it a couple years and maybe I won't and I'm not looking for pity either because I'm 69 now. And I've been through a lot. But, you know, it's just make sure the right people are paying taxes. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. KING: Greg Popil. MR. POPIL: Thank you, Council members . Am I allowed to approach to show you guys a photograph ? MR. KING: Sure. MR. POPIL: Those photos were taken by me in August of 2018. There was a flood there. It was heavy rain. And the entire Keyser Valley, the lower part of Keyser Valley was ]flooded . The rain was not as hard or significant as it was on September 9th. But nonetheless , resident s had to leave their homes, many of the same ones, the Camerottas , the Douglasses , had to evacuate and the pump house did nothing . It was not turned on. I'm not an engineer . I don't know why. I don't know what happened . But I do know that the warning signs were there. West mountain has been increasingly more and more developed , more and more trees are being removed . That means that there's less woods to catch the rain water. And it's coming down to us, that whole area. I'm on Cameron Avenue. So I'm about a block up. I was lucky. I only got a foot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 water in my basement , only. But that whole area is basically the bottom of a hole. And the other side of that hole is, you know, 10 feet up is built up for the football field. I love the football field and my daughter is a cheerleader over there. So we all -- you know, everybody in the neighborhood loves that. But it's basically a giant wall between Keyser Valley and Keyser creek. And some other people here said that that 24 inch line on Briggs Street getting that hooked back up would do a lot to alleviate that. But the fact of the matter is, the warning signs have been there. This is not the first significant flood that we've had even just the last half decade. So again, not an engineer , I'm just here to add my voice to the many, many voices that had more informed things to say just to say that something needs to be done or that whole area is going to be abandoned . People are just going to leave their homes. And one of the, frankly , nicest residential areas I think in the whole city is going to just become an absolutely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 underdeveloped abandoned area. I work for county dispatch . So, you know, I kind of got my eye in the sky this whole response . I also want to add my voice to the people who said thank you to the police officer s, firefighters , and DPW workers who worked tirelessly in our neighborhood to help get that cleaned out. But again, the problem is not -- you know, from the bottom up. The problem is from the top down. We need assistance . And we need it badly to alleviate these flooding problems . That's all I have to say. I yield the rest of my time. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Popil. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I wasn't going to talk about this. But I will talk about the water issue right now just for a brief second. It was said we don't know what to do about the pump house. It gets flooded . Electricity gets cut off for it. We need engineers to figure out a plan on how to fix that. Well, it's been put forward here, elevate the pump house in the first place. The pumps that go in the ground 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 to pump the water out, they're waterproof. They're water sealed. It's just a matter of running power lines to them and running the piping section up and having pumps that can move that capacity of water uphill a certain number of feet. We've had submarines for how long? They go underwater . Believe it or not they don't flood. It's possible to make a structure in water that does not flood. Surprisingly enough electric cables, we've had transatlantic cables running from here to Europe under saltwater. It seems they're operational and have been operational . But we can't figure out how to keep electricity to a building . And we put electric boxes at flood level below the ground level rather than the top of the building ? I don't quite understand it. What I also don't understand is when I was in high school or even as a kid you take a glass, you fill it up with water and you turn it upside down in the sink and you pump air in there; and what happened ? When air got pumped into that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 structure it displaced the water. So one of the ways to stop flooding when water is coming up into a pump house is to create negative pressure in there by pumping air into the structure and air forces the water out of the bottom no matter how high that water gets as long as you have an air pump pushing air into the bottom of that structure , the air will rise up and push the water out. I'm sorry if you could have a four year old do that in a kitchen sink and that's too much of a concept of how to keep a pump house running , but that shouldn 't need to take an engineering student to figure that out. Onto my other subjects , it's been stated many times the Mayor has sent out letters to non-profits , pilots who have not donated to the city. We've asked if this body can provide a list of those who were mailed and if any response were returned. Two weeks ago that was asked here. And I went back and the last time I asked it before this body was promised a response as it was forward ed to Mr. Voldenberg from the Chair was 100 days ago. So right now you have about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 114 days that we're still waiting on that response . Do we have a response yet? MR. KING: I don't believe so. Did we hear anything , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, Mr. King. MR. KING: Okay. Well, let's make that a priority and see if we could get that list of all the non-profits that letters were sent out to asking them for, you know, donations to the city in lieu of taxes. MR. COYNE: See in Eighth Order the question on reporting overtime . It was suddenly put in an executive session and has been stated we'll get back to it because there was question s that needed to be answered in a meeting . It was introduced June 6th of 2023. It's been 120 days since that has been put on a side table on the back burner. How long until we get an answer or should we expect for it to sit and die on the legislative table at the end of the year? Open burn was on June 13th. And the reason for -- that was the reason for the executive session held. Now that that's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 resolved and the case has been resolved , can you bring us onto speed on the agreement and settlement since that case is complete and no longer executive material ? The people should know the financial cost for that deal. Last week after the Police Chief was here and opened up for question in Fifth Order Mr. King noted they had a bunch of question s to be answered by the Chief and should have him respond -- have him respond . The Chief was here. I don't know why they weren't asked during that meeting while he was right here before the body. And last in closing , people out there in Scranton, why watch over the next month or so. Elections are coming up. Watch your political body on how they operate or don't operate . Bring that knowledge , judge them; and go to the polling booths based upon what they do or don't do for their community . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Had a pool meeting with the city and the engineer s for Nay Aug complex . Mr. Gattens wasn't able to attend. So I'm going to go up to the Rec Authority meeting on Thursday to go over some stuff with them. And all my other requests I have forwarded already to Mr. Voldenberg . So that is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I'm first going to start by saying I was happy that the resident s of Keyser Valley came out to speak their mind tonight . It's been something I always recommend city resident s to do is to come out and speak on public comment . I'm willing to hear anything you want to say, whether I agree with it, whether I don't. I sit here and I listen to it all. And I have been doing that for years. So I'm very happy that they came out to speak their mind. So let's see, Mr. Voldenberg , last week I asked a few question s. And I didn't see any response s as of yet. I don't know if we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 received any e-mails today. I didn't have a chance to check my e-mail. But the University of Scranton rental properties in accordance with the rental ordinance , did we get any response from the city administration on that one? MR. VOLDENBERG : I don't believe so. We did receive an e-mail -- a lengthy e-mail this afternoon at 5:39. But we were already in caucus. So I'll review that and get back to you tomorrow . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. I also asked a question about the complete streets project . It was the first time I heard this terminology . And I don't -- my question last week was is the administration adopting a complete streets policy in Scranton . Did we receive a response on that one? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of today. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. You know, I asked -- on our capital budget we have a couple different projects that are going on downtown that are coming out of the walkability study. And in that capital budget it had to be determined cost on it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 When I asked some of the questions about the Wyoming Avenue piece in the grant that we just applied for, it came back to me that this was something that we were going to do grant by grant. So we really didn't have a plan moving forward . We were just going to do it grant by grant. And that is why I asked about the complete streets if this is something that we're going to do with each and every one of these project s. But just to keep in mind and when I look at the capital budget and voting on it later tonight , it's going to be something that I keep in my mind is that to be determined cost. We asked about the vouchers for Weston Field several times. And I don't think we -- did we ever get a response on the voucher s for Weston Field? MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe that's in that lengthy e-mail from this afternoon . I'll report back to you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. In the lengthy e-mail we got I guess at 5-something as we were all en route to Council Chambers I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 guess we received an e-mail. We asked about it for several weeks. And then it wasn't until I think last Wednesday that there was a news piece on the news about the Keystone Mission thanking the City of Scranton administration for the vouchers . So I really don't -- other than that news piece, that was all I really heard on the voucher s and was surprised to see it on the news rather than the question s we had been asking for quite some time. Another question I'm going make of you, Frank, is I did get a list of city vehicle s. There was a response that came with that that they cannot give employees address es, vehicle numbers , things of this sort. Can we also get a list of -- I don't need any identifying information , but can we get a list of city employee s that are given a vehicle , those people that have been assigned vehicles , can we get a list of those employees names? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. We got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 some correspondence about the Scranton Recreational Authority . They've appoint ed a director there. Some questions came over from -- I had some questions on it regarding benefit s from the city and if the authority had the power to do such. I didn't get a response on that. But I did see some correspondence coming back and forth between the city and Controller Murray. And some of the concern s that he had were also concerns that I had. The person who was hired as director isn't a resident of the city. And I think we were told -- I think the answer was that they didn't have to be a resident of the city as they weren't an employee of the city. So I'll be waiting on that answer if we could reach out with some of those question s that he had that they would parallel my questions . It looks like our benefits are going to be paid by the city. And we're using ARPA as startup, and then we're going to be reimbursed . So if we could get -- MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, if we could get some clarification on the response s that he got and that we got and how this position is going to be funded moving forward . MR. VOLDENBERG : Yeah, I'll follow up with Controller Murray and administration . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. That's it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. I have a few things, but I first wanted to start by thanking the people that came tonight from the Keyser Valley and those who suffered damage from the storm last month. It's, you know, it's clearly very devastating for many of these people and their properties to have had that damage and for something that has happened in the past with flooding in the Keyser Valley being known for having those issues. And I know that this Council as well as previous Council s I think when Council man Gaughan was on here he also worked very hard on trying to address the Keyser Valley stormwater issues. And I know that it's unfortunate that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 more hadn't been done up until this point. It is a high priority for the city that we need to fix the issues that are there. But I don't think it's a simple as just, you know, fixing one pipe. I think it's a combination of issues that lead to that water flow being so devastating when it does flood like that when there are heavy rain storms. So I want to make sure that this Council continue s to do what we can. I know we've had votes on this in the past and on, you know, the design and study and I hope that we -- that that gets completed as soon as possible so that work can begin on this issue and hopefully prevent future damage for people. I know that it's not coming soon enough. And that's really unfortunate . But we're going to continue to be here for those people and to do whatever we can on Council to make that happen. And a couple of notes, there was a question about the mosquitos in that one section in particular and the county is address ing that. So they were down there today. They set up traps. And they're going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 to be back tomorrow to then spray. And with regards to Briggs Street that -- I just want to clarify , that is being address ed within the GPI design which, you know, can't come soon enough. And there was another matter that I wanted to address that was brought to my attention . There's a -- separate from the flooding issue, there's a property in the Hill Section , 723 Wheeler Avenue. And there had been a number of concerns with this property over time. And I think the neighbors are getting to their last straw with a number of them. So there's some garbage issues. There's mattresses constantly being placed on, like, the side of the house. They think it could be a possible boarding house or temporary housing for people. And then there was an incident last week. I'm not really going to go into it but it was disturbing I think for a number of the neighbors . So if we could get code enforcement down there. I know the SPD has been down there previously for parking issues. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 I'm not sure if there have been other nuisance calls or complaints . But if we could take a look into this property and then see what we can do to address the problems . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And lastly, there was a conversation that I had with someone earlier today, very helpful conversation . And it's someone who uses the handicap placard for their vehicle and is disabled . And there seems to be a number of issues for people who are in that situation who are disabled . And I know that I've taken the time to address them here on Council in the past. But what I want to see if we could do forward at least with regards to parking for people within the city is if we could have a review of our ordinance because I'm sure it hasn't been updated in quite some. I want to see if there is any changes that could be made to make it easier for people with what that handicap ped placard to be able to park within the city, especially 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 if they have -- if they're paying for it outside of their homes. There's a couple concerns there and also to make sure that it's as enforceable as it could be so that the SPD can give tickets where needed when someone is parking in those spots who shouldn 't be. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, and that question is also geared towards Solicitor Gallagher if you could help in review of that ordinance . MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll pull the ordinance and reach out to the Law Department and SPD tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple. So as a resident of Scranton that hails from West Side, I was thrilled to see Keyser Valley come out. Guess what, they've had enough and I agree. And me and the Mayor or the Mayor and I could disagree or agree to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 disagree about the pump house. It's failed. It doesn't work. And it didn't work two weeks ago -- three weeks ago. But a common thread that I've heard from resident s up there -- and it's not just the past week. I've heard this every time it rains which is an issue with that pipe -- or that main. Guess what, I'm here almost four years. Sometimes the answers we need or the best ideas come from the resident s, especial ly them that are the most affected . So if this 24 inch pipe that used to go into 15 or 15 into 24, I'm not a plumber . But I've heard it from multiple people. If that's an issue like we said earlier , we need someone to take a look at that. And I'm told, okay, they've always had issues with water. But ever since the changing or the unhooking of that pipe 24 to 15 or the 15 and no longer 24, like I said, I'm not a plumber . But they seem to know this. They seem to know that ever since that was either messed with or disconnect ed or whatever word 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 you want to use, it's made the issue worse. So I believe them. So we need to look into that. MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll make it a priority , sir. MR. MCANDREW : And I know there's a big project coming in the planing stages and construction , but we can't wait. We can't wait. This is going to happen again. And then I'm going to be sitting here. How am I suppose d to respond to that if we don't do anything ? So please send that over. Now Mr. Raines was sitting here with his concern . Guess what, it's not his third, fourth, or fifth time. It's his umpteen th time he's come to us with that complaint . And we were assured last year, let alone this year before recess that, you know, we'll take care of it. DPW said, you know, Mr. Pietreface said he'll take care of it. And this issue predates the discussion of whether it was going to be paved this year or on the list or off the list because the water company is suppose d to pave it. That shouldn 't be any part of the conversation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 This gentleman was promised some type of resolve in front of his house. The poor guy is handicapped . He can't even get in and out with his van. And the issue -- his needs are small. And the issue is easily resolved , filling a couple holes or removing some of the stuff that's inhibiting him from using his driveway in the summer or winter. For the love of God, please let's have this fixed for him. Please follow up with that. I know you have. This is as many times I issued this concern to you, you sent it over. But this is another issue where it's enough. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And the Scranton Redevelopment Authority move that just recently happened raises an eyebrow . This was a position that hasn't been filled in years. All of a sudden it's being filled because they lost some traction with the Scranton Housing Authority with appointments or hires. So it raises my eyebrow especially that we're suppose d to fund it and get reimburse d. That's absurd and not consider this person making I think it's 90 -- is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 90,000 -- going to make $90,000. There's no way to fund it. So we're going to fund it and down the road the Redevelopment Authority is going reimburse us. And, okay, technically it's not an employee . But guess what, we're going to provide benefit s. So this employee is going to fall under the city benefits plan. Does the insurance company know that? Are they aware of that? I don't think so. I don't like it. We posed question s. We didn't get them back. And we want these answers . We want it clearly defined, explanations about how, where, how they're hired, why they're hired, who's paying, why are we being reimburse d? This process has never happened before that I'm aware of. If it has, I need to see evidence of it. I just think this is some quick move that I don't like. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I too would like to thank all the resident s that came out here from the Keyser Valley today. I know many of us here on Council visited a lot of those areas that were affected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 and devastated , quite frankly . But when you see the throngs of people that came in here tonight and it gets awfully real when you see the pain and the suffering that they've had to endure for far too long. So I'm truly hoping that we could get some of these things resolved sooner rather than later. And we do have, you know, studies have been done, the Keyser Valley study has been done and East Mountain . I was told today that the work on East Mountain for storm remediation is going to begin in 2024. I believe the same is true with the Keyser Valley. So I hope that we could get these issues resolved sooner rather than later. I have some responses for Fifth Order from last week. Council received a request from a resident of West Elm Street and we forward ed it to DPW for street signs for the intersection of South Main and West Elm Street. Council sent a request to code enforce ment requesting revisited property at 1602 South Webster for quality of life issues. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 Neighbors advised the owners do clean the property after code enforcement notice but revert right back to the same issues in September . Council receive d a complaint from a resident of Connell Street regarding a boat and trailer parked on the street for an extended period at 1632 Connell Street. Scranton Police patrol will investigate and advise. Scranton Police Department ticketed numerous vehicle s on a lot -- on the lot at 819 Pittston Avenue and businesses next door in September for parking on the sidewalk. Code enforce ment will also be reviewing the entire block for qualify of life violations . We forwarded a resident 's concern to the Scranton School District regarding the Scranton School District owned overgrown lot at South Hyde Park Avenue. Virgil Argenta , Council President Bill King asked the Law Department of OECD if the Council could have an update on condemned properties as listed below when the building s may be scheduled for demolition and awaiting a response . Those properties are 1502-1504 West 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 Gibson, 1614 North Lincoln Avenue, the rear of 1111 Blair Avenue, Harrington Place and the rear of 345 Phelps Street. That is the rear of Scranton Prep parking lot. Also, the code enforcement team was asked to visit the court in the rear of 1518 Jackson Street near the Family Dollar store. Property in the court contains quality of life issues that include overgrown trees, brush in addition to trash on the property . Council asked administration to provide an update on the Weston Field pool house repairs. We also asked the administration to provide an update on the public safety building Serrenti Center. The June 23rd update provided to Council stated we're current ly completing ARPA funded HVAC project at Serrenti . It should be completed later this summer. Well, it's fall now. $125,000 is for the construction of class room and evidence room. We current ly working through some grant funding logistics and will begin construction after that. Victoria Fultia(phonetic ) Council requested September 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 27th that our DPW review and update the turning lane and crosswalk markings at the intersection of South Washington Avenue and Hickory Street. Marie Schumacher , I believe Marie was here for the last meeting , but Council sent a request to the administration for the listing of pilot payments to date in addition to the date correspondence were mailed to not for profit entities . Administration respond ed by stating they are compiling the information , will forward the information to Council . Council asked schedule to East Mountain stormwater project . Administration responded the East Mountain stormwater update, there's going to be an update at October 25th at the Howard Gardner School. And also, sent a request to DPW management to revisit repairs at the lookout on Route 307. DPW has placed that on their work list and will be addressed . Earlier this evening an individual made some comments attacking me for whatever . All I could tell you is that I'll take my record of community service . I'll take my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 record as the former Superintendent of the Scranton School District having, you know, been involved in building three brand new schools, including Whittier , in addition Lincoln Jackson and renovating the other half of Lincoln Jackson , building a new Isaac Tripp Elementary School, putting five roofs on various building s in the district . Seventeen out of 18 of our schools met adequate yearly progress in the years '11, '12. We started a number of curricular program s that were beneficial and we had three and four-year-old preschool at the time and budget was balanced when I was there. So I'll match all of the contributions I've made to the city including what's happening this weekend with the Steamtown Marathon which I started over 26 years ago and has raised 2.3 million dollars for St. Joseph's Center and has benefitted Scranton well over the tune of 20 million dollars over that time with money coming in from outside of the city. So I'll match my record over that gentleman 's record any day of the week. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, Mr. Voldenberg . President King, can I just add two things to our request for Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. KING: Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : We talked about that 24 inch pipe. Can we also add to that request about the pipe if the city has ever checked the reservoirs above Newton Road? I did bring the Mayor and her flood control group up there I'd say probably three to four years ago to take a look at those reservoir s if the city's ever checked those reservoirs and then if they've ever reached out to the Turnpike Commission . And then for our SRA request if we could also request a resume of the person that was appointed Director of the SRA. MR. VOLDENBERG : I was advised that the resume is forthcoming , but I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm happy to see that some of this ARPA money is going towards the affected residents in North Scranton and Keyser Valley. Since I got on this Council , I've been talking about stormwater in West Mountain . I've been mentioning it for years. Like I said, I took the Mayor and the flood team up there to go from the turnpike all the way down to the pump house. I pointed out many problem s. And I think that was on my second 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 week while I was on Council . I took this team right to the area where the rock slide came across Newton Road. So this project can't come fast enough. It's been many years in the making. The one piece I would like to -- I pointed it out while we were in caucus. There's been a project going on at Keyser Valley Community Center for many years. They've had a grant there. I think they needed some money to get them over the top to finish their parking lot to get the stormwater moving around that facility . It is a city-owned property . And I think it's an integral part of that neighborhood and moving water through that neighborhood to it's proper places in the flood control channels below. Like I said, I brought it up in caucus tonight . And I hope it doesn't go unnoticed. And I hope the Mayor does reach out to Keyser Valley Community Center to find out what the Neighborhood Association there needs to put this project over the top. MR. KING: All those in favor of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
