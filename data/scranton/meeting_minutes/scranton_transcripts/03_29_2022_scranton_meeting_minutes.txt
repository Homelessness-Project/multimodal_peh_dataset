CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I want to wish a happy Vietnam Veteran 's Vet Day. It was on the radio 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 this afternoon that they are recognizing all veterans of the Vietnam War so I salute you. Also, I noticed that the 2020 audit is on the City's website when you go to City archives financial reports and audits. It's there for anybody who would care to review it. Do we have an update on the status of union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : They are still under negotiations . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, I'm sure they're working very hard. Do you realize 25 percent of this year is gone? Okay. And I am waiting eagerly to see the database restored on real estate taxes and refuse fees. That will be very helpful . With regard to 5-B, the insurance contract with Knowles , what is the cost of that contract ? MR. DONAHUE : Let me pull it up and I'll address it. MS. HODOWANITZ : I looked at it. In the backup I couldn't find a cost listed. That's very curious that with an emergency certificate , the one key item the money is not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 listed. And did anybody go through the backup on that and notice that too? You're going to approve this and not know what it's going to cost and write a blank check. MR. DONAHUE : I thought I saw it somewhere . I thought I saw it somewhere , but let me double-check and see where. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I have it printed out if you would like to see it. Also, there's a mention by the contractor , the $250 contribution to Paige Cognetti ? When did that occur? There was no date listed and does that pose any kind of issue with the Ethics Code? MR. DONAHUE : I think that would be a question for the Ethics Board. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. But that is something you should pursue if you decide to pass this this evening that -- you should have caught that as you're reviewing the backup. I was pleased to see that the overtime is getting back into line. Well, LIPS does have a 94 percent usage rate of their budget, the overall -- the overtime budget is at 29 percent which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 pretty close to where it should be. And one other thing, I was looking at the resumes of the people being appointed or reappointed to the boards. There was a gentleman by the name of David Phaneuf . And I hope I'm not mispronouncing his name. He's been reappoint ed to the Scranton Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority . He had a most interesting resume. Did anybody read it? Okay, don't raise your hands all at once now. The first line really caught my attention . It says and I quote, authorized to work in the U.S. for any employer . Now, I'm not quite sure what he's getting at there. So am I and so are all of you and so are all of you. I don't know what that means. Education , BS in business , Lackawanna College , Scranton , September , 1965 to June, 1967. Now 1967 was a very good year. I remember it well. I also remember that in 1967 there was no Lackawanna College . There was a Lackawanna Jr. College , which only gave out associate degrees , no four year degrees . First 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 bachelor 's degree was awarded in 2017. Now, let's assume that this is a mere typo. I'm wondering who sent this resume forward . Did they read it because this is embarrass ing to both the administration and to Mr. Phaneuf if this is a typo because there are no two year BS degrees from Lackawanna College in 1967. So this is either an unintentional error or what is somebody trying to pull on the people of Scranton ? This is why I get irritated because you say last week, well, I want to know who dropped the ball on the Knowles contract , how did that sneak up on us or who dropped the ball on the 2022 budget that required 95 amendments . It's called a lack of attention to detail and a lack of supervision . And these things keep coming up constantly . The majority of the employee s are excellent but not this one. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. I didn't come to follow up on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 questions I asked Council the last time I was here. But I'll do that in the future. But the one thing I have here first is that I find Ukraini ans to be remarkably brave considering they still don't have the weapons that they need and that their children are being indiscriminate ly killed. And I just hope America would do more for them and the world. And the thing I'm here for tonight is, you know, I'm watching reassessment take place in other places. And I'm sure that this county wants to pursue that. And I think that not only should the county but the whole government take a very hard look at what's taking place in the world because , you know, we just got talking about, well, 68-plus million dollars being spent of borrowed money. And the world is moving away from the dollar, okay. It's moving towards the Chinese currency . Saudi Arabia is sitting down now and seriously contemplating not taking U.S. dollars for purchases . And as the American dollar gets weaker and weaker, it's going to have some very serious ramifications for the people in this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 country in the amount of debt we're holding . And when you take a look at reassessments , it's time to cut the size not just of government but of social programs . And I mean massive cuts because this country can't carry anymore. And all the seniors , they shouldn 't be moving into high rises because they can't pay their property taxes. And when we come up with a reassessed value for a property , how do we know that property will ever sell for that much money? Is it just an abstract number with no real meaning ? I mean, you know, think about it. If the government tells you your house is worth X amount of dollars and you can't sell it for that, was it ever worth that much? And should people be losing the things that they worked all their life for? For what reason, and at 2.4 percent wage tax on every resident that lives in this City. Look at the bloodbath that the unions in the City have taken over the whole time the City's been here with the pension plans. The City never fund them ever. But yet, the resident s still owe the debt for it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 But the real question to ask here today is, how much did the pensioners lose because if you didn't contribute your 2 million dollars this year, they couldn't return a yield to the plan. You know, we've played a lot of silly games in America for a very long time. We're giving people money not to work. We moved all of our jobs offshore as if that was an answer. And we got people crossing our border because they think they're going to come here and get something for free that there is something here in America for free. It's really time to look around and think, you know, when you talk about spending this money, through the 30 years that this City was in recovery , did it ever cut its budget? Did it ever do anything along that line? Did anybody ever look into the fact that Chris Doherty changed the administrator of the fund from Mellon Bank to another administrator and it lost millions and millions of dollars ? How about the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority ? The Council President himself was against it but yet he voted to put it on the agenda and they did it. And then the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 reserve fund for some reason was pumped into the Authority before the sale. So the City never realized anything from that sale like it should have because the reserve fund was gone. It was like free money. I mean, is the City ever going to get this right? And people ask legitimate questions here every week but they never get a legitimate answer. We've got to cut spending before we leave our children nothing worth having. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . I'd also like to mention Ukraine . And thanks to Mr. Putski over there in Moscow, 250 to 300 million people may see a food shortage next year. That's 250 million people, not thousand . They're unable to plant. The Russians are planting land mines in the farm field. So when you hit a -- when a tractor hits it, if the guy on the tractor isn't killed or the person on the tractor , then the tractor certainly is destroyed . And it's really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 trying. I support getting lots and lots of weapons to them. And it's a shame that Mr. Trump badgered Ukraine for so long because he's part of it. He has that to be proud of. And I'd like to mention voting again. All kinds of schemes are going on. Congress failed to get the Voting Rights Act passed. And it's not going to be pretty. I hope that people aren't standing in line for hours and hours only be to turned away. They cancel voting polls and close them because they're not handicap ped accessible . And what makes handicap ped accessible is an absentee ballot. So get your votes out and let's start seeing a better, a much better way of higher turnout for votes because too often they're almost sad. And I see the insurance -- try to work together and get things straightened out. You know, years ago when I bought my house I didn't have the trash bill. So it kind of ran over, partly my fault. But when I called, the lady couldn't locate my property even though I'm telling her my address , you know.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Okay, so the next year I paid dearly. So I started going down to -- downstairs to the Treasurer 's office. And the first year I paid it. And I asked that I be put on the list or wherever , the computer and, you know, okay. The second year -- well, that's already the fourth year that I was in City Hall to pay it. And they took my name on a padded envelope or something . And I still didn't get a trash bill. So the fifth year, I went and sat and waited for the employee that took my name on the envelope -- the torn envelope . And she said who did this? You did. So finally after embarrassing somebody I guess, I got my name on the trash -- to get a trash bill. And that's the way it's been in the past in City Hall. And you have a lot of things to straighten out. But hopefully they will get straightened out. And we can get along. I mean, I don't mean to be political , but everybody in this is a Democrat . So it's your show, whether it's good or bad. And finally , I'd like to mention I forgot the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 paper on the school scores not increasing with additional funding for the school in Scranton , Pennsylvania . That's a ploy that was back with no child left behind which has been a dead issue for 15 years. They never did anything with it. They never came up with the subsidies for behind student s or anything , and it's a real shame. But it's my property taxes, not the school score. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . As with Joan, I would like to know the cost of the -- MR. DONAHUE : The insurance , it's going to be 1,071,000. It's an increase of 171,000. And that is due to an increase in IT coverage because you know we had the security breach. So it's an increase there. And then also -- MS. SCHUMACHER : How much was that? Did they individual ize it? MR. DONAHUE : They did. But that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 was given as a reason, our increase in our cyber insurance . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. I would like to know what happened between the date of that letter of March 8th and last week as well? Where was it? Why wasn't it brought up? MR. DONAHUE : That was my fault. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. I would like to have you guys as much as you can during these next few days emphasize the participating in the -- take the ARPA budget challenge that's available on the website because it does expire at noon on the 4th. So it would be nice to hear from more people. I don't know. Do we know how many people respond ed to date? MR. DONAHUE : They said tonight about just over a hundred to date. So we're hoping that, you know, their presentation tonight will also garner some participation . And it is at the top of the website . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Yeah, is there a place for household s that do not have the internet to participate ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. DONAHUE : I could check with the administration . But I could, you know, as Joan always likes to point out, there's always the public library . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now, the Single Tax Office has been putting the -- only the current year dollars on the distributions . I found it helpful to see what -- how it was the prior year, that comparison . So I would urge you to ask the Single Tax Office to go back to that form and show last years' because I do think there is value in that. And also, do we need to put -- I notice they've collected some Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax. And do we need a special -- they must be delinquencies . So do we need a special account for that? MR. DONAHUE : No, because we're still able to collect delinquent BP and Merc from past years. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. When we will get a report -- a regular report from Portnoff on what they're collecting ? MR. DONAHUE : We did request one of those. And it's going to be back on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 website . The new City Treasurer is just working through some issues in terms of what they collected . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Also, it would be nice to see a grant page that shows the grant applied for, who the donor will be, and when the grant expires so we can not have them hanging forever . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, we did get one of those about six months ago, I believe . But we will request another one. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I think they should be on a regular basis whatever you guys decide. But it should be something regular . MR. DONAHUE : And you're talking grants that are awarded, correct ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, or when they die because the grant has expired . Four, let's see -- oh, when is the -- what is happening with the acoustics in this room? I thought they were suppose d to happen in February . But I also thought it was February , 2022. MR. DONAHUE : So I have been in contact with -- we're trying to contact the one that put -- the guy that put together the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 proposal for us. We haven't heard back from him. We need the specs. But ECTV has agreed to help us out with putting the specs out there to put a RFQ and an RFP bid because , you know, we're not sound experts. So we don't want to miss any technical aspects of it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now, I know you got the emergency for the insurance was obvious and expedited . But what's happening with the emergency thing for the Wyoming Avenue cleanup? MR. DONAHUE : So that is going through the process . We're waiting on one of the property owners to sign off on the access. Then it has to go down to DEP which will be a quick turnaround and then it will be -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I'll bring the rest next week. MR. DONAHUE : I'll give you an additional 30 seconds if you have anything since I interrupted . MS. SCHUMACHER : No, I just would like to know which of you -- because I have a question on one of the reports from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 assessor 's appeals . Which of you are the attendee to those? MR. DONAHUE : The City Law Office should be sending someone to the assessment appeals. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, you have the ability -- you have the -- this body has the ability to for a spot too. MR. DONAHUE : In terms of what? I'm sorry. MS. SCHUMACHER : The appeals to assessments because there was a humongous one. I didn't bring it to the podium because I know I'd run out of time. But that affects how much we can bring in too. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I don't. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I do not. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. Mr. Voldenberg , did we hear anything back on the Clearview Street situation that I asked you to look into a couple weeks ago? MR. VOLDENBERG : Nothing as of yet, Mr. McAndrew . I'll check tomorrow with the Law Office. MR. MCANDREW : Please. Well, put a little pressure , okay? It's a year and -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : And then also, so last week I had to inquire about the ATV issue where it's starting up again now that the weather is warm. And I asked if we can, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 know, contact the Chief of Police for any new strategy . So I'm happy to report that I met with him yesterday and I had a great conversation with him. And the Chief is putting together -- like we said, we talked about the legislation that was approved last year with regards to it being illegal to drive up to a pump and get gas in the ATV. So that's still enforce d. I think it's a deterrent . But the Chief has -- was thinking outside the box which is pretty cool. He's putting together a strategy utilizing technology . When I say technology , he's still putting this together . He's going to -- eventually when it's all done, he's going to present it -- I'll let him present it better than I because for the most part, you know, we're going to use the cameras that are within the City to identify , track, and then issue citations . Okay, so with that said, I'm thrilled that I had the meeting with him. And when he puts this whole plan together he's going to present it to Council . And that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have something to add? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. Mr. Voldenberg , can we also reach out to the administration . I know there was supposed to be some work coming up on the Meadow Brook culvert. I know we knew there was some blockage s there. I think there was a new contract put together which I heard was signed. But I don't think there's been any movement on it yet. So if we can just get an update on where we are with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Just a couple updates , last week I brought up that the crime statistics were -- on the PD website were last updated on 12/13/2021. Chief Caroll did advise the update is a priority and they're working with IT to implement updated records for the site. Chief Judge will be -- Fire Chief Judge will be in next week to discuss the SAFER 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Grant once again in our caucus. Also, Mr. Voldenberg , I think it was about a year ago maybe over the summer. But we put in a request for or passed on a request for a potential four-way stop sign at the corner of Capouse and Walnut. And I know the police department had put up, you know, the speed detectors where they capture speeds. So would we be able to just follow up with them and see if they have the required data to make a decision based off, you know, what they were able to collect so far? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. We did get an e-mail from a citizen that wanted to acknowledge DPW and what a wonderful job they did on Boulevard Avenue between the Throop city line and Parker Street. The resident was impressed with the working hours that DPW was committed to cleaning up the area. She claims it's a real facelift. And she just wanted to let the DPW and crew know how pleased they are with the effort they put in and that was that. I also got a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 complaint regarding a property in Green Ridge as it relates to drug activity and suspicious people at night. So I'll pass that along to the police department too. And I've also got a complaint regarding sewer covers in the Oakmont section of East Mountain . I guess the crews were out there inspecting the sewers and broke some of the covers. So I did reach out to American Water. I haven't gotten a response yet. But I will follow up on that this week. And that's all I have for tonight . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND KNOWLES INSURANCE LLC TO PROVIDE INSURANCE BROKERAGE SERVICES TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON . (EMERGENCY CERTIFICATE ATTACHED .) MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so, of course, I'm going to vote yes for this because I would never put the City in jeopardy . But I still have concerns about the lack of processes . So last week I did ask -- inquire about why it happened -- what happened , why it happened and who is responsible for this close call with the lapse of coverage . Mr. Voldenberg , please check on that again for me because I did not receive any information . So when this happens , we have to have an emergency certificate . To me, an emergency certificate is an emergency that is out of someone 's hands. That's considered an emergency . So you have to react and I get that. I get that we go right to -- we have to move it right to Seventh Order without a three read rule where we'd have time to discuss the bidders through the three-week process and scrutinize maybe, you know, a document or some backup document s like you referred to earlier . So, of course, I'm voting yes. But I'm still not happy with the lack of the process or, you know, this sense of -- it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 an emergency . It's only an emergency when it's out of people's control . This wasn't out of people's control . This could have been done correct . So, of course, I'll be voting yes. But I had to say my peace. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? I would just like to add I do think it's unacceptable that, you know, it's coming down with an emergency certificate . We can't put the City at risk. But I am hopeful that Item 7-B on our agenda tonight will make sure that this does not happen again because it has a contract management portion of that software that will notify, you know, the proper parties of when a contract is coming up for renewal or is expiring . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second to have item -- to move Item 5-B to Seventh Order. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I made the motion. I'm happy to move it. But I'm not happy the reason why we're moving it. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR.
