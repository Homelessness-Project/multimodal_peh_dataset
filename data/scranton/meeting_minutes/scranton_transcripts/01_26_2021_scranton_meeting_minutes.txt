And they are still waiting for the Gatsby{sic} 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 75 report to finalize the audit. But one of the requests I'd like to send along to administration , Mrs. Reed, if maybe we could send it to the Business Administrator to see if the fact that this year -- that the 2019 audit hasn't been completed yet if that's affecting the work that's starting -- that should be starting for the 2020 audit so that we're not in the same position a year from now. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other comments on Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? Okay. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Jimmy Sotack, Trudy Abda, Craig Beavers , Fay Franus and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : I make the motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments ? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Jimmy Sotack as follows : I appreciate all of the city council members dedication to service in our city. However , I do have a problem with the Oakland /Scranton flag that is apparently being flown outside of city hall. The flag needs to be taken down.City hall is supposed to represent all residents of the city. Not everyone is in favor of the Biden/Harris administration . This is the equivalent of flying the LGBTQ flag full time.It simply has no place speaking for everyone . I look forward to hearing back from you. Respectfully , Jimmy Sotack. . MS. REED: The second submission is from Trudy Abda as follows : Please we need vaccination sites . If we want to help ourselves and get our numbers down and this VIRUS UNDER CONTROL and residents safe, we need vaccinations and vaccination sites. No one can get through1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 anywhere on online lines or if you submit forms you are told there are no appointments being taken die to hug demand and no product . Scranton needs a plan. Please Please get us vaccines and sites we can go to. MS. REED: The third submission is from Mr. Craig Beavers as follows : I fully support the renaming of a city street in honor of President Joe Biden. Being the childhood hometown of a sitting U.S. President is a great honor for Scranton , and we should certainly acknowledge and celebrate this achievement . One potential street that was mentioned was Wyoming Avenue. However , I think a different street should be chosen. As Frederick Hitchcock writes in his "History of Scranton and Its People," this street is a compliment to Lackawanna Avenue. These two roadways are named to reflect our greater geographic and cultural regions , the Lackawanna Valley and the Wyoming Valley. These two avenues are also two of the largest in our city, purposefully symbolic , as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 it is an important reflection of our region. Changing this name, I believe would be a sad loss of a historical nod from our founding Scrantonians and city planners . I think there are other notable roadways that could be good candidates for renaming . Mulberry Street, for instance , is a major roadway in our city, connecting Nay Aug Park, Geisinger hospital , the University of Scranton , Center City, and the North Scranton Expressway . As one of the first streets one enters when coming to Scranton , Mulberry Street, renamed Biden Boulevard perhaps , could still be easily noticed . I hope that both Council and the soon-to-be formed committee will take this into consideration when choosing a street to be renamed after President Biden. MS. REED: The fourth submission is from Fay Franus as follows : I am quoting Kasie Hunt from MSNBC as this applies to all governments : "Our government is only as good as the people who are willing to come here and serve us in it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 And if we create an atmosphere where good people no longer want to be here serving us we are the ones that are going to suffer." So I say to you Scranton City Council members sad to say but you are the ones who do NOT serve the people and yes indeed we are suffering from your actions or lack thereof . Your latest idea reeks of self service surely not public service . You want to name a street with over 10 blocks of residential homes and over 60 businesses on Wyoming Avenue after President Biden. You say you want to honor him. You already named the block he lived on after him, now you want to rename Wyoming Avenue Joseph R Biden OUTRAGEOUS ! Scranton Prep Burne Cadillac Wendys Jack William Tires Scranton Primary Care,Red Top, Smertz tire Enterprise Rental Kelly Mazda are just a few of the over 60 businesses on Wyoming Avenue to say nothing of the homes in Green ridge that would be affected Imagine the enormous undertaking to get this achieved . Perhaps you have come to your senses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 and decided it would not be wise to choose Wyoming Avenue as Joseph R Biden Blvd or any street for that matter. Whatever street you may decide upon keep in mind every business and resident on that street will have to change their letterheads business cards billing brochures to say nothing of contacting every single person they do business with. Residents do business on line they would have to contact their credit card company and all the places they but things from, as well as anyone that writes to them in their family. This would also be a huge expense for everyone involved in changing their address and a massive inconvenience . How is this serving the citizens and businesses of Scranton the very people YOU are suppose to be looking out for? Have you even considered the cost to the taxpayers ? Of course you don't know that yet because you have not formed your committee yet. A committee you are selecting . Which only leads one to believe this is a done deal. The taxpayers will want to know every penny spent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 on this foolish idea of this council . Do you even care about how the people affected by this feel--perhaps Republicans ? Sure there will have to be a public hearing . I have been addressing council at public hearings for over a decade and not once did anything I said or anyone else said during a public hearing mattered to you. It is simply a formality ! Then yiou always do what YOU want not the people. Keep in mind this is an election year. Good luck to any of you on council or any other office up for election who has a hand in naming a street after Joe Biden.I'm sure the citizens will not look kindly on you and others. I have to ask what are the pros for doing this? I can list many many many negatives . Other than honoring Joe Biden and possibly furthering your own political careers what are the great benefits to the city of Scranton that will cost everyone money especially the people and businesses who work and live on the streets you may decide to name after Joe Biden?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 I voted for Joe Biden but I also have to ask what has Joe Biden ever done for Scranton in all his years serving the country ? Nothing that I am aware of. He has only come here when he was running for office to get votes. That's all. You should be concentrating on getting a contract for a collection agency to go after late fees. We have not had a contract in place since January 1st. A month's worth of money already lost to the city for your lack of action on this. Now I believe it has to go back out to bid. How about storm water? Nope you are more interested in taking care of Joe Biden and not the residents who pay your salary. If you can't take care of the residents of Scranton maybe you should seek another profession . We need people to work for us not themselves . MS. REED: And the final and fifth submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O Unless you know something we don't know I don't know what the big rush is to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 "honor" the Chief Executive . As my letter-to-the-Editor published today implies , you don't really care about the people of the City. You want what you want without considering the woe this would impose on the businesses and residents of Wyoming Avenue. Just thinking of notifying all friends of the address change would impose an unwanted cost and this would take much more effort that couldn't be ignored (even the post office will only forward mail for a small amount of time). Also, Mr. Gaughan could have taken the time to call the Historical Society and inquire why Wyoming is used so much in NorthEast Pennsylvania . The Battle of Wyoming Valley is also known as the Wyoming Massacre was, and is and always would be, a part of the Revolutionary War. A major piece of our history and importance to all citizens , not merely the chosen few. The Chief Executive is still living and there is plenty of time to come up with a change other than changing the name of Wyoming Avenue unless you are going to put a new street sign up in the City every month to "honor" him. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Heck, you can even honor someone after they pass away. (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that concludes the CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? On the question , a couple things that I want to say. First of all, you know, Mrs. Franus and Miss Schumacher should pay closer attention to the meetings because last week when I brought this up I stated very clearly in the motion that I made that we would form a committee to discuss and explore the idea. So I don't know how they missed that since they follow these meetings very closely . But I did state that very clearly . As far as the Historical Society and including them, that's why you form a committee . That's why I brought that up last week. So again, you know, I think they should pay a little bit closer attention . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 the letter to the editor today was mostly false what was written in the letter to the editor because I did see that. So that's number one. Number two, Miss Franus said -- had written about the why don't we concentrate on the delinquent refuse collector . Again, should pay closer attention . We did focus on that. We did send it to the administration our changes looking out for the taxpayer s of the City. And we didn't get anything back yet. So the ball is in the court of the Mayor and the administration . And we're looking forward to that legislation and voting on that. Stormwater again, pay closer attention . We had the stormwater management or the stormwater -- the company that was working with the City on stormwater management into a caucus. I think it was about 45 minutes explaining detail by detail on what's going on with stormwater management in the City. Again, the ball is in the court there of the administration and City officials . But I took it upon myself and Council took it upon themselves to make sure that the people were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 informed of those changes and of what's going on with stormwater management . So those are just two points there. As for the other resident who asked about by vaccines , the local governments really don't have any control over vaccine distribution at this point. It's the state and the federal government . So any questions related to that really should be geared towards the State Department of Health or the federal government . Anyone else have anything on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time other than I was happy to see that a lot of citizens had written in and given suggestions about the Wyoming Avenue issue, so happy to see that. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments at this time? You're muted, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : Nothing at this time. Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : No. I think I'm good. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And Council man Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I just want to say briefly I was happy to see that the City's website -- new website was launched this week. It's a lot, a lot, a lot cleaner than the previous one. You know, it's still not finished yet. But it's a start. So I was happy to see that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Donahue . I have a few things that I want to bring up. Number one, as I mentioned during the caucus but just to get it on the record, we do have an opening on the City's Ethics Board. We did get one person to submit a letter of interest and a resume. We're going to leave it open until this Friday. So if anyone is still interested and they would like to be considered by Council , please submit your letter of interest and resume to Lori Reed our City Clerk at Lreed@scrantonpa .gov or you can send it by mail, 340 North Washington Avenue, Second Floor, City Clerk's Office, attention Lori Reed our City Clerk. And then next week hopefully we'll be able to make a decision on the next Ethics Board appointment . Also, I mentioned in caucus we did receive an update on the audit that was taking place by the administration of City employees who had delinquent refuse fees, real estate tax, other things like that. The Business Administrator , Carl Deeley reported that there are 33 accounts from City employee which are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 delinquent and the total comes to about $90,000 according to the Business Administrator . And we're still waiting for an update on the audit that was going to be on done on the residency requirements for City employees . The last thing I want to mention is the Third Avenue issue. So I want to read this into the record because the residents took the time to write it and get a bunch of different signatures here. So this is from the residents of Third Avenue. Dear members of -- January 12th, 2021, Dear Members of Scranton City Council , we are residents of Third Avenue in Scranton , Pennsylvania . We are writing regarding the nonstop truck traffic that passes through Third Avenue on a daily basis. We've been calling City offices since the summer of 2020 and have spoken to the Mayor's office and City Council but so far nothing has been done. By our estimate we experience a minimum of 144 truck passes per day. On a daily basis we must endure the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 noise level of these trucks which is bad enough on its own. But this noise is also coupled with the fact that we cannot hear our devices unless we turn the volume up to a very high level. Imagine the decibel level in our homes and the impact it is having on our hearing and children 's hearing . Would you want your own children to live like this? Another concern is that we are unable to have our doors and windows open in the spring and summer. We must live without the benefit of fresh air until early evening because in addition to the noise level, we must also contend with the exhaust fumes that come into our homes. Surely this is not good for the health of any human being. Again, would this quality of life be good enough for your families ? Beyond health and quality of life issues, these trucks produce a rumbling effect which may eventually damage our homes and properties . Will the City compensate us for any damages caused? Probably not. As tax paying citizens of the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 of Scranton , we are asking our City Council to do something to stop the constant truck traffic that is damaging the quality of lives, our health, hearing and properties . We are not asking for any special consideration that other taxpayer s in the City aren't getting . We simply want the same quality of life as the other residents of Scranton enjoy. When we bought or began renting our homes, Third Avenue was a quiet peaceful street. Now we seem to live in an industrial park. Something must be done. There are alternate more commercial routes that these trucks can take instead of driving through and disturbing the peace of a residential area. Sincerely , the residents of Third Avenue. As I mentioned during the caucus, I worked closely with the residents of Third Avenue months and months ago to try to address this problem . So we did take certain measures to try to ease the issue. Obviously it had not solved it. And as I was explaining earlier , the problem -- the ultimate solution is the Elm Street bridge 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 is replaced. Unfortunately , for all of us and the residents of Third Avenue, that it won't happen for the next two to four years. I'm just estimating in my conversations with the City engineer previously when we talked about the condition of the bridges throughout the City of Scranton which are not in the best of shape. So that's the ultimate solution . Other than that, we're going to have to get together again with City officials to see if we can come up with any sort of plan or idea that can eliminate some of the issues here. As I mentioned , we did pass legislation that eliminated or prohibited Jake brakes or brake retarders on Third Avenue because that was a cause of a lot of noise. So we passed that I believe back in the summer before we went on the August recess. And those signs did go up shortly thereafter . But obviously there are still issues. So I do plan on reaching out to the one gentleman . He actually did call me the other day. And I have to get back to him about the issues there. So we'll keep everybody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 updated on that. As for the -- just to mention this briefly, we're going to talk about it next week anyways. But as for the, you know, the idea to form a committee to explore the feasibility of renaming Wyoming Avenue after President Biden or another prominent roadway ; again, I mentioned very clearly last week I'm not sure how some people missed it that this would be a committee to explore the feasibility . I completely understand that there are going to be businesses and residents affected if the City were to make this change, which again, that's why we form the committee . But we wanted to take a look at what steps you have to take, how you deal with post office and what that process looks like. So that will occur when the committee is formed. And we'll take that up and discuss it further next week. But just so we're all on same page here that we're forming a committee . No one changed any names of any streets . We're trying to do a good thing here to honor the President who is from the City of Scranton which we all know and has really -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 it's benefitted the City because all the eyes of the nation and the world have been on Scranton . And it's a tremendous ly positive thing for the City. And that is all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING SECTION 709.G OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON ZONING ORDINANCE PROHIBITING SIGNS OR DISPLAYS THAT INCLUDE WORDS OR IMAGES THAT ARE OBSCENE , PORNOGRAPHIC , OR THAT AN AVERAGE REASONABLE PERSON WOULD FIND HIGHLY OFFENSIVE TO PUBLIC DECENCY . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into it's proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Solicitor Hayes had given us an explanation in the caucus of 5-B and 5-E. I think this comes down -- I think this is a no-brainer for me just in terms of if we were -- if we didn't approve this settlement agreement and we didn't approve the zoning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 change. We're looking at a lawsuit and legal exposure probably in the hundreds of thousands of dollars . That's number one. Number two, as Solicitor O'Brien had indicated in his opinion which goes point by point on why the City should do this and should settle this, Lackawanna County was involved as he indicated with the ACLU not too long ago and was exposed almost half a million dollars in terms of legal fees that they had pay out. So they weren't going to win that. And according to what I'm reading here and what Kevin, our Solicitor , Kevin Hayes had just explained in the caucus, we would be exposed . So we don't want to waste taxpayer dollars . So that's the approach that, you know, I'm taking and that's why I'll be voting for both the zoning ordinance being amended and the settlement agreement . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And I think, Kyle, you have to make a motion to table. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to table Item 5-B. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second to table Item 5-B. As I mentioned previously , this piece of legislation is being tabled pursuant to the Pennsylvania Municipality 's Planning Code until such time that the City and County Planning Commissions have performed their reviews and provided recommendations . City Council will schedule a public hearing following the 30-day review period of the City and county. On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C.

(EMERGENCY CERTIFICATE ATTACHED ). MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , you know, a lot of the grants that we need to apply for we need to have some of the legwork done at the front end. And this is just a situation of that. Unfortunately , given the timeline, I don't, you know, I don't foresee the Nay Aug pool opening this summer. But at least we're getting to work, you know, to fix that issue because it's not only the liner that are issues. I believe -- I think talking to Bob Gattens from Rec Authority there are some subsurface issues there too. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I'll be voting in favor of the introduction of this legislation and the emergency certificate that's attached . You know, it's the Nay Aug Pool is very important to the City. And we want to do everything we can to get it repaired and get it ready for the summer in order for it to open. And the contract that was attached was very comprehensive and I believe was in agreement with everything that we were requesting to be assessed in the study. So I'm interested in seeing the results of it, what their finding s are, and what we need to do to get the pool in order. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Just a couple comments , number one, as I mention ed in the caucus, Nay Aug Park and Nay Aug Pool Complex is one of our major assets. It's really the jewel of the City. And it all started back in the early 2000s with Mayor Doherty 's administration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 really reviving the park and reviving the pool complex , putting the slide in. And we really saw the rebirth of not only the park but of that area of the Hill Section . Over the years that park has been extremely popular . It's used. There's tens of thousands of people that use it whether they walk, run on the trail, use the pool complex and other amenities up there. The Recreation Authority Board has done a phenomenal job the last few years in really keeping the park up where it should be along with the Parks and Recreation Department . Unfortunately , like everything else, over time pools age. There are maintenance issues and there are costs that come with operating a large pool complex like that. So I think that the Recreation Authority and the City administration wanting to complete this feasibility study makes a lot of sense. It's not just looking at how do we fix this pool so that it's open for the summer which I still think that is a possibility and I want to see that happen. I think it needs to happen. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 it's looking at an operational assessment , a facility analysis , a financial and pool management analysis , a layout design and it's developing a capital financing program moving forward . And the company that they chose has done this successfully in a lot of other areas throughout the State of Pennsylvania . And they've been highly, highly successful . So I'm sure that that will happen here. This will be good for the City moving forward so that we have a plan. Any time you -- and I learned this from Tom McLane who is doing our parks analysis now through out the City. Any time you have a comprehensive plan like this, it's easier for you to get grants whether it be from the DCNR, whether it be through any organization throughout the state and through out the country . So I think that this is really, really, really important . I did ask Eileen Cipriani the OECD Director a few questions about this. And she did get back to me, which I appreciate . And my first question was when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 they will award this grant. So once this analysis is done, the City is going to apply. The deadline to apply is I think April 12th or April 15th. Yeah, it's April -- let's see, April 15th, 2021. So the City will apply for this grant. They're not sure when it's going to be awarded. Typically they would announce in the fall. But if the feasibility study shows that they can repair and open the pool safely, then they also have a $62,000 LSA grant. And DCED will entertain a proposal from the City to use HRA loans proceeds for -- towards a community development project , in this case repairing the pool. And that's according to Eileen Cipriani . So I do think the prospect s of opening the pool this summer are still there. And I think it would be an absolute shame if it wasn't. And I do have to say I was disappointed that -- because I've been bringing this up now for months and months and months. We knew that the pool was in bad condition , you know, a long time ago. And I was disappoint ed that it took this long to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 some action and the City administration took so long. But here we are. And I do think now that this plan is good moving forward . So depending on -- according to Mrs. Cipriani , depending on what the study shows, that would let us -- let the City know if they could afford the repair and if they could begin the repair in 2021. The grant application to DCNR would be to implement the outcome of the study for the entire complex . So if funded, it would be for construction in 2022 because they have to address the larger pool site, not just the pool. There's other issues outside of just making sure that the pool gets open. So it will be, you know, would not be good for Nay Aug, would not be good for the City if they missed out on this grant opportunity . So, you know, usually I'm a little weary of emergency certificates like this because I would like to be able to have the opportunity and ability to flush things out over a two or three week period as we normally do. But in this case, it's important 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 for the pool -- of getting the pool open. It's important for the park. And I'll be voting yes.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH BARRY ISETT & ASSOCIATES , INC. TO PERFORM ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I discuss ed this in caucus. But I do have several questions that I'd like answered before we entertain passing this next week since final passage will be next Tuesday . It's my understanding as I mentioned earlier that historically in that office, project management came from the deputy director and maybe one other position in that office. So basically as far as I could tell, this legislation is hiring -- or farming out project management to a company that we're going have to pay a little bit over $60,000 to. It's my belief based on what I experienced over the last few years in dealing with OECD, that we shouldn 't have to bid that out unless there's some good explanation that comes down from OECD. Again, historically that's always been done by the deputy director and/or another position in that office.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 The way this is worded is a little confusing because it seems like you're getting engineering services . Now, I could be wrong, but the way that I'm reading this, we're getting a project manager . We're still -- the OECD and the City is still going to have to bid out for engineering services . So again, my -- a simple explanation of why this cannot be done inhouse when historically it's been done inhouse. I also wanted to ask for a description of what line item this funding is coming out of. They do state in the narrative that the funding source is CDBG funding . I just want to make sure that is coming out of the administrative part of the budget, you know, what line item is that coming out of. And I also wanted a list of all the other bidders and the prices -- the bids on the project . So I just don't want us to spend more money than we have to. If we're paying people in OECD already that had done it in the past, we should be doing that moving forward unless there's a good reason that they're making the switch. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.
