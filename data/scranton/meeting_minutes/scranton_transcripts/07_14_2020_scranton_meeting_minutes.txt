Will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Patricia Nestor, Marie Decker, Lenard Shoemaker , Fay Franus and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , one of the things Miss Franus brought up in her comment was the 500 block of Luzerne Street. I know we've gotten a lot of complaints about that area. And I know we passed them along to Licensing and Inspections . So, Miss Reed, would we be able to reach out to Licensing and Inspection s just to get an update on what's being done on that block? MR. GAUGHAN : They did -- Mrs. Reed, Mr. Oleski did provide an update on that, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 didn't he? I think. MR. DONAHUE : Did he? MS. REED: I would have to check back in the file, Councilman Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I think what I remember because I had reached out to him -- and you know what, I can't remember if I just talked to him or if it just came through the office. But he did tell me that they went out and visited that place. It used to be a gas station . But now there is just a bunch of cars sitting there. I don't know if it's now a -- I don't what it is now to be honest with you. But I received complaints from Mrs. Franus and other neighbors in that area. And I -- Mr. Oleski told me that they tagged the cars. It was going to the magistrate . And one of the neighbors told me since then the issues -- it's still there. But the cars -- there's been less cars there. So we should follow up on that just -- it's been two weeks. MR. DONAHUE : All right. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I was going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 add it later tonight ; but I was going to ask if there was a followup on that gas station there on Luzerne and Railroad as well as any of those other houses. I know there's a lot of garbage and things in that area and other residences . And then last week we also asked about that 1642 Sanderson Ave. I reached out to that individual and they said it's business as usual, some of the same stuff is going on there. I don't know if we got an update -- anybody looked into the Sanderson Ave., residence ; but if we can add that to that list. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. Definitely . MS. REED: Yep. Will do. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? I just wanted to say that I went through all the public comment . Any questions here that should be posed to the administration will be sent to the appropriate officials within the administration . Public comment will be placed into the official record and our official minutes . If anyone would like to take a look at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 public comment , you could go to www.scrantonpa .gov and click on Council 's web page. Any questions that were posed are forwarded , whether it's to the Mayor or the appropriate department head. And if anyone would like to submit comments to the Council based on our agenda items or just official City business , as always you could e-mail those comment s to Lori Reed our City Clerk at Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. We will accept public comment until the day of our meeting Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. And our agendas are posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (Public Comment , the following are letters or e-mails submitted for public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 comment .) (Patricia Nestor) I just read in the newspaper about our Scranton “Parks Passport 2020.” Literature and stickers encouraging people to visit our parks. I hope everyone goes and visits PennRidge . We haven't had a nickel or dime for repairs in the past ten years but we have money to print tour guides. Not one single pool is open and can't be blamed on Covid. (State pools open). How much did this cost in printing and who approved it? Can someone please ask the mayor to stop spending so much time, energy, and money on rebranding Scranton until we can fix some of our more pressing problems ? How many times is she going to change the graphic with the Electric City sign? Leave our iconography alone and work on budgets and policy. We didn't hire her for marketing . Hashtags aren't going to fix our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 problems . Regards , Patricia Nestor (Add on #1) The look out area on Moosic Street near Lake Scranton is covered in spray painted graffiti . It's horrible . I mean bad, really, really bad. Shameful . (Add on #2) The Green Ridge Neighborhood Association told me Mr. Donahue is getting the swamp water drained from Capouse pool. Thank you very much. We don't need a mosquito farm. They also informed me about the pine brook renovation program and getting grants. The pool has been neglected for a long time and the structural integrity is questionable . I would like to be kept aware before any decisions are made to change the pool into something else. I haven't even heard a dollar amount of how much it would cost to fix. When it comes to renovating Pinebrook , it would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 be kind of cool if it was turned into our antique district . Lettieri 's Auction and On&On would be great showcases for that, as well as Olde Good Things over by the Glider. Keep the old charm like polishing the tarnish off of silver instead of melting it down into something new. Know what I mean? Regards , Patricia (Marie Decker) I'm giving you an update from my e-mail last week. I live in south Scranton and the fireworks continue every day and night since Memorial Day, it is 43 days in a row for us and we are sick of it ,this is not about their right to have fireworks for 4th of July anymore it is truly harassment . Marie Decker (Lenard Shoemaker ) Please consider ordinances regarding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 ATVs and fireworks in the city of Scranton . We have been listening to fireworks since Memorial day and they are still setting them off to this day as I have called Scranton police two times in the past week. Sincerely Lenny and Susan Shoemaker (Fay Franus) I want to try to understand a few things--I say we give our recycling and every other aspect of garbage collection to another place NOT DENAPLES . Why do we and the school district keep rewarding this man-- why weren't the busing contracts put out to bid? I know that is a school issue but I am just stunned by all this man gets--he seems to be holding everyone hostage --BUT WHY? Clip this thief off at the knees-- He has controlled this city for decades -- don't ypou honestly think it is time Scranton is DONE with him? I also do not understand why we need 18 months to keep Scranton in a distressed status-- YOU decided that not anyone else-- I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 will never ever understand why the Mayor does not declare bankruptcy . You find it much easier to keep passing on every single bill to the citizens . We are BURIED we can NOT take any more--you are driving people out of this city. But you can bet all unions will maintain high salaries and high pensions . And those people who Wayne gave raises to still have them. Are you NOT going top amend the budget and cut cost ? Cut salaries ? Twenty eight years is way too long for distressed status --and you seriously want to add 18 more months--then what-- stop taking the easy way out all of the time make some tough decisions . You know what you are doing will only have the same result of years making the taxpayers pay pay pay. FILE BANKRUPTCY . You say taxpayers can't keep paying BUT you keep raising taxes on them Words are cheap . Words do not cut it--sincere actions do--Please stop saying you don't want taxes raised again and that it is too hard for us if you do not have a plan to stop raising taxes --we are tired of those lies year after year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 My words to you mean nothing --they never did--so why do I keep writing ? Who the heck knows--maybe just maybe you will feel a ting of duty to serve US for once--not the almighty UNIONS who YOU seem to think YOU need to vote for you-- Does that hit home a bit? I sure bet it does! It should! As for us in Bellevue -- please get inspectors to those houses on the odd side of the 500 Block of Luzerne Street--they should be torn down. Three neighbors came to me this week disgusted with that corner--all the cars parked in that gas station . They are destroying our neighborhood . I couldn't give my house away in this neighborhood -- Slum city! That's all-- we all have issues and situations to live with-- we simply do not need more piled on top of us-Please do something -- we are ALL waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting ! Fay Franus (Marie Schumacher ) 14 July 2020 MEETING INPUT FOR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 FOURTH ORDER. O My thoughts on last week's Caucus. I especially "liked" the discrepancy between the City's projection of the year-end 2020 deficit ($6-10 million ) and PEL's ($2+ million ). I trust we will hear the reason this evening . My second "like" is what I call "The Federal Money Tree" theory. This a Democrat double-whammy...it's okay for the Feds to borrow money to bail out the Cities with Councils too lazy to solve budget problems and put the entire Country deeper in debt (i.e. there is no money tree). This is also a sneaky political gotcha: If the Fed increase the Country 's debt to bail out municipalities and States then the Dems can blast the President for increasing the debt while they enjoy a "balanced bailed out budget" and get a pat on the back for not working to find source of revenue , making any tough cuts in their own budget or raising property taxes. I believe it takes a lot of guts to encourage citizens to ask the them to lobby 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 their Senators for a bailout without having cut one cent from the budget expenses . I am anxious to hear the 6A disscussion . Moving on,. O 7A This appears to be "feel good" legislation as it sounds good but is virtually impossible to equitably enforce . Why not try to acknowledge this fact and simply ask people to respect their neighbors and provide a suggested cut-off time for each holiday . O 7B With the number of gasoline stations in the City I also believe this to be difficult to equitably enforce . The more unenforced laws the less attention people pay to all the laws and the less faith they have in the competence of their elected officials . o This one is probably for Councilman Rothchild , does the City still share the costs for the United Neighborhood Centers of Northeastern PA to administer the continum of care for Lackawanna County and, if so, what is the amount of the City's share? O What has the Shared Services Committee been working on? When did they last meet?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 O The Third Order from two weeks ago (30 June) contained a letter to Council President asking the attached documents be reviewed and a meeting schedules to discuss the pending Meadowbrook project in more detail. With only two more weeks until you take your month of August recess will you please tell us tonight when the requested meeting will occur. O Will you meet on 8 September ? O I should acknowledge having received responses to some of my questions which I graciously accept. On the good news side I did learn the MS4 permit application was submitted on 2 May. O Since the HRG Report has not yet been received may we assume the decision to establish or not establish a Stormwater Authority , along with a property owner's fee of course, has been put off until 2021? o When is the Audit expected ? If it is not received until August how will it be made available to the public/taxpayers ? O Conclude with the hope that Councilman McAndrew will put some meat on the negative Standard and Poor's rating of the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 of Scranton . (End of Public Comment ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Not at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a comment . I receive d an e-mail from a concerned citizen today at the lookout on Moosic Street up near Lake Scranton , there's a quite a bit of graffiti . I also noticed not too long ago driving by that there's a lot garbage . And, you know what, to be honest with you I'm not sure what entity is responsible for the upkeep of this if Mrs. Reed could please send some correspondence to the City just to clarify who is actually responsible and how it's done and when is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 done. I'd appreciate that very much. And also, we talked in caucus about the two new pieces of legislation that we're bringing forward tonight which I'm thrilled with the Mayor and the Chief of Police putting this together . And, you know, one being fireworks , the other being the ATV. I think since we have the opportunity with the ATV piece of legislation like I mention ed in caucus, a gentleman reached out to me today who is a responsible ATV owner. And his concern s are, you know, maybe the enforce ment -- we should enforce responsibility on the ownership and usage of these vehicles that maybe they should be licensed and registered . So -- and they'll have to carry insurance if driven on the street because like we said, we're going to charge a fine to these people that go to gas stations and fine the gas stations that provide the gas. But going there period is breaking the law. So maybe we put a little more teeth in this before final passage . And also, this was brought to my attention like I said earlier . I wasn't aware 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 of this. I don't own an ATV. I'm not against ATVs. But this was brought to my attention that a lot of these ATVs are fitted with these after market illegal parts. And, you know, what he stressed was, especially very loud obnoxious exhaust . So that also creates a nuisance in the City with, you know, with regards to noise. So, you know, I said some are ruining it for local resident s that safely comply with the use of ATVs. So like I said, I'm not against them. I don't own one. They look like a lot of fun. Maybe we do this and think about before moving forward that since we have the opportunity , let's try to do this more fair with everybody involved . So if maybe if you would, please, Mrs. Reed, maybe send some of that what I just mentioned in the form of a correspondence to administration to see what we can do with this. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 motions or comment s, not at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly . I did talk to Parks Director Brian Fallon. Today I had gotten a couple complaints about some of the pools with standing water. And he was on top it of and was planning on going out and draining those pools anyway. They were just waiting to see what the final decision was on whether pools would open or close. So the pools that have standing water -- I know a few of the neighbors on a couple different pools were, you know, concerned about the mosquitoes and that sort of thing. So they will be drained , you know, this week and hopefully next week. I did talk to DPW Director Tom Preambo this morning also. He gave me an update on the project of the bottom of Birch Street in between South Washington Avenue and Cedar Avenue. That project should be done at the end of September which then the road will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 reopen. But then by the end of October will be when the full road restoration will be done, the full curb-to-curb paving. So they'll open it up but then it will just be shut down while the full restoration is happening. I also talked to him about a flooding issue up on East Mountain . Also, one thing I did forget to talk to him about but I think we should get an update on is -- so, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to -- and this is more of the administration I think too. We sent out bids for the engineering for the paving project for this year. Could you just see if we will get legislation -- can you ask this tomorrow too because we would need that legislation tomorrow , I believe , to approve that before our summer recess. MS. REED: Yes, I will. Thank you, Council man. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And I also got a complaint -- and this has been an ongoing issue too with the 600 block of Donnelly Court with garbage in the alley. So would we be able to send correspondence to LIPS about that too? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 And then that's all I have. I'll hold the rest of my comments on ATVs and fireworks for when that legislation comes up. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few things. I did receive a complaint about the 500 block of Birch Street, overgrown empty lot. So we sent that along to the Licensing and Inspections Department . There was quite a few complaint s about the 1700 block of Church Avenue. So we sent that along to the Licensing and Inspection s Department as well. I received from Mr. King our City Planner an update on our stormwater management plan and the stormwater management issues in the City. In May there was a meeting via Zoom with a representative from Herbert, Rowland and Grubic which is the company that was putting in our -- we contracted with for our stormwater management issues throughout the City and to come up with a stormwater management plan. One of the questions that came up in the last few weeks was whether there was a drop-dead date when a report has to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 prepared . Mr. King has reviewed the contract . There's no -- no date in there when it says the report has to be due. The consensus in his conversations with representatives from his company and other representatives from the City is that it would make the most sense -- and I think we talked about this in the last few years to have a regional countywide authority . And Mr. King agrees this would probably be the best option for a number of different reasons . The County Commissioners thankfully are in agreement as well. And he reported that Senator Blake is now working to bring more stakeholders together to make this a reality . In May, 2019, a permit application was submitted . It is still under review. The Planning Commission had on their March 27th, 2020 agenda the Pollution Reduction Plan to receive and comply with the participation section . The plan is done. But it can't officially be submitted to DEP until there is an actual public meeting . And I believe that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 that's being planned as we speak. So that's an update on stormwater management. At this time, I'd like to make two motions . First, I'd like to make a motion that City Council send correspondence to the administration for an update on the status of each one of the recommendations made by the Pennsylvania Economy League in the City's Exit Plan. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm making this motion for a few different reasons . First, I believe I made this motion in the past and I had not really ever received a response from the previous -- the Courtright administration . I think it's important for a few different reasons . Number one, it's always good to have, you know, Council performing their role as the legislative oversight of the administration . And number two, when I went through again today and looked through the Exit Plan, there are so many important recommendation s. And I know for a fact that many of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 them are not accomplished yet. Now, if the legislation in Sixth Order tonight passes and then final passage next week and we have an additional 18 months, that does buy us more time. And these are only recommendation s. But if you look through it, they're very important . And it really would make -- it is common sense to go through with all of them. For example , some of the important ones that I have been asking about for a while -- and I know this administration is in the process of completing a debt management policy, a capital improvement financing plan developed by the administration and then approve d by Council . One of the very important ones would be a pension fund governance policy, an investment policy and program . Basically the recovery or the Exit Plan says that the City should define investment policies , fixes investment responsibilities and provides for a clear investment process for the sole reason that formally adopting this policy would protect officials from legal actions for questionable investment practice s. And then one of the other important 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 ones and there's more. I'm not going to go through every one of them -- but would be an updated Human Resources Management Plan. That is something that I've been asking about now for the past three or four years, a database for the personnel in the City. And I know that that was really one of the things that PEL was harping on now for the last few years as well. So those are the reasons that I'm asking. I know there's members of the public also that were interested in this. So I look forward to receiving the information . Anyone else on the question ?

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just two questions I had for the administration , one being what is the overall enforcement strategy to enforce this going forward ? And then I just also want to make the point that we are -- we have to stick within that time limit until the state house passes legislation that would allow us to ban the use of these fireworks outright. So that's why we're only doing what we can do for the moment. So we still want to encourage members of the public to reach out to their state representative s to support legislation banning -- giving the City of Scranton the opportunity to ban these fireworks outright. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? On the question , I think that people throughout the City should have their right to live peaceful ly in their homes. I understand as well as anybody else 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 that on the 4th of July, Memorial Day, Labor Day, it's normal to hear fireworks . But a month before the 4th July, sometimes a month and a half, a month after the 4th July; it's hard for people to live in their homes. We've heard from them the past few weeks. It's not fair to them. It's not fair to the taxpayers throughout our City to have to be literally up all night and afraid to go outside of their home. We've heard and it's been documented that fireworks have caused catastrophes in terms of fires in garages . There was one in South Side I think on the 4th of July, a garage that was lit on fire. Garages that light on fire and then turn into lighting the whole home on fire, among a number of other things. So it puts our people in danger and puts our veteran s in danger in terms of PTSD. It puts our children in danger. And it really is a huge burden on our police and fire department . I had, you know, conversations with Chief Graziano about this in previous years. There are important and dangerous things outside of fireworks that go on. And we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 really being stretched thin here to keep responding to all of these important fireworks calls. So we have to do something . Is this the end-all be-all panacea for this problem ? No. Will it be difficult to enforce ? Probably . But it's giving a little bit more teeth until the state legislature steps up and ultimate hopefully bans these commercial grade fireworks for good. I don't think that those types of dangerous fireworks should be in the hands of people. They have to be -- you know, whether you have it at Montage Mountain or a professional fireworks show. But it's definitely an issue that has gotten out of control , especially this year. But even in previous years we've heard about it. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I just want to say that, you know, it is expected on the 4th of July for fireworks . But, you know, in 2017 when the C class fireworks were allowed to be used, guess what? Prior to that, the only people that would set them off are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 pyrotechnician s that are trained and safely know how to do that. And allowing that to happen or that change is kind of crazy where they were available -- we're lucky that our area has only had -- I mean, we're not lucky, we had some horrible situations . But it could have been worse or get worse. So I'm really happy with this legislation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : One thing I did -- I said I had two questions for the administration . And I didn't get to my second one. But the second one was, you know, the fine was raised from 150 to 300. You know, is there any down side as to go even higher for that to be a bigger deterrent ? So that's another one I'll pose. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? Good points. Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – REGULATING THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF GASOLINE DIRECTLY INTO THOSE VEHICLES THAT FALL UNDER THE CLASS OF VEHICLES DEFINED BY 75 PA.C.S.A. 7702 AS BEING AN “ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE ” OR “ATV” OR A “SNOWMOBILE ” WHILE SAID VEHICLES ARE RUNNING AND PROVIDING FOR ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THIS ORDINANCE . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Oh, sorry. Second. Was there a second? I jumped the gun there. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I also have, you know, just the thing -- one of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 the things for this one, just what is the overall enforcement strategy going to be; also how we're going to give, you know, proper notice to gas station owners. And then there's, you know, I still think there's an issue with credit cards, you know, that might fall on the gas station owner is that issue but just to bring that up. But that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Really, the same comments I have for the fireworks legislation too. These ordinances really are intended to maintain our citizens ' quality of life and their safety. The ATV issue is one that has kind of exploded over the last few months as well. I have it in my own neighborhood as I'm sure all of you have. They are dangerous . They are not allowed on public streets in the City of Scranton . And there may be responsible people who ride ATVs. I'm sure there are. I haven't seen any in my neighborhood . I have people who literally drive up on wheelies with children on the back of the ATV with no helmets on who fly -- they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 have to be doing 80 to 100 miles an hour zipping up and down. There was just an accident over on Church Avenue I think two weeks ago with a young guy who got seriously injured . These people are irresponsible , and not only irresponsible for themselves . But they're irresponsible for the young people, my children , other children who play in the neighborhood , irresponsible for the people now because of the pandemic on East Mountain who I talked to who have to work from home who literally cannot work from home because of these loud ATVs are going up and down their street. No one minds if the ATV is in a wooded area and you're not on a public street. Have as much fun as you want. But when you are traversing neighborhoods day in and day out, it is absolutely unacceptable . So these people need to be held accountable . They're breaking the law. I do agree with everyone that spoke tonight that we may have to tighten up some of the language a little bit. But it's not -- again, just as I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 mentioned last week with the quality of life issues, it's really just not fair to the people who follow the rules and who just want to live in their homes in peace. I mean, within the last few months the ATVs and the fireworks on top of it, it's been listening to people, talking to people on the phone who have reached out to me personally , just people from different neighborhoods of the City. It's been really difficult for people. So I think that hopefully again, this legislation certainly will not be a panacea for the problem . And it won't solve it completely . But I'm hoping that it will take a step in the right direction . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MS. REED: 5-D.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, on the question , just as I mention ed in the caucus, these changes stem from the adoption by FEMA of new flood maps set to become effective on August 5th, 2020. In order for the City to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program , the City has to agree to adopt floodplain management regulation s that meet or exceed their minimum standard s. That is the purpose of these regulations . The maps have changed . If anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 would like to take a look at them, you could go to FEMA's website. You could just make a search on the internet for FEMA floodplain maps and then type in the City of Scranton . You could type in your address and see if you are located in a floodplain . If you are new to the -- being in a floodplain , according to the new maps you'll be notified by FEMA. And then you'll have to purchase flood insurance . So there's a whole process that goes along with that. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-E.

DONAHUE : Have we gotten any explanation for why this change is being made? MR. GAUGHAN : This has been -- Mrs. Reed, if you could refresh my memory, if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 you remember , I think this has been in the works for a while. Am I correct in saying that? MS. REED: Yes, you are. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, this -- I know that our City Engineer was in contact with the Railroad Authority . We can ask him for a more broad explanation . But I know that this has been -- I think really even since the beginning of the year there's been talks on making this move for safety reasons . So we can ask Mr. Pocius for a more broad explanation . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, because I remember when we voted on this originally , you know, there was some discussion on it. I guess I'll have to go back and look through my notes and see what -- I don't remember exactly what it was either. I feel like there was an issue or two when we adopted the first ordinance on this. So I'll have to go back to that. MR. GAUGHAN : Um hum. Okay. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-F. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ARC PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF $50,000.00 TO BE USED TO DEVELOP AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE CITY. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I was really pleased to see that OECD and the administration is going after this grant. And I hope that they are successful in securing it. I think it's very, very important 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 that an Economic Development Strategic Plan is developed for the City. Going through and looking at this legislation and the backup that was used and really the rational e, when you look at the unemployment rate in January of 2020 in Scranton it was 6.3 percent . In the State of Pennsylvania it was 4.7 percent . And nationally it was 3.6 percent . So we were -- we had a higher unemployment than this -- both the state average and the national average . The unemployment rate in April, 2020 because of the pandemic is unbelievable , 17.8 percent unemployment rate in the City of Scranton , 15.1 percent in Pennsylvania and 14.7 percent nationally . The poverty rate in Scranton is striking , 23.7 percent in the City while in Pennsylvania the average is 12 and a half percent and nationally it's 12.3 percent . The other thing that stuck out to me was the median household income in Scranton is $39,066. In Pennsylvania the average median household income is $60,905. And nationally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 it's $61,937. There's no question that we need a strategic plan for economic development , not only in our downtown but throughout our City. The poverty rate and unemployment rate are significantly higher than the state and national averages . I often hear people say, you know, why does a police officer make so much or why does a fireman make so much. But the question really should be $60,000, $70,000 in today's environment , it's even hard to raise a family on that as some of you know. So the question shouldn 't be why does this person make this amount of money or why does that person make that amount of money. It should be why can't we raise everybody up together . And I think that's really the goal of this legislation and this program to get an actual strategy moving forward , not just for the next year or two years but really for 5 and 10 years down the road. So I'll really be looking forward to following this over the next few months and hopefully we secure this grant. Anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just want to say I agree on -- also excited to see that this is starting to be planned out. I know it's something that Miss Cipriani had mentioned previously when she came before Council that she was interested in developing a strategic plan. And I'm glad to see that we're making some quick movement on it and that there's some grant opportunities to help us to be able to do that. I think that our City will be better for it. We should have already had a strategic plan. But here we are and we can develop one now that helps our economy to grow and help us become a better City. So thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Definitely . Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I'm also happy to see this. I know it's been something that's been discussed for the past couple years. But I just would like to point out too that I'd also, you know, like to hear from the administration on what their plans are for the LIPS Department because you could have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 best, you know, economic development strategy there is, if you don't fix the LIPS Department it's not really going to matter. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-G. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING AN AMENDMENT TO THE MULTI-BRIDGE (BRIDGE BUNDLING ) PROJECT AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA , WHICH AMENDMENT INCREASES THE TOTAL PROJECT AS SET FORTH HEREIN. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? As I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 mentioned in the caucus, this is -- legislation is simply amending the Multi Bridge Project Agreement to increase the project cost. These bridges that are going to eventually be replaced are West Lackawanna Avenue, the Elm Street bridge over the Lackawanna River, North Main Avenue bridge and the Parker Street bridge. Our share of funding -- the City's share would be increase d from 1,287,000 to 1.4 million . And the federal government covers roughly 20 and a half million dollars . That's going to be increased to 23 million dollars roughly . And the state originally was covering 3.8 million . And that's going to increase to 4.3 million . I can't stress enough -- and in my conversations over the past really year and a half with the City Engineer , previous DPW Director and the administration how crucial it is that we replace these bridges and how crucial it was really to get this bundling package together for all of these bridges . I know that it's going to take time. It will probably take a few years when all is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 said and done. But our bridges are in really rough condition . I don't have it in front of me. But we receive d a report that grades every bridge in the City. And our grades were not good on many of the bridges . And if it gets to a certain level, the bridges will have to be closed. And they'll have to be -- routes will have to be changed which will cause, you know, chaos in terms of traffic . So I do want to thank the administration and previous administrations for making sure that this got done because at one time even with the West Lackawanna Avenue bridge, things were stalling and we were in danger of not moving forward . So I'm glad to see this on our agenda. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR.

I hereby declare Item 7-B legally and lawfully adopted . And then I know, Councilman Schuster , you had something to add about Church Avenue? MR.

And it caused a -- it caused parking issues going up Putnam which then in turn pushed cars up onto Church Avenue. So maybe that's something that could be added to your piece regarding Church Avenue. I don't know if that has been fixed as of this point. But it caused -- there was individuals parking in yards and everything there along I'd say maybe the corner of Putnam 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 and Church due to the amount of parking spaces for that building .
