This resolution is reallocating ARPA funds to allow for violence prevention efforts . It was not properly voted on after its introduction in Fifth Order on February 20th. It is being placed in Fifth Order for a vote. The rules will be suspended after it's voted on in Fifth Order. And it will be moved to Seventh Order for a final vote. Anyone who would like to speak on this piece of legislation may do so in Fourth Order during Citizens Participation . On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR.

KING: Mr. President , just a reminder this coming Saturday is the St. Patrick 's Day Parade. At 11:00 a.m., will be the Brian P. Kelly road race, which this year is going to benefit Detective Kyle Gilmartin . So we're trying to encourage all local runners . It's a two-mile race on the parade route. So we know there will be great traffic control . But also we want to get as many runners out to support Detective Gilmartin . All proceeds will go to he and his family. So I just want to encourage and to remind everyone that Saturday parking is going to be a little crazy in the city so just be patient and cognizant of that. So that's all I have for now. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm going to say one more thing. I'm glad that Mr. King said a two-mile race. The Kelly race is a two-mile race and I think he could correct me on this one. It is the shortest race, is it in the State of Pennsylvania ? So if you're a new runner -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. KING: It's not. MR. SCHUSTER : It's not? MR. KING: The Green Ridge mile. MR. SCHUSTER : Oh, okay. If you're a new runner, it's only two miles. So it might be a way to get your feet wet and, you know, support the parade and support a good cause. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . DR. ROTHCHILD : I have an announcement . This past weekend we were suppose d to have Sprucin g up Scranton , which was a city run cleanup. But that had to be reschedule d due to the weather . So that is now going to be Saturday , March 16th from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. And at 11 a.m., they'll be meeting up at Tripp Park 2199 Dorothy Street, and just a great way to get out there as the weather warms up and to help clean up the city. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So April -- Saturday , April 27th, Scranton ALS United Walk is going to take place. And it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 going to be for the ALS United MidAtlantic Division . So, you know, the message I got was save the date, come and walk with us. The walk is free. Sign up and help fundraiser donate at Teammiller@ALSunitedwalk.org. You could also buy shirts, short sleeve are 15, long sleeves are 20 that you could wear during the walk. And it will be at the PNC Park field, 235 Moosic up in the mountain ; and again, April 27th. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I was one of those fortunate people on Friday afternoon to see Detective Gilmartin return. And it was a beautiful day and a beautiful event. But I would ask you all to remember that next Tuesday , March 12th is the ninth anniversary of the passing of Officer John Wilding . And so let's keep him and his family in our thought s. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I want to thank everybody who support ed the Friends of the Scranton Public Library book sale that concluded last Saturday . Just so people understand , the profits we make on these book sales go towards children 's programs . And, for example , this Sunday at the Children 's Library up on Vine Street at 2 p.m., we're having a program that we're funding . It's the Dinosaur Adventure Show. And have you ever met a five year old who didn't like dinosaurs ? Okay, it's a lot of fun. You should register your attendance if you want to bring your child. Call 348-3015 or stop by the Children 's Library and they'll register you. They're going to have among other things an 8 foot Triceratops ' skull. So bring your kids. They'll have a ball. One of the things I would like to see in the future and hopefully I'll live long enough is those union contracts . The Firefighter 's contracts , it's now 337 days and the Police is 221 days. And those really should be on the City's website , documents 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 which the public should be able to read. Last Friday -- not last Friday, but February 29th was the deadline for the RFP for financial forecasting for the city. Does anybody know whether or not they got any takers on that RFP? MR. SMURL: I did not look it up yet to see. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I'll check with John Murray when I get a chance. Also, during the first half of March keep in mind that we should be getting an update on the city's bond rating. If you hear anything on that, please let us know. Item 5-B, the capital reserve fund, it says in the legislation that the initial funding is a total of 3.3 million dollars . But then it gives a description of how it will be funded thereafter . What it doesn't say is what will be the annual requirements thereafter. And it's something I would like you to if you could discuss during Fifth Order because it's one thing to establish a capital reserve fund. It's another thing to sustain it. You need to take a look how that's going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 to impact future budgets . Also 5-C, the stormwater debris removal for Kathleen Kujawski , I don't have a problem with that. I saw in the legislation it said to help a property owner who is struggling with large boulders in her property and other stormwater debris following the flooding on September 9th. But I have two comments , one, it says on the financial impact of the legisla tive sheet, all it says is general fund. It doesn't quantify what it might cost. And maybe they can't quantify at this point in time. But the other question is, have there been any other residents and homeowners who also need city assistance and what are we doing for them? I mean, if we have one resident requires city assistance and what they declare actually is an easement and there are other things required , have there been other residents who have been impacted by that stormwater flood and do they also need some assistance from the city for removal of debris? MR. SMURL: So I was there after the flooding , days after. And the city did have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 lot of equipment in and they did clear out stuff that was landed in people's yards, filled their swimming pools and stuff. I know that was all done and that was -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I just didn't, you know, we got one person identified . I just want to make sure that anybody else that needed help was offered the same assistance . MR. SCHUSTER : So this one, Joan, this is where the -- actually the creek bed -- it's a small creek bed that comes across Newton Road. They put about a 6 to 8 foot rock pile closed Newton Road at least for a few days. And this rock pile went right into that home. I think it took the home off the foundation there. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Yeah, if there are other resident s that have had similar problems , I hope that we've given them also a certain amount of assistance . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner. As Joan said, I wasn't able to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 attend Officer Gilmartin 's ceremony on Friday. But I watched it on television . And I was really inspired. It's amazing the progress he's made in less than two months taking two shots to the head. He should be an inspiration to everybody . And God bless him. I think everybody 's prayers worked. But he needs more prayers I'm sure. He still has a ways to go. But it's unbelievable the progress he's made. Best of luck to him and his family. Sitting at the house today watching the rainfall and seeing the water piling up on my sidewalks and nobody could walk, I was just wondering is any information if my corner is going to get fixed which I was promised almost two and a half years ago? They said we're on a paving list. It wasn't paved last fall. I wonder if we're on the spring list? MR. SMURL: I'm not sure if it's on the spring list. We did discuss the stormwater management . And you were only one block out of the range. And I believe that they did -- MR. SCHUSTER : I spoke to Mr. Spindler about it. When we look at the map 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 for the stormwater project s that are going to occur in the Tripp Park and North Scranton area, the cutoff was Hawthorne Street. And I know that Bulwer Street, your street is parallel -- parallel issue to Hawthorne Street. I let the resident speak to the individual that was from the engineering company . But I'm going to get that into the city to move that over at least one block because I know the issues are parallel to Hawthorne . MR. SPINDLER : Two and a half years ago they were up there and they said they were going to fix the whole corner. They said last year now I have to wait until the street gets paved. I hope it's done this year because I know there's fisherman -- stocking Roaring Brook because of what the water company did. They could have stocked the front of my house today and they could have fished in front of my house. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you check to see if they posted the spring paving list yet on the city website ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 have, Mr. King, yes. MR. KING: So it is posted on the website right now, Les. I'm not sure if you're on there. MR. SPINDLER : All right. The last time I was here I talked about how Wilkes-Barre fixes their potholes permanently , not like we do it here just throwing the cold patch in the hole and letting cars run over it. That machine they use can also be rented. You don't have to buy it. I think the city should seriously look into doing that because the way we fix pothole s, it's not a fix. Wilkes-Barre does it permanently . They just don't throw cold patch into the hole. And I explained that all two weeks ago when I was here. Next thing, any information about what I spoke about a few weeks ago? Mr. McAndrew looked into it about the bridge on North Main Avenue -- the trucks keep running into it. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. Spindler , we reached out to Norfolk Southern management and we supplied them with a picture of the Capouse 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Avenue bridge as an example and asked that they paint the North Main Avenue in a similar fashion . MR. SPINDLER : Okay. I think that will be a good idea. MR. VOLDENBERG : We could follow up, but we did provide them with all the information . MR. SPINDLER : All right. Thank you. Yeah, I wasn't here last week. I saw the police chief was here. I wish I could have been here and I would have asked him about the idea that I had about educating the general public about gangs. I think the more eyes you have on the street, like I said, myself and a couple neighbors , they said we wouldn't have known that kid that was walking by Scranton High had a gun. We wouldn't have known he was in a gang. So I think the people should be educated . Lastly, I noticed for a number weeks now, we haven't had the Times-Tribune reporter here. And I think I know why. I called last week wondering why -- I'm a big sports fan -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 if anybody gets the paper and they look at the sports page, there is no more NBA coverage , no more college basketball coverage . I called last week and asked why. They said their deadline used to be 11:00 at night. Since they were sold it's 7:30 in the evening . So I said to the guy, I'm serious ly considering stopping my subscription . And he said I'm not alone. That's ridiculous . A lot of news happens at night. If you notice the newspaper now there's -- hardly any -- there's nothing to it. There's no sports. High school sports, that's all you see in the sports section now. That's it, no professional supports . And now baseball is coming up. Nobody is going to get baseball scores. They'll just have to watch ESPN. Thank you for your time. MR. SCARINGI : Good evening , Council , Mark Scaringi {phonetic }, Mulberry Towers across the street. So I've been here last year. And I'm no stranger about these noise issues, Council . So I'm going to address these noise issues. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 But first I want to comment very briefly on this scaffolding issue here. I want to know, Council , when I was in New York City I had to audition for Santa Clause at Harold Square. And as I was walking down 6th Avenue, I look to one of the side streets . And I see this gigantic boom lift. And these people are working on the facade of this building with the windows and everything . That thing must have been 100 feet high. I wanted to know is there any talk about a boom lift in front of -- instead of all this scaffolding ? Is that a possibility ? MR. SMURL: It was decided that it's much easier to use scaffolding. You could do multiple section s and multiple levels at one time. MR. SCARINGI : I see. All right. Well, all right, that was for my own curiosity . Moving on, I want to point your attention out to this, Council . I walk the streets of Scranton every day. I have no car. And I look at the drivers as I observe people and driving . And they always have their cell 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 phone readily available . It's either in their hand or on their dashboard there. And what they do is, they say I'm not really -- I'm driving but unscrupulous I'm going to say I'm not driving and they do it anyway. And shame on those people and they know who they are. What happens is that it becomes a distraction and you're not paying attention . Now, for the point of my conversation , let's just pretend that this red dot is a car. Here's this tractor -trailer on Mulberry Street. And he wants to get through that intersection . But that car is not going through the intersection because he's -- he's looking at his cell phone watching some video or texting somebody . And that tractor -trailer leans on that air horn and it is loud right here at Mulberry Street and Washington . And because there's a building one side and a building on the another , that air horn magnifies that sound, Council . It's very annoying . So I want to know if we could do something about that air horn, Council . What it is is that since you have workers on the scaffolding -- I took a picture yesterday .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Here's a picture of a worker on the scaffolding . He has no railing . I know it's a little dark. But can you see that? He has no railing behind him. If he was to get startled -- if he was to get startled from an air horn of some impatient tractor -trailer driver, he's going to fall over backwards. He's higher than the stain glass window. He's going to get hurt, if not killed. So here's the solution , Council . I want to know -- if you could put a sign like this at Mulberry and Washington and the tractor -trailer driver cannot lean on that air horn because I'm telling you something , there may come a time when someone is going to get startled and he's going to fall off that scaffolding. And there will be a stain on this building until the end of time itself. It's only about a $50 sign, Council . You could put it on north and south at the intersection just temporarily as long as the scaffolding is there. Are there any questions , Council ? Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 The first thing I have here is, that I think before the city funds any housing projects in this city, somebody should actually enlightening themselves about migration of people from one area to another . And you might learn something . It might be eye opening . I think that people should look a little bit into what happened at The Hideout in the Poconos and migration there. But in general , there is a lot of data on migration . And I go to Kingston and Plymouth and I look at what migration has done there. And, you know, when I talk about public corruption , I mean, these project s being funded with federal and state money, we're living in a country now where the Social Security fund has been looted. And it's 175 trillion dollars down. And we can't fund our military . The Congressional budget office has said that we don't have an ability to fund our military . And if you want people to be successful in life, you have to offer them opportunity . They have to work, make a living. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 And when you're talking about seniors in their homes and they can't go to the second floor, well, maybe we should be using grant money to make it possible for them to have a bathroom and a shower built on the first floor of their home so they don't have to go up the steps, and that way they don't have to leave their home. And when they pass or something happens , they could sell the home and the next person that moves into it, they could modernize it or remodel or whatever . I think what the city's done over an extended period of time is refused to put any funding in the neighbor hood that benefit ed the residents of this city. And it's gone on for decades . We've had a lot of project s done here. Look at what happened with the Scranton parking garages . The resident s put all kind of money into that. Look where that took us. Look at the Scranton Sewer Authority all the money that was put there and what that did for us. And the list just goes on and on, South Side Sports Complex , Scranton 's golf course, you know, look it, we've got to come to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 a conclusion in order to turn this city around, we got to stop playing games with federal and state grant money because all it's doing is creating more blight and forcing more people out of the city. The people who fled this city were people who had an income and could get outside of corruption here and they've gone to other places like Clarks Summit and places nearby. They aren't going to play games here. But, you know, let's switch the -- let's switch this up a little bit. Since we had a meeting last week, Council President Smurl, have you or any of the Council members done anything about the perceived corruption in the Licensing and Inspections Department ? Do you have anything to report to the residents of this city about the remedial actions that this Council has taken for the benefit of the resident s and the 31 properties that were condemned by one inspector ? And maybe the Council itself should explain to the residents what an inspector has to do to become certified to run roughshod over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the community and how long is Tom Oleski going to be allowed to violate zoning law in the city? And I just would like to offer you an opportunity to respond . MR. SMURL: I believe every Council member responded to the administration over the questions last week. There were many question s that went in. Now, the response s we should have this week. I don't know how detailed or whatever . But, you know, we could only ask. MR. MORGAN: Oh, I think you could do much more than ask. I think you could investigate because the Home Rule Charter gives that authority . And you also have a right to go down and sit in the Mayor's office and tell the Mayor you're not going to tolerate this stuff and you need answers and you need change. You need a change of direction . The residents deserve that. The residents deserve a Council that understands that in order to move this city forward , somebody 's got to make a stand, make a change to the way the government functions . And it has to function for the benefit of the residents . And I think that the problem we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 in the city is we forget where the founding fathers got their ideas and what the government was founded to do. The government is founded to serve the people and that's not what's going on here. We got a government that's building of rental units, helping people move federal funds to special interest groups. That's not helping the resident s. That's forcing the resident s to flee the city. We've been backwards for a long time. We've elected the wrong people to offices for a very long time. The people in this city need to wake up and make a change. MR. SMURL: Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council . And the first thing I want to do is just to let the Gilmartin family know that each morning that he's covered with prayers and that, you know, it was just so inspirational to see the power of prayer. So to that family though, I continue to pray for them each day. And I know that we could just continue to expect a miracle in his case. Also I wanted to talk tonight about I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 guess it's rain water, stormwater at the corner of Olive and Colfax and the corner of Olive and Wheeler . And Doris could probably tell you more about it because Doris walks that way with her walker. The flood there each time that it rains it's way out in the middle of the street. And if it's cold, it's ice. So I don't know what can be done. Those two corners must be connected under the ground somewhere that they both flood out when there's a rain like we had today. MR. SMURL: Mr. Voldenberg , can you ask if we can get the vac track back out there? I know I request ed this in the fall. And they went out and it worked for a while. Evidently they filled up again at both corners, Olive and Colfax and Olive and Wheeler. MR. VOLDENBERG : It's an ongoing problem . I'll have them send a truck out tomorrow . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Sorry, Norma. MS. JEFFRIES : That's okay. And then it was good to hear that the street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 cleaning schedule is on the city website because I was out in Green Ridge the other day. And the street cleaner was busy cleaning Washington Avenue out and Green Ridge. So I thought maybe we're going to be next, but I doubt it because they are doing a lot of digging and replacement of pipes in my neighborhood . So we probably won't get a street cleaning this year. But it's always hopeful . The other thing that I wanted to talk about tonight was, you know, my favorite thing is street signs. And good old Facebook , it was down today. But when I was on earlier , I did get -- something popped up on my Facebook this morning at about 7:30. And I'm going to read it to you because I gave each one of you a copy of that posting that popped up on my Facebook this morning . And I would just like to read it so that the public can see what -- how long I've been up here asking about street signs. It was dated April the 22nd, 2021. This morning Mayor Paige Cognetti , Representat ive Marty Flynn and Representative 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Kyle Mullins announce a $306,000 PA Department of Economic Development Multimodel Transportation Grant to the City of Scranton to replace street signs in poor condition and install signs in locations where signs are absent. The street sign project is a long needed program that will improve emergency services and the aesthetics of our neighborhood s. The team -- the team is DPW is ready to go. That was in 2021. I'd like to know if someone could give me an update -- not me, just me alone, the city's residents as to this $306,000. I know at one time I was told that they had to rent some kind of a machine or scaffolding thing to get up to reach the street signs. So that gave me the impression that the street signs were maybe ready to go and all they were waiting for was this machine to install the street signs. So my question to, Council , if you could find a status of this particular information that I gave each of you and if you could just get back to the residents of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Scranton as to that $306,000. And if it hasn't been used, then it must be growing a lot of interest and sitting in an account somewhere . And like I said last week, I would love to start a business myself and hire people to get these street signs going. You know, we're going into this weekend is the parade. And, you know, there are people coming to town and there's so many signs that are in need or missing in our city. And we're better than that. Scranton is a better city than that that we should let our city go downhill and not fix our street signs, especially when in 2021 $306,000 was granted for that project . I don't know who was the project lead. But if you could just find that out for us. That would be wonderful . MR. SCHUSTER : Can you reach out to administration and ask for a breakdown of the $306,000 that was used for the street sign project ? I know we got an update on some of the street signs that were replaced . I feel like we had a database at some point in time. And I feel like this grant has been spent. MR. VOLDENBERG : It's been expended 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 and they're looking for additional grant at this time. MR. SCHUSTER : Can we just get a breakdown -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a breakdown on how the money was used. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. MR. KING: And an update in terms of how that project or process is going to move forward in 2024, if you could. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council , I'll say too it was wonderful to see Detective Gilmartin on television the other day. Okay, I'm here. I want to talk about Pennsylvania American Water again. First of all, I want to know -- I think they're supposed to decide their rate hike toward the end of this month. So I'm hoping that Council and the rest of the government people will be still putting pressure on the PUC so they don't think it was a one night meeting and they're going to forget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 about it. Now, I also want to say which I'm -- to me is a public service announcement . I don't know how many people in the city carry the protection plans with the water company . They have a protection plan that they sell for the sewer pipes coming -- once they hit your property , the outside ones. And they have a protect ion plan for the inside. I was paying last year $17.50 for combined, for the sewer outside and the inside which I just started taking after my husband passed away just for peace of mind even though I use my regular plumber . I receive d a notice in the mail that my stuff was going to be automatically renewed . And now the new price it was going to be automatically renewed. And now the new price -- it was going to be automatically renewed March 29th at the price 13.99 a month for the indoor pipes and 28.49 for the outdoor pipe, which, of course, I knew if I called they would lower it because last year I called and they lowered it. I'm sure they have no intention of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 really collecting that amount of money. But if don't call to have it lowered and they are afraid not to take it, they will collect that kind of money. To me they are like the mafia. So I made my phone call and said I'm disconnecting my service for that. Don't renew my policy. And, of course, they sent me to the cancelation lady who said, oh, wait a minute. Let's see if I could help you out. So what she did was, she helped me out to a raise of a total $3.73 more for both plans -- together totally $21.23 for both plans. So instead of $42.48, it will be now be $21.27 for the two combined plans which they automatically put on your water bill. So my public service announcement is for anybody listening and anybody to spread around to their friends, please call the number there and tell them you are going to cancel because to me this is a lot of crap. And I'm not sure they're doing the same thing with the PUC with the water rate hike. They probably never intended to actually be able to get that much and possibly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 will cut it down. But they may cut it down a little bit so everybody says, oh, well, wow, at least they cut it down. And I know Council can't really do anything about this. But I want people to know and spread the word and spread the word to your friends and neighbors that are homeowners , okay, so is basically what I came to talk about today. But now that you said something about sending a truck out for Olive and Colfax which I did mention last week about the water problem there, is this truck thing, like, to clean the sewers like they used to 100 years ago is that where -- because it's coming back up out of the sewer because they could actually send a truck over to Mulberry and Colfax because you have to -- like, when I cross the street that way, I have to go around into Mulberry instead of going up the curb cut on Colfax because the water comes out of the sewer there too. So if the guy's going to be in the neighborhood , maybe he could check that out. It's not near as bad. It's not like a giant, giant thing. But it is a big puddle that you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 want to walk around. MR. SMURL: Mr. Voldenberg , add that to the list. Thank you. MS. KOLOSKI : I came to the -- at the end of the caucus. And I heard them talking about affordable housing , which was my big thing when they were ripping down all the houses. One of the questions I might want to ask is if anybody thought of if they're going to build smaller homes on some empty lots of looking into maybe modular homes. I think modular homes are much cheaper . I know there's some modular homes up on East Gibson Street that are very nice. So that might be helpful . I don't know if anybody ever -- I know there's going to be empty lots where they tore things down. We probably need some housing like Park Gardens which I believe is like a rental control . But it's not like a project housing . And, you know, all of those empty lots that are -- that the Commonwealth bought when they -- Mercy and Moses and they were going to hook up and all of that. And it's all barren land that they have never done anything 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 with. I don't know if anybody in the city's ever approached them to see if they wanted to sell it. You know, maybe it will -- a price just to get rid of it, get it off their tax things. And maybe they could put some kind of housing there. And when you're walking about living in place, I myself live in a two-story house. And I have chairlifts on the front steps that were put in by the veterans for me. They go up to the one step half way and up the other. The veterans put in a handicap shower upstairs for me. I had the veterans put in wheelchair ramp. It's all part of the veterans benefit s. So when you're talking about revamping houses, maybe people don't have to move out of their two story and you don't have to build a big bathroom downstairs . You may be able to do these other things. They're expensive . I believe those chair lift things are like $10,000. And that was, like, one of the things that the hospital 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 was trying to buy my house. I was trying to tell them. Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: And your 421 next door is on the demolition list for this spring. MS. KOLOSKI : Thank you. MR. SMURL: I didn't do it. Patrick Eagan. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , the basins that are on Colfax, I believe that they are American Water basins. If they end up being American Water basins, we would have to contact American Water to do the cleanouts, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll contact both DPW and American Water. I'll have them up there. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. EGAN: Members of Council , thank you for taking the time to hear us out. My name is Patrick Egan. I represent Kelly Towing and Kelly Motors. I'm also here in attendance with Mike Moletski from Keyser Valley Auto Wreckers and Moletski Towing. Together each of our business have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 been in Scranton for a combine d 75 years. We have 56 employees throughout all of our enterprise s. And we strongly believe in the city, the resonance it's going through and what our roles in it are as both business owners, employers , neighbor s and members of the community that we all call home. It's because of this I'd like to address several concern s that we have with the Towing Ordinance of 2024 that's being introduced today. We feel that a lot of these concerns that we have limit our ability to provide the level of service required and that the city does need provided . There's a major disconnect between towing which is the general term for our industry . And it's a conventional and routine service as compare d to the more advanced recovery services which are required when vehicles end up in different locations . Because of this, the amount of equipment and personnel require d to remove vehicle s from these different location s is expensive , not only to mobilize but for us to maintain as companies and to be able to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 continue to offer these services . We do feel that the Mayor did a great job reaching out and bringing us all together in a meeting but that a lot of our input and opinions were lost among other voices and concern s and that we are not really being heard out and able to share our inputs and expertise . We'd like to state that we totally support the goal of the towing ordinance but that its execution has a lot of major flaw points that do set it up for failure in our opinion . And it doesn't address some of the biggest concerns , the largest of which involves safety issues both for our personnel and the general public. Our major concern because of the structure and lack of flexibility for us to make judgment calls in our profession that we will not be able to properly and adequately employ the resources we have invested in to perform jobs efficiently and most important ly safely as possible for both our team members and the public as a whole. We also feel this does not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 accurately represent the massive increase in costs to insurance equipment and labor that we like all businesses have absorbed in the last four years. The investment we have made in order to provide the level of service s that our customer s and the city deserves aren't really reflect ed in this deal. We'd ask that you simply hear us out on some of our concerns before making a final decision on this ordinance because we do want to continue to be able to provide the best service possible to the city, to our customer s and do so while providing a safe working environment for our employee s and being able to complete jobs efficiently and safely as possibly and not trying to cut corners, which is encouraged with this proposed ordinance . I would just like to thank you for your time and if we could have time to address some of the more specific concerns . MR. KING: Patrick , is it possible for you to send an e-mail to Mr. Voldenberg listing exactly what your -- bullets of what your concerns are so that -- I think the ordinance will probably be introduced tonight . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 That's the reason that we typically have three readings before anything is passed. If you submit to us exactly what issues -- I know that there was a committee formed. Mr. Smurl and I were there initially with the Mayor when we met with all of you and an agreement that all of the towers would get together as a committee and then submit some changes. And I believe some of those changes -- a lot of them I think were made to the original ordinance that was present ed. Apparently , not everybody 's voice was heard. So if you could forward those issues or concern s that you have, that would allow us and then what will happen is, Mr. Voldenberg will get those to each of us. And that will give us the opportunity to reach out to the administration and try to get some answers and see if there's, you know, anything that can be done to change it. As I said, it will likely get introduced tonight . That will give us time to be able to identify those issues. MR. EGAN: Great. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. KING: All right. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, Mr. Egan, thank you for coming tonight to voice that. We would not know that if you were not here tonight . MR. EGAN: Thank you very much. We really appreciate your time. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Michael Moletski . MR. MOLETSKI : Good evening , Council , Mike Moletski , Keyser Valley Auto Wreckers , Moletski Towing, also here about the introduction of the towing ordinance . Reiterate what Pat said, Mr. Egan, he brought a lot of valid points. I think I don't need to get into everything . Mr. King brought up everything he said where we could send all of our concerns over. A lot of our voices weren't heard. The committee went and submitted some stuff. And I don't think it all -- it was what everybody wanted or was expecting . So if we could just submit them over to you guys and you guys could review them. We could move forward . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mr. Moletski , will you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 also contact the other -- the group that you formed because I spent many, many hours with them discussing all of this. And so I didn't hear everybody 's exact concern s. We heard the general thing. Basically what the city wants to do is get out of the towing business . There is no pay a fee to start or to be a part of it anymore. There's no paying the city a penny. You don't have to pay the city for storage like it used to be. You don't have to pay the city for every tow that you do like it used to be. So there's a ton of that that's gone to make it fair. And then now the distance it's a three-mile radius now instead of a five so to try and, you know, I assume to help our local businesses and keep it local. And if there are other things, maybe get back with that because I assumed it was formed to bring us all of that information . And evidently I didn't receive it all. MR. MOLETSKI : As far as the old contract paying the city, I don't know if there was ever problem s with any of that. But moving forward with this new ordinance , there's -- you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 know, we're -- there's stuff that we could discuss we're moving backward, you know, we're moving backwards almost 30 years with stuff. MR. SMURL: I believe paying to be part of a towing company or to be part of a list in the City of Scranton to be a tower is not the right way to go. MR. MOLETSKI : Okay. Yeah, we'll get our concerns over and we'll move forward , okay? Thank you. MR. SMURL: Yes. We'll probably introduce it but get your question s and stuff in so we can -- so we have it because the old one is expired . MR. MOLETSKI : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, I'm sorry, I thought there was some people ahead of me. It seemed like our Mayor is more interested in pickleball than concern of sitting here for an hour listening to comments by interested parties . Last week I asked a few simple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 questions regarding Cartwell 's{phonetic } $3,000 rental property , the assessments and the taxes and so on. Did anybody have any knowledge of anything or is that supposed to be swept under the rug? I guess not. I hope we don't end up as taxpayers having to subsidize the rent on this place. That ought to be prohibited on paper. How much money did the city blow on this deal anyway? Do you know how much we investigated in it? MR. SMURL: In what deal? MR. ELLMAN: I'm just wondering it just -- last week it just -- in the paper it just said the city invested something -- had a little investment in it. MR. SMURL: Oh, in that new building , the new structure that they built. Oh, yes, yes, the city their -- the city's investment was $200,000. MR. ELLMAN: That's not so bad. I talked to three our four people this week. Everybody thinks Cartwell already has someone in mind to rent the place. I hope they have a large income and lived here five or ten years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 and not somebody they're bringing in like our Mayor came 3,000 away. In a short time we're facing an unjustable rash of coming tax increases like the reassessment . You know, I forgot what year it was. But Gerald Cross -- I know you people are familiar with Mr. Cross. It must be like 10 years ago. He said the city was 8 million dollars -- had lost 8 million dollars of worth. Since then everybody has done nothing except raise taxes to try to overcome this. That doesn't seem to work. Since Janet Evans tried to do something about these phoney non-profits hiding behind the Pure Charity Act, no one has -- no one has done anything about all of these parasites living off the city. You know, this week there was something on television . A woman took some salary money from -- $100,000 from the ARC. They have bought house after house after house in nice neighborhoods all around the city. But the money goes to the Abington . All we do is lose is property . This has got to stop. But nobody seems to care. You people were jumping up and down a couple months 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 ago about doing something about non-profits and then it died out. MR. SMURL: Mr. Ellman, it didn't die out. You will have that report soon within the next few weeks, the first phase of it is done. So we will be getting a report of how many that we believe that we can go after in the first phase. It didn't go away. It is being done. MR. ELLMAN: I'm not expecting something immediately , but why don't you tell the -- once in a while what's -- give us some good news about something . MR. SMURL: I'd like to. MR. ELLMAN: People sitting here about the water bills and everything else. I'll tell you, I hear such sad stories about the city. Low income housing is not a good thing. It destroys a good neighborhood like mine. And then here comes undesirable s for low income housing that's even worse. I can't walk my dog where I used to because of really some bad rough people just sitting there. They don't go to work or nothing . I don't know what they're good for. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 I want to thank Council for allowing me to speak tonight . But I still -- I still say this area just reeks from the sour stench of graft and corruption . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. SMURL: James Hogan. Mark Margavitch . MR. MARGAVITCH : So tonight I'm going to start with the condemnation process . I don't know if many people are familiar with it. But I've been through it twice, one successfully and we -- all of Council know the one unsuccess ful one. When a place gets condemned , you have two choices. You have an appeal within 20 days or you have the general inspection done where electrical , HVAC, mechanical and plumbing come out. They'll give you a list and you have to repair those deficiencies by a licensed contractor and then have it reinspected to get it released . I went through it one time, went through the process probably back in 2009. And then I'm going to talk about my other situation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 I've been talking about. When I did have a place condemned and it was released to me without going through the appeal process or without going through the general inspection process . So back in 2010 I had a tenant that fell behind in rent. When I went to the magistrate , I did file for the possession . The day I filed for possession was November 8th of 2010. Coincidently , the city came and condemned my house for infestation on November 8th of 2010. When the tenant had notified me of these bedbugs, I called an exterminat or on October 30th. They found no bedbugs and the tenant got very upset and cursed at the exterminator and he left. I did call in a second exterminator before November 8th and the same situation was found and even a third one after my house was condemned . So I moved ahead with the eviction process . And then they filed two things on that day, the city. It was infestation and the electrical hazard. So I already knew the infestation was not a legitimate concern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 because of -- I had exterminator s there. And certainly this code enforcement official wasn't more competent than three exterminators , two at the time but one after. So when I asked this person what is the electric hazard -- now some of you might know my background is a long-time landlord and a long-time contract or. So it's a tough hill to go up when you're going to talk about homes with me. So I asked her what was the violation . And I did not receive it. So after that I then went to her boss at the time which was Deputy Director Tom Oleski. I had several conversations with Tom over the month from November -- probably November 10th or so to December 3rd. Tom admitted that they don't get involved when evictions are in process , but here they did. And it definitely made the situation very, very confusing. So I made -- after the electrical -- excuse me -- the attempts to get the electrical current violation , on November 9th was my last day to file for the appeal. So I wanted that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 information so I could file -- I wanted to know if there truly was an electrical violation . I never received that information with several requests to the city before that day. But on November 30th, I finally did get a letter to address the electrical code violation . On that letter -- I do have it here. I'll read it, like, word for word what this person said. It said as for the electrical hazards , when you set up a general inspection, the qualified electrical inspector will be able to give you his report. So essentially , this person condemn ed my house for an electrical violation and then told me someone else will tell me what's wrong with it because she had no clue. That's as simple as that. To this day, I never got the electrical violation that happened . So then continuing , I did speak with Mr. Oleski several times on December 3rd and then I followed up because I want to know what the deal was with the appeal. On the 6th and 7th I left phone calls and the 8th I finally sent another letter to the city.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 I received nothing . So then I sent a letter to the Mayor on January 7th. Once again, I heard nothing . This was Mayor Doherty . Finally I found the lady, I think she felt sorry for me. Her name was Stephanie and she actually got me going in the right direction . She got in touch with Mark Seitzinger who was the head of Licensing and Inspections at the time. And Mark came out. He came out to my place. I invited him in. And he actually came out and he looked up and said, oh, wow, you got smoke detector s. I said yes. He said, oh, you got GFCIs. I said yes. I always had. And it was like he was shocked that I had them, maybe based on the other department 's information . So the weird thing that came from meeting with Mark was, he did give me the release . But in it he also said in the future, he said, just an FYI, you have 20 days to appeal. Now obviously he wasn't aware that I had appealed to Tom Oleski and to the other inspector who did condemn it. So I did get my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 building back without an appeal. And in the city, they said that I fixed the issue a couple weeks ago. They said I fixed the issue. I couldn't fix the issue because I wasn't -- I wasn't licensed to fix those issues. So there was no issue that was fixed contrary to them saying that an issue was fixed because there was no general inspection done. And but, yeah, I did receive my house back without a general inspection and also without an appeal. But I did try to appeal. But I was denied that appeal as well. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Margavitch . MR. MARGAVITCH : Oh, that's it? All right. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Joseph Marshal . Rick Little. Rick, you're up. MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , I'm Rick Little formally of Scranton Housing Authority . I've been homeless now for 30 days. And I'd like to report to the city about what it's like. These are the same clothes I had on 30 days ago, same thing. I've been thinking about this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 because I, you know, thinking how I got evicted . I've lived there 14 years. And most of that time I was fighting for my child in family court. And so I learned a little bit about the law and how it works. And one thing I really learned is people in law hate Pro se litigants . But under the situation , I mean, they're taking your child away and you get a public defender that you could get. And I had many of them. And I weeded them out and worked with them. But the thing that really kills you is they assign a lawyer for your child. And that's what's happening all across America , especially since 1966, you know, after Betty Friedan 's book and that feminism started and everybody 's rights and the black and white rights, I lived all through this. You know, and I'm looking at it now and I'm seeing the fentanyl , all of these heros of mine just dying from fentanyl overdoses . And it's the worst it's ever been. I mean, they're coming over the border with fentanyl and people are dying. And this is worse -- I mean, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 remember the opioid thing in like 2000. That was really bad. And I especially remember the whole, you know, crack, AIDS of the 80s. But it's a sad situation . We -- and I'm looking at the, you know, the city's solution for this to make it look like there's caretakers because everybody is a caretaker . Everybody is a 5013C. And they have no idea of the evil that they're involved in. I mean, these are good people. They have a job. They're doing it. They're asking, you know, provide the papers. I was amazed. There's actually a paper that you have to provide when you become homeless . It's called proof of homelessness paper. And I got one. It took a long time to get one. But you get it over at 409 Olive Street, the shelter . There's 20 beds there. And you could stay there for 30 days and that's it. You know, but this is Catholic Services . And you walk around the corner and you see, you know, refugee housing and everything and, you know, like there's all kinds of housing -- anything having to do with women or drug addicts, there's all kinds of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 5013Cs. I'm looking at the Recovery Bank and all these people are there. It's the 5013Cs. That's the biggest problem . That's the problem because -- because , I mean, Scranton Housing Authority is a 5013C. And what has happened is, that that 5013C has garnered all of these other 5013Cs, Lackawanna Pro Bono, and Northeast Penn Legal, and especially the Area Agency on Ageing. Is there anybody who's watching this or anybody in the room who could tell me that they have had a positive experience from the Area Agency on Aging? Because as far as I could see, it's just an another funnel for federal funds. And what I'm talking about is the ERAP because I have a letter saying, oh, Scranton Housing Authority which is run by the District Attorneys and, I mean, why do we have housing people that are all of these lawyers that have all of these judges in their pockets that are making salaries , you know, 10 times any one of you up there is making to be the head of housing because it's going -- it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 coming down the pike of what the housing is. And I wanted to end -- I want to give you -- he's the head of the school board. That's the same thing with the school board. He gives a little speech at the end, you know, there's a waiting list. No kidding . It's a three-year waiting list anywhere and maybe somebody could get in that will pay the rent unlike Mr. Little. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Dave Dobrzyn . Dave, is that you? It doesn't look like your regular signature . MR. DOBRZYN : -- the anthracite hillbilly if you want. Yeah, I'm from Central Pennsylvania about 900 people in the town. Okay, now, 5013Cs and C4s have come up tonight . And the only two -- well, there is three things about them. Number one, I don't want a 501C3 running my city. I don't want a 501C3 running my life. The first woman in Texas died from a miscarriage and septic shock because the doctor couldn't act upon it. And tax relief, 37 and a half or 37 percent is not an acceptable figure. So if the state wants it, so be it. But -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 it's time for them to kick in and over 20 percent or something and start replacing the money and not asking the taxpayer , last guy in the church pew to pay. Detective Gilmartin came up tonight . And the one thing I would like to say is that it is not legal for a kid under 21 years of old -- age to possess a handgun , period. They won't be sold one. And you can't turn one over to them legally . And if it's parents , please lock them up. And if it's somebody else, well, if it's stolen or whatever then -- or sold on the street, then somebody needs to be held responsible . A fire also came up -- or flood. But I think we should try and get tax relief for anybody with a domestic disaster . And a lot of times flags come up here. Don't rag about flags. Call your Congress . Call a Congress man even if he's from another district , especially for aid for Ukraine . I can't see the value with my health, to put a Ukrainian flag out front. But those people are being killed in droves and the Russians are advancing again. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 They were guarantee d their own peaceful country 30 years ago. And now once again Indian givers, an assault upon intelligence because we're the ones that took the white people. But a Russian giver might be a more appropriate term. And the water, if I have to go up and down Crown Avenue to each address with a missing curb and if they don't replace it and get a class action suit to do it, I'd love some help. Now last week I kind of got a little bit too late on dementia . And people are saying that people aren't suitable for office because they're old or whatever . And I've seen it with people in my life. And dementia takes many forms. It doesn't always make somebody quiet and contemplative . It could make them confrontational . I had an old guy ask me if I was going to vote for the Donald a couple years ago. And he started screaming at me in the supermarket . I said no. You know, and I had somebody -- talked to on the phone and he was all fired up about donations to St. Jude. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 Another person told me that's not a religious world in Kosovo. That's the Christians and the Muslims . I mean, you know, we all get -- I have trouble remembering people's names sometime s and it's really weird because I could -- there's whole baskets full of CDs that I could jam along with on the guitar and stuff. But I forget names, you know, I just forget them. And, you know, it's -- I'll be 70 on April 11th. So it's just really like we're kind of stuck with Joe as democrats . And I wish some people would cool it and forget this whole -- consider -- just like he said, consider the alternative . I'm going to suspend the Constitution on the first day. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, good evening , members of Council . First, I want to congratulate the Scranton Times on doing the critical story of the -- of our Electric City sign doppelganger being used on the Willy Wonka movie that appeared in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Thursday 's paper and then a second time on Friday's paper, way to fill space. Now off to the races. Tonight we're going to discuss Council 's operations . Last week one of the presenters asked if there was a conflict with any Council member and Director Oleski. All parties answered no. The Council President volunteered he often has to deal with him in his position , which is understandable as the Council President and director 's position often run hand-in-hand. But Mr. Smurl is, in fact, banned from any discussion based upon potential ethical and criminal actions due to perjury , any misconduct or disciplinary actions including executive sessions and meeting s with any department on the matter. While acting as a member of this body, Mr. Smurl on taking the position in Council said he would not take on bids for contracts in city because of potential conflict s of interest . But Mr. Smurl's business is directly dependent on License , Inspections and Permits and does run in the City of Scranton , HVAC contractor s in the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 and because of that, it causes a direct financial conflict with Licenses and Inspections . And the Ethics Code is clear. Anything that even suggests a conflict or can be construed as impropriety , it mandates that the person with the conflict not only recuse themselves from any vote but bars them as well from any conversations or deliberations . At this point if Mr. Oleski comes in up in conversation s, the Council 's Vice President should take over the discussion . It's just an ethical violation because of a direct conflict with financial interest . Next we have an issue of Council saying that terminating an employee is an administrative function and they have no power to intervene . Even legal Council opined on it. I had a brief conversation with one of the designer s of the City Charter and the separation of powers that were crafted after the federal legislation in Executive Branch with a few exceptions . Part of this separation of powers and a checks and balances are what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 unfortunately is lacking . The intent of Council having to approve directors was so that the administration cannot stack the deck. This was a primary check and balance on the Mayor, department heads who are being responsible to both parties . The failure is -- that no one considered is what happens when you have someone who is corrupt and one side refuses to act on it. You say your body has no power that you only have say in hiring a director , which Mr. Oleski is and that terminations are the scope of the administration only. I say you need to then take a step forward to correct the charter and the legislative branch. You do have the power to give yourself the combined ability to force a termination of a director . It's easy to be helpless when you refuse to act. Fix the issue. Give yourself the power to remove corrupt directors . Do your job. Legislate . Thank you. MR. SMURL: No one else on the list. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. SCUTNICK : Brian 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Scutnick {phonetic ) West Side. So three weeks ago we had the conversation -- I wasn't here for it. I watched it. So with Tom giving quite a presentation there I was going to ask Jerry something . But we'll go to Mr. Schuster . So three weeks ago it was said that with the 31 houses condemned under one inspector without a certification that it goes to Mr. Oleski to make the decision , right? MR. SCHUSTER : That's what was said to you us, yes. MR. SCUTNICK : Okay. So since I'm on you, do you have any law enforcement experience and enforcement experience at all in that matter? MR. SCHUSTER : No law enforcement . MR. SCUTNICK : Mark, we're really good friends after last week I think, right? So how about you? MR. MCANDREW : Zero. MR. SCUTNICK : Okay. So would it make any sense for you to provide Schuster permission to go write a speeding ticket? Tom (inaudible ) the IMP certification as the director making the decisions . Does that make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 any sense? MR. MCANDREW : We got answers . He'll report them Fifth Order. The questions you're talking about, Mr. Schuster got answers . MR. SCUTNICK : Okay. So then onto since there was the person with 31 condemnations , I'm going to bring it up to -- I mean, you guys are the legislative side of it, right? How about something that does a background check on these people? One specific person sued five times by five different people for home improvement fraud, home improvement charges that were all over the news. And now this is a person of public trust that's going to come after you for what your house looks like? Does that make any sense? No? Same person could write a falsified affidavit to tell the city after he's outside of my house taking picture s with his cell phone not in city policy that it's stalking because he's at my house and then claims he's followed over 10 times, doesn't have dates, doesn't have times. City tells him, well, you should go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 to the magistrate . So he goes to magistrate and tries to say the same thing, can't even tell the magistrate what color vehicle follows him. Any of that sound like a legit person that should be here? No? Nobody has answers ? Why is there no background checks? It's really quiet. MR. MCANDREW : I requested background checks and vetting of employee s and board members of all the authorities . MR. SCUTNICK : So why isn't it done? MR. MCANDREW : Fell on deaf ears. I did request that in my tenure here. MR. SCUTNICK : You just had a person that was in code enforcement recently that had several counts of retail theft and they're out there making public trust decisions . You know what I mean? It went all over WNEP for ripping off a homeowner , charges and everything . Now they're deciding if you could do the same job on your own house. It doesn't really make any sense besides somebody owed somebody a favor, right? So and then we have Kaylee Pikulski . I mean, we'll get to HR here. I went and I filed a bunch of right to knows. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 One of hers tried to claim that the reason of three people leaving code enforce ment was my fault. So we'll get to the last three people that left. One of them, you guys got a seven-page letter from. Anyone want to deny it? You got a seven-page letter reporting misconduct and illegal activity . Another one was given a timeframe to report that she lived in Scranton . Her IPMC certification says she lives in Tobyhanna that she turned into the city. So Tom Oleski was very aware she didn't even live in the city or the county. But it went on. And the third one got fired because she couldn't pass the test. But Kaylee Pikulski could get sworn statement s saying that these three people quit because of me. I live with one of them. Does that make any sense to you? But this is your administration , the same lady that didn't have a clue anything about FMLA law that kind of ran her mouth to an employee trying to act like she knew telling an employee that nine days after an employee hands her FMLA paperwork1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 that she signed approved , nine days later tells her I want new FMLA paperwork because I didn't think you were going to use it. What intelligence does that have? It has none. All it ended up is getting you guys a lawsuit . Do you know what I mean? Like, these are the people that everybody is appoint ing but they're just costing everybody in this room money because they don't have a clue what they're doing. That's all. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . I would like to say that bravery and strength are what determines a Scranton Police Officer . Welcome home Detective Kyle Gilmartin . I promised here this evening that I'd come back and talk about how to fix things around here. And I'm going to do that for the duration of the next 4 minutes and 30 seconds if I can. It starts with blight. If you notice in the City of Scranton you have major thoroughfares like North Main, South Main Avenue. You have the side streets like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 Luzerne Street, Washburn Street and such. If you notice predominantly through out our 27.7 square miles that encompasses Scranton and side of it, you're going to see a lot of streets. And when you see these major thoroughfares , if you notice, the first block going in from these main streets are possible most of the blight that we have in the city, not to mention our major thoroughfares . So what's happening here is, our communities are collapsing upon each other. And when you have this and you had it for a length of time, the blight actually pushes beyond our city limits. We recently had (inaudible ) pulled from Nicholson , Mayfield , Old Forge. So as we have paid 55 percent of the tax base for the county, as we fonder, so does the rest of Lackawanna County and the surrounding areas. It's up to each one of you as legislators with your Chairs to continue to try to do the right thing. I mention ed this railway system and the fact that we're nowhere near ready for it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Here's my plan as far as blight. It's getting the community involved . That's leaning on our neighborhood watch programs , our neighborhood leaders. We have a lot of these kids that are doing things like breaking into cars, things like that. We had magistrate s that push them through . My recommendation would be to take those individuals whether community service , allow them to work with the neighborhood watch programs like West Side Neighborhood Watch, Green Ridge, Hill Neighborhood Association , South Side. They have good people there. But they are short of people. So it's going to be a heavy lift. But we need the community involvement and that starts with our neighborhood watch. So what I would like to see is our youth go through this neighborhood watch, have the neighborhood watch program allow for, like, on the weekend s where we had blighted properties . And we have the permits and licensing . And now we're adding two additional cars to the force. Is our goal to actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 reduce the number of vehicle s? I would recommend that instead of fining people, give them a timeline to actually give a choice as to opposed to a fine because if you're just fining people, we don't have the ability to collect it. All right? They're just pieces of paper until it's -- when these are actually received . So we have to take a proactive approach . That would be to have the community involvement. Say on Saturday s you have people from the neighborhood watch. You go out to specific properties and have them work with the people to fix up the properties . You have the community involvement . You have the neighborhood watch giving you a chance to know the individuals and bringing communities together . I think that's important . We have to go back to old school to fix these problems because once this railway system comes through , we're not going to fix this blight. What you're doing is, you're prevent ing the homeowner s, property owner's full profit potential on their investment . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 a house isn't just somewhere you live. It's not where you drop the anchor. It's a true investment of what you're future is going to hold. You know, and as we increase our taxes, we want to just make sure that our blight is in place because you want to have the true value of that property based upon millages that we pay on a yearly basis. That's going to come to fruition at some point. But you can't choke the property owners because of this blight. Blight is very important in our community . And it needs to be address ed because , you know, you have these kids, they come through these -- our communities and they see this blight. And it causes them to do bad things as opposed to good ones. You know, we want to try and have our children with a future here in Scranton . And when they go to college only 25 percent of them stay. So I think it's very important that we become proactive on our approach when it comes to involvement with blight. I'll be back next week. Thank you, Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a couple comment s. I know that -- I think I saw it on Facebook recently . There was question s about the Robinson Park Project . And I reached out to Scott Gassenmeyer today. In fact, he reached out to me about a week or two ago trying to reach out to somebody from the East Mountain Neighborhood Association . I gave him a cell phone number and I spoke to him today to find out -- he's suppose d to go up there and meet with the neighborhood association to give them an update. I believe even bids are going out this week for that project that's going to happen up at Robinson Park. So he told me a meeting is probably going to happen within the next week or two. So that's a good thing that we'll be able to get that project moving. Also, we received an e-mail today from someone about Meadow Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 between River Street and Moosic Street. And the individual was right. It's a mess. There's potholes . I noticed that they tried to fill several of them in the last day or two. But I know for a fact that Meadow Avenue is on the paving list. And that's going to be not only paved but then restriped . It's on the spring paving list. So that would be Meadow Avenue between River and Moosic Street. Also, it was mention ed about the nonprofit s. And I believe Mr. Smurl mentioned something that the company that we hired is out there doing the HUP test. And it's sounding like they may be identifying a few that their status may be changing soon. Let's put it that way. So we shall see. But we didn't just shelve that, Mr. Ellman. That process is moving forward . And we expect a report back in short order. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. The first one I'm going to make is that I'd like to say I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 had the pleasure to attend Detective Gilmartin 's homecoming last Friday. It was a great event. He is definitely progressing well healthwise . And the message to the city that he gave was perfect for this moment in time. There's a couple questions we had in the last few weeks that we did get some answers to. The first one I will start with is Councilman Schuster asked the following questions . Are the city inspectors and code enforcement department certified for both inspections and condemnations and may they perform these duties prior to certification under IPMC. The answer we got was that inspectors must work with their managers , Tom Oleski and Andrew Sunday. In order to condemn a property both Mr. Oleski and Mr. Sunday are BCOs. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we just clarify this a little bit further ? Could they explain -- give us a explanation of how this is allowed , where this is allowed under, and how the city works through this process with signoffs from superiors . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 MR. SCHUSTER : And also while we're at it, if there's any plans to do background checks when hiring city employees . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that also. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. The next one was on the Serrenti Center. It's been something that's come up often. So we asked for updates on the Serrenti Center, what work has been completed , what work is pending , what's the time utilization from the city and by whom is the facility used. We got that the following work has been completed : Roofing , exterior repointing and repainting , plumbing , the simulator and SID room and the HVAC. It also states that they have plans for interior and electrical work for classrooms and an evidence room which are being reviewed and they will bid out this year. And we also asked about getting an upcoming caucus. So it says future Council caucus can be planned and please remember that the Serrenti Center is not a public facility . So it's not a public facility . But I don't know if anyone on Council disagrees , but if we could have Mr. Voldenberg start to look for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 date for a Council caucus on an update or Serrenti Center. I don't think it's a huge rush but I think in the next few months. Thank you. One of the other questions was that I asked again for the Rubicon rollout. And the answer I got was members of the administration including Director of Technology Jack Reager met with this topic in person with Councilman Schuster and Council man Smurl on the 22nd. They did meet with us about Rubicon . It was a very informative meeting . We were informed that the rollout wouldn't occur in January . But I wasn't given the date of the rollout. So if we could just let them know it was a very informative meeting . But the rollout date wasn't given to us at that meeting . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all for this evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I also first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 wanted to welcome Detective Gilmartin back home. I'm sure he has continued work and recovery from his injuries . But we're glad to have him back here in Scranton . I'm happy to see how proud we are to see the work that he's already done and that he's recovering and on the right path. I wanted to also bring up a couple of the responses that we received from the administration . So first one, I think a number of us have asked about this before. And we've had several complaint s about 125-127 North St. Francis Cabrini Avenue and that property whether it could be condemned based on being a nuisance property with a number of Scranton Police calls that have been there in the past. And so Chief Carroll had given us a response that there weren't any recent confirmed gun incident s at this location . I guess that was one of the concerns . But they're going to work together along with code enforcement to determine if the property is, in fact, a nuisance property and if it needs to be condemned based on that. So I think we've asked for that for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 a while. I'm not sure why they're just now working on that. But I'm glad to hear that they are. And hopefully they'll come to a determination if that's appropriate . And another request that I had had was on the demolition property so they did provide us with an update on what properties have been demolished so far within this year and then which ones are going to be included in spring projects . And one of the properties that we had -- or I had gotten a lot of questions on specifically and whether that was on the list is 1068 Cottage Avenue. So it is listed here but it does have the caveat that an asbestos report was completed on the property in November of 2023 and then title search is underway because the city had a question about whether or not it had a new owner; and, if possible , this would be another property to prioritize for the spring demolition . And one more update that we had also received , Miss Shelly Prat McHugh with Moms Demand Action, she spoke here a few weeks ago and she had a number of question s that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 Mayor had responded to. So I'm just going to forward those responses along to her with regards to that. And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I got a couple comments . So I have responses from two inquiries over the past couple weeks. So the first one is regarding the 300 fee for an appeal via code enforcement . And, you know, I wanted the rational e for the 300 nonrefundable fee that, you know, if you're going in to fight a $50 fee, you still got to pay 300, which I thought was ridiculous . But here's what I got. Here's the answer I got. The 300 fee for code enforcement appeals is legislated via city ordinance . The appeal fee covers legal fees charged by the appeals board solicitor , the solicitor bills $150 per hour for preparation of cases and attendance at meeting s. This fee is nonrefundable . So that's the answer I got. And then another inquiry about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 dispatcher on weekend s for DPW. These were concerns brought to me when we had two bad weather events. We didn't have a lot of snow. But, you know, they were on the weekend s. And in the past historically I was told by workers that this is the case. They have a dispatcher when they know there's a snowstorm coming up to alleviate , you know, all of these calls of having their streets plowed or missed. They had no one to call. So this is the response I got. So due to collect ive bargaining agreement of DPW employees , dispatch does not operate on the weekend s. Well, it used to be. So I don't know what happened . Dispatch is staffed Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. When winter weather or major storms are in the forecast , we may staff dispatch on weekends utilizing overtime . The city monitors for pending weather events and will always respond during weather emergencies . So I guess they say they kind of have one on weekend s but weekends it's not that clear. And then Mr. Spindler -- Les 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 Spindler had a -- you know, every once in a while he has a great idea. And I like the fact that two weeks ago he brought up, you know, hey, we do a lot of cold patching, which doesn't the last very long. And he said, you know, Wilkes-Barre has a hot patch or whatever you want to call it a hot -- a pothole machine . And after him being here two weeks ago I was out somewhere . I don't know where it was and somebody came up to me and said, you know, Mark, the city had one years ago. I said what happened to it. He goes, I don't know but the city at one point had one. So, you know, it's a pretty good idea. We're throwing a lot of ARPA money around the past couple months. Maybe this is an investment that would be worthwhile we can look into. Can you reach out to the city and ask, you know, if they could look back and see when we had one, how did it work out, what's the deal, how come we don't have one. There might be somebody on staff still in DPW that might remember it and see if we could get some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 information about maybe having that added to the capital list next year. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And the rest I'm going to save for when we introduce the towing contract proposal -- ordinance , I'm sorry. That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few things. The legislation on Deacon Street for the traffic change, legislation is being prepared . The administration is submitting legislation to vacate Gardner Street to -- it was a dead end. And that also -- legislation is also being prepare d for that. City Council was asked by residents questioning the public health coordinator position , two out of the three years of the grant given to the city by Moses Taylor Foundation for Public Health Coordinator position were fulfill ed. The grant funding expires in June. The Moses Taylor Foundation has agreed to fund the position for one more year when the position is filled. The position is posted on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 the city's website . And we're actively searching for a candidate to fill that position at this time. The Theodore Street bridge, naturally everyone knows now it is closed. There are major repairs being done on it. The city did take up barriers and blocked the street. And they also provided signage to direct traffic around that street being closed. The administration had advised me when I asked that Norfolk Southern was contact ed and asked if they would be paying for the cost of the equipment or the barriers being put up and all of the signage, and they have agreed to pay for that. Also (inaudible ) River Street is being paved and rear 811 Cedar Avenue and Kirst Court quality of life and trash issues. They were sent to code enforcement to check. That is all I have right now.

VOLDENBERG : 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ENACTING THE “TOWING. ORDINANCE OF 2024” BY REPEALING AND REPLACING THE CITY’S TOWING AND STORAGE CODE. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , once again, we'll wait and see if we receive some questions from some of the individual s that spoke tonight and then maybe we could try to get some answers, at least generate some discussion on whether making additional changes to that ordinance are appropriate or amendments . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Also on the question , I agree with Mr. King. I was glad that the two individuals came tonight to express their concern s with this ordinance as it affects them greatly . There were some other concern s I got when I was out and about. So I wasn't involved with the process of this ordinance . But I would like to wait and see what those concerns are and see if Council could address them in an appropriate fashion . MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , I'm looking -- every piece of legislation we get a cover sheet. And it's the administration 's rational e as to why we should vote on it as a Council . So the sheet reads to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 me it says updates to the 2023 towing ordinance of 2024. It says the Mayor and Chief of Police, Business Administrator , City Solicitor and Deputy City Solicitor met with about 20 representative s of the city's towing industry in late 2023. We know that. There was a meeting , okay, and then to solicit feedback and discussed the proposed changes . So we thought that took place. And we thought -- at least I thought it occurred and everyone was happy. But then I got a couple phone calls over the weekend about this legislation being introduced. So I'm going to continue to read what it says. So it says the administration -- this is after they met -- continued followup with the tower represent atives over the following weeks. Based on those conversations , the Towing Ordinance of 2024 makes the following updates to the 2023 draft including a list of things. So tonight it doesn't like look like, you know, the same 20 were involved in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 this process or all of the 20. So that's why I have a concern because the rational e is to say, hey, everybody is on board. But I don't think so. So I too look forward to a collective group of the towers and share their concerns before, you know, we'll introduce this but before we make final vote just to make sure everybody 's on page. Maybe they have to get back to the table together . I don't know. But there's concerns out there. So let's hear them. MR. KING: Further on the question , I think it's important to note we sat around that table -- there must have been 20, 25 towers. I will say this. They were told to form their own committee , submit -- and I believe adjustment s were made. At the end of the day I will say this. There is no way you're going to please all 25 of them. I just want to make note of that because , you know, there's five of us. All five of us -- I'm just saying that I want to see what some of those concerns are. And if they look reasonable then maybe we could look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 into making some adjustment s. I do know that they formed a committee and they were asked to submit. Maybe the committee wasn't as inclusive as it should have been or didn't allow participation by certain people but -- MR. MCANDREW : After the initial meeting. I get that. Something 's -- there's something -- there's a disconnect it appears . MR. KING: Well, the committee was formed and then whatever that committee determined adjustments needed to be made were sent into the city. But I guess there may have been some that weren't included on that committee or some concerns that were expressed were just maybe ignored or not include d. So I just want to see what they are. And if it's possible to make adjustments if it seems reasonable to do so, then I suggest we consider that. MR. SMURL: Absolutely . It was my suggestion to the towers to form a committee and to come with all of their gripes at the time and to come up with a plan. I have been working with the towers for a few months. They 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 did come forward with this plan. We went over it, adjusted a few more things. But this is news to me. So naturally you want to see what else they want to either add or change in the ordinance . But again, are we going to have 100 percent happiness , I doubt it. But we could at least see what their complaint s are. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree with hearing them out on their concerns and making sure that we have all of our ducks in a row prior to finalizing and passing this legislation . But I am also happy to see the work that was already put in by the city in, you know, talking with the towing companies and making sure that this ordinance works for the majority of everyone . So I'm in favor of introducing for tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-E.
