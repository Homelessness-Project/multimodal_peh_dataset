As part of the planning process , the City is conducting a survey to identify residents ' needs in the community and ideas on what the City residents would like to see funds used for. Please take a few minutes and complete the survey which can be found at the top of the City's website Scranton PA dot gov. Also The Office musical parody is appearing at the Scranton Cultural Center this Thursday and Friday at 7:30 p.m. There will also be a free premier party before the performance on Thursday at 5:30 at the cultural center. That will include food, drink, and music. Tickets for the show could be purchased at the Cultural Center box office. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Just one. Yesterday afternoon 's Scranton Tomorrow coordinated with Master Gardener for the planting of fall mums throughout our downtown . I would like to thank them for the continue d efforts as well as a big thank you for the many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 volunteers who assisted with this very worthwhile project . They've been doing this for many years now and is no small undertaking as we have numerous planters throughout the entire downtown . So we thank them and the volunteers who made this possible . MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers spoke on agenda items and matters of general concern : Joan Hodowanitz Less Spindler Bob Bolus Lee Morgan Dave Dobrzyn Marie Schumacher ) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: No, nothing at this time. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comment s? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. DONAHUE : Yes. First off, I would like to welcome our intern Ben to the City Clerk's office. I'd also like to acknowledge Councilman Gaughan as well as his entire family and all the volunteers for the tremendous job they did planning and organizing the fundraiser for John and Bill Trently on Saturday night. St. Mary's Center was jammed packed all night which is a testament to the positive impact John and Billy as well as their entire family has had on this community . Last week I attended the South Side neighborhood meeting where they retained their current officers for a two-year term. And those officers have done a fabulous job representing the concerns of their neighborhood . I will be following up this week on a few complaints they submitted to License and Inspection concerning issues on the 300 block of Willow Street as well as the 500 and 700 blocks of Hamm Court. Also, neighbors of the South Scranton Intermediate School have had issues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 with students congregating after school at the corner of Cedar and Beech Street, which the beat officer for South Scranton who was in attendance at the meeting promised to look into. There were also question s about overgrowth on the right-of-way between Front Street and the Central Scranton Expressway . I had requested Miss Reed to reach out to both PennDOT and DPW to see who is responsible for maintain ing that right-of-way and if we can get it cleaned up as soon as possible . On Thursday night myself and Council woman Dempsey attended the Housing Appeals Board meeting involving Ken Bond and his company PSN Realty. Although Mr. Bond requested the hearing based on an appeal he filed with the board, he didn't even bother to show up to the hearing . So his appeal was dismissed . Quite frankly , that's how arrogant this guy is. He didn't even have the audacity to show up at a hearing that he requested . It's my understanding that he could still appeal the Board's decision in county court. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 A couple avenues the City can take moving forward are issuing citations on all properties that are not in compliance with City codes and ordinance s, which I believe the City should start doing immediately so we can start holding deadbeats such as Ken Bond accountable . Also, once the Rental Registration Escrow Program is operation al -- I found out today hopefully that will be by midOctober . The City can also begin collect ing rent from tenants to put into escrow that will be able to go towards delinquent fees and taxes that are owed by the property owner. Due to a receiver being appointed to oversee and collect rent on most of the Mr. Bond's properties in question due to his failure to make mortgage payments , there does become a legal question of whether the mortgage or the delinquent taxes and fees would take priority . I did -- I was in contact with the Law Department and they are currently researching the priority question . And I will continue following up to check on the progress of these initiatives . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 On another note, Friday, September 20th, was the first day of the global climate strike which will run through September 22nd. And it's focused on bringing attention to global climate change. This particular initiative was kick-started in August of 2018 by a then 15-year-old Swedish school girl named Greta Thunberg, organize d a protest outside the Swedish parliament . Her efforts have grown into a global movement of student s. She played a major role in the climate strike held in New York City this past Friday and spoke to the United Nations Climate Summit this morning . She's stated this morning , "You have stole my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," to world leaders. In her comment s she also admonished adults for not doing enough to protect our environment . Over the weekend she also characterize d partisan efforts that envision an idealized future as unhelpful dreams by stating no matter how political a background this crisis may be, we must not allow this to be a partisan political question .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 The climate and ecological crisis is beyond party politics . Our main enemy right now is not our political opponents . Our main enemy now is physics. And we cannot make deals with physics . Yesterday 's Sunday Times featured Op-ed on the climate strike that was offered by the Reverend Rebecca Barnes, Rabbi Daniel Swartz and Bernie McGurl. The Op-ed provided facts relative to global warming , the consequence s of which we are already seeing. They also outline the devastating effect of the same that we will see in the very near future in leaders in this nation across the world continue to ignore global warming or even worse continue to deny global warming 's very existence . I also made it a point to attend the climate strike rally that was held yesterday at the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail pavilion on Olive Street. I was very impressed by the number of attendees, especially the amount of student s and young adults present . Those present were told of the impact that they could have as well as simple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 actions they could take to effect change. They were provided with small steps which they could take as individual s which when followed by others will have a positive effect. Using paper or non disposable grocery bags, replacing plastic straws with paper ones, using a water bottle verses a single use water plastic bottle and using non styrofoam take-out containers for leftovers were some of the simple yet very effective changes that we can all make. I also believe we need to develop strategies on the City level to play our part in minimizing our part in the footprint . These can include initiatives such as decreasing the amount of garbage we send to the landfill , establishing an aggressive composting program , completely re-evaluating and reconfigurating our local recycling program and that's just to name a few. We cannot wait to act any longer. We must start to act on this issue now before it becomes too late. That's all I have today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Attorney 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Dempsey , any motions or comment s? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, thank you. I have a few comment s and then I'll end with a motion. First of all, Joan, I'd like to clarify the comment I made last week. I think it might have been misunderstood . While I did acknowledge that the auditor would have to input data, I certainly didn't mean to intimate at all that that is all the auditor would do, especially in this post political corruption era that we find ourselves in. I think all of us want an auditor to go above and beyond in any extreme to make sure that all of these numbers make sense. So the point was that new additional data was going to have to start from scratch as opposed to auditor s who in the past have had information already in their computer . But I wanted to make clear about that because that's very important to me. The second thing is Councilman Donahue is correct . We did attend the Housing Appeals Board. I went there because PRN Realty or PSN Realty, Mr. Bond is also the number one on our garbage delinquency list. And I wanted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 to see what, if any, defense he had to the rental registration and as Councilman Donahue indicated , he did not show up. A motion was granted to dismiss and a motion was also granted or an order is going to be granted that he does have to comply with our rental legislation law. And we did spend some time afterwards speaking with our solicitor . That brings me to the garbage delinquencies . Someone had asked last week and it was actually on my list of things to do anyhow what is the current up-to-date list. I think most of us are working off of a list that was published in the newspaper about six months ago. And I was able to find out that, in fact, the Treasurer is the one who does keep the list. And I did make a written request for that through our clerk. We had expected to have it late last week or at the latest today. Unfortunate ly, I do not have it today. The gentleman who is in charge is out today, which we can't punish anyone for that. So I'm hopeful by the next meeting I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 come to I will have that in my possession . I do want to see that for a variety of reasons . There are a lot of figures that are being thrown around with regard to the garbage delinquencies . And as I do my best, number one, to try to get to the bottom of them and, number two, to try to get more aggressive action to be taken, I also want to find out what specific number I'm dealing with. I also hold a fear as an attorney that each day we wait we are losing out on a statute of limitations that may be applicable in this matter. So hopefully by next Monday I'll have that list and be able to see what it is. I'll also be meeting with Mayor Evans next Monday with regard to the same issue. In that regard I may have some motions next Monday with regard to further aggressive action with regard to the garbage delinquencies . Someone had asked last week about a hiring policy or procedure . That is, in fact, what I do for a living. I'm an employment lawyer. I thought about it at night. I always do my best thinking at night I say. And I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 not sure in a municipal government that one is definitely mandated due to the fact that we have Civil Service and due to the fact that a lot of our employer s are governed by collective bargaining agreements . That having been said, I did research it. I did pick out two that I thought were very helpful . And I am going to forward them onto the Law Department slash Human Resources Department . And in the event they think they're helpful going forward , they're welcome do adopt one. Lori, I'm sorry, I meant to do this in caucus and I forgot. We had receive d a complaint previously on a property located at 1803 North Washington Avenue. My daughter received the complain t at my home. It was from an elderly neighbor . She did not get the gentleman 's name. He has since stopped by and renewed that complaint and gave me a more accurate address . It's 1805 North Washington Avenue. It's two doors away from me to be quite frank, it looks to be a condemned property . I don't know what's going on with it. I don't know the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 status of it. I do know that when we had the storm sweep through here about a month or four or five weeks ago, the (inaudible ) was actually on the sidewalk to the point where the St. Claire's kids were picking it up as they were walking by. So I know Mr. Oleski is very busy. If he could put that on his list I would appreciate it. And finally , I would like to conclude with a motion. We in the past we had done two letters . One was in August and then one was about ten days ago to the Controller asking for an audit of the gas card use for the City fleet vehicles . We had not received anything back until today. To be candid, all of us found it on our chair today. It appears to be about two months' worth which we had asked to go back three years. And I don't think any of us had a really fair chance to take a look at that. I plan on doing that sometime tomorrow . That having been said, I do believe we are on all in acquiesce that what we are looking at as of today does not accurately 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 address our concerns . And we have prepared a letter that I'm going to make a motion at this time that we send a followup letter to the City Controller dated today's date as a followup to our August 26th initial communication to her as well as our September 13th letter to her asking for addition al status, which this letter should detail what additional information Council is asking for with regard to the gas card audit regarding fleet vehicles going back for three years. MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I agree with Attorney Dempsey 's letter. And also I was a little concerned maybe there is a miscommunication between Council and either the Controller 's Office and the Administration . We received an e-mail from Mr. Bulzoni -- we were copied on that he sent to employees of Controller 's Office and member of the DPW where he states, "First I'll state that the review procedure is not an audit. It is strictly review and should be conducted as such." 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Then he says, "We are not seeking to evaluate each card with a level of detail commensurate with an audit. The review is to detect irregular activity and search that activity ." And there is more to it here. But I think that's the most important point. I think Council was very clear that we would like an audit performed . If for no other reason than in light of the revelations over the last few months, I think it's very important that we make sure that there is no abuse and no fraud that had occurred over the last number of years. I think going back three years will suffice at this point. But I do think it's important that we're all on the same page that we're not looking for a review. We're looking for an audit. If we were looking for a review we would have asked for one. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? ATTY. DEMPSEY : If I may very briefly , the other thing that became important when we looked back is there was change in the provider of the gas cards from the Valero to Sunoco. In fact, we're putting in that letter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 that we would like copies of any and all written contractual document ation that exists so we can take a look at that. And I think the letter just clearly sets up a process that Council would like the Controller to follow which hopefully will streamline the process and make things easier as well. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor? MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First I'd like to welcome Ben McFadden who is our intern, our first intern. So I appreciate you putting your name in Ben and coming to work with the Council . Look forward to getting to know you better over the next few weeks and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 working with you. So congratulations on getting the job. Mrs. Reed, a couple requests for you. I'm sure you're happy to hear that. I spoke to quite a few neighbor s, the area of Church Avenue. This is one actually that we had already sent to the Licensing and Inspections Department and actually one that we have heard about for the last few years. 1724 Church Avenue, there was a fire there a few years ago. And quite frankly , the neighbors that live in and around this property could no longer stand it. This property is in deplorable condition . So we have sent this again to the Licensing and Inspection Department and ask if it is on the demolition list and if so when it will be demolished . From hearing from the neighbors and from driving by this property myself, it looks like the property is in disrepair and cannot be salvaged at this point due to the fire. Also there are quite a few issues on Drinker Place behind Richmont Street. I'd like to ask Mr. Santoli, the City forester to take a look at some dangerous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 trees and also ask the Licensing and Inspections Department if they could do a walkthrough on Drinker Place, Mrs. Reed. There are some quality of life issues that are taking place there. We received the paving list, the 2019 paving list. I won't go through every street. There is quite a few of them. Although I will say that I'm very pleased to see that East Mountain Road -- and I'm sure Mrs. Schumacher will be pleased to see this as well -- from the firehouse to Interstate 81 ramp is on the paving list. Also, Moltke Avenue from Birch Street to Brook Street is on there as well in terms of East Mountain . And then there are some streets in the hill and in North Scranton . One of the question s that I had posed in the caucus for Mrs. Reed to find out from the Business Administrator was the total bid is roughly one and a half million dollars . From what I remember , we only had a little bit less than a million dollars allocated for the paving project . So, Mrs. Reed, if you could find out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 from Mr. Bulzoni whether we're taking streets off this list to get the bid lower or if we're trying to find other monies available to go in line with that bid. So I would appreciate that. Also, Mrs. Reed was kind enough to attend what I think is a very important meeting . I had brought up two weeks ago or three weeks ago about the idea, the possibility of equipping all City vehicles with GPS capabilities in light of some of the issues that we've been having. So Mrs. Reed did attend a meeting with several City official s and representatives from Verizon 's Government Account Division . So without going into great detail on all the meeting notes because there's quite a few of them, there is a GPS program that Verizon has purchased called Network Fleet, which provides special government pricing for this type of thing. The City of Albany uses it and Philadelphia as well. The GPS system uses Verizon Wireless towers to communicate with the satellite and provides realtime tracking for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 dispatched service s and efficiencies . It includes fleet maintenance capabilities and has diagnostic trouble codes. Safety measures include capability of tracking the speed of all City vehicles which will result in greater fuel efficiencies . Data from other cities provide fuel savings that will be realized . The portal that retains all of this data will stay intact for 90 days for designated users to view. And then another system layer for up to 15 months of tracking capabilities . The company will archive all data indefinitely and they are available to provide that data as requested . One of the things that I was interested in on here is that parameters can be set for each City vehicle . This is called geofencing for which an alert would be provided when a vehicle travels outside of the designated area. There is a lot of other things in here that I think would be beneficial to the City. But all in all, I think we should be looking to be more efficient in each department . I think this provide s a level of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 efficiency that I don't think we've ever seen here in the City as it relates to our vehicle fleet and also for a level of transparency that I don't think we've seen so far in our City's history . The only question I had Mrs. Reed is going to follow up with the Administration on this is whether or not this has to be bid. Towards the end of the notes here it says that they are working to draft legislation working on contract details. But I would like to know if this type of thing has to be bid out. So I would appreciate that. Last thing I have is, I'd like to make a motion to have City Council send a letter to the Administration requesting that they complete a cover sheet. It will be created by City Council to go along with any legislation that is sent down to be voted on. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question . I just want to take a minute to explain this. This is something I've been talking about now for the last few months. I had researched what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 other cities do in terms of simply having a cover sheet that would go along with the legislation . Many times Council receives a piece of legislation and we're not exactly sure what department it originated from. We're not exactly sure what the benefit s are from the Administration 's point of view. We're not exactly sure what the financial impact might be, the cost -- like, a cost and benefit analysis , funding sources , so on and so forth. Now, many times that is included . But often times we have to go out and then request that information . So what I'm attempt ing to do here is to create -- and I actually used most of this from another city, create a cover sheet that would go along with each piece of legislation . And the Administration would then be responsible for making sure that this was filled out before the legislation was sent down to Council . This would help not only Council but the public in prioritizing the important information that is in the legislation . And the last question here I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 is important to me, Why should Council unanimously support this legislation ? So many times we have go and ask the Mayor or ask a department head why did you send this us? Where did this originate from? Give us some background on this. And why should we all vote for this? So I just think that this cover sheet would eliminate that layer that we have been having to go through over the last few years. So I would appreciate and I think I'll have the support from my colleagues here. And then hopefully the Administration would support this as well. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, two more things. Somebody brought up the LERTA, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 citywide LERTA. I would be interested , Mrs. Reed, if we can find out some data on that who has pulled applications for that and have we given out any LERTAs. I would be interest ed to see information on that. Mrs. Schumacher had asked -- and I know I had asked this question before. But what money remains from the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority ? How much is still outstand ing in escrow accounts ? That's all I have for this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just one issue I want to touch on briefly . It was brought up -- it's been in the papers quite a bit recently regarding the upcoming election and the legal challenges . And I think I speak for all four of us that were here at the time. Our intent all along with the process that was put in place was to have an open special election . There is no question that a two-year election for Mayor in the City of Scranton is a special election . It's typically a four-year term. It's the only time this type of election has ever been done. I'm very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 disappointed in legal challenge s that have been taking place. I understand that's part of process even in regular election s when people's petition s are challenged and things of that nature. But I just want to state publicly that Council 's intention all along was to have an open special election so the voters could ultimately have the say who is going to serve the remainder of this term -- the bulk of the remainder of this term. If the courts determine otherwise , I think at that point in time Council needs to look at all other options to see if there is anything that could be done on our end. But I do think it's critical that the people have a say. There was not an opportunity for a primary in this type of situation . So it certainly is a special set of circumstances compared to what normally would take place on a regular municipal election . So I just want to state my feeling s on that. And again, it's very rare when Council -- any Council , this Council or any of the Councils that come before make large decision s such as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 we have on a unanimous basis. We all put a lot of time and effort and listened to the public on what they wanted regarding the filling of the remainder of this term. So I think it's critical that the people have a say and that the courts do the right thing and allow the voters to have the final say on who our next Mayor is. And that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Rogan, I'm sorry if I may just -- jogged my memory here. Solicitor Minora, just based on what Mr. Rogan said in the event that -- and I don't know if you can talk about this now -- but in the event that the courts come back and say that, in fact, Council did not have the ability to call for an election , what Mr. Rogan mentioned other options , do you know at this time what other options that Council would have? Would we have any say in what happens moving forward should the court come back and say that, in fact, it was not correct ? ATTY. MINORA: Well, I haven't researched it obviously what Council 's role would be after a situation like that. But I presume an order of court that struck the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 special election would also include instruct ions to the Election Board on what they were to do. Could it come back to us? I suppose it's possible . I think unlikely . But I haven't really done the research to be sure. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF ROBERT J.

I think what the Human Services Alliance does for the community is unbelievable in many respects just looking through this application there -- the total project cost is almost a million and a half dollars . They're asking for $350,000 from an LSA Grant. I just think that this type of project is going to inject or boost our local economy , put people to work and renovate that whole area. So I support this 100 percent . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? ATTY. DEMPSEY : I would just like to abstain from the vote, please. MR.
