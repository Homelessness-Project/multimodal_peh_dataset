MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially Beverly Gilarde and Chas Forgione and all of the lives that we lost in 9/11/2001. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. CITY OF SCRANTON PARKS BUDGETED COSTS AND TIMEFRAMES RECEIVED FROM CITY COUNCIL PRESIDENT GERALD SMURL SEPTEMBER 3, 2024. 3.B. REPORT PREPARED BY MUFLEHUN , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 WASHINGTON , D.C., FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON , TITLED "COMMUNITY HEALTH & SAFETY LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS ." MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : So I just have one comment on Item 3-B, the Muflehan report. So after reading the report, it's my opinion that a lot of assumption s have been made in this report. It's a common criticism of this type of a study, especially when you are using this type of study to form policy and drive policy decisions , which I feel is going to be coming out of this study. A couple questions I initially had was how well an indicator is used in this study to determine results and lack of (inaudible ) validation indicate which in turn may cause bias and speculation as well as resulting in the false -- flawed assumption s. When we look at who was interview ed in this, it was select members of OECD, Parks and Rec, SPD, and only nonprofit organizations . So I don't think it took a real slice of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 pie of this city. It just seems to be to non-profits and select members . So results of it, I could have -- I could have assumed what the results would be. And I will wait to see how this study drives policymaking in the future. That's all. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I agree. So, okay, we got the report. I wasn't happy with the last report. This one was a little less vague. The holistic approach I don't believe is the answer. I know it's -- some administration might be happy with the data per se. But we got the report, okay, so I don't think we need to retain them. They were paid. Thank you and I don't want to see them get another contract telling us how to operate and how the police to work. And with that said, like I said, I hope we got -- Muflehun is done and we move on. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So NeighborWorks will be hosting the West 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Scranton Fall Festival . It's going to be September 28th at 12 p.m., at Clover Field. It was a great time last year. They did a fantastic job. And if you get a chance to stop by, it's worth your while. And also I would like to remind everyone of the Kelly Hopkins event. It's a reminder that the fundraiser is this Saturday at 4:00. That's all I have. MR. KING: I believe it's Sunday, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry, yeah. I apologize . It is Sunday. MR. KING: Four until nine. MR. MCANDREW : Four to nine, yes. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? I do have one. It's the annual commemoration of September 11th. It's present ed by 911 Memorial Committee of Lackawanna County. It is at McDade Park. And it will be September 11th tomorrow at 8 a.m. That's all. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First on the list, Joan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . With regard to 911 tomorrow , I wonder how many people realize that we're still suffering casualties , firefighters , police, first responders who worked on the pile after that incident and are dying of cancer now. So, you know, it's the gift that keeps on giving unfortunately . So everyone should pause sometime tomorrow morning and remember the people who gave their lives for us. I think the number of firefighters which was original 343 who died is up to something like 370 now. So we paid a high price. Union contracts , I looked at the website this morning . The three that have been negotiated , firefighters , police, and the nonuniform clerical unions, they are obviously not on the City's website . Firefighter s is the oldest. That was arbitrated 18 months ago. But what is interesting , there are only four unions in the city, those three plus DPW. Guess what union contract runs out on December 31st? And it's not the firefighters . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 It's not the police. And it's not the nonuniform clerical . It's DPW. So I don't know the status of how negotiations are going. I would hate to wake up on January 1st to see that we don't have a single union contract on the City's website . Remember that, you know, a large portion of the general fund operational budget is personnel costs. So we should have access to that in a timely manner. Eighteen months is not timely, but be that as it may. The positive side of things to remind everybody the library 's book sale is ongoing at the Marketplace at Steamtown , second floor. You could get books for a dollar to two dollars , puzzles , DVDs, CDs, a whole lot of wonderful things. Any update on the status of the city's audit? MR. SMURL: Not as of this afternoon , nothing new. MS. HODOWANITZ : Chugging along, are we? Okay. Are we still hoping for some time in early October now? MR. SMURL: I'm still hoping for on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 time, but we'll see. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey, we'll see. How about the city's investigation into the records that were found in Dix Court back in March? MR. SMURL: As of 3:00 this afternoon no new information . I know they were dealing with the insurance company . And I don't know the status of that if they could release it as of yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm more interested in accountability at this point to make sure that we established the correct protocol s and internal controls so such a thing does not happen again. And, B, you know, if someone was stupid, you know, they need to account for their stupidity. And it's a great opportunity for training . And the Muflehun report, did you notice that not one veteran was cited as a potential criminal ? But there were a couple veterans organization s which were listed among them, 154 service organizations . And by the way, if you look at the appendix of the 154 organizations , 27 are for profit. So there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 were some in there, not many. One thing I did notice and it was a valid point about coordination with the county because a lot of aspects of health and safety have to be, you know, coordinated with the county. So hopefully the county will pick up a copy and read it. I didn't think it was all that bad of a report. But one thing I would like to know is, you know, how this is going to impact staffing levels for the police department because the suggestion is that our population is going up and we're going to have to model the police department to, you know, be able to handle that. And did you see the projection s they made on our demographics ? They treat minorities and our population going up. It's interesting . And I'm happy that we're going to put the bid notices online. It should save the city some money. Does that also apply to the city's boards, authorities , and commissions if they have to put out a bid notice, same thing? MR. SMURL: Joan, the idea is right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 now to get as much online as we possibly can except for the ones that still require . MS. HODOWANITZ : I know federal and state. But can the authorities , boards, and commissions if they have to put out a bid -- MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : -- would it apply to them too? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Next, Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . 5-G, with the University of Scranton , don't you think we've given them enough over the years? We as taxpayers in the city have to pay taxes everywhere else and they get a free ride constantly . And now we're giving them a grant for more money? You know, I brought up a long time ago and it was a touchy subject . But it's a Jesuit university . And they participated in with the gay corps community allowing them to do whatever they needed to and sponsor it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 You know, if you look at religion that they are bound by, it's a Rule of God. And it was a violation of that. Their chapel is the only thing that should remain exempt. And they should lose their exempt status because they violated the Rule of God that they're under as a Jesuit university . No matter what anybody 's sexual preference is or their orient -- that's up to them. But this is the University of Scranton and it should be taken back. And they should be paying taxes on everything in this city. We're entitled to. 9/11 is a time to honor our heros that died there going into the building s and around there and those that are dying today from related medical issues. Four days after 9/11 happened , I took one of my trailers . It sat up at Drinker Street. It will be out on the road tomorrow . And it's all detailed on the side with Bin Laden in a cave as a coward with the Statute of Liberty standing on his tail as a snake that he was with an American tank coming and saying gehad this. What we lost and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 because of Biden and Harris today, we lost 13 of our fellow veterans in Afghanistan and then have the nerve to say we didn't lose anybody on his watch. She's the czar of the border. The border -- she could close them at any time. She doesn't have to ask permission . Yet, look what she's done to this country and her partner Tampon Tim as I call him, putting tampons in boys' bathroom s is a no-no. We got to draw the damn line somewhere . And it's time to draw it. So these are the people that we got to deal with and we got to pay attention , especially tonight . You know, during La Festa, very upsetting. I had one of my Trump trailers there parked on Spruce Street. I refuse to use the other terminology because I believe he's a coward walking away like he did. No politician in Lackawanna County ever walked away from anything . They'd die first. But the City of Scranton put a garbage truck there where porta potties were put in by the county, so I blame the county, the City of Scranton , and the heads or the president of La Festa for allowing that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 to take place. Those porta potties were put in a circle to block our trailer . People coming from the La Festa right there on the corner of Spruce and Washington , they had to come from La Festa just walk right into the porta potties . They were washing and cleaning them out, people urinating there. It's on the floor. It's washed out on the street. People are going in and out and carrying that to where everybody is eating. The stench of the garbage , I mean, what is the city coming to that you are worried about politics ? You won't fly the Ukraine flag. You won't fly the Israeli flag and honor those that are being butchered and murdered . You won't do a damn thing about our POWs, our fellow veteran s that didn't come home and those that are suffering today. And now we're going to have a memorial service down at Veteran 's Park or former memorial park or Memorial Stadium . What are we coming to? There should be a high flag flying to honor them. We didn't fly a flag on the 80th anniversary of all those on D Day. Go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 look at the statues , the graves of Normandy . And these punks in the street protesting that those kids gave their lives for 18, 19, 20 and so on and didn't come home and yet we sit back. What the hell are we all doing here? This is our country . That flag is our flag. It don't belong to these idiots. If they don't want to be here, get out of our country . But you should be flying the POW flag out front. And it should be at the stadium on Friday at 4:00. We're Americans . We defended our country . And it's time our country starts taking care of and respect ing all those and puts these punks in their place. Respect our flag for a change instead of these idiots that are out there. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for our sign-in list. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Last session , there was a question on the key to Nay Aug Park. And as I listened to it, I find it -- I found it to be a bit trivial . I was amused by first the response of, well, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 don't know if I have the key, followed up by a second response of, well, maybe they changed the locks, followed up by a final parting shot of it's my key, I'm not giving it back. Smurl at that point reminded me a Smeagol from Lord of the Rings. It's my precious . You can't have my precious . It's just very odd that something like that became such a thorn that it needed to be respond ed like that. Mr. King in the last session said that he agreed it was time to change city charter . Well, you have the floor. Make that charter change. Go out here, introduce it. If you say it's time and you agreed to it last session , then it's time to look at and review the charter , get the ball rolling . You agreed to it, put it forward or just scribble with your pen on a piece of paper and ignore the person talking . Getting onto the Mulfehan report, 115 pages, some of it was duplicated . Some of it was duplicated in multiple sessions . Lots of terms, no definitions . Resources handpicked and still the results are the same according to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 it, housing , education , transportation , all deficient . In your 115 page report it says -- and I summarize the 115 page report. Scranton has failed, has not participated or coordinated in any effort for the betterment of its people, nor coordination of service s for the betterment of its people in the community . By the effort of -- the effort local government has shown that they prefer poor and dumb as the objective . Onto tonight 's 5-G, the University of Scranton . I have a question because I don't think I remember seeing it. As of this point in time I don't think this year the University of Scranton has provided a pilot at all. As a matter of fact, I don't remember this year any pilots actually being donated to the city except for the family who had the son who puts in the $5,000 every year for the Fire Department 's fund. I think at this point no pilot has given money to the City of Scranton . But it seems that's okay. And maybe they don't want to donate to the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Scranton because we're actually looking to see whether or not they are validly under a nonprofit . There's a responsibility in that pilot. But it seems again we don't hold charities responsible to pay their fair share. And I'm not talking about the percentage that every other person in this city pays to keep the city floating . For the University , it's not even 1 percent . It's a percent of a percent , but every year it's reduced. Yet we're going to give them more money in a grant now because they need it from the taxpayers ' fund when they have supplied this city goose egg so they could take their extra money and build more buildings for themselves on the threshold dwarfing this city since they are now the highest zoned area in the city. Last of all, trash and recycle I'm going to hit. If it's going to be until December and the person deciding whether our recyclable s are acceptable or not is the person making the profit from them where it could go from 40 to $120 on the decision of anyone who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 is making the profit in that venture . I would ask Scranton residents as of September we've given enough. Forty-seven dollars and sixty-three cents is what is required by trash. We should at this point recycle nothing , save the taxpayers money. Throw all your recyclables in the trash until an agreement is paid and save the city $80 a ton for the rest of this year. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , that is the point that was brought up, can we get a list from the administration of the pilots and their donations for 2024? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. LUCAS: Alan Lucas, Scranton , President of the IFF Local 60 representing Scranton Firefighters . I just wanted to touch on what Mr. McAndrew said about the event for Kelly Hopkins on Sunday, yes, 4 to 9 up at Montage . I just wanted to be very brief here. It's very touching the support we've got from the city's residents , outside the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 residents . Kelly Hopkins has touched a lot of people's lives. And it's really a good feeling to see that people are in support of us and helping our brother . The Local 60 Union is -- the membership has been in charge of getting this whole thing up and running , so a special thank you to those members . Timmy O'Connor is the one that's heading that up. So we hope to see everybody there. We thank you again for your support . We thank the numerous , numerous , numerous businesses that I can't even begin to name that have donated items for raffle and we really hope for a good turnout and we really do appreciate everybody 's support , so thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Lucas. Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , I'm Rik Little from Scranton . I'd like to talk about democracy and elections . Everyone is thinking about taxes and what's being taxed to keep what's going, especially in the schools . And it seems to me that everybody wants to -- is talking about balancing the budget and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 accounting in the city. But the realty of it is to balance the budget after let's say the last 30 years, all these non-profits have come up as other speakers have talked about and non-profits are supposed to -- they have a lot of employees and keeping all of these non-profits going is -- the powers to be are depending on the federal thing. Now, just a couple weeks ago I saw that, hey, Scranton Housing Authority got 153 million dollars in the paper. It disappeared . But no one is talking about that. They're talking about law enforcement and, you know, a lot of talk about law enforcement and getting rid of the homeless with law enforcement . But this is the key thing because the powers that be run all of these non-profits . They own the courts through outside influences putting people in office as attorney generals , as district attorney s, and these are the people that are running Scranton Housing Authority . They get 153 million dollars and all of a sudden I'm homeless after 14 and a half 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 years. Now there has to be some critical thinking because we're talking about democracy and this woman Kamala Harris was not democratically elected by any -- anything and the debate is tonight . I'm running out of time. I only get five minutes to talk here. So I would like to talk about children . In 2021 I went to the public library my favorite , my favorite place in the city. And I got this book. I encourage everybody to read this book. This was written by Vietnam ese immigrant teenage son, this guy Andy Ngo. And I was really surprised to read this book because it's about what happened during Covid when they're burning down the police station s in Seattle and Portland and everything that went down. But this book is filled with the history of laying it out of how things work. Similarly , I went to the library and I asked them to get these books, these books by Brett Pike. And these are children 's books. And they're asking me, well, do you have a child? Yeah, I do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 And they after about five months of pushing and pushing , they ordered the books. And then the children -- you know this is going back and forth between the children 's library and the regular library . And I had a long talk with Scott Thomas today about it and was encouraging . I wanted to know who -- they don't want these books. They don't want these books. Why? Because we're looking at the school system; and, you know, they are talking about making it a state issue like marriage and abortion and so many other things. But people are ignorant of the law and how things were formed. And people are underestimating the intelligence of children . And these books explain it, explain it because the children are our future here. And if we're pushing for public education , there's plenty of people that are home schooling . And these are key books, key books in that sort of teaching . You know, I learned at eight years old about the Treaty of Versailles watching combat with my father in 1961. And then when I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 went to school, I met Laszlo Benedek who directed a number of those episodes . Kids are smart. And they need -- they need an education and books are key. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to talk about arrogance . I mention ed in the past arrogance becomes your downfall. When you have studies that single out veterans like Joan Hodowanitz , Bob Bolus, and others, it's wrong. Studies of cause -- holistic approaches . It's a waste of money. If you need a study or a consultant , you have no business working for the city. It's a waste of money. If you cannot make solid decisions based on principles and those who you surround yourself with, you have no need being here. The other evening there was a call near the University of Scranton . A young man got stabbed in the back. University of Scranton never put out an alert. The kid was running loose. And today I don't they actually found him. I'd like for somebody to look into that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I have talked about so many things in the past and they've gone wayside . Not a lot of people show up here. The reason for it is, they go to say something , nothing gets done. People lose hope. That's arrogance . What else is arrogance is the comment s that you made last week, Mr. Smurl. I take offense to that because I've known people that sat in that very chair before you, John Pocius, Janet Evans, Judy Gatelli , many others. And for you to make a comment like that is unbecoming of that chair and those who have elected you into this office. People look up -- please look at me when I'm talking to you. At least give me that respect . Apparently you can't do that either, just like you walked away from the Washburn Street Cemetery because you trolled somebody 's page and you don't like the comment that they made so you said you were done. You know, you took your own personal approach as opposed to every single one of those flags that you went by with the your zero turn lawnmower. And I take offense to that. It's very upsetting because you and those who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 were with you did an amazing job. And it's very upsetting that we're in this position now that we're in. And after my comments last week, Mr. King, you touted the city. And you said that they -- that we're not doing all that bad. How far away was that woman from you that was abducted at knifepoint and taken in New York City, not far, right? When was the last time that happened ? You touted 2 million dollars in savings from a bond. But yet we pay 1.2 million dollars to an attorney per year. You know, all that stuff used to be handled in-house and yet it's okay. It's not okay with me. We're going through a crisis right now. People are afraid to walk down the street. People are afraid to sit outside of their house. Things have changed . Mr. King, in the last four years you know things have changed . Everybody knows that they have. And for somebody to just sit there and say that it's okay and cater to a party of one instead of those who have elected you into this office is wrong. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 I mentioned the Sewer Authority and the rate increase of 1.9 percent . Instead of any of you looking into it and making $63 a year, everybody is getting whacked 220. Our paving contract with these paving companies still hasn't been addressed as far as sealing these roads. A plow truck comes over them and just blows out the pave cuts, whose expense is that, ours. You know, I met with the Mayor a month ago for an hour. And she said she's working on a program . Well, she's been working on the same program for the last four years, you know, we come out with a pothole number, 800 number, 311, what have you, what about the list from the year prior? You know, you should resolve the list from the year prior before you put out another one. We could do better. And I hope each one of you take a different approach tonight because this railway system is coming in the not so distant future. And the decisions that each one of you make are very important to the city. I want you to take a look at those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 who have sat in those chairs before you and respect those chairs and the people of the City of Scranton because they need you. Good evening . MR. SMURL: Anyone else wish to speak? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments , as far as the University of Scranton is concerned , that is an LSA grant. It can only apply for a Local Share Account grant going through a municipality . So all we are is a passthrough to support that, the University of Scranton . And from what I understand , the program that they are looking to put together is this workforce development project . And my understanding is that is going to greatly benefit the resident s of the City of Scranton . So I think that's probably a good thing. The money is not coming out of a city account . We're just simply a passthrough . As far as -- I make no apologizes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 about the fact that I think a lot of great things are happening in the city. I am not blind to the fact that we have a lot of work to do. And I said that last week. There's a lot of things that need to be fixed in the city, no two ways about it. But it's difficult to see sit here and listen to doom and gloom week after week and try to paint the city as if it's the worst place in the world. And it's not the worst place in the world. There's a lot of great things happening in the city. And if I don't point them out, then nobody knows about them because everything is at that podium -- not everything , a lot of people come up and do mention positive things that are happening in the city. So I'm just trying to give a fair and balanced view. There is no doubt that there is a lot of work and we are having problems with crime. But I will tell you this. I remember growing up. I remember going to South Intermediate . I remember two students getting kidnapped hitchhiking in Minooka and they were murdered .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I remember another student getting off a bus on the top of East Mountain Road, murdered . I remember multiple -- a girl leaving North Scranton Intermediate School got kidnapped and got murdered . So, like, this isn't new with crime in the City of Scranton . It just hasn't completely gone away. It exists. I understand that and we need to pay attention to it. So is everything perfect ? Absolutely not. Are we striving and working toward making the city a better place for all of us? Absolutely . And that's all -- that's the only thing I meant to point out last week that there are some really good things happening . And I did emphasize there's a lot of work ahead of us, don't deny that. There is. Thank you. That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. Some of the question s I asked last week we got some answers on. During caucus tonight it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 stated that some of the West Mountain and East Mountain stormwater project s are going to be moving forward . So East Mountain we were told tonight it's ready to go. West Mountain 's on a holdup due to a possible housing development near a reservoir on the top of West Mountain above Newton Road. So one of the questions I asked last week is if we had an update on the stormwater management project s and stormwater meeting s scheduled for the city because some of the resident s -- I know especially in Keyser Valley were asking for that and had some correspondence with the Mayor. The answer was that the city continues to work with organizing public meetings on stormwater project s but important project element s must be confirm ed so our residents are presented with reliable plans. One of its tasks is working to require access agreement from the owner, Newton Realty property in Keyser Valley. And once that access is permitted to the property and it's granted, city engineers can begin testing them potential basin locations .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 So that was in regard to meeting with the Keyser Valley on how the stormwater project s are going. I also asked for an update on zoning questions . The Zoning Board came and met with us in caucus. They had some concerns . They do need to rule at zoning meeting s on things in our city. And they felt there was some gray areas in the new zoning ordinance . And the answer that I got where we're with that is that it's pending . I also asked for an update on homeless encampments that are being -- if they're being addressed by the city and if the homeless task force committee may advise if there's been any notable increase in the number of homeless since other municipalities outside the City of Scranton have been taking action. And I got a one word answer. That one word answer was no. Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask if the answer no is from -- is -- if there is a notable increase and if that's the case, can we also make sure that at the next homeless task force meeting it be brought up if there is an influx in the number of homeless coming into the city with other municipalities taking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 action on it? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get clarification and ask those questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I asked for a status on the damaged monument at Providence Square. And the city communicated that the insurance broker on the claim will update Council with any pertinent developments when they come out. That's the monument that's in Providence Square in North Scranton . I asked about the HR Department if we could provide a list of updates on which positions need to be filled. So we're still looking for a public health coordinator , a public safety specialist , two housing inspectors for Tuesday s and Saturdays , health inspector , traffic sign maintenance , part-time maintenance , diesel mechanic , property stabilization and enhancement team manager, First Assistant City Solicitor , a DPW Director , and the OECD Director . And another question I had was about our ARPA funds, how many -- how much of the funds have been earmarked and also allocated . And what we were told is that the ARPA funds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 are 100 percent budgeted and 98 percent obligate d. So that number is looking good. There were a couple properties that I had e-mailed Mr. Voldenberg . Some of those properties were 1623 Jackson Street which we talked about in caucus, 312 South 9th Street, 18504, and then 925-927 Oxford, a couple other things. Getting back to the homeless task force, can we ask who runs the actual task force? Is it someone from OECD? It seems like a lot of OECD is involved with that, but who is running the actual task force. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. We have an extensive list. But we don't have chairman name, so I'll find that out. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. With tomorrow being 9/11, last year City Council was present ed with a flag and also a certificate from the Scranton Fire Department from Zach Fanning and Ed Sweden{phonetic .} Council , the Chambers were being painted in here and then Council offices were being repainted as well. So I was kind of just waiting on that to get that up in here but we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 could get that in soon to get into either Council Chambers or Council offices . Last year they did a flight climb with some members of the police department and also EMS to commemorate 9/11. So now onto recycling , it says here on our list that we do not have our DPW Director . But it seems with this not being on the list we do have a refuse coordinator and also a recycling coordinator . Do you know if that's correct , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That would be one in the same. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Can we just make sure that position is filled because I know it was unfilled at some point in time. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. When it comes to tonnage -- so this might be question for the Business Administrator . What would be the city's average tonnage for the months of October to December based on past numbers ? And do we have those past data and numbers to compare , number one. Next, has the City BA done a cost analysis to see how much it's going to cost the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 taxpayer with the price increase from recycling company and verify if it's worth continuing the recycling program at this price. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And then how are we current ly verifying whether our recycling is clean and not contaminated ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that also. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And do we know how many tons are not taken as recycling and charged at the new rate of $120 and how we're verifying that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, thank you. First I'll start off with the responses I received . I also had asked about the Unsheltered Task Force and when they would be meeting next. And I was provided the date of October 3rd. I'm not sure if that there's a formal chair person. The meeting I had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 attended was run by the Mayor. And the other response I had gotten about the Novembrino Splash Pad, I had some concerns about the pad itself and that the flooring that was splash pad is located on deteriorating and falling apart which has been an issue in the past. I wanted to know if there was still a warranty in place on it. They said, no, they are not -- it's not still under warranty . It expired this year. And it was previously utilized for repair, the amenity . And then the Parks Department will be formulating plans now that the summer season is over to remediate it before next season. So I'll be interested to see what the plans are for that and what the cost will be. And I'm hoping that whatever mistakes whether it was the type of material or the company that we went with for the splash pad will not be the same mistake s that we repeat in the future with other splash pads. I had some concerns about 429 Prescott Avenue, that property not being secured . I didn't really receive a response 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 specific to that. I receive d a response on that and 1068 Cottage Avenue, which was that they are reviewing homes previously slated for demolition , condemned homes and homes with -- that have several complaint s including those properties . So I guess that's still to be determined . I didn't a response if those are on a demo list or what the plans are for those specific properties , which I am concerned about because there have been many cited issues with those properties for several years. And I think it's frustrating to neighbors and residents that, you know, that still hanging in the balance and not getting -- and I'm not able to really provide them with much of a response . So that is frustrating . And I'm sorry for that, but I'll keep pushing for us to address properties like this. And hopefully with the ideas that Council man Smurl has brought up, we'll have some other options and avenues and legislative changes that we could make so that the city holds more power on properties such as this. And I wanted to bring up a concern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 that was brought to a few Council members . I'm not sure whether or not if it's been forward ed. So I just wanted to bring attention to it tonight that there were -- there was work being done without permits at the old Jacobson 's Hat warehouse in South Side. So that's located at 5 South Webster Avenue. And they were going to try to contact Code Enforcement officer , but I don't know if they didn't receive a response . But I think unpermitted work was continuing . Was that forwarded to you? MR. VOLDENBERG : It was. And then code enforcement manager went out to the property and verified they were only power washing at the time and permits were pulled for other internal work. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Excellent . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll keep an eye on it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, appreciate it. And I was happy to see that we do have a shredding company now that's servicing the building . That was a question I had asked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 about several months back when we had the issue of the recyclable s being placed outside of City Hall. So I'm really happy to see that we have a company now that's going to be taking care of that for us. I am just wondering about the cost. I know that it's -- that those are usually inexpensive . But I would just be interested in knowing how much that will be for the city. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find out the cost. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Excellent . And one last thing that I just wanted to mention . So there have been several groups that have done, like, cleanups around the city and, you know, non-profits organization s that regularly hold them. And I just think it's really fantastic work that people do. And one of the groups that holds regular cleanups is called Scranton Lovers. And I joined them last week in a cleanup on Main Avenue in North Scranton . And it was outside of Griffin Cemetery , which I didn't know that that was a cemetery there.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 And I think a lot other people may not be as familiar with it. And it has some pretty old graves in there back when there was farmland in that area. And so I had gotten an interesting history lesson on it, which it just, you know, gives you a better appreciation for places like that. And it's also difficult to see when cemeteries like the Washburn Cemetery , you know, not taken care of. And this was on the sidewalk outside that we were cleaning up that was really filled with weeds and took many bags at least like a dozen bags to get all of that. But I was really happy to participate . And they wanted me to bring it up tonight because they just want to bring attention to their group in case other people are interested in volunteering . And they make it fun. And it's just a really great way to give back to the community by being able to help clean up our city. So if anyone is interested in getting in contact with them, I could provide contact information . There isn't like a Facebook group or anything that I could give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 you specifically to go to. But if you want to know more, then feel free to get in touch with me and I'll provide you a phone number. That's all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a couple. So recycling , there has been some buzz around town about recycling . And there's been a lot of questions posed to me that, you know, I should have the answers for and I don't. And so I'm looking for answers . I know Mr. Schuster just touched on it. My questions might be a little different , but his are important I believe and so are these. So let's clarify again. Mr. Voldenberg , let's find out what the title is now. We had a recycling coordinator . Now it's going to be recycling slash refuse coordinator ? I wasn't aware of the title change and that it would be beneficial to know if that occurred . It would also be beneficial to know if there is someone in that position 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 whatever they are going to call it because I remember we were without one. And then I was told that maybe that whoever is covering for the DPW Director was assuming the responsibilities , I don't know. But I lived here long enough to know when recycling started . And, you know, when it started , you know, of course, and I know that the Recycling Act of 1988 is one of the reasons why we did it. And that's fine. And, you know, of course, we worry about the environment . And that's fine too. But my understand ing it was suppose d to produce revenue . From what I'm hearing now it doesn't. So it cost us to recycle . So we have, you know, we have a great DPW team that has to pick up the recyclables . Now we're hearing we're charged 40, was charged 40, maybe it's 120 now or going to be. So I would like to know -- the question s I would like to pose is, is there any net revenue from recycling of these recovered materials ? And I'm talking about, you know, cans, bottles . I know it's commingled . I know in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the past or recent past that there was a problem with the commingling because China no longer wanted it, who would actually do that work. And then, you know, it was going to be an issue with us and then it kind of went away. But I don't remember the outcome totally or where we're at now. And, you know, is there a cost benefit ratio because there is expenses , like I said, with recycling not just what they charge at the landfill but we have to pay salaries and trucks to pick this up. I'm concerned about the environment . But what does it actually cost us to recycle and if there is another vehicle to use, not meaning a motor vehicle , another way to do this where it costs less for the residents . You know, we don't have to reinvent the wheel. But I'm not sure that, you know, administration when they come to us with asking for raises and new positions , they do comparisons with other cities like Bethlehem , Allentown . So I would like to know -- we don't need a study. This information should be in-house and easily obtainable . I don't want to hear 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 we'll put Rubicon on it. We don't need that. I just think, you know, let's not reinvent the wheel. Let's ask administration for these numbers . You know, are we making money or not? First, that's the first question . And if we're not making money then, you know, if it was revenue neutral I would be okay with it or break even. What I'm hearing it probably isn't. I don't know that. So I would like to know that. And, you know, moving forward are we looking at ways to maximize , you know, the way we do this and can we do it better? And that information should be inhouse and easily obtained from other municipalities that maybe are doing it better than us and that's fine. If they are, you know, we're not going to reinvent the wheel. So if you would please pose them questions to administration . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Okay, here's a property that, I mean, I'm here four plus years and this property has come up multiple times. So it is 3103 McCarthy Street. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 It was on fire 10 years ago, all right? And I got some information from Mr. Voldenberg and thank you very much. But I'm getting complaint s about this property again. And my understanding , this gentleman lives -- who owns it lives in Brooklyn , an LLC. But they went to the Scranton Board of Appeals , which convened in May. The owner was granted six months. So they have until November to maintain the property . They're not. Must obtain a performance bond -- I'm not sure if they did that. But the property owner or owners' agent was given a 30-day extension to schedule and complete an engineer 's report and city inspection . Has that occurred because I don't think they pulled any permits . I don't think they're doing any work. I'm told no. We need to verify that. I'm also hearing multiple complaint s about this property . And there is drug activity being seen there with regards to selling drugs. So please alert the police department . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 And my understanding is there is a squatter or squatters living there with drug-related behavior . There's dogs that are living with them. And so, like I said, let's check on the permits , were any pulled. Are they following what they're supposed to do, which is in writing here and they have until November . But meanwhile , even if they're not, there's some suspicious activity there the residents that live near there are very concerned about. So let's have both entities take a good look at this and please provide some feedback for me and so I could provide it to the poor neighbors that are worried about this. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have it for you, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So, okay, the Heritage Trail, you know, I drive by it and around it or, you know, through the intersection sometimes down in Bellevue . But a gentleman reached out to me and he's like, you know, he's witnessing some very unsafe practice s of drivers.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And, you know, he asked for a speed bump is that a possibility . I know they're not allowed in the city. But I don't know if we need better signage . I know maybe some have stop signs or not. So could you please ask administration -- so what's the process ? I mean, I understand like I see, I drive, I slow down like everybody else does. But I know there's some little signage there and, you know, can we do better at because it doesn't seem to be working in this gentleman 's eyes. If there is anything else that's being thought of, maybe you could ask administration so this gentleman can have some type of satisfaction with his question . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. And I'll also ask the county. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Yeah, thank you. And I know and they're a big part of it. But, you know, the intersection s of the city are ours to worry about and maintain . MR. VOLDENBERG : They have updated some the past, so I'll follow up. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 you. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Mr. Schuster , do you have anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg -- MR. MCANDREW : I apologize , when you're done I missed one. All right. I apologize , but this is something that was brought to my attention last week. So, I mean, everybody has witnessed banners being put up across Main Avenue, different parts of the city. I mean, as long as I'm alive I've seen them. And they're great ways to advertise , especially for small churches that afford any other advertising , you know, outside of word of mouth or during mass or whatever . So it was brought to my attention that the Lebanese festival , it happens every year probably in a week from now had a sign across Main Avenue in West Side. It's every year like clockwork . They were denied this year with an excuse that we can't put signs up on state roads and that concerned me. So I reached out to Mr. Smurl and I thanked him because he got me the banner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 policy. There's a new policy, guys. And guess when it came out? June 21st of 2024. No one knows about it. I didn't know about it. Mr. Smurl didn't know about. I'm grateful that he got it for me. We had to ask for it. People asking about this it was just denied. Some people did a little digging and they reached out to Harrisburg and said, no, we -- PennDOT , they're like we have no problem . We never told Scranton because initially we were told that Scranton said, you know, they reached out to us and said we can't do it anymore, which I, you know, maybe was that was case. But some people reached out to Harrisburg and PennDOT . And they said, no, we have no problem with it. I mean, come on. We know it's been done forever . And they're like, no, we didn't send any directive to your city to, you know, stop doing this. So we get the policy. And I'm looking through -- I'm not going to read the whole thing. I hope, Mr. Voldenberg , you could put this on the website because it's a new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 policy that the resident s should be aware. But in a nutshell it pretty much says after reading it that we still could do that as long -- now there's a couple steps involved . Any request has to come before Council . And that's what we kind of -- that's the understanding we have. Maybe we didn't hear that exact directly . MR. SMURL: It pretty much says in there Council can change the ordinance and give permission and then the city would assume responsibility . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, that's fine. I mean, I don't know why the change in policy. Who knows, but I just wanted the folks to know out there that, you know what, you could still put that banner up. And now there is just a little more paperwork involved for whatever reason, I don't know. But, you know, moving forward now is the process that has to come before us. So if you're planning an event or yearly event, it's probably , you know, wise to reach out to us ahead of time, give us some ample time. It's unfortunate , but the way it reads now that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 what we have to do. And, you know, we could have more discussion on this with administration for clarity and why the, you know, there is some speed bumps put up now to slow this process down. But I apologize . I jumped back in. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. SCHUSTER : All right, Frank, I have three quick things. One was 1519 Dickens Street. I know I was in contact with you and I believe Isaiah where the sidewalk is buckled around a water basin on 1519 Dickens. I did get receipt that DPW received that but we haven't heard anything on that since so if we could just follow up on that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a status, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. We talked about fire damage properties , if we could just follow up on 1111 Rear Blair. It's been on the demo list for a while. We all know what property that is if we could follow up on that one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 And then there was an update on 614 North Sumner Avenue that we got. So as per last Tuesday 's Council meeting , the property owner at 614 North Summer Ave., was issued a quality of life citation for $200. And it's due on 9/14. Andrew Sunday asked DPW to trim the property which we did hear that DPW did trim the property . The property is not city owned. But there is a lien placed on the property and a demo notice was issued. So this property should be on the demo list. That's all. Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . I just want an update on last week with the information that I presented during Council and gave to the administration on a conservatorship about blighted properties and vacant properties . We did have our first meeting yesterday . And we are in the process of establishing a vacant property review committee . So there is a lot of legislation that has to be written yet on this. There are a lot of rules. And there are a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 ordinances and stuff we may need to be changing so that we may go after the owners of these blighted properties and either take them into conservatorship or another way the city was looking at was an eminent domain. The conservatorship seems to be a little less drastic . But at that meeting , it is not public yet because it isn't -- it isn't actually a committee yet. So until we get all of our rules started and we have a legislation that we need to move forward , that's when it will be established . Once it's established , it will be an open public meeting . But until then we'll probably get together one more time just to make sure our rules are together and everybody is on the same page. There's a lot of work to this. As of right now we have (inaudible ) Todd Pousley , Eliza Carrol, Jacob Weinberg , Don King, Andrew Sunday, Frank Voldenberg , Andrew Connors , and we have Attorney Mariclare Hayes and Attorney Andrew Cutillo . So I don't know how much we're going to adjust that. I believe Dr. Rothchild is going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 be part of that since she was part of I believe what the original blight -- I don't know if we ever got a real name for that -- the blight task force was. So this is maybe the way we plan to move forward with this so that we actually do have more bite. We could actually go and take a property that is being a problem in our neighborhood . So if that's the only way we could do it, but I will update everyone. I believe we're having the next meeting -- we're supposed to do it the first Monday of every quarter . So that would put us into December , about December 4th, I believe . But after it's organized , we will make it a public meeting or a public hearing . The second thing I want to speak about, I want to thank Councilman McAndrew and the Career Technology Center for hosting a lunch today for our first respond ers. Councilman McAndrew is also an instructor at Career Technology Center and has been doing this event for our first responders for many years.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 And I didn't even know about it until this year when I was invited . I just want to say his student s did a wonderful job preparing all the food and the desserts . It was a great service they provided for our first responders . I believe the part I had enjoyed the most today was when Mr. McAndrew spoke to us and his students about the importance of what happened September 11th of 2001. Most of these children weren't even -- these young adults weren't even born. So this is something that we all need to teach our children about. And I thank Mr. McAndrew for teaching our students about 9/11. And they are lucky to have you as an instructor . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SMURL: That's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
