Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any comments or motions tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : I got nothing at this time. MR. PERRY: Mr. Gaughan , any comments or motions tonight ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Just two things, Mrs. Reed. 824 Pittston Avenue, I know I sent this to you in an e-mail, I just want to make sure it gets in the record. There is a woman that lives next door to this property , she has numerous concerns so if we could jus make sure we stay on top of that with the Licensing and Inspections Department . The other thing I wanted to mention was West Locust Street and Parrot Avenue, we have sent this in before, but a woman had reported that a hole had opened up in that vicinity so if we can send that again to the Licensing and Inspections Department . Also, we did receive a letter, I know I have been going back and forth with a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 gentleman over in the Watson Street letter, we received a letter February 8, 2019, from Pennsylvania American Water about issues in the area of the 1100 blocks of Watson Street, Rundell Street and Sloan Street, there is several issues. In response to the letter that we sent, American Water sent staff to clean and inspect the sewer pipes over there and catch basins that were described in the areas. They were owned by Pennsylvania American Water. Once an assessment of the sewer facilities in the area had been made, Pennsylvania American Water said they will take action in repairing or replacing any sewer pipes, manholes or catch basins that do not meet their standards , and then there is some other things in this letter here, but they are taking the issue seriously and we did copy Mr. Norton who reported that problem to me, so I appreciate that. Also, we did get a letter from Mayor Courtright , I sent -- council sent a letter January 30, 2019, asking for an update on the Shared Services Committee between the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 city and the school district . Mayor Courtright said, "I am in receipt of your letter dated January 30. The city is addressing several of the proposed initiatives for shared services . A brief summary of key items of significant value are as follows : The city and school district have both adopted the extension of the LERTA designation . The city is working with it's Act 47 coordinator , the Pennsylvania Economy League to convert its business privilege and mercantile taxes to a payroll tax with target implementation of2020. The city is hopeful that the school district will also adopt this conversion . The city is presently awaiting a proposal for the soccer field project at which point the city and school district can further evaluate the feasibility and the value of this initiative . The city would be interested in establishing cooperation with the school district regarding recycling and would like the shared services committe e to explore this possibility further ." So that is the correspondence we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 received from the mayor and we did talk in the caucus about any correspondence that we get from the mayor or any department heads that we would consider starting to put that in third order so that's included in the backup. Mrs. Reed and I will be meeting with representatives from the University of the Scranton on March 7 to discuss the internship program that we have been working on so I'm hopeful that once that meeting occurs that we will finalize our plans and we will have an intern in the city council office relatively soon. Also, I received an e-mail from residents on Greenwood Avenue and they would like to thank the DPW for their quick action in filling major potholes on Greenwood Avenue. The residents reported they called February 11, they immediately received a call back and the issue was resolved on February 15. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. I only have two quick issues to address , the first one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 is on North South Street, with the weather starting to break a little bit and get cold a little bit and then the rain, of course, the potholes are inevitable . North South Street there has been some reports of some potholes if we can have DPW with some cold patch check out of that area and see what can be done. And then, also, I received some inquiries on the update on the Novembrino project . The last time it was posted there was supposed to be some activity on the site in January , there hasn't been any yet, so if we can just get an update from the administration on what the holdup is and if there is a new time frame or if something shifted or changed and then I will definitely get back to them. And those are the only two issues that I for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, Mr. Perry, I have one thing. MR. PERRY: Sure. Go right ahead. MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed, if we could find out, I had it here some place, but I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 don't know what I did with it, the budget for the storm water for the Arcadis , what the city's budget was if we could just find out from Mr. Bulzoni , okay?

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A BEAUTIFUL BLOCKS PROGRAM PROPOSAL BY AND BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND NEIGHBORWORKS NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TO ENCOURAGE GROUPS OF NEIGHBORS TO IMPROVE THEIR HOMES BY PROVIDING MATCHING GRANTS FOR EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS . MR. PERRY: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. GAUGHAN : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I just want to take a second and explain what this is and talk a little bit about it so I'm just going to read right from the legislation the program overview because I think this is -- this is the type of vision, this is the type of program that the city really needs, and I think this is just something that the administration really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 should -- and Neighbor Works should be applauded for. So the program overview , it says, "Through a partnership between the City of Scranton and Neighbor Works Northeastern Pennsylvania , the Beautiful Blocks program will encourage groups of neighbors to improve their homes by providing matching grants for exterior improvements . The median listing price of the homes in Scranton is just over $100,000 while the national median listing price is approximately $275,000. The Beautiful Blocks Program seeks to not only narrow this disparity but also build community through concentrate d home improvement projects that beautify a neighbor hood. The Beautiful Blocks Program is modeled after the City of Oswego successful Renaissance Block Challenge Grant Program . The goal is to provide an incentive for groups of five or more neighbors to work together to make exterior improvements to their homes which will make neighbor hoods more attractive places to live and increase 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 property values over time. Through the program , each property owner can receive a matching grant of to $1,000 for exterior home improvements . These grants will afford Scranton residents the opportunity to define their neighborhoods and take the revitalization of the city into their own hands. The budget for this program in the first year was grant funds that equals $50,000. Program administration $10,000, trailer , tools and equipment is up to $8,000 for a total of $68,000. You know, Councilman Evans had approached myself and other members of council about this program back in the summer because he had, you know, seen how successful this was in the City of Oswego, New York. And, again, I have to applaud him and the administration for the foresight in Neighbor Works to try to implement this program . I think that this is going to help kick start neighborhood revitalization in the city by promoting development , restoration and in some cases preservation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 of our neighbor hoods. And I'm hoping, as was the case in Oswego, and in similar programs throughout the country , that this will have a domino effect and spread to other parts of the city and continue to get bigger each and every year. The other thing I wanted to pointed out was some of the -- what it takes to be eligible for this. So as was mentioned earlier , it will be open to groups of five or more neighbors providing that the following requirements are met. All homes, obviously , must be located in the City of Scranton . Grants must be used for exterior home improvements only. Neighboring homes must be located on the same street or block. If a block has previously received a beautiful blocks grant, it may be reapply after a two-year period, however , at least 50 percent of the homes must not have participated in the past. The grants are going to be awarded through a very competitive application process and are going to be awarded based upon the availability of funding and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 number and quality of applications received . I think last year in Oswego there was over 170 homeowners that had applied for their grant program . So, again, I think this does a number of different things. It will help kick start the revitalization in some of these neighbor hoods and it might bring together neighbors that wouldn't usually maybe get together on some sort of project . So, again, with some of the other things that we have tried to do here we are trying to give people in the city an incentive to upgrade their properties and we are going to provide a matching grant of up to $1,000. And I have to, again, applaud Neighbor Works as well. They are a group that it seems everything that they touch ends up being successful . So, again, I applaud the mayor, the administration and I hope that -- I know that this program is going to be successful . Thank you. MR. PERRY: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ?
