Also, final announcement , DPW's going to be off next Monday, May 25th for the Memorial Day Holiday . Refuse and newspaper collection will be one day behind next week. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you, Councilman Gaughan . Just to double-check back with you, were all Third Order items received and filed? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, all Third Order items were received and filed. MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. I would ask now that someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals , Fay Franus and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. On the question ? On the question , Mrs. Franus had submitted several questions related to the appointment of Mrs. Cipriani tonight . I had talked prior to the meeting with Solicitor Hayes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 And, Solicitor Hayes, you know, if you can research her questions -- Mrs. Franus's questions and provide a response by next week I would appreciate that. Sorry, you were muted. ATTY. HAYES: No problem . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And Mrs. Schumacher again as I mention ed in the caucus had submitted several questions . So we're going to forward those to the proper department . I do have one of the answers . I just don't have it right in front of me now. So I will forward that over to her. And hopefully we get some answers . I do know the administration did respond to one of her questions and is working on the others. Does anyone have any comment ? Okay. There's been a motion made. There's been on the question . All those in favor of the motion, signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. The ayes have it and so moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 (Public Comment ) (Fay Franus) Council , It is my understanding that a person who gets a waiver to work in the city if they live out of the city MUST get this waiver BEFORE starting work. Did Eileen Ciprianni start work on May 18, 2020 before getting this waiver? How long is this waiver for? Does Eileen Ciprianni have 6 months to move into the city or can she live outside the city indefinitely ? One part of the City Administrative Code states one SHALL move into the city within six months or be terminated . Do you feel a person should live in the city to take this job as head of OECD? If so Why? If not, why not? How many departments are actually working and getting paid at City Hall? Are they there every day? How many people and who are they who are working from home and getting paid?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 How many confidential assistants /secretaries does the Mayor have working for her? Who are they? I paid my garbage TAX bill yesterday . Six people on my block alone will not be paying their garbage bill and have not for at least 10 years. Part of my money is going towards THEIR payment . As I have said time and time again you have a law that states the DPW does NOT have to pick up anyone's garbage if they do not pay their garbage bill. Bill Gaughan has stated that that would be hard to enforce because of bags all over -- well Council woman Dempsey alleviated that concern by having a LAW passed that states every home owner/renter must have LIDS on their garbage cans. This way there will be no bags laying on the sidewalk with garbage in them. This is yet another law you CHOOSE to not enforce . Time and time again you have ignored the citizens of this city. Why is a great question to answer-- Today is May 19th, 2020. I have yet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 to get ONE response from any of you in reply to my many questions . That is inexcusable on many levels. Fay Franus (Marie Schumacher ) First, the Agenda items, 5E First and foremost for years we have heard how many citizens we taxpayer educated that would like to return home but there are no jobs available . Now we have an open position and you want to fill it with a non-resident . The University of Scranton has a Master's program in Human Relations Management so it possible someone with such a degree might be interested in this position and be willing to live in the City. Second, my sixth sense tells me there is probably more than meets the eye. What person would give up a job overseeing a staff of 400 employees and a budget of $228 million to take the Scranton job? Just doesn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 compute . However , if Ms. Cipriani wants this job let her move to Scranton and pay all the taxes the residents pay. Finally on Agenda Items, are all the salaries as budgeted for 2020? Last week Mr. Gaughan commented on the few employees available to be accessed in City Hall. How many active (not furoughed ) employees are working 285. Recently it was announced there would no City pools utilized this year, will the splash pads be open if completed ? And, speaking of splash parks. As I went through the Controller 's Report for April I noticed that Don Scartelli received $102,690. You may recall this is the firm contracted for the Novembrino splash pad. I opened the Controller Reports for the first quarter of 2020 and found the firm had receive $327,240 to date. I thought great! The splash pad must be ready to use so I hopped into the car and went to see it. All I found were a couple of old buildings one with new windows but not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 even a hint of a splash pad. So, what amount is in the Capital budget for the Novembrino splash pad? While on the subject of the Capital budget I would like to request the Capital budget be added to the Business Administrator 's website along with the Operating Budget and Auditor Reports . The Controller 's Report for April also revealed the IT Department expended $285,627 to CDW Government during the month (both Operating and Capital Budgets ). What is this firm contracted to do, was it a competitive bid and did this contract come before City Council for approval ? Can anyone explain why $429,767 was expended in March for the Street Lighting lease and in April there was a credit in the same amount? To wrap up the Controller 's April report, it appears there are several accounts that will exceed their budget for the year (such as landfill ). Since the Harrison Avenue replacement bridge opened has the City done any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 study (such an ARC GIS) to maximize fire protection more efficiently ? I do believe you need to pass a resolution to send to the Governor asking him to let us live again. If the long term care deaths are taken out of the equation we should be fine even with the ever-changing "goals." People are finding new ways to shop and if it doesn't end soon they will not return to the old ways and even more money will flow out of the City. I will end noting that kicking the Stormwater can down the road has resulted in yet another lawsuit against the City. (End of Public Comment ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments today? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a couple. So we talked in caucus a little bit about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 ATVs. I don't know if the caucus went public at this point in time but probably have to state that again, correct ? MR. GAUGHAN : It was public but you could state it again. MR. SCHUSTER : So I did get a call with some pictures , some video from over on East Mountain . And one of the sections there, they use a place at the bottom of Moltke and East Mountain Road for staging while they are doing a pipeline and possibly for 81. And the concrete dividers that keep vehicles out of that area have been moved to where cars and ATVs can get in. So we're exploring some of the options that we can take there with ATVs in several sections of the City. And also we stated about the flood project in North Scranton or I stated about the flood project in North Scranton and maybe some of those ATVs were taking some of the topsoil off the top of the flood plain or the flood -- the dams there. So that's a possibility . I also wanted to request that Council send correspondence to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 administration to see if we can get a written response for a date of -- an end date for the current HR Director before the new HR Director takes that position as well as to send a letter to the Mayor requesting a tax payment from Mrs. Cipriani . And one other thing, we did get an e-mail about the polling places, the fire stations , one of them being the fire station in North Scranton on West Market Street and the other one East Mountain fire station . Do we know or did we get an answer as to whether those polling stations will be opened on Election Day? MR. GAUGHAN : You know, Tom, that's a good question . I was actually going to bring this up as well. The county has sent -- I think it came from Don Frederickson . Yeah, he had sent a letter that is basically saying that the Mayor has made a decision to close Ward 2-1 and Ward 12-3, the firehouses that you just mentioned in terms of voting in the Presidential Primary Election . I don't know how the Mayor is able to do that to be quite honest with you this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 close to an election. I think Don Frederickson is making the same argument here. So that the Board of Election s is requesting that she reconsider her decision to close the two City firehouses to the voters on June 2nd and allow them to serve as polling places as they have for the past three decades. I would tend to agree with that. And if you want, I think we can send correspondence to the Mayor trying to get a, you know, explanation as to why that was done. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that would be good. MR. GAUGHAN : Anything else, Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. I think that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do, mister -- Councilman Gaughan . I apologize . I was unable to unmute myself during moment of silence . But two gentlemen from the City passed away last week, one was Billy Bocchicchio . He worked for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the Single Tax Office for 21 years and Lieutenant James Togher of the Scranton Fire Department . So please let them know that, you know, they're in our hearts and prayers . Secondly , also today as Chairman of the Public Safety Committee , I'd like to say that I had the great pleasure today at noon to watch the Scranton Police Department virtual memorial . It was very moving. It was honoring our fallen police officers that made the ultimate sacrifice . The inscription at the base of moment pretty much summed it all up, integrity , courage and honor. So great job, Chief Graziano , the Memorial Committee and the Scranton Police Department . Secondly , also we discussed in caucus it's no secret I've been asking for the billable hours of the acting HR Director for the past four weeks and the hours prior to the past four weeks. So what I said in caucus was what is our recourse because I waited four weeks. And so if that person -- the acting HR Director worked 40 hours a week for the past four weeks, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 not including the prior weeks at $89 an hour which is a lot of -- that would be 14 grand or so which would be a third of budgeted salary for Miss Viola. So, Solicitor Hayes said the possibility of a subpoena . I mean, I don't think I should have to do a Right To Know, which is -- I mean, I asked, you know, I think a reasonable question in a reasonable amount of time. So with that said, please, Solicitor Hayes, please explore that for me so we can get this information to the taxpayer . I'm not the only one asking. There's people coming up to me in the community , taxpayers asking, you know, what's going on here. So please do that for me. ATTY. HAYES: I will. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have one comment tonight that I wanted to offer. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 just wanted to say thank you to Mrs. Ward for the work that she's done as OECD Director . I think that she has done a great job. And I'm really appreciative for what she's done for the City and the fact that she will be continuing to stay with the City as assistant director I think is great. We're lucky to have her. So I was happy to see that. And I just wanted to make a note of that. And I know that we will be discussing the residency waiver that's on for our legislation . And I had just a few comments about that. I do believe that from our conversations and seeing the resume of Miss Cipriani that she is highly qualified for the position . And she does have connections that are unique and that we perhaps have not had and knowledge of a lot of grants that will be useful for the City. So I was excited to see her. Obviously she does not live in the City of Scranton . And while that is problematic , I -- I've been a little confused in the past on the residency requirement that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 we have. I feel like maybe it's an outdated ordinance . I haven't really heard of a lot of other places, cities, municipalities that have that same sort of legislation still. And I would hate to I think lose out on such a great candidate for the position just because of that. You know, I don't think that she's going to put any less effort into her job because of it. And, you know, I don't think she would work harder if she lived in the City of Scranton . So, you know, I think that I will be supporting her in that position . And I'm excited to have the opportunity to work with her. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just a couple quickly . Miss Reed, would you be able to send the following addresses over to Licensing and Inspections to go look at? I've gotten some complaint s on both of them. One is 2041-2043 Margaret Ave. And then the other is 1068 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Cottage Avenue, just some quality of life issues there. And would we be able to request another update on the progress of the Serrenti Center as well? I think we sent that out a couple weeks ago. I don't think we've gotten anything back to my knowledge . And then another request is a status update on the contract with Northeast Revenue and where the administration is with that. And could we also request the paving list for this year and to see when an RFP or an RFQ will go out for the City's Paving Program ? I could put all this into an e-mail too so we don't miss anything . MR. GAUGHAN : Kyle, I'm sorry, I think Mrs. Reed dropped the call for a second. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. I'll put it in an e-mail just so those requests are in -- and that's all I have. MS. REED: My call dropped , I'm sorry. I have 2041-43 Margaret and 1068 Cottage Ave., to the LIPS Department . And I'm sorry, I wasn't on the call after that. MR. DONAHUE : I was just looking for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 a status update for the Serrenti Center project -- progress . And the status update on the Northeast Revenue contract . MS. REED: Will do. ATTY. HAYES: -- the Northeast Revenue contract , I have been trying to obtain information per the request of Councilman Gaughan so I'll follow up on that issue. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have a few comments . I mention ed in the caucus about a resident reaching out to me regarding the garbage bills and paying the garbage bills online. So I just want to state this at the public meeting in case anyone else is experiencing the same type of issue. The woman who reached out to me had paid her garbage bill online. Two hundred seventy was the discount . And after she paid it, it was still showing that she owed $30. So I reached out to the City Treasurer . He did state that they had similar issues to this last year. And he was going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 get back to me. So if any Council members get calls on that or anyone from the public is watching and that has happened , that is being looked into. Councilman Schuster mentioned the ATVs. I too have gotten a lot of calls on this issue. So in the caucus -- and Councilman Schuster had requested tonight as well Solicitor Hayes look into the laws that we have on the book in regards to ATVs and maybe what we can do to better enforce them or add more teeth to them. So we'll take a look at that. ATTY. HAYES: Absolutely . MR. GAUGHAN : The other thing, I had a conversation today briefly with Mrs. Reed regarding Third Avenue. Before this whole pandemic started to occur, I was in constant contact with the residents of Third Avenue regarding truck traffic . I received a message today from the gentleman who was leading the charge over there in regards to this issue. And it still is a major issue. And it's a major nuisance to that neighborhood . So I had asked Mrs. Reed if she would send correspondence again to the Mayor, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 the DPW and the City Engineer and to copy the Police Chief, Carl Graziano on it as well basically to try to see if we can come up with some sort of solution and to do an assessment of that area once again. So hopefully that will be taken care of. I also got a call in regards to a gentleman that was attacked by pitbull in the Hill Section . He had relayed to me really a horrific story of a dog that is kind of terrorizing the neighborhood . He request ed that Council revisit the laws that we have on the book. I had sent him the memo that Solicitor Hayes had provided to us when Mr. Spindler had requested something similar . So what he had suggested and what maybe we'll have a discussion on in the next few weeks is requiring dangerous dogs to wear muzzles when they are on a public street. This is something that he is pushing for. Again, it's not something we're going to make a decision on tonight or anything . But I just wanted to let everyone know that he probably will be reaching out to all of you. So that is an issue that he is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 stating that several people in the Hill Section are concerned about as well. In regards to the poll -- MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, I received the same complaint from that gentleman . And I instructed him to actually , you know, do public comment in the form of an e-mail so we can actually get this process started . Sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : No, that's okay. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, I'm going to jump in here too. Was that breed specific or was it just any dangerous dog? MR. GAUGHAN : I can't even remember to be honest with you. Yeah, I think it was pitbulls. But I forgot you weren't on Council when we had that memo. Tom, I'll forward it to you so you can take a look at it. But, yeah, it's definitely an issue so -- MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. To jump back to the ATV piece, the neighbor said that up there on East Mountain Road that the concrete barrier s are open enough that the vehicles can get in there. I don't know if it's in the City's purview to move those barriers or whose 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 property that is. But that might be a fix to that situation there just find out whose property it is to move those. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. That's a good idea. MR. DONAHUE : I do believe that property is privately owned. And I don't know -- I know the barrier s that Mr. Schuster is talking about. And it sort of didn't stop ATVs. But it stopped , you know, like a jeep or something from going back that way. But I believe it's privately owned. And I don't know if the City has something to do with putting those there in the first place or if the property owner did that on their own. So maybe we can look into that too. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, some of the video I had was trucks and like several of them and like a convoy going back at night with their headlights on. MR. DONAHUE : Oh, yeah. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And the last thing that I had was in regards to the letter that we received or were copied on today in regards to changing polling places, one in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 North Scranton , one on East Mountain in the firehouses . I actually just received an e-mail from Stephanie Pisko, the Mayor's Chief of Staff. They had been in communication with the Bureau of Elections from the county. And the reason for their request for those changes was because of the coronavirus . They did not want people in those firehouses with employees in them voting. So they suggested the use of other properties nearby. So I'm not really sure where it's at. But that was the reasoning , the reasoning for that. So we'll follow up on that, I guess. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I know some of the -- there were some changes in some polling places. I did look at the county site where I saw that say, for example , the Boys and Girls Club on Ash Street, I think. I think they were going to be voting at the county building and several of those other polling places we have over at the county building . School Board President , Katie Gilmartin just sent me -- I'm going to forward it to you now; but it's from the Department of State and the school district got that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 correspondence from the Department of State I think stating that they had to open for election day.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF EILEEN CIPRIANI , 117 WASHINGTON AVENUE, WEST WYOMING , PENNSYLVANIA , 18644 TO THE POSITION OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVE MAY 18, 2020. MS. CIPRIANI WILL BE REPLACING MARY-PAT WARD WHO WAS SERVING AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm going to be voting for this appointment tonight . And I'll also be voting in the next piece of legislation to grant the residency waiver for several reasons . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 First, in the past I had stated my concern with hiring individuals who do not reside in the City. I'm taking a different position today for the following reasons , first, by all accounts the United States may be entering into one of the worst recessions since the great depression of the 1930s. The coronavirus pandemic has had an absolutely devastating debilitating effect, not only on the health of our people but on their livelihood and our economy . Just today as Mrs. Cipriani stated in the caucus, there was an article in the Scranton Times which stated that Lackawanna County's website crashed yesterday when they offered a digital application for business relief grants. People are desperate for help. At no time in the City's history have we needed a more qualified , competent and most importantly experienced individual to lead our Office of Economic and Community Development . As a City, we all know that we're staring down a barrel of unprecedented economic challenges . When Lackawanna County moves from a red to yellow phase whenever that is, there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 will most likely be many businesses which have closed that will not be able to reopen. This presents a challenge in terms of lost jobs and revenue that the City receives . For example , Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax and Earned Income Tax revenue . We must give the Mayor and her administration the tools to be able to have a chance at recovery . We need the best person for the job, not somebody 's cousin, not somebody 's brother , sister or uncle. We need someone who knows how to work with the business community to come up with plans and strategies to actually foster growth. The City is going to need someone in the important position of OECD Director who has already built relationships throughout the state and with the Governor 's office and state legislature , someone who has experience navigating the grant process . Every municipal ity in the state will be competing for the same funding , the same grants and the same resources . It is crucial . It is crucial that the City of Scranton is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 competi tive because many times in the past we have not been. Miss Cipriani 's resume is impressive . The former Deputy Secretary for Workforce Development for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry , former Director of the State Workers Insurance Fund, special assistant for strategic initiative for the Department of Labor and Industry , masters degree in organizational management and degrees in leadership development and project management . She clearly , clearly has the background qualifications and experience to do the job. The waiver process was put in place for these specific situation s in which the City would face unique challenges and I don't think anyone would disagree with me when I say that we are in an extreme ly unique position . And trying to come out on the other side of the devastation of this coronavirus pandemic is going to require , not only Council working together with the OECD Director ; but it's going to require someone who actually has experience , someone who actually has the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 qualifications . Over the past six years I've guided my decisions based on what I think is best for our City. After reviewing the resume, after understanding the unique situation we're in, this is in the best interest of the City. And that's why I'll be voting for the appointment . And I'll also be voting for the waiver. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction into its proper committee signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. No? Or Opposed rather? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-E.

MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, on the question , I made this request last week just for the simple fact that this funding would help our police department .

MCANDREW : Yeah, Billy, as Chairman of Public Safety I also echo your comments . I mean, our police force needs every tool available to battle this pandemic and be on the front lines. Thank you. MR.

MR. GAUGHAN : What is recommendation of Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of 7-B. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this might be slightly off task. But in the emergency declarations that we received a few weeks ago, I did ask about in those declarations it does say that money over $21,000 -- it's giving the City the permission to purchase and procure items, lease things like that. And I requested whether we had used that emergency declaration to purchase anything at the time. I think the answer was no. Can I make another request to see if the City has purchased anything with that proclamation ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah.

Before we adjourn the meeting just so I'm clear because I don't know if my audio was choppy. When we voted on the appointment of Mrs. Cipriani , Solicitor Hayes, that went three to two in favor of Mrs. Cipriani , correct ? You're muted. I can't hear you. ATTY. HAYES: I'm sorry it was five-zero. MR. GAUGHAN : Or, five-zero, I'm sorry. And so my question now is so that's moving towards next week for a final vote on the appointment . However , there was no second 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 on the waiver. ATTY. HAYES: That's correct . MR. GAUGHAN : Right, so -- ATTY. HAYES: The 5-E would have failed because there was no second. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. So how does that affect the appointment now if the appointment goes through next week? ATTY. HAYES: So the appointment can be effectuated and passed and become effective after next week's meeting . However , it will be without a waiver. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. ATTY. HAYES: A residency waiver. So in other words, Mrs. Cipriani would be permitted to serve in that capacity for six months -- or would be allowed to obtain residency within six months. MR. GAUGHAN : She would be able to what? I'm sorry, I missed the last part. ATTY. HAYES: Obtain residency in the City within six months of her employment . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. All right. If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn . MR.
