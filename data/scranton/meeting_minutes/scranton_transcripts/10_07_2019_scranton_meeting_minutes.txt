Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one. The City of Scranton is preparing their Five Year Consolidated Plan, Annual Action Plan and its analysis of impediments to fair housing choice. As part of the planning process , the City is conducting a survey to identify residents ' needs in the community and ideas on what the City residents would like to see funds used for. Please take a few minutes if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 haven't already and complete the survey which can be found at the top of the City's website Scranton PA dot gov. ATTY. DEMPSEY : I have a few as well. Thank you. Good evening , everybody . And thank you for attending . My first announcement is I want to thank our Ethics Board. I was reading the paper today and I see that we have our first scheduled meeting for October 10th at 5 p.m. So thank you to the people who are following through on that and making sure that gets scheduled in a timely and an expedited fashion . And we do appreciate that. The second thing I will mention is I saw this on Facebook . And it had to do with a Scranton Police Officer . And I really think it's a beautiful sentiment . And it says, Today is October 3rd, 2019. Two years ago on October 3rd, 2017, Scranton Police Officer , Christopher Hallock was diagnose d with cancer. The Scranton Police Officer writing this post is Officer Chris Hallock . I just wanted to send a special thank you to the great City of Scranto n, the many business owners and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 the resident s who call it home. So many people have supported me and my family through this difficult journey . Community policing has always been so important to me and my favorite part of being a police officer . No matter what you were dealing with or going through , do not give up on yourself . Continue to push forward . Take it one step at a time. A quote that helped on tough days was: Tomorrow is a brand new day with a brand new beginning . Be kind to one another . And let's continue to make Scranton the great City that it is. So I thought that was a beautiful sentiment . And to Officer Hallock we send our thoughts and our sentiment s for a speedy recovery . Thank you. MR. PERRY: I have a couple announcements . Beginning today October 7th, the License, Inspections and Permits Department will no longer accept cash payments . Only credit cards, checks and money orders will be accepted as form of payment . There is no fee imposed for using 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 your credit card. Mayor Evans made arrangement that no fee would be charged . Once again, cash payments will no longer be accepted in Licensing and Permits Department . Also this Sunday, October 13th, will be the 24th Annual Steamtown Marathon. I can't believe it's almost been 25 years already . Remember when that first started it was a big deal? I can't believe it's been 24 years already . The annual Steamtown Marathon will be held. Please be mindful of the runners as you travel through the City on Sunday and plan for slight delays and/or road closures . I would like to congratulate all the participants and wish them a good race day. Next Monday, October 14th, City Hall will be closed in observance of Columbus Day holiday . DPW will also be off on that day. Refuge and recycling will be one day behind next week. Council 's next regularly scheduled meeting will be on Monday, October 21st. A public hearing will be held that evening at 5:45 for Item 5-B on tonight 's agenda. The legislation pertains to a parking permit on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 900 block of Jefferson Avenue. Thank you. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items or matters of general concern . Les Spindler Normam Jefferies Joan Hodowanitz Ron Ellman Bob Bolus Lee Morgan Dave Dobrzyn Marie Schumacher John Tarantino ) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just real quickly . An updated -- I asked for a timeline last week on the old Garcia's Market on Pittston Avenue. And I did get something back this morning for Mr. Oleski that the demo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 should occur on that property before the end of this month. Also myself and Council woman Dempsey met with representative s from SEIU Healthcare about their contract negotiations with Regional Hospital . A couple -- or over the weekend , I -- one of the representatives reached out to me and they're current ly working without a contract , which expired on September 30th. So I would like to make a motion that we send the following letter to the CEO of Regional Hospital , Michael Brown. The letter reads: Dear Mr. Brown, we were recently informed that members of the SEIU Healthcare of Pennsylvania in your hospital are currently working without a contract , which is expired on September 30th. It is our understanding that negotiations will not begin until the end of October . We are writing you today to urge you and your staff to begin negotiations immediately . As representatives of the City of Scranton , it is a part of our duty to ensure that our residents have access to the highest quality of patient care.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 We urge you to work with these caregivers to reach a fair union contract that ensures easily, obtainable , and affordable healthcare while also setting wages that ensure the hospital can recruit and retain the best talent. In closing , thank you for your time and consideration regarding this important matter. We look forward to seeing reports of an agreement that improves the quality of care within the City of Scranton . MR. PERRY: Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Do we have a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: All right. We have a motion and a second. Anybody on the question ? All those in favor of sending the letter to Regional Health signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Would you please note me as abstaining ? MR. DONAHUE : That's all I have for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 tonight . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comment s? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, thank you so much. I do have a couple comment s and I do have a couple motions. The first thing I'd to bring up is I think most people who know me and who've worked with me over the years it will be close to 30 years I have been practicing law know I try to be as diplomat ic as I can in just about everything I do. But I also have a strong sense of passion . I'm also the mother of three girls and an aunt of many girls. And a comment was made here tonight that I found offensive as a female, I found offensive as a professional and that I found insulting as a member of government . And I will not call out the person by name. But when a female candidate running for Mayor is called a Barbie doll, again, I find that sexist and I don't think it's acceptable . We do have rules of Council that say no person shall use their time to personal ly insult or attack any individual . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 I'm going to leave it at that. But I'm going to respectfully request that in the future we refrain from any type of offensive , insulting , or sexist comments . A couple other comments . Attorney -- excuse me, Mr. Donahue and I are going to visit the Boys and Girls Club. It's going to be this Thursday . Actually Mayor Evans will be joining us as well. So we're looking forward to that. They want to give us a tour of their facilities and explain to us everything that they do for the boys and girls. And we're looking forward to that. I think that's going to be very informative and very helpful for us to see it firsthand . My ongoing problems with venue -- my ongoing problem s with trash I do have some announcement s. This Thursday at 2:00 I will be having a meeting with NRS that will happening over at City Hall. The Mayor will be participating as well Mr. Bulzoni , Solicitor Eskra. And I'm not sure if additional people from the administration will be coming as well. And NRS will be bringing one, if not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 two representatives . So I'm looking forward to that meeting. Again, that will be this Thursday at 2:00. And I'll have an update on that once that is complete . I want to give a background on this and then I'm going to have a quick motion to finalize it. With regard to our gas card audit, Norma, I believe you had asked whether it was going to be all credit cards or, in particular , gas cards. Right now we truly are focusing on gas cards. That is not to say that we are opposed to having other audits. In fact, many of us have spoken about that whether it be with regards to credit cards, City Council is given that power. And I will repeat in this post political corruption era if there is any time for us to use it I think it is now. But what we had done a few weeks ago is we had sent a letter to the Controller asking her to prepare that audit for us. She kindly wrote back and said due to a lack of manpower she is unable to do that. So Mr. Bulzoni , our Business Administrator sent out requests for qualifications or proposals . I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 not quite sure what the correct term is. To make a long story short, I believe they are due back on or before November 1st. Here is my concern from a time standpoint . I don't want to us pick someone -- let's say the qualifications are due back November 1st. Maybe a decision is not made either that day or a couple weeks. I would like to propose and then I'll make a motion that we send a letter either to the Controller and/or to the BA's Office, the Business Administrator 's Office, whoever holds these gas bills going back for the last three years that they start putting these together . And that way when our auditor is in place, whether it be the first week in November or thereafter , he or she could start working immediately . I don't want this to be delayed . So, gentlemen , my motion would be that we send a letter to the Controller and the Business Administrator asking them to please put together any and all data including the gas bills and any other information regarding the holders of the gas cards for the bills going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 back three years and to please have that completed by 11/1/19, which is the date when the RFPs are due back. MR. PERRY: Okay. We have a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: And on the question ? Yeah, just on the question just so I'm clear, we're just asking just to have them start to pull the data proactively so when the auditors come in it's a clean, quick process . ATTY. DEMPSEY : That's correct . MR. PERRY: Okay. All right. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : And then one more thing, if I may. And this was brought up by one of our speakers . I as well was taken aback when I read the headline in today's paper about the Scranton Sewer funds. And I was more taken aback when I saw the amount of money that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 at stake. I nor -- I don't want to speak for these Council members . But we sit up here in a fiduciary duty on behalf of the taxpayer s of the City. And it is a potential 11 million dollars that could be split 80 percent to this City and 20 percent to Dunmore . And I have a lot of question s about that. And I know the article specifically uses the term confidential quite a bit. And as a lawyer I do understand that. However , what we want to know and what we're hoping to find out with regard to these liens that are out there and with regard to what is being done to try and rectify this situation how -- what in the past have they done? Has this been going on for three years or have they just started this in the near future? Again, is this deadline coming up in a month or is this deadline coming up in a year? And we want no know what type of due diligence has been done in order to see, again, what type -- the number of easements , number one; and number two, how are they approaching these easements? I'm very concerned about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 that. And I as a taxpayer and as a resident am not willing to sit up here and say that we are willing to lose that 11.5 million or 80 percent of that. So my motion on that would be as follows : That we send a letter to Attorney Jason Shrive the Solicitor for the Scranton Sewer Authority asking him for a meeting as soon as possible and if it deals with confidential matters that this be held in executive session and that he answer any and all question s that Council may have regarding these remaining funds and any and all question s that Council may have regarding these easements . MR. PERRY: There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question I agree with Attorney Dempsey 's motion and her comments . I too have quite a few questions after reading the article in today's paper. My first question would be, you know, why wasn't this disclosed ? This is a public asset. This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 is ratepayer money. Going back a few years to when this whole Sewer Authority thing was going down, people were sold a bill of goods and year after year it's becoming clearer and clearer that it didn't pan out the way I think people were promised . The fact that this amount of ratepayer money, million s and millions of dollars can go back to a private company in Pennsylvania American Water because a deadline isn't met is absolutely positively outrageous . This money is the money of the people of the City and of Dunmore . There should be -- if there is a deadline then that deadline should be met. And why it wasn't disclosed is ridiculous . And we need to know why it wasn't disclosed . And quite frankly -- and maybe I'm missing something here, if there was a deadline , an escrow reversion deadline , shouldn 't it have been in writing someplace ? Was it in the purchase agreement ? And if not, why not? Was this deadline created after the fact, after the purchase agreement , after the sale had closed? These are all questions I think what Attorney 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Dempsey was alluding to as well as there's a lot of questions that need to be answered here. And I think the question of why this wasn't disclosed needs to be answered publically to the people because I don't think we can lose sight of the fact that this is their money. This is millions of dollars over decades that was invested by the people of this City and the people of Dunmore . And again, to have that money revert -- possibly revert back to a private company is outrageous . So I thank Attorney Dempsey for the motion. And I look forward to the answers hopefully . MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . There's just too much money on the table that's in limbo without good enough answers . And I think we all discussed that at our caucus today. And, you know, that money if lost, you know, that's infrastructure improvements. That's City Hall improvement s. You know that's money could be used for stormwater management. There's a lot of things that that money can go towards that's going to be put to well -- and we need to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 sure that we have a handle on this. And I know we did talk about inviting Mr. Shrive to a meeting a Monday before Council . But, you know, I'll be the first one to say if this is something that isn't with his schedule . I'd be willing to meet at any time during the week to make sure that we get this taken care of. We can meet in executive session if necessary at any point during the week when we can all make ourselves available because this is something that just can't go on. All in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : That's all I have. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , motions or comments tonight ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. Last week I mentioned an issue at Hilltop Manor, several residents had reached out about loud 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 noise and parties going on all hours of the night. I did receive a prompt response from the Chief of Police that they are coordinating with the Scranton Housing Authority and that problem is and will be addressed . I believe it was asked a few weeks ago about LERTA applications how many have been taken out. We did get a response from Mr. Oleski from the Licensing and Inspections Department . They currently have five LERTA applications which represent five new homes in the City. There was also one for a commercial space on Main Avenue in West Scranton . So that was the statistics on that. I did ask in the caucus for Mrs. Reed to contact the Controller 's Office for an update on where we stand year-to-date with overtime figures across all departments . Also, I receive d a complaint that we did send to Licensing and Inspections on a City-owned property on empty, overgrown lot at 618 East Elm Street. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. Actually sorry, I forgot. Mrs. Reed, if you could -- and, Mrs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Jefferies , if you want to stay after the meeting and leave your e-mail or your address or you can wait for a copy if we can get her a copy of the contract with the sign management company . Also, one thing I wanted to mention was these -- we have two opening s for the alternate positions on the Zoning Board. So we did discuss in the caucus that we will be putting out an advertisement in the newspaper requesting people to submit letters of interest and resumes if they are interested in being an alternate on the Zoning Board. Mrs. Schumacher I believed asked a question about the Ethics Board and whether we're going to provide funding for that. Yes, we will. And this is just my thought when we were going through this whole process . I know in the Ethics Code it calls for the board to have a secretary . I did talk to Mr. Bulzoni . This would obviously have to be a decision made by the administration . But we do have a Boards and Commission secretary . It would be my recommendation if, you know, they would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 willing to do this that you make that person your secretary . That person is already getting paid to be in charge of the boards and commissions . I don't know how that will work or if they will be agreeable to that. I certainly think that would, you know, save money and I think it makes sense. So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . I want to comment on something that came up last week I wasn't able to speak on. That was the -- Mayor Evans with the raises. I know that was a hot topic and that was spoke on a lot. But just to weigh in on that, you know, that's something I'm in favor of for this short time period with the positions taking on extra workload . Is it something I'm interested in going forward for 2020? While I do see there's a benefit in increasing salaries to get the best people for the job, it is difficult for me to justify raises right now in the City of Scranton when we are still distressed . And I'm well aware of where we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 in terms of salary and other cities in this area whether it be Hazleton or whether it be Wilkes-Barre. There are positions similar that are making more money than we have. But we're not in charge of their cities. We're in charge of our city right now. And while I do believe it's prudent to take care of the people pulling double duty right now, I don't know if going forward implementing a raise that would perpetuate into the future when we are actually not done with getting out of Act 47 is the best thing. So, you know, before the budget comes out I'm sure we'll have discussions on that. We'll go back and forth with the Mayor and Mr. Bulzoni . And we can go further and dig deeper in that. That's just -- I just want to let you guys know where my thinking was right now behind the current raise situation on 2019 and then the upcoming ones in 2020. That's all I have for today. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING PERMIT PARKING ON THE EVEN SIDE OF THE 900 BLOCK OF JEFFERSON AVENUE. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. PERRY: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . ATTY. DEMPSEY : So moved. MR. PERRY: And I need a second. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? Ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH BARRY ISETT & ASSOCIATES , INC. FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON LICENSES AND PERMITS DEPARTMENT SERVICE ASSESSMENT . MR. PERRY: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. GAUGHAN : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . We discussed this in detail in caucus tonight and I just want to bring a few question s that I have. And I think we'll hopefully get our questions answered before final passage . I do think we should move cautiously on this. There were only two bidders that submitted . According to Mr. Bulzoni 's memo that accompanied this legislation , both are somewhat similar . I do think though that we need more explanation on the SAFEBuilt application . One of the things that they're offering that I am really interested in is something called Community Corps. This is a proprietary online community development software tool which manages permitting, plan reviews and approvals and inspection activities . The system integrates with other government software systems and it's designed to streamline and automate building department processes , ensure compliance , manage work flows, generate activity reporting and provide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 transparency to all stakeholders . In the SAFEBuilt proposal they say that this software solution can transform the way the City conducts plan reviews, applicant s can submit plan reviews electronically and track the progress of each step in real time from applicant submittal through certificate of occupancy . This gives the City's clients , people who are coming for permits, clear insight as well as detailed information on the status of each permit. The interesting thing about this software is that SAFEBuilt is offering it at no cost. So I think we do have to weigh that before we move forward with this. I don't know in it of itself how much that will cost the City. But I do think that one of the things that we have discussed over and over and over again is making that office more efficient and using technology to make it more efficient . In other words, if you are a person in the City or a contractor , you should in all rights be able to get a permit online and receive an update about your permit and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 process online through an e-mail, things like that. I think that would make the whole office more user-friendly . One of the other question s that I had in the Barry Isett proposal which is the other one, the one that the administration is choosing , they have two people who are going to be doing the review of the department . That's a project administrator at $95 an hour 12 hours week; and an administration assistant for $62.50 per hour six hours per week. So one of the questions I had was just in in other reviews in other municipalities how long it took them to do that type of review. The SAFEBuilt proposal , they're offering a flat fee for the initial assessment . And after that they have one person a senior level building official at $115 per hour and a building analyst at $90 per hour. And again, I don't think they delineated how long it might take for a more detailed review. Two of the other things that caught my eye from the SAFEBuilt proposal is that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 would be willing to credit the amount spent on this assessment against any future contract s that extends beyond the 36 months. And they would also allocate point four percent of City of Scranton 's annual spend with SAFEBuilt towards local community outreach program s. And then as I mentioned , the cloud-based permitting and inspection software would come at no cost. So I think we should have a deeper conversation with the administration on this to make sure we're moving forward in what's the most advantageous manner for the citizens and for that department . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I also have some concerns . I had a conversation with Councilman Gaughan this afternoon about this. And looking at reviewing this sheet that we got that has both comparisons , the first time I got it was this afternoon when we came in. But just looking at it now it says that Isett and Associates their RFQ timeline extends to July 31st, 2021. Whereas SAFEBuilt 's is only -- the initial assessment is only a four week engagement . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 So I agree that this is -- this is important to do. If we're going to do it, we have to make sure we do it right. And if we can do it right and do it as quickly as possible that would be even better. So I also have more questions that I'll have to get answered before final passage . MR. GAUGHAN : The other thing I want to know too if anyone is looking at the backup, the cost that were received for each proposal were actually omitted from the backup. So Mr. Bulzoni did provide Mrs. Reed with that information . So we do have that if anyone would like to look at it. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Yeah, as Mr. Donahue and Mr. Gaughan said, the two bidders there were very similar . There was pluses and minuses with both bids. And we did just get extra information with costs on it today before the meeting . So there is a lot to go over. And I do like these guys have questions with exactly why we chose this one over the other, what was his line of thinking on it and is this actually the best way to go because they are things that we're not going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 get depending on which company we go. We just want to make sure that we do this right. So we do have questions for Mr. Bulzoni , Mr. Evans -- Mayor Evans and, you know, we hope to get that in the coming weeks and be able to make a better decision on this piece of legislation . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. PERRY: Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.
