MCGOVERN , JR., ESQUIRE , REGARDING PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have one quick one and that is 3-E. I know that we already -- the vote was already taken last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 for the ARPA Director . But I still have concerns as to, you know, the backup and what was presented tonight in 3-E that the director 's going to spend 19 percent of her time distributing or handling 68 million dollars . 19 percent of her -- and getting extra 35,000 a year. So 19 percent of her time is like seven and a half hours a week for an extra $600. I still think there is so much on her plate. This is a nice gig if you could get it, but I still have concerns . That is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any other comments on Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. I might as well start with Item 3-E. Similar to Mr. McAndrew , I express ed last week that I thought this individual was spread too thin. When we look at the three department s that the director is going to oversee, 64 percent is dedicate d to OECD, 19 percent to ARPA Director , and then 17 percent to Code Enforcement . I just feel it's spread too thin. And one thing I will bring to that is when you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 look at the justification for 3-F, it states that this same director as well as the grant writer do need help because there is a large amount of work to be done. So I can't see where we can say we're not spread too thin in one area but then use that same justification for another piece of legislation . Also one thing I did want to bring up, we did receive our legal billing that I've been asking for for about two months now. And in that memorandum that accompanied that, I just wanted to point out a sentence it says, in order to responsibly adhere to the promise of transparency , the Law Department reviewed the invoice s and redacted information . And I don't know if anybody has seen some of these documents . But most of the information has been redacted . So just to point that -- point that out. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any other comment s on any Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So, first of all, I want to wish everybody a happy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Flag Day, just throw it out there to Old Glory. Secondly , I want to provide some kudos to the firefighters yesterday that heroically pulled out a dog and his owner. Great job, Fire Department . And then I don't want to forget Father's Day. I almost forgot Mother's Day. So, of course, I don't want to forget Father's Day. I want to wish every father out there or those that take role of father a very happy enjoyable Father's Day. And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I also want to wish all those that celebrate , a happy Father's Day for those who are fathers or parents . And I also wanted to remind people about the Juneteenth celebration that's also taking place on the same day. So that's on Sunday from 12 to 5. And that will be taking place at 1902 North Main Avenue, which is the old PNC building there. I think it's East Market and Main Avenue. And so that will be a lot of fun 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 activities and people there. I think that's everything I had. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? I have a couple. This coming weekend the Mary Mother of God Parish is holding their annual block party Friday between 6 and 11 and Saturday between 5 and 11 at the Parish Center on West Market Street. All your favorite picnic foods and beverages . On Friday a tribute to veterans will be held at 6 p.m., followed by Picture Perfect at 7 p.m. On Saturday , Jim Cerminaro at 5:30 p.m., followed by the Chatter at 7 p.m. Also, the family and friends of Colleen Calpin Strong are sponsoring a fundraiser to help assist Colleen and her family during their time of need due to an unforeseen medical situation .

There will be a basket raffle fund-raiser held 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 on Sunday, July 10th at the American Legion Post 568 on Birney Avenue in Minooka from noon until six.

They'll also be setting up at the Legion on Saturday , July 9th if you would like to bring a donation the day before the event. That's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm sorry, I have one more thing to add for an announcement . I apologize . I had also wanted to mention the Greek Food Festival that's taking place this week. So that's starting -- I think it started today at 11 a.m. It goes to until 7 p.m., and will go through June 18th, which is Friday. And that's at the Annunciation of Greek Orthodox Church, 505 North Washington Avenue.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 You can go online and have a website where you can order food ahead of time or you can call it in and pick it up that way or you can go in and order it as well. That's all. Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. President , if I can add, I just want to remind everyone about the concert series that's happening up at the Nay Aug Park. I think it's typically Sunday afternoon . They typically have a band at 2:00 and 6:00. It's free. They've done a tremendous job up there preparing the bandstand and the grounds so if anyone gets an opportunity to stop up there. Also, the East Mountain Residents Association is going to be sponsor ing first time ever an outdoor movie at Robinson Park. I believe it's Sunday, June 26th. I'll try to get all the details for next week. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Neil Ackerman . MR. ACKERMAN : I'm here talking about the Nay Aug swim pool, which I call the pool for all ages. Now, we have to be a leader and not be a follower . Mr. Schuster told me -- I was talking with him. He said, all of a sudden everyone is building splash pads, everyone is building splash pads. Just because everyone is building splash pads, we don't have to follow them. The fact that everyone is doing something , that's a good reason not to do it. So because a splash pad is nice for little toddler s and little kids, not for adults. We want a pool for everyone . So we should really, really think clearly about that. A personal note, I came to Scranton in 1985. And my daughter had two children . And we started out before there was -- we went there almost every day. There used to be a children 's pool and waiting pool. And after that, they went to the steps of the children 's pool and they graduate d eventually to the adult pool and then they went on a diving board and now my daughter joins me doing laps all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 time. That's what I've been doing for the last 35 years. And now my daughter spends the summer with us. She lives in another country and comes back with us for two months and she now heard children are starting the same thing, the steps and things unfortunately the COVID virus messed us up. And the pool collapsed and things like that. So it was interrupted . But it's very -- but you know, it's a cycle of life and we would really like to have this continue . Now, I know there's a problem with money with this. But let's not give up because I don't know how much money there is left. But there is COVID relief fund we have. Now, what does the COVID relief fund have to do with a swimming pool? Well, it does because being outside , being healthy , being swimming , vitamin D and things like that. It's helps everyone 's immune system, not only for COVID, for everything else. So it's really a health issue to have a swimming pool that people could really swim and could really get some activity . Also, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 if you need money, there's corporate sponsors . Let's not give up on PNC Bank, Delta Medix or Geisinger . They're things -- they want to have a PNC pool, something like that. Good. If they give us a million dollars , why not? (Inaudible ). Then there's also federal and state grants. Let's look into that. And then also, we're in a tremendous situation . The mayor has a good relationship with President Biden. He came here and she went there. You have Bob Casey who lives a few blocks away from the pool, a senator who's been there for quite a while now. We have Matt Cartwright who's on the Finance Committee . He's the chairman of the committee of something like that. Come on, to get money we have the advantage right now. It's working for us. Let's -- and we have President Biden I'm sure who used to swim in the Lincoln pool before. You know, so we had people that know the pool and know Scranton . And certainly the government talks about trillions and billions . A few million I think for a worthy cause should be able to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 raised. Now, the project do it right. The project is a once in a one lifetime endeavor . A lifetime , we're talking about 60, 70, 80 hopefully people live longer than that. It has to be done right and not in just in a convenient way. Yes, the cost of this is not cheap but (inaudible ) Scranton . So I look at things like mathematics . So if you take the cost whatever it is, 3 million , 2 million , 4 million whatever it is, divide by six years and then divide it by 10 weeks, which we use it every summer, divide it by seven days, divide it by 100 person that people that use every day let's say which is a modest amount. And then all of a sudden the cost for each day that is reasonable . (Inaudible ) So it really isn't too bad. And like I said, I look around at everyone here. I'm the oldest one here. When you're my age you look at things differently . When you're young you look at just right in front of you. But when you see the picture of 70, 80 years, you know, like that, you see it's well worthwhile . So we should look to provide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 a pool for all ages. Do it the -- don't do it the easy way. Do it the right way. And I hope everyone -- the Mayor will be able to take that into consideration and everyone will because it's a, you know, it's a once in a lifetime . You're not going to have it another 60, 70 years that people will be able to do what you can do right now. So I hope everyone , please convey this to the Mayor. And I think it's very serious . And it's a great opportunity for everyone . So please don't mess it up. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ackerman . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Today is June 14th. It's Flag Day. And it's the 247 birthday of the United States Army. And it's the 165th day of the year, 45 percent of the year is gone. So what is the status of negotiations on our three labor contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : Negotiations are still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : Is there any light at the end of the tunnel? MR. DONAHUE : All I know is negotiations are still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I took a look at 3-B, which was all the invoices , all 116 pages of them. There's not much content. As you know, everything was blacked out. But I said, gee, I wonder what the financial total of these 48 invoices are from November 30th last year through March 31st of this year -- these invoices . The total is $171,601.07. This doesn't include April, May, or June. And God knows how long this process is going to be stretched out. I, personally think that the unions are not going to be happy with a 2 percent pay raise when we're looking at a potential COLA raise for next year of 8 percent . So can you say arbitration ? So when we get the total for these contracts , you're going have these legal fees. And any salaries and wages which go beyond what we put in the 2022 operating budget and it could be a handful of change and I'll be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 watching . Now, that's the bad news. The good news, today IT finally posted on the City's website the current Clerical Union Contract which was signed on March 31st, 2021. That contract expires at the end of next year. I hope someone in the administration is setting up a suspense file so that before it expires , we have done the negotiations , hired special labor counsel and there's a seamless transition from one labor contract to the next. And if the administration doesn't do that, shame on them because that doesn't take a PhD in rocket science . Let's see, just so you know, I'm counting . The 2021 audit is now 14 days late. And Item 3-G, the correspondence from Mr. Lazor and Mr. McGovern on the Payroll Preparation Tax. I wasn't able to come last week because I had an adverse reaction to my second booster . But don't worry, I've got my barf bag at the ready. But I wanted to ask questions about the taxing the self-employed and landlords . And I would like to know hopefully you could answer this is, are we going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 relook at this Payroll Preparation Tax or are we just going full steam ahead? What are you going to do? Are you going to make some kid that sells lemonade in the summer pay it or some kid that shovels snow in the winter? I mean, they're self-employed . Is there an age limit? They raised some very good questions . And I think I and other people would like to know the answers before that legislation is passed. And let's see what else. 3-E, the Mayor's answers on the ARPA Director . It was interesting but I still want to know the number of hours Miss Cipriani is working . I don't care about the percentage s because they mean nothing if you don't know the number of hours. And that needs to be redone. And finally this 3-F, the open government quarterly report with all the neighbors . Why didn't they address downtown Scranton ? You have blighted properties . You have people living downtown . You have all kinds of issues -- quality of life issues. Why is downtown Scranton just left off the map? I would like to know that so that the next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 quarterly report talks about downtown Scranton . You got places like My Mother's Table on Penn Avenue which is starting to crumble again. And you've that building boarded up next to Buona Pizza. A lot of places need to be addressed . And you've got people living in apartments throughout downtown . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening, Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . First off, I didn't attend the meeting last week but I watched it. Kudos to you, Councilman Schuster , for looking out for the tax payers and finding all those discrepancies with the pool. And a couple things, well, I brought up the week before about the turf. And I heard you say last week that real grass would be a lot less expensive . I was shocked at how much less expensive it would be. MS. SCHUSTER : It was like $200,000 less. MR. SPINDLER : That's unbelievable . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 And next thing, I don't remember everything you talked about. The bathhouse, that's -- from what I'm hearing that's only like 18 years old. It was built in the Doherty administration . Why tear it down and build a new one? If they want it bigger, blowout a wall and just add on. You got to try to save money. So, President Donahue , you plan on getting the Mayor and OECD back in here to discuss this? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, they're coming in with an update based off the discussion we had a couple weeks ago. MR. SPINDLER : (Inaudible ). MR. DONAHUE : We were thinking maybe next week. But that might be a little too soon. So right now we're aiming for July 5th. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Great. Next thing, I'm sure a lot of people know, some might not. Friday, there's a new business opening up, an ice cream place on Adams Avenue. Boozy B's. And according to them, there is alcohol in the ice cream. One problem I have with this is, is it a City ordinance with the open container 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 law? Is that a City law, a state law? Does anybody know? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. MR. SPINDLER : Anyway, you're not allowed to take the ice cream out of the place because of open container law. That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of. You're not walking out with a can of beer or a bottle of Jack Daniels. It's ice cream with a little alcohol . I mean, here's a business that moved here and they want to do well. And we're going to hurt them because people might not want to go there. They might not want to eat there. They might want to just take it out. To not let them take it out is totally ridiculous . I bet the amount of alcohol in that wouldn't even register on the breathalyzer test. So I think there should be an exception made to that. Here's a business that moves here and we got to try to help them out. I think that's terrible if that law is enforced . Next thing, I spoke about this last time I was here. It's really not City business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 but it could be. The gun laws, I'm glad to see the Republicans and Democrats got together and came upon an agreement , I guess. Those things they agreed upon aren't going to solve the problem . You've got to get rid of these automatic weapons . That's the problem. I don't care for these red flag laws or background checks. As long as these guns are available to me and you which shouldn 't be, you're still going to have these mass killing s. And like I said, I saw it on the news last week. There's a graph. We are so far ahead of every other country in the world as far as mass shooting s it's outrageous . It's despicable . So I think we got to -- I don't care how many laws they make, the only thing -- the President said this and I agree with him. You got to get these guns off. They shouldn 't be sold. People like the -- they shouldn 't be sold in gun stores or gun shows or whatever . The gun rights activists saying, oh, you're violating our second amendment . Well, give them a gun that they had back when the second amendment was written . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 It was a one shot musket that took a couple minutes to load. You didn't have weapons that you have today. I always thought for years the second amendment should be rewritten because they didn't have the guns back then you have now. Lastly, hope somebody from Lackawanna Commissioner 's Office is listening. My wife and I attempted to go to that fair -- that Saturday of the fair and we never made it there. We sat on Montage Mountain Road for probably about 45 minutes. The line was all the way down to the beginning of Montage Road. And we got to where the traffic light is from Glenmaura. Moosic Police stopped everybody . It sold out. The parking lot was filled. Now, what rocket scientist planned this? It was terrible planning . First of all, they shouldn 't have had it the same weekend the Railriders were home. They could have parked everybody or a lot of people at the stadium and shuttled them up to Montage . They've done that in the past. So I hope they are listening . They better get their act together . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Next on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And now you grow up and you want to always thank those people because we're always as human beings, we're quick to find fault. But I want to thank the IT Department that they worked to get our information up online. I want to thank Councilman Schuster for working with me and with them. And it's up online. I guess I might have been a little bit too pushy about it. But the reason I wanted it up is that, you know, when you go to the website and there's the tab that says events and so if someone is visiting and they say what's to do in Scranton and they go on the website and hit events, you know, it's great to see the information that's there. We're working very hard to make this first inaugural Electric City Flower Show a success . It's going to be on August 6th. And over the weeks, I will continue to give information about that. So kudos to the IT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Department and whoever got that information up for us. I do appreciate it. The second thing I wanted to talk about, nobody from Council mentioned it so I thought maybe I'll just scratch it from my list if you mentioned it but you didn't about the Juneteenth celebration on Sunday. And, you know, growing up here -- I grew up here in Scranton . And there was no mention of Juneteenth. I only learned about it, maybe about 10 years ago. And so it's something that we need to take the opportunity to learn more about it. You know, it can just be another holiday . But it's more than that. It's more about our culture . And even though it's about the slavery , our whole country was built on slavery . So we all should learn more and more and more about what happened because the kids are not getting it in school as far as I know. I don't have any kids in school. But as far as I know, I know I didn't get it at school. So it's going to be on Sunday. And it's going to be on Main Avenue at Market 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Street and Main Avenue. There will be vendors there. And there will also be a table if anyone is interested in a NAACP membership , there will be a table and there's other tables that will be there. So I had to mention it being that you guys did not. The next thing I wanted to talk about was comments that were made last week. And, you know, as you're sitting there and I go home and I listened to the tape again because I wasn't sure about what I heard. But I wanted to make sure and make everyone aware of these comment s that were made. One of the speakers mentioned -- he started off about gun violence . And we're all concerned about gun violence and because it could be any of us. We could be at the Wal-Mart. We could be in our cars just parked at a red light. And we could be involved in gun violence . So he went on and he had some very good statement s to say. And then I was listening and then came a comment that it was a joke -- that it was a joke that growing up that black kids did not know who their fathers were. I take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 offense to that. I take offense to that. I grew up here in Scranton at Kressler Court. There was nine of us, five girls and four boys. There was -- the girls were in one bedroom , five girls in one bedroom . There was four boys in the other bedroom and my mom and dad were in the other bedroom . I grew up with my mom and dad. My dad was there for us. I was in Kressler Court and there were a lot of dads that were there. So I don't know where the speaker got that stereotypical phrase from. I get emotional now thinking about that he is a grown man. And all of these years that is still in his mind about things that were a joke. That's no joke. If anybody is in a fatherless home, it's nothing to joke about. I did not grow up in a fatherless home. None of my friends that I knew grew up in a fatherless home. And I think I'm around the same age as that gentleman that spoke last week. So I took offense to it. And I just hope that he thinks -- when we stand here at this microphone, we have a responsibility of what we say, what comes out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 of our mouth because out there is the public listening to us. And we could just turn and put a bad sour taste in anyone's mouth. So I just had to say that tonight and to say that I was terribly offended . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . You can't wait to start that, can you? MR. DONAHUE : We have no control over the clock. MR. ELLMAN: Yeah, I understand . Last week at the Taurus Club Miss Rosie told me to shut up and sit down and pretend I'm at Council . And when I did, I had a couple of armchair generals , I guess you could call them, explain to me why -- I'm just thankless for what's going on in my life that all this gas and reassessment and everything is being done for me. I'm not thinking of 40-some years down the road like Jerry is and Debbie are. And here, Jerry leaves his business just so he could make sure that this reassessment goes through with no problem . And poor Debbie, she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 must have anguish over the -- from what she says the big crocodile tears for the homeless and the -- not the homeless -- but for the seniors and the people that will lose their homes she says she doesn't know what to do about it. Poor thing. It must break her heart. Well, you know, I know what a sorry SOB I am. But too many people out there you don't -- you just don't know who your friends are. This newspaper almost every day is some letters of adversity to keep us apart at each other's throat instead of making peace among the political party. I noticed today when I was walking Chumley at Weston Park they're emptying the pool again. Did they find lifeguards? Last year the pool was perfect and no lifeguards. You know, I don't know about women and cars and stocks and bonds. But I know about swimming pools. A small investment of time and chemicals all winter, you wouldn't have to drain the pool and clean it like they do every year. I took care of Anthony Quinn's pool and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Elvis's and the pool at Universal . So I know what I'm talking about. This is a complete waste of time and money for the City. And one other thing, I had in my garage the very first gas pump. There is no doubt about it. I mean, it's got fancy paintings and a phone number on it. It was at the corner of Mulberry and Wyoming before 1900. It's actually what they call an alcohol pump because they didn't have gasoline yet. Gulf oil claims to have the first gas station in 1913 in Pittsburgh . I think the City would very easily use that as the first gas station . And it's in the phone book even, those old phone books that they used to have at the -- I think it ought to be elaborated on. Anyway, I'm not going to give it away because I've been offered some money for it. I don't want to sell it. Maybe I'll loan it to the City or something . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign -- MR. ELLMAN: I think I got hay fever or something . This weather is killing me. MR. DONAHUE : I hear ya.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. ELLMAN: My dog's got a runny nose. And my cats are sick. I guess there's something in the air. I don't know. MR. DONAHUE : That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, when the Mayor comes in next time, I've already mentioned it to Mr. Voldenberg , it would be nice rather than just a PowerPoint projected on the wall that the public who wishes to view this be able to go to the City Council 's website and download the document 24 hours before the presentation so we have an opportunity just as Council should before the meeting happens to review, absorb, and understand what is involved in the documents . I see that the IT Department was successful from my last comment of putting up photos for every member of City Council . Unfortunately , out of the five that are now up there, one of them is center justified and the four other are left justified , incredibly sloppy for just throwing a picture on a website 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 not to actually make the four other pictures centered . It's -- it just looks poor. It's an HGML coded and three seconds to copy it. I had mentioned after the meeting the overgrowth on I think it's 2601 Cedar Avenue. It's the property that the police had seized with the 1.4 million dollars of marijuana . Well, from the time that the City has put up it's condemn ed notice and cannot enter, that property has been steadily growing grass across the whole front of it because it was owned by a New York group. It's condemned and someone needs to remedy or take a look at it and deal with the overgrowth . At this point it is getting up to knee high on that corner. It's a very wide and nice corner in that neighborhood , which now has a field -- an impromptu house field growing next to it. As for 3-B, the financial notes from the City's Law Department , it surprises me looking at them, not only that 80 percent are redacted, but I would figure just like any other type of business that any other type of request , an executive session could have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 held to give City Council an unredacted view of these documents . It's different publishing them. It's different on whether or not it's released . But City Council should have a complete overview of the unredacted documents . MR. DONAHUE : We had the opportunity to review them unredacted . MR. COYNE: You did? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. COYNE: Okay. They cited attorney /client privilege , which is all well and good except when you look at the documentation from the solicitor , it says from a Supreme Court cite. I think it is unprofessional to not actually cite the case that they are referenc ing to, to make it easier for one solicit or in City Hall to give the information to another solicitor in City Hall. Your solicitor should not have to look up -- figure out and look up case law related to that because it wasn't in a document . It should be clear that it was 67102 and it was out of Levi versus the Senate of Pennsylvania that that was the ruling. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Why is there no communication that means that not only does that body have to look up the law, but when it comes across this body without the detail of where they're pulling those legal reference s from, this body again has to look up the law and reference it. It should be clear just like in a courtroom , just in a pleading that if they state a case that they're holding up against they should provide the case law references to this body just to ease not having to do extra expenses . And as far as blacking it out, it should be this body because the Mayor did not authorize this. These bills are paid by the City of Scranton . And this body is as much the City of Scranton as the Law Department is, as the Mayor is, as anyone else. The City is not the Mayor. The City is the Mayor and the City Council . Both have equal rights under the law and you should not be blocked because you are the ones paying the bills just as much. She is not personally paying them out of her own pocket to rule confidentiality . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , citizen of Scranton . I would like to start tonight -- I just have to pinch myself to say how in the world could the City find a way to put down the calendar -- the addressing of the stormwater in the City. I don't know how many of you read the legal notices . But I was shocked to find a study -- RFP for a study. The bids will be opened on the first of July for the East Mountain stormwater and drainage study. Now, how many times have we done a study of the entire City? I mean, the places that are Froude Avenue, East Mountain Road on the one side where the stream goes behind and goes into people's cellars . I mean, I just don't understand why I don't know how long this is going to go on. But when are we going to start doing something -- actually doing something about stormwater ? MR. DONAHUE : So this -- I'll address that in Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : To me it's just a kick the can down the road again. Has anybody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 ever -- different subject -- because , you know, Joan's been talking and asked about the audit between now and God knows when. MR. DONAHUE : I have an update there as well. MS. SCHUMACHER : Do you have -- MR. DONAHUE : I have an update that I'll share in Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. 5-F, that is the one where the City wants to hire for the City to execute and enter into an agreement with Nossaman LLP to provide Federal Government Affairs Services . I do not think we need a lobbyist . We don't need to spend that kind of money. And I look at it as a lack of transparency too. If there is something that they need, that the City needs from the federal government, why don't they come to the citizens and say write to your Congress man, write to your Senator . You could even -- well, no, don't bother with him. But why do we need a lobbyist ? It's just taking one more instance -- somebody is going to tell this person what they want down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 there. I don't think we need one. And I hope none of you will vote in favor of this. Oh, we talked about the legal department . I assume you all read the Times-Tribune . It was just a few sort weeks ago that there was an article in the paper about the Mayor hiring a woman from Luzerne County as one of her many or one of our many assistant solicitors , $45,000 part time. Now, does she live in the City of Scranton ? That is a requirement . Did anybody ask? Did anybody read the article and you didn't ask? MR. MCANDREW : I did ask. I was told that she's moving. MS. SCHUMACHER : She's what, moving? MR. MCANDREW : Moving to the City. DR. ROTHCHILD : She was here tonight and I spoke with her. And she does have plans to move into the City. MS. SCHUMACHER : When? MR. DONAHUE : She has six months. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, she has six months. Everyone does. MR. MCANDREW : So labor didn't come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 to us to allow her not to. So that means she has six months to move in. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, keep on it. Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening, Dave Dobrzyn , resident . Okay, we're talking about the pool tonight . And I thought it was also my idea last week to expand that old bathhouse that wasn't really a bathhouse. It was just an entryway . But it has modern electric al and modern plumbing in it. So it's a good way to save money and keep it in consideration . I would also like to mention that over the years we've had problems with life savers. We need maybe a deal where they to go down Weston Field, like high school swimmers or whatever and get a summer job for themselves because apparently Lackawanna State Park pool closed due to a lack of lifeguards. I have some articles here. I'm going to run them over quick about Doug Mastriano . And it's several articles on how he plans to make everybody reregister and contrary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 to federal law and voting and on and on and on and on. And he's also being subpoenaed by the current committee in Washington Congress to answer some questions about his doings on January 6th. From what I could see -- oh, he also has selected Jenna Ellis one of the Giuliani bunch, Lieutenant Governor . I mean, really? She may have a law license someday. Who knows. And on the hospital , they mention ed years ago I talked to some engineers -- operating engineers . And they said a building really can't go in Scranton much above eight stories , maybe 10 because it -- of our mine -- the whole City is mined out under us here. So at any rate -- but the idea is if we limit them to 40 feet which it would impose on people's homes possibly . But then -- will they need all the more land all the more blocks, two or three more blocks up in the Hill Section and that's getting massive . And there aren't good roads into that in the first place. It was a small community hospital . And once again, get your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 vaccination even if you do have a problem , get to the doctors . If you do -- I have to wear this mask so my wife will beat me if she sees me on television without my mask. I'll have to call the police on her, you know, I said no more black eyes, lady. Just kidding . And there was several -- different point of interest , presidential Teddy Roosevelt , that's over with. And last weekend John Dean from Watergate fame was on CNN. Teddy Roosevelt was on 31, the History Channel , Comcast . It was very interesting . And it would pay to announce it and hopefully it will come around again. Anyway -- and we really don't need somebody like that in the Governor 's office. There is just quickly a man from Florida he's a senator . He wants to relegislate Social Security , Medical Care, Medicaid . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Thank you. That's a little much. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 to address Council ? MR. SHAW: Good evening , Council , Darwin Shaw, Scranton resident . I'm sorry. I got thrown for a loop on the situation that happened. But I'm staying focused . Mr. King, if you don't mind, I love you, man. But I don't mean no offense . But I have to ask you. Do you know how many garbage trucks DPW has available to utilize to picking up the trash in the City because our garbage right now is behind schedule . And I'm only assuming that is either because of manpower or equipment , honestly . Number two, would be flood mitigation . I lost my car due to the storm we had on Friday. And certain areas that I didn't know, it seems like the man covers are on a mechanism that relieves pressure . So instead of all that water flowing through the pipe, the covers lift up and it lets all the water come out. The area by DPW, North Main Avenue, the plot in Green Ridge, it got flooded for a little bit until the water subside d and was able to run through the pipes that it needed to.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And I'm honestly going to assume that is because of clogging in the draining due to the street sweepers. And it's not being timed properly matching when the citizens are going to go to work and when the street sweeper s are going to come to clean the streets, pushing the trash and debris in the gutters was going to cause a bigger problem . More pipes are going to explode . Number three, about the pool, if we can due to the ARP funding or American Rescue Plan funding say throw at least 24 million dollars into the pool at Nay Aug and extend a botanical garden and also extend access to people who like art and culture and even music to not only develop our city, form a state park but for a natural revenue . That can take about two years you would say if we had -- had this Payroll Preparation Tax properly because as it is right now, it looks like we all dropped the ball, including me because I could have debated better on the Payroll Preparation Tax instead of the Business Mercantile Tax. Right now if things don't get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 situated , it looks like the City is going to have to go into receiver ship on top of the contract s that are going and being negotiated and then going to arbitration . The reason we're going to receivership because like you gentlemen know and ladies, you can't claim bankruptcy . So you have to raise property tax on every area. That is going to be a big, big issue if the Mayor alone does not have the proper individuals she needs to help her and delegate her to get though these problems . To the new City Solicitor , I like the way you (inaudible ) to address people when they ask you questions , honestly and a truthful matter. There is open law containers . Local law doesn't supercede federal law. So there is nothing anybody can do about having alcohol inside of ice cream. It shouldn 't leave the building honestly . Number four, thank you so much for taking consideration Juneteenth . As an African American and us understanding each other's culture , I'm very happy about that. And also I would like to see if not only African American s can get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 acknowledge d, everybody because it's more than African American s in Scranton , Pennsylvania . We have Irish. We have Indians . We have everybody -- Italians . I would like to see if everybody can get recognize d because we all do go through trials and tribulations . And we all have been through slavery , every last one of us. And then I would like to say great job, way to keep your guys' heads up during this horrible time. This is bad. And also the flood mitigation system when American Water you will say upgrade s their water system and goes green, what are we planning on doing when we have to buy back the Sewer Authority system, like the pipes and everything ? Are we stable enough to not only sustain those materialistic things or can we even replace them honestly because if we cannot take on that burden and they're going to sell it back to us. They have to because they shouldn 't have had it in the first place. Are we able to maintain that because if we can't maintain that and the Business Mercantile Tax falls away and then we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 overtaxing citizens and they leave Scranton , Pennsylvania , the City will implode on itself. And all this hard work will be for no reason, honestly . And then happy Flag Day, everyone . Dr. Rothchild for addressing the Juneteenth situation , honestly , thank you. Thank you, Mr. McAndrew for standing up. Thank you, Mr. Donahue -- especially you, Mr. Schuster , for catching the documentations when it came to our finance s. And thank you, Mr. Voldenberg , honestly for the lack of manpower and the lack of equipment including the funding and cooperation for you standing up and helping our public workers , not only for me but for a lot of my friends because they do work for the City. Keep up the good work. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Shaw. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. KING: Yes. I recall meeting a while back with Mr. Preambo . He gave me a number of Pak Masters. And I can't off the top of my head remember the exact number. But I will get that number for you. Also, under 3-G under Third Order, the Payroll Preparation Tax, can we ask, Mr. Voldenberg , the administration if they can meet with Mr. Lazor and Attorney McGovern to really talk about the concerns ? I would rather see if we can -- if there are issues with this Payroll Preparation Tax, I would rather see them worked out now and catch something before we end up in litigation . So if the Mayor and the administration can meet with Mr. Lazor and Attorney McGovern , that would be greatly appreciated . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out in the morning , sir. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have a few. So first, I had a question -- I'm not sure if it was last week or the week prior, but back in March I sent some inquiries about exempt and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 nonexempt employees . I did get somewhat of a response from the HR Director . So it was stated that there was a supervisor that just switched from exempt to nonexempt. And she stated that the supervisor position was made nonexempt because other supervisors which would be considered equal were also nonexempt. But she does not expect to see overtime to be an issue. It's a very rare situation that it would be required . I do say this because last year I spoke about it quite a bit with DPW administrations . We exceeded that line item by over 700 percent . And at this point in time this year we're at about 73 percent utilize d in highway s and 40 percent used in the garage section there. To address Joan and also Marie's question , a few weeks back I did inquire to BA West about the audit. Mr. Donahue says he has an update tonight . But I did not hear back from him for over a couple weeks. In the IT Department , Jack Reiger from the IT Department was able to get that up on the site. And he made some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 other updates . So I would like to thank him for his help there. Frank, I have an address . So 137 and 139 South Fillmore Street, this is a home. If we can have the inspectors go out to that address to see where we stand. There was a home that was on fire at one point in time but now it's just -- it's standing with nothing being done at this point. Also, can we send correspondence over to BA West to see if we can get an update on where we are with HGC with the regional stormwater and where we are with our MS4 compliance if there is any updates on that? And that's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few tonight , a couple in response to what some people said during citizen participation . The first one I want to address was about Boozy B's. I know our solicitor had mentioned that it was state law and not local law. But also, this is their second location so they are currently open in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Pittston . So they have to be doing well to want to open a second location . I'm really proud that they want to come here to the City. I think it will be a great business to add to the downtown section and to Penn Avenue along there. So I'm looking forward to that. I don't believe that that law has hindered their business that they already have in Pittston . And then the second thing was in reference to Juneteenth , I did mention the celebration last week and this week during my comments . It's an event that I've attended previously and very much in support of the Black Scranton Project and the Juneteenth celebration . And I expect to be there this weekend as well. And then the next thing I wanted to bring up, over the weekend there was the March For Our Lives that was held downtown which I attended . And that had started four years ago and I also attended back then that was started with the Parkland shooting initially and is something that felt the need to hold again because we continue to be in a state in our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 country where mass shooting s are happening so often and gun violence is a major issue. And I'm very interested in doing whatever I can in my position with the City to help prevent gun violence in our city and to address it. And I know we're limited in what ability we have here on Councilman and because of preemption with state law. But I feel there is still other things that we could be working to do. One of the things I met with the Chief of Police about a number of things, one of them being what we're doing as a city to address gun violence and ways that we can prevent it. And I went on a ride along over the weekend with several police officers , which was very insightful and helpful to see them in action. And that is something I plan on doing again with them too. And it's something else that I was considering was holding a community active shooter training with the police department that anyone would be welcome to attend, anyone who wants to learn how to deal with an active shooter situation . That's helpful training that I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 like to have. And, I mean, I'm honestly afraid for my daughter for when she is school age and she has to go to school. I don't know how I'll deal with that. It makes me emotional just thinking about it. Like I said, I'm very passionate about doing what I can to help our City. And I also was very offended by the speaker last week who brought up fatherless household s and how that might have an impact on people who grew up to become killers or to commit gun violence for offense s is because somehow related to growing up in a fatherless household , which is just total BS. I don't see the relevance and I also find it highly offensive . So please when you come here, be careful of your words because they could be very hurtful and harmful to others. And we all want to be respectful here. So I think that's everything that I had to say on that topic. And then the one last thing I just wanted to address a property that's on Prescott Avenue. And I'm not sure if I brought it up here before. It's something that I've been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 working on with the administration with various department s for a few weeks. It's on the 400 block near Turkey Hill. It had a fire that took place in March. And so the property was condemned . And then there was trash that was left out in the front of the property ever since then. And the trash has actually been building up. And there's been a number of issues and complaint s with that property . But we have been communicating with the homeowner and the property manager and that's something that's being taken care of slowly but surely. So if anyone was wondering about that, I know I've received complaint s about it. There was a dumpster now in the front of the building and they are actively doing some work on it. During the storm I believe last week there was a hole that opened up in the sidewalk , a sizeable hole. And so that will be -- I believe the property owner's responsibility , something else that they will need to take care of to make sure that it's safe and that the sidewalk is useable for anyone who is travelling on that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 street. That's everything that I have. Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do, a couple. So to answer the question about how many garbage and recycle trucks we have in the City, there's 11. MR. DONAHUE : There's 11 garbage . MR. MCANDREW : There's 11 garbage , I'm sorry. There's 11 garbage and they are only running 10. All right. So that leads me to an issue that I'm going to bring forward is, so they are only running 10 trucks instead of 11. So what happens when you do that? You get behind on garbage . I received multiple complaint s this week about Ryerson Court. All right. Garbage has not been picked up since -- the last call was made on last Wednesday . So I don't know if their pickup is Tuesday . But the calls started on Wednesday ; Thursday , Friday to pick up this garbage . And my understand ing is and, of course, this is no fault of the drivers and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 workers. This is the fault of administration saying they are following and using the systems . Them systems that they refer to is that Rubicon program that I voted against last year because I thought at some point it would become punitive . So guess what, who's suffering right now with garbage sitting in front of their property for a week? So it is punitive . It's the residents who pay their garbage fees. All right. So with that said, Mr. Voldenberg , please call over there and make sure, you know, this garbage gets picked up. This is beyond ridiculous . And secondly , I want Rubicon who was suppose d to save us over -- a million dollars a year, all right, we're going to spend 100 and some grand for this tracking system that I was against because I believe it would be -- end up being punitive and guess who's suffering ? But -- so if it's suppose d to save us a million dollars , right now it's implement ed at least half a year. So I want them to come in. And I don't need -- I know that we have -- I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 know what the excuse is being that DPW Director is out on leave, we don't need him to come in. We need Rubicon to come in. And I want an update from them, all right, because obviously there is problem s happening using this system supposedly . All right. Since I'm talking about this, I was going to wait for the vote on -- the Juneteenth resolution . This has nothing to do with the resolution . But I'm getting concerns and question s about who's off and who's on, who's celebrating the holiday within the City employees , right? I get that, you know, the public safety unions who protect and serve 24 hours a day probably have to work with an MOU with their contract they have another day off versus that day. That makes sense. That's in my world too where I work. But everybody else is scheduled off, okay? So with everybody else being schedule d off, I look at my garbage pickup calendar on my refrigerator and it's scheduled -- DPW is scheduled for the day off. It's in purple. Monday is -- they're off. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 So there's some back and forth e-mails today from the HR Director where, oh, yeah, they are off. And then an updated e-mail, no, well, we're still -- we're still talking about it and see if they're off. So then I heard from some workers that, no, they are not off but they have to report. They're not going to pick up garbage , which doesn't make any sense. And guess what, so Juneteenth we're observing it Monday as a holiday . And what do most people do with holiday s? You make plans and surround yourself with friends and family and plans on holidays . So right now they don't know if they're off. They don't know if they're being called in and not being put on trucks. So and them e-mails we got, you know, one said yes, one said no. Can you please inquire to clarify this for these workers so they know the status of Monday because it's, you know, tomorrow is Wednesday . You know how quick the week goes. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. What else do I have? So last year we did a traffic study on St. Ann's Street. It was angled parking on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 St. Ann's Street for -- I'm going to be 60, longer than that. All of a sudden it went away, right, so we were told because there was no ordinance for it. That's fine. So I asked for a traffic study to be conducted because it's the widest street around, okay. And a traffic study was supposedly done by the previous engineer . Did I receive the study on behalf of the resident s of St. Ann's? No, I receive d an e-mail that, no, you can't do it because it wasn't an ordinance . All right. So I waited -- so then my neighbors , of course, are still complaining that they, you know, because that study was done supposedly . I never saw the study, just an e-mail that it was done at 90 degrees which is unrealistic . Who's going to park a car at 90 degrees no matter how wide it is. So I waited for the new engineer s to get in, get settled in. I receive d a letter from concerned resident s in that area, not just St. Ann's Street that they want another study done. So we sent it over. We didn't hear anything yet, right? So can you please send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 that letter over again and request that we want a study at a 30-degree angle which pretty much lines out with the statute from the state. So I'd like a response from them. They're settled in now, this new engineering firm so I really didn't get a response . All they said they were going to honor the last study. But the last study was 90 degrees . So please reiterate that we want it at 30 degrees, all right? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then Miss Hodowanitz made a great point. So we get this quarterly Code Enforcement report. All right, it's every section of the City but you live -- all right, so, I mean, everybody loves their part of the city. I'm no different . So can you please send correspondence over to OECD and make sure that their next quarterly report includes Central City and their residents and their concerns ? DR. ROTHCHILD : If I may just respond , downtown is included currently under the Hill Section . So it's not that they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 being excluded from the report. But it's just not separated . So Miss Cipriani will see if there's a way to separate that out. MR. MCANDREW : Well, you're going to feel you're not include d when it's not explained to you even in the report. I'm just saying that's -- that would be my take on it. And what else do I have here? So I agree with Councilman King. And we talked about it caucus. We received that letter from Attorney McGovern and Mr. Lazor, all right? We've been trying to get this payroll prep tax straight for years. We extended Act 47 eighteen months to get it right. And I really don't believe we got it right with this new letter. So I agree. Let's set up something , send correspondence down so our legal department takes a deeper dive and takes a better look at it before we end up with a problem that, you know, we can correct right now. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just a couple things, in terms of the audit we did get an update last week from the auditors . And they laid out a schedule of exactly what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 they'll need and a due date for when they need it in hand for it to be completed by September 30th. So there's a bunch of lists under the June 20th as one of the dates and the second date is August 1st. So we will follow up next week to make sure that the auditor s were given everything that they put out on their June 20th date and then also August 1st for everything else they need by those dates in order to complete the audit in full by September 30th. In terms of East Mountain stormwater , so if you remember about a year ago there was a study put out regarding Keyser Valley stormwater . Those engineering studies need to be on the shelf in order to apply for grants. So in order to expediate the application of these grants, Keyser Valley was put out first. East Mountain was put out next. And it's more so the above ground drainage and basins. So that's why that's being done so that we could then start applying for grants to then, you know, try to get two dollars out of one in terms of money that's set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 aside from ARPA to use it as a match instead of paying for a project in full there. A couple other things I have, Mr. Voldenberg , can you reach out to DPW? I got a couple complaints and request s for some patching on the -- on Murphy Court from 2600 block to the 2800 block of Murphy Court. And as we move into the summer it's getting into fireworks and ATV season again where those complaint s start coming in. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we check with Chief Carroll ? I know he was working on a strategy in term of ATVs but also on fireworks as well. In terms of fireworks , you know, our hands are sort of tied with some preemption laws on a statewide level. But some good news on that front, the State House of Representa tives passed legislation last week. It's House Bill 2157 that gives more -- local governments more tools to fight the use of illegal fireworks . One of the things that it does is, it gives local police departments the ability to seize fireworks as evidence that are set off illegal ly because they can't seize those now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Another -- a couple other things it does if enacted into law, penalties imposed under the bill would be violating the use of consume r fireworks fine would increase from 100 to $500. Violating a sale of consumer fireworks fine would be not less than $10,000. The current fine is 5,000. Violating the sale or use of display fireworks would not be less than 10,000, same for federally illegal explosives . And then also higher grades if a subsequent offense for the same violation results in a conviction within three years of the first conviction . So that is some promising news there. It is going to the State Senate for consideration on that front. And that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. MCANDREW : Can I just add one more thing? I forgot. I apologize . This also has to do with DPW. It's been brought to my attention that the inspection license at the DPW is still under the name of the previous BA and the previous DPW Director . That probably can present an issue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you contact administration and ask if this is the truth and if so, when are they going to change it and put the proper names on it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So I'm also going to jump in there as well, Mr. Voldenberg . On the Rubicon request , Mr. McAndrew requested to see if we can get a presentation given to us on Rubicon . To add to that, could we ask the question is this system being utilized daily and then how much have we saved to date with the implementation of this system? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And then also one more. This is just a comment . On the report we got from OECD that we discussed downtown and the Hill Section , the pie graph if we can just make a suggestion that the color codes in that pie graph just be changed to be more contrasting . There were various shades of teal. I really couldn't tell which entities were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 putting in the complaints . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. 5-B.

VOLDENBERG : 5-F. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR, OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT OFFICIALS , AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH NOSSAMAN LLP TO PROVIDE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SERVICES . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so this is being reintroduced. I voted no for it last time. And I'm voting no for the same reasons. So, first of all, we have a very competent staff that work for Senator Casey and Congress man Cartwright that live right here with us in our back yard. Congress man Cartwright is on the Appropriations Committee . What does he do? He gets money. He's in the paper and on Facebook almost every day bringing tons of money to Luzerne County, right, so they are our advocates . We vote for them to be our advocates or lobbyist s, right? So the same goes for the Mayor. Like I said, that is part of her responsibility . And I know we got a letter sent back with the reintroduction saying, you know, 4,000 a month isn't bad if we get one grant for $500,000. Well, you could spend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 $4,000 a month on scratch offs for a year and maybe not win $500,00. All right, this money is better spent somewhere else, all right, because we have people in places that are paid and elected to do this for us. And then secondly , I didn't bring it up the last time because this was my main concern . But there's a conflict . The Mayor worked for this man, all right? So that in itself is a conflict to me. So I'll be voting no. I'm not reconsidering . I'll be voting no to introduce. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question , I'll also be voting no. Mr. McAndrew covered his points pretty succinctly . I'll just say that this is the second or third time that something has been voted down by Council and has been reintroduced. So I am just letting my other members know I don't want to make this a habit. But I will be voting no for Item 5-F. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. SCHUSTER : No. MR. DONAHUE : The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
