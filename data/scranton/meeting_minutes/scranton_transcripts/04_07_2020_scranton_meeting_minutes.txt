MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing now for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially Jane DiBileo beloved mother of former Scranton City Councilman Gary DiBileo . And also I'd ask that we remember Cody Barrasse . It's the seventh anniversary of his tragic passing . And it's been truly inspiring what Cody's friends and family have done in his honor by forming an organization promoting organ donor awareness . I'd also like to ask now that we take a special moment of silence for people in our community and throughout the world who are currently suffering or who have passed away from the coronavirus . I'd like us to think now about them and their families that they may find peace. I'd like us to think now about the doctors , the nurses, the researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they find protection and peace. Whether we are here at home or abroad surround ed by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together , persist and prepare together .

CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM MAYOR PAIGE G. COGNETTI DATED MARCH 31, 2020 IN RESPONSE TO COUNCIL ’S CORRESPONDENCE SENT MARCH 19, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd just make a comment on the Item 3-E with the date of the taxes. The School Board last night, we added a friendly amendment to keep the current date or current deadline but not follow up with any delinquencies until July 15th just to keep our cash flow situation in order. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Does anyone else have any comments on the Third Order items? I have general comments about the recommendation from the Pennsylvania Economy League. But I'm going to hold those until our comments and motions in Fifth Order at this time. If there's no other comments , received and filed. Do any Council members at this time have any announcements ? MR. DONAHUE : Not necessarily an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 announcement but a reminder if you haven't already to fill out your census form. You should have gotten something in the mail. If not, you could go to my 2020 Census dot Gov to fill out -- fill the census form out. Before we had a public hearing on how we distribute our OECD funds. And the census actually determines where those funds can be dispensed . And that's just one example of the money that's determined based off of the census. So please make sure you fill out your census forms at my 2020 census dot Gov. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : I do actually . EJ the DJ, his wife Penny along with his beautiful daughters McCae and Olivia have been doing a Facebook live dance party from their home in West Side during the stay at home initiative . This event is usually broadcasted Monday, Wednesday , and Thursday s at 5 p.m., Friday at 8; Saturday and Sunday at 12:30. I just want to give a hats off to EJ and his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 beautiful family for bringing us all together through music and dance during these trying times. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I would second that. I've watched it, Mr. McAndrew . It's very well done. Anyone else have any -- MR. MCANDREW : I actually participated too. MR. GAUGHAN : Did you? Anyone have any other announcements ? I have a few. First, if there are any groups or organizations that are offering free services or assistance to someone that's in need during this national emergency and you'd like to have that information available on ECTV, please e-mail ChrisECTV @gmail.com. The wording of your e-mail is exactly what ECTV will publish on Channel 19. I'd also like to state once again that if anyone would like to comment on agenda items or City business , please send those comments in writing to our City Clerk, Lori Reed by e-mailing Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. City Council will accept public comment until the day of our meeting Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Public comment is reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed on the official record and in the minutes of our meeting s. Council 's agenda is now being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting to give people enough time to review all the legislation and backup documentation if they were to comment on it. Our agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. And as Solicitor Hayes mentioned in the caucus, obviously this is not the way that any of us would like -- the situation that any of us would like to be in. We are doing the best that we can at this point in terms of trying to meet. I had a conversation with our City Clerk, Lori Reed earlier in the week. And she gets updates from City Clerks around the state. And we are one of the few councils actually that is still meeting on a regular basis. There are several councils that have just cancelled their meeting s altogether . So we are doing the best we can and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 I think we all look forward to the day when we can be back in City Council chambers with everyone and conduct ing our business as we regularly used to do. Also the Mayor informed me today that there will be a virtual food bank fundraiser benefitting the Northeast Regional Food Bank. This will be Thursday , April 9th from 7 to 8 p.m. Participants will join through Zoom and viewers can watch through Facebook or YouTube . And apparently there will be more information coming about that. So just keep checking Facebook or YouTube , and there will be some sort of announcement coming from the Mayor's office. Last week I also want to announce that I failed just by accident to mention that the Council received comments from Fay Franus and Joseph Healy. They were a part of the record for last week's Council meeting and they are in our official minutes if anyone would like to review those comments . Okay. And that is all I have at this time. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. I'd ask now if someone -- one of my fellow colleagues could make a motion that Council officially accepts and places the comment s received from the following individuals into our record to be fully included in our minutes . And the two people that -- two citizen s that we received comment s from for this week's meeting were Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus. So would someone please make that motion at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I'd like to make a motion that we accept public comments be included into our minutes . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , I reviewed both Mrs. Schumacher and Mrs. Franus's comments as I know everyone else did from last week we received some questions to Council . They are under review. And we will do our best to try to answer those questions and get back to those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 citizens with answers . Mrs. Schumacher posed several questions , stormwater management along with some other things. It may be difficult to be quite honest to get answers to those questions now in the middle of the coronavirus crisis. If for no other reason that those type of things I think are somewhat on the back burner. And it may be difficult to get specific answers to those questions . But nevertheless , we will do our best to in a reasonable timeframe to get those question s answered that were posed to Council . So we have a motion, a second. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. PUBLIC COMMENTS (MARIE SCHUMACHER )1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 #1 Request the Cash Flow Chart be added to Third Order. #2 Does Police Overtime count toward pension . #3 Direct to Councilman Donohue - Have you received a response from DPW such that you are able to provide the promised information to Lenny Serebro ? #4 Has the MS4 Permit been submitted ? #5 What is the contractual date for receiving the Stormwater report from HRG? #6 What is the current status of the Stormwater /Sewage Rights of Way case that will free up the escrowed Scranton Sewer Authority sale and is Council 100% committed to use that freed up money to reduce debt? Submitted by Marie Schumacher (FAY FRANUS) The Scranton school board meeting had the public call in live during their meeting and some were even able to appear if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 they downloaded Zoom site--I am hoping you realize before tonight 's meeting that it actually is possible to have people be heard at the meeting while it is taking place. You may also want to consider the fact that if Tom Schuster gets sworn in without hearing from the public about his appointment it may very well be illegal and anything Tom Schuster votes on is INVALID . The public is an essential part of any public meeting . To silence them is wrong. Putting their comments and questions into the record is NOT being HEARD. Perhaps you all should brush up on the Sunshine Law/Act. Your willingness to not hear directly from the people during a meeting speaks volumes -- you claim to be transparent ., actually hanged your hat on being transparent . Perhaps you should also brush up on the definition of transparency . I do believe it is time you start serving the people you are SUPPOSE to be representing . Your lack of interest in allowing people to be heard only tells them loud and clear you simply do not CARE what they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 feel or what they are concerned about. Fay Franus. Scranton (END OF PUBLIC COMMENTS ) MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I would just like to thank my new colleague s on Council for their vote of confidence for this appointment . And I'm glad they feel that my record on the Scranton School Board could help strength en the City Government . So thank you all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, Mr. Gaughan , one more thing. MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MR. SCHUSTER : I did receive a call about the West Side Hyde Park Neighborhood 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Watch Community Center on Washburn Street. So I guess hearing some things in past about it, I don't have any new updates. But the citizen was questioning what the update on that building was. So maybe I could ask Miss Reed if we could reach out to see if any City money was used in that -- for that community center and where they are with that. MR. GAUGHAN : Certainly . MR. SCHUSTER : I don't know if that was put in the most concise way but -- MR. GAUGHAN : No, no, I know where that building is. And I know that in my time on Council I know that there has been a lot of money put in there. I don't know that City funds were used. But I am certain Mrs. Reed could try to find that out over the next few days. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anything else, Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. I just want to check in with Mrs. Reed. I know last week I posed a question regarding the self -- self-insured , I'm sorry, and that normally when benefits are cut they are paid one month ahead. So I know Mrs. Reed sent an e-mail today posing that question hoping that we would have got a response today. And I didn't see one. Mrs. Reed, did we get a response yet? MS. REED: No, Councilman McAndrew , unfortunately we did not receive a response in time for the meeting tonight . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Could you please just follow up for me? MS. REED: Yes. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Also as Chairman of Public Safety Committee , I would like to thank Mayor Cognetti for her successful effort and stopping daily Greyhound buses from New York to Scranton . And also I'd just like to say in the week of Passover and Easter and actually being a chef by trade, I know that holidays and food bring people together and families together . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 This holiday will be a tough one. But to continue to celebrate holidays and social events with families and friends, we need not be tempted and continue to stay home and stay safe. I just want everybody to have a blessed Easter and Passover to all of those that observe these holidays and to everyone else enjoying this really nice spring weather . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any motions or comment s at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, thank you, Dr. Rothchild . And, Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comment s at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly . I wanted to wish everybody a happy Passover and a happy Easter this upcoming week. And again, urge everybody to stay at home to only make necessary trips out of the house if absolutely necessary , pharmacy , grocery , doctor appointment s, those sort of things. The longer, you know, we all abide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 by -- the sooner we all abide by these restrictions , these social distancing restrictions , the least amount of time we'll have to do them. So if everybody follows them we'll get out of this quicker . Also, just want to bring up that we still haven't gotten any numbers on -- with regards to the furlough s. All we're looking for is really how many people were laid off and what did it save so that -- and also what sort of revenue projection s are being used. I know that the revenue projections keep on changing . But at the same time, there should be a best case and a worse case scenario so that we know when we're looking though these budgets and exploring different things we might have to cut how far we really have to go. But the, you know, the answer we keep on getting it's a personnel issue. It's also a budget issue. And that's a part of Council 's prerogative approving a budget and making sure it's followed . Also as Solicitor Hayes brought up in caucus, I did mention to him this morning when I was talking to him about just doing some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 sort of resolution extending the deadline from April 15th to July 15th for Business Privilege and Mercantile just to make sure we're covering our basis because we did approve an ordinance that we had April 15th as a deadline date. So I just -- just to make sure we're covering all of our bases there. And the other thing that we haven't -- in the first two years I was on Council we had received refuse legislation . I know that in conversations with Solicitor Hayes had with Solicitor Eskra, the reasoning was that we haven't gotten it yet this year was that there was language in the legislation that was passed last year that said and for each year thereafter . Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send correspond ence to the Law Office and copy the Mayor asking for that reasoning in writing so we don't have it secondhand so there's an actual record of it? MS. REED: Yes. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And that's all I have this evening . Thank you, Councilman Gaughan . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few comments . The first thing -- and this will be in Third Order next week. We received a letter from PennDOT about our bridge replacement projects throughout the City. As I mentioned at past meeting s, one of the issues that we have in the City is deteriorating bridges throughout Scranton , excuse me for one minute. Sorry, I had to take a drink. One of the issues as I said is the deteriorating bridges throughout the City. So we actually received a letter from PennDOT which will be in Third Order as I mentioned next week. And they are going to be replacing within the next few years the North Main Avenue bridge over the Leggetts Creek, the Lackawanna Avenue bridge over Railroad Avenue, the Parker Street bridge over the Lackawanna River; and the Elm Street bridge over the Lackawanna River. The letter notified Council and the City that they are going to start this whole process by evaluating each bridge to determine the appropriate work that's required during the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 contribution so you will -- citizens will start to see representatives on site during the spring and summer to complete surveys , in depth bridge inspections and traffic counts. Again, as our City Engineer , John Pocius had relayed to me several times, these bridge projects take years. So it's not likely that we'll see any sort of actual construction until maybe four or five years down the road. But nevertheless , the process is started . Also on our Third Order agenda next week will be a letter that Council received from Pennsylvania American Water to update us on some project s and some critical work. Even through the coronavirus crisis they are still going to provide essential services and continue to advance work on utility construction project s that they deem critical . Schedule d to begin actually this week weather permitting , contract ors are going to replace existing four, six, and eight inch cast iron pipes with new eight inch ductile iron mains along several City streets . This range is really all across the City. So this will be placed on our agenda 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 next week. And if anyone is interested , they could take a look to see if they're in one of these affected areas. And Pennsylvania American Water will be notifying these residents as well that they are going to be doing work. I did receive a phone call from a woman in the Oakmont area on East Mountain about quads. With the nice weather as we know comes the use of quads which have disrupted life in that area and really in other areas of the City as well. I was able to reach out to Chief Graziano . Obviously , we know from past experience that those people who ride on quads cannot be chased for obvious reasons . We wouldn't want anyone to get harmed. But Chief Graziano did notify me that they were going to do their best to intercept these people and try to get them to stop doing this. Especially in the Oakmont area and I'm sure through other places in the City, there are people now working from home trying to get work done. And this apparent ly in Oakmont at least has been nonstop . Hopefully 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 that issue is going to be taken care of. The other thing I just wanted to briefly mention was in Third Order we received last week a letter from the Pennsylvania Economy League. The letter was actually addressed to the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development . And it was our Act 47 coordinator 's recommendation to the secretary of DCED for the City of Scranton and whether or not we were prepared to exit from Act 47. So I just wanted to make a few comments on this because this letter is important , especial ly now in light of the economic affects of the coronavirus will most undoubtedly have on the City. Before I get into the points I want to make on this, I do want to say that I think it is important that Council work together with the Pennsylvania Economy League and the state and the Mayor and her administration so that we can resolve some of these issues. And in reading the letter, there are several issues. Some of them are not surprising . The first issue that was noted in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 this letter is that in 2019 the -- or in 2018, the City had a deficit of nearly one and -- a little bit over 1 million dollars . In 2019, the unaudited financial statement s were examined and the City experience d an excess of revenues over expenditures resulting in almost a million and a half dollar surplus . They're project ing in 2020 that the City would incur a slight deficit of $124,290. The one thing that I am concerned about is in the 2020 budget under the sale of assets, the previous administration had put in for one and a half million dollars -- actually it was more than that. Council pared it back a little bit because of concern s we had at that time -- but one and a half million dollars for the sale of delinquent refuse and delinquent real estate bills. So I think the Mayor had mentioned this in her letter to us on the furlough s. That is a point of concern because we don't know what that looks like. And we were banking on that -- the previous administration was banking on that in terms of closing a budget deficit . So, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 know, I've spoken to the Mayor about it. We're going to continue to monitor that. But right now that obviously is a concern because we don't want to come up with a hole in the budget. So we'll continue to watch out for that. The second thing that I wanted to mention on page 12 was that unfortunately , the Pennsylvania Economy League is projecting that the City will incur operating deficits throughout the 2021 and 2025 projection period. So we're looking at -- let me see here. We're looking at 2021, $503,000 potential deficit . And then it just keeps going up over a million and a half in 2022; nearly 4 million dollars in 2023; in 2024 nearly 3 and a half million dollars . And then in 2025 it's projected almost 6 million dollar deficit . Now, what they're citing is something that is no surprise to anyone who has dealt with City finances over the last few years is the lack of inherent growth in our real property tax revenue . That's the main driver for the projected operating deficit s. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 And this lack of inherent growth is the result of annual flat or a decrease in City real property assessed values. I won't go through the whole thing. But they provide some pretty stark numbers here, which they did really in December of last year when they came before Council when we were preparing to pass the budget. It goes without saying that if we continue to operate without a reassessment , we're going to continue to suffer. We need -- and this again provides anyone who's paying attention with the fact that the lack of a reassessment is hurting the City of Scranton . And that is evident in this document here. And again, it's been forward to the county and it's been relayed to the City over the last number of years. The third point that I want to make here on page 18 is the fact that what PEL is recommending over the next few years is minor tax increases . So they're recommending that the City increase its property tax millage rates by 1.4 percent in 2021; 3.5 percent and 6.2 percent in the years 2022 and 2023. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 They also mention that the City's participation in the Act 47 program cannot directly reverse this trend that we find ourselves in. So long story short, at the time of writing their recommendation , they under normal circumstances would recommend that the City exit Act 47. But under the circumstances with the coronavirus they're going -- it says the future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the City's financial projections as present ed by the coordinator , and this Act 47 coordinator 's recommendation is unknown at this time. The coordinator will continue to monitor the City's fiscal condition as the City progresses through the Covid-19 pandemic . So I would ask everyone to take a look at this if you haven't already when you can. One of the things that PEL has recommended over the last several years is small annual tax increases so that we don't get hit with very large double-digit tax increases . My concern with this is that the recommendation from PEL and the recommendation from the state when we're faced with these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 issues that we're very well aware of is to continue to go back to the property owner and to raise their taxes. It's a never-ending battle. In the six years that I've been on Council , the answer is always to go back and to raise property taxes. I personally don't understand how we can expect to grow as a City if we always go back to the property owner. The bottom line in all of this, there's no simple solution . But the local government system that we operate in is broken. And it has been for a very, very long time. I'll read -- I want to read a section because I think this is so important from PEL's own report that they issued a few years ago. And they state: The Commonwealth attempt ed to legislate away the inadequacy of Act 47 by compelling municipalities to leave the program through establishment of an arbitrary deadline . And what they mean by that is that in 2012 when the legislature amended the Act 47 legislation , they -- the clock started ticking for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 municipalities who are distressed like Scranton . So we only had five years to get out or go into receiver ship or disincorporate as a municipality . So the legislation was passed despite the fact that it is questionable to assume real change could be made in only five years when the problem 's inherit and the local government system itself has not been addressed . This was written a years ago. They still have not been addressed . PEL states that the truth is that the Commonwealth could change the optics of distress by claiming to have fixed Act 47 municipalities by forcing them out of the program but that action has done nothing to repair the broken system these municipalities must operate in. Given the findings of the most recent stress index, the consequences of failing to truly reform the rules under which local government s function likely will result in an increase in municipal distress throughout the state. So my only comment on this -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I've made this comment and Kyle is probably sick of me saying it and others are sick of me saying it over the last few years, but we can only do so much. The state continues to ignore, in my opinion , distressed municipalities . And they have ignored distress ed municipalities for a number of different years. And they always give us the worn out answer of raise property taxes to fix the problem s. And many times that's the last result. As all of us know who have reviewed the budget, there is only so much that can be cut. Most are our expenses are labor, health insurance , things that are -- we are contractually obligate d to pay. But the problems that we face in Scranton and all the other municipalities who are distressed state stems from the local government system that's dysfunctional . It's outdated. And it's broken. So unless the system is reformed and fixed, each Council person that's in this Zoom room tonight and those who will come after us will continue to face this never-ending battle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 that the City faces every single year. So I wanted to make sure that once again I stated for the record these issues that have been well documented over the last few years and since we've been in distress since I believe 1992. So what I would ask and maybe we can formulate some kind of correspondence and work together with the Mayor and her administration is ask that in light of the crisis that we find ourselves in with the coronavirus and the crisis that we probably will find ourselves in financially as a result of it that instead of the quick fix of going back to the property owner to raise property taxes, that the state and the state legislature actually do their job and identify the problems and provide solutions for them rather than these half-baked solutions with Act 47 that municipalities stay in for decades . And as I said in December and I think Councilman Donahue was there when I asked the Pennsylvania Economy League Director Mr. Cross, what was the point of all of this. What was the point of being in distressed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 status and being in Act 47 for almost most of my lifetime since I'm a young kid. The Mayor has issued a statement as we all know that she wants to stay in Act 47. And there may be merits to that. But I think if we're going to do that, we need to have a conversation as a City with our state legislature to make sure that they know that this system is broken and that there has to be solutions put forward by them and working with the distressed municipalities in Scranton and throughout the state. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MR. DONAHUE : Councilman Gaughan ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. DONAHUE : Just to add onto your point, so let's remember that the taxing code, the state taxing code that we're operating on was developed in the late 60s. So that's when Pennsylvania , when a lot of the population was concentrated in cities. We didn't have suburbs . There were cities. There were farms. That's the taxing code that we're operating under now which is completely outdated just to add onto your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 point. MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO, 27, 2020 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THOMAS J. MCLANE & ASSOCIATES AS CITY OF SCRANTON PROJECT CONSULTANT RECREATION NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND PROJECT ACTIVITIES FOR THE PERIOD DECEMBER 1, 2019 THROUGH NOVEMBER 30, 2024. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee On Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Just on the question , I'm going to be voting in favor of this legislation as I mentioned during the caucus. The City does not currently have a comprehensive assessment of its park system. This contract with Thomas J. McLane and Associates will provide the City with a roadmap for our park system for the next several years. Having a master plan concept for each of our parks will give the City a better ability to receive grants in the future 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 for all of these areas. Continuing to upgrade and invest in our park system is crucial to the success of the City. Our City Parks and Recreation Department does a really good job in maintaining the parks that we have. The City needs to continue to invest in this department and make sure that they have the tools and manpower that they need. I had several conversations with our police Chief in the last few years about the impact that a well maintained and active park has on a neighborhood . It is so important to the success of our neighborhoods . And it really comes down to the broken window's theory. When a park is blighted and it's rundown, it invites a criminal element . We need to ensure that that does not happen. And we need to continue to invest in our park system as much as we can. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS.

Before we adjourn , I just want to say once again that I -- and I know all of my colleague s are thinking about and praying for all of those affected by the coronavirus crisis. Once again would echo what some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 my colleague s said tonight and what we said last week that we would ask that all residents of Scranton take this very seriously . And I think most people are. It is not a hoax. It's not a joke. And the sooner that we all do our part and stay inside as much as we can, the sooner that we can get back to normal here in the City and in the country and around the world. Again, I know that for all of us who may be watching this meeting tonight or watching it on YouTube , this is difficult . Being separated from your family for some of us who have not seen our parents , our grandparents , grandparents who haven't seen their grandchildren , it's extremely , extremely difficult . But we will get through this together as a City. This Council and the administration are doing everything that we can to make sure that everything is in place. I know that so that we are prepared for this. I know our state government is as well. So I just want to again say that our thoughts are with everyone . And we continue to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 think about everyone at this time. If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting is adjourned . Thank you everyone . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Have a great holiday everybody . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
