MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Rogan. Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.Firsta remainder thatECTVwillbetelevising the mayoral andcitycouncil debates onChannel 19,that'sallI'mgoingtosayaboutthat issuebecause Ireally don'tthinkthisis theforumforpolitical comments . Tonight I'mgoingtotalkabouta subject thatisaspecial interest tome, andnoit'snotreassessment .Historical preservation andthefuture ofcities,and whilewejustmaybeonthecuspof something trulyamazing ,butonlyifwemake therightdecisions onagoingforward basis. Asaformer president ofthe Architectural Heritage Association ,aswell asaformer member oftheHARB,whichisthe Historical Architecture Review Board,and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 alsoaformer cityplanning commission member foralmost adecade,preservation and planning havealways intercepted forme.So whatIwantittalkabouttonight isa return ofthecity.Cityliving,belive it ornot,ismaking acomeback.Ithinkwe haveseensomeofthatforyourselves with thegrowth ofresidential living downtown . 80percent ofAmerican sliveincities and urbanareas,andthatnumber isincreasing . According tothelastcensus,theurban population grewat12percent between 2000 and2010.Infact,since2000,homeprices inthecitycenters haveoutperformed those inthesuburbsby50percent .Thisdynamics pertheTimemagazine headlineinAprilof 2014thatread,"ThenewAmerican dreamis living inthecitynotowning ahouseinthe suburbs ." Soevenwhilesuburbansprawl continue dtoproliferate ,manyAmericans begantofeelthatsomething wasmissing in thenameofthe20thcentury convenience . Building suburbanneighborhood sstructured around cars,rather thanpeople,theyfound1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 theywerelosing manyaspectsofthemeaning ofplacethatcomprised thebuilding lots thatmakeupacommunity .Suburbanites complete dependence ontheautomobile ends ofcosting families moremoneyintheform ofmultiple cars,moreinsurance ,gas,and evenhealth care.Theformer president of thenational trust,Richard Moe,called the suburbs themostexpense ,resource intense , landgobbling ,polluting wayofliving ever built. SoasImentioned earlier ,inthe beginning ofthe21stcentury thecomeback forcities began.Inthebook"TheGreat Inversion intheFuture oftheAmerican City"theauthor wrotethatweareliving in amoment inwhichthemassive outward migration oftheaffluent thatcharacterized thesecond halfofthe20thcentury is coming toanend,andamongthedriving forces behind thischange andaninward migration backtocities arethoseborn between 1980and1987,alsoknownas millennials . ANielsen report foundthat621 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 percent ofthemillennials wanted tolivein anurban,mixeduseenvironment alongside shops,restaurants andoffices .Infact, further research suggested thatafull85 percent ofthisgrouppreferredcityliving tolifeinthesuburbs,andI'mnoteven including theemptynesters ,manywhoare nowtaking aleavetocitylifeandtrading theirlawnmowers andsnowblowers foran easier andfarmoreinteresting wayofurban life. Youngprofessionals andmillennials , unlike theirparents ,whoseemtohave calculated theirworthintermsofhowmany square foottheirhousewas,aremore interested intheamenities ofthecity itself.Greatpublic spaces,walkability , diverse people,andmoreactivities . Thereason Italkaboutsubject s likethisisbecause thiscouldbeour future.Weneedtodoalotmorethings rightbutthisisthereforthetaking.We needtoembrace itbecause avitaland relevant downtown neighborhood willbring increase dtaxbase,are-imagined1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 prosper ity,smallbusinesses andyesjobs, andthatmeansstability atthegovernment levelaswellasadditional resources to drawfromtohelpsupport ourneighborhoods . Inthemoviethe"FieldofDreams" thethemeissimple,ifyoubuildit,they willcome.Wehavealready builtit.We already havewhatothersdon'thave,butwe needtobesmartandinnovative and concerned caretakersofwhatwedohaveand it'struepotential . Sohowdoeshistoric preservation enterthisconversation ,because itstarts withwhatI'mgoingtocallthequality of place.Thisisthequality ofthe buildings ,architecture andthestreets that surround us.People wanttoliveandwork wherethatexist.Quality liketheScranton CulturalCenter,theAlbright library ,the Radisson Lackawanna ,theScranton Life building ,theScranton Electric building , theConnell building ,theBrooksbuilding .

It'stimeforustotelladifferent story andsothat'sIhaveonthatsubject tonight . Finally ,Iwouldliketothank--on reassessment ,because Ican'tletanightgo bythatIdon'ttalkaboutreassessment ,I'd liketothankMr.CrossfromPELaswellas theLeagueofWomenVoters fortheir unbiased presentation onreassessment .And onemorething,theelection islessthan threeweeksaway,please vote"yes"for1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 reassessment .Thankyou. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Evans. Mr.Gaughan ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,thankyou,justa fewitems.Firstofall,Iwantto apologize forbeingabsent lastweek.Iwas illandIstillcan'tseemtoshakethis cold.Iwanttosaysomething aboutthe purpose ofthesecouncil meetings after listening tosomespeaker tonight .It'smy viewthatthepurpose ofthesemeetings is toconduct citybusiness ,notengage inwho people wanttowinfortheOfficeofMayor, throwing outvarious allegations about different candidates .Ithinkthatweneed togetthesemeetings inorderoverthenext fewweeks,otherwise ,theintent ofcouncil meetings ,whichis--thepurpose isto conduct citybusiness ,itwillcontinue to deteriorate inmyopinion . Second thingIwouldliketo mention ,thispastSaturday Ihadthe opportunity tocallabingogameattheWest SideSenior CenterandIapproached atable ofelderly womenandwestarted tohavea1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 conversation andalmost allofthewomenat thetablelivedorcurrently livein Greenridge Seniorapartments offofDixon Avenue.Andifyouremember ,thissubject hascomeupheremorethanoncewithone speaker whowasverypassionate aboutsome oftheperceived injusticesthataretaking placeatthiscomplex ,andIhadalmost all ofthepeople sitting atthistabletellme somepretty horrifying things thataregoing ondown--apparently goingdownatthis senior citizen ,atthesenior apartments . Oneofthemisthatthereis apparently a$15charge onelderly people if theyarelocated nexttotheelevator .The elevator wasdownforalongtimesothat affected manyoftheelderly thereand people thatarehandicapped . Oneofthemajorthings thatthese womenweretelling meisthattherents continue torise.Whenthiswasbuiltback in2012,andIwanttoreadanexcerptfrom anarticle ,aMarch21article fromthe Scranton Times,"TheCityofScranton , Lackawanna County andtheschool district is1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 considering ataxabatement forthe121unit senior citizen apartment building thatwas goingtobebuiltinaformer masonry block plantintheGreenridge section ofDixon Avenue." Sothiscompany ,whichisfrom Williams ville,NewYork,wasseeking atax abatement ,itwasspecifically seeking a LERTA,whichgivesaone-yeartaxabatement forevery$1million invested in improvements toaproperty forupto10 years,andIbelieve theyeventually gota 10-yeartaxabatement . Christopher Trivasani ,thedirector ofdevelopment foraffordable senior opportunities ofNewYorkIncorporated ,a for-profit company ,requested aLERTAfrom Scranton CityCouncil inMarchof2012,and hesaid,"Withtheconstruction estimated to cost10to50million dollars aLERTAwould payforthefirm'smortgage and,thus,allow rentsof$700to$800amonth." Healsowentontosay,according to thisarticle ,"Thatrentscouldbe maintained asaffordable ,soaffordable1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 senior housing couldbeoffered tothe citizens ofScranton andthecounty." Well,apparently fromwhatthese elderly womentoldme,therentsarenowin theareaof$1,100,$12,00and$1,300a month.Idon'thavetotellanybody inthe roomtonight orintheCityofScranton that oursenior citizens areonafixedincome andthesewomenthatIspoketosoldtheir homesinthecitytomoveintothis apartment complex because theywerepromised affordable housing .Soneedlesstosay,we wentonto--Iwon'tgointoeverything ,but wewentontodiscuss alotofotherthings thataregoingondownthere,theyarevery afraid ofspeaking out.Therehavebeena massexodusofpeople whohaveleftthe complex apparently .Theproblem isthere arethosewhoareleftbehind andwhocannot leavebecause theycannot findanyplace elsetogoandmanyofthemdon'thave family leftinthecity. Thishaskeptmeupnowforthelast couple ofnights thinking aboutallofthese people thatImetandalloftheirstories ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 soIdidbringthisupinourcaucus inthe backroomandIthinkwhether thisisan issuewherewehavetheauthority tosolve thisproblem atthispointdoesn'teven matter tome,something hasgottobedone here.Idon'tknowwhat,whether it's bringing thiscompany backinandtaking awaythetaxabatement ,Idon'tevenknow howthatworks.Ihavehaddiscussions with Solicitor Minora inthepastaboutthat,but something hastobedonehere. Thewomanthatcameandspokea few--maybeamonthortwoago,shewas verypassionate ,shewasverypassionate aboutthecause,I'vehadmorethanone conversation withher,butnowshegot kicked outoftheapartment complex because shewasspeaking up.Thepeople thatare leftthereareafraid tospeakupsothey needsomebody .Theyhavegonetoother avenues andithasn'tworked outsoIhave askedSolicitor Minora toinvestigate every possible avenue toseeifthiscouncil can doanything tohelpthesepeople.I honestly thought ofmyowngrandparents if1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 theyweretoldthattheycouldmoveinto thisapartment complex andpay$700or$800 amonthandbeabletoafford itandthen fiveyearslateryouarepayingnearly $1,300.It'sunacceptable .Andthisisa for-profit company sosomething hastobe done. Justafewmorethings,Iaskedfor anupdate fromthemayortoday,themayor's secretary actually ,ontheleaseagreement between thecityandtheCivilWarGAR Museum downinthebasement ,haven'theard backyet,butwearehopeful thatweare goingtogetthatontheagenda before November . Ialsohadtheopportunity totakea rideouttothe1,800blockofShimpf Court wherethereisseveral residents inSouth Scranton whohadanumber ofdifferent complaints .Thereisissueswiththecourt actually crumbling andfalling apart.It waslastpavedin1975,soIwouldaskthat werequest thatitbeputonthenextpaving listifwecansendcorrespondence toOECD because Idobelieve thatisinalowto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 moderate income area.Thereweremounds of dirtthatwereonthecourtandthereare twohouses wheretheweedsareovergrown,I actually couldn'tevenseetogetintothe house.Theweedsweresohighandthegrass wassohighIcouldn'tevenseethefront door.

Theproperty ,wefoundout,isowedbythe Lackawanna County landbanksowedid contact RalphAtlasfromthecounty andhe isgoingtotakecareofthatissue. ThelastthingIhavetonight ismy concern overtheAct511challenge inCourt andthefactthatthatmayhaveonthe city'splantoexitAct47distressed status.Youknow,themayorhasbeen touting thelastfewmonths thattheCityof Scranton ispossibly goingtoexitAct47, andIhatetorainonhisparade and everybody else'sparade,butwereally only1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 havetwooptions according tothe legislation thatwaspassed bythestate. Weeither exitAct47,taking advantage of thethree-yeartimelinethatwehave,which takesusto2021,wedisincorporate asa municipality ,whichdoesn'tapplytous,or weenterreceivership .Sothereisreally onlytwooptions.
