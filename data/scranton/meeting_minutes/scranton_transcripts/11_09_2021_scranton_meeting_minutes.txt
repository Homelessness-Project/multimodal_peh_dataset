Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . I just want to start off first by wishing all the Veterans and their families a happy Veterans Day. I think it's never too often to thank the people who defend this country and preserve our democracy . Can you update us on the status of the audit? MR. GAUGHAN : They are waiting on the audit from the Redevelopment Authority or the Sewer Authority -- one or the other, I can't remember . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And do you think it will be out before or after you get the proposed budget? MR. GAUGHAN : I'd say after at this point. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, darn. MR. GAUGHAN : We're going to get it on Tuesday . MS. HODOWANITZ : All right. And I checked the City's website this morning , still missing the parts of the labor agreement for the firefighters . MR. DONAHUE : I did get an update on that. And they are just working on rectifying and getting it together and putting it up there. MS. HODOWANITZ : My understanding is that the union contracts for police and fire expire at the end of the year. Are negotiation s in progress ? MR. GAUGHAN : They are. MS. HODOWANITZ : All right. With regard to the 5-C, the Peer grant for $10,000 for our parks and trail accessi bility study, I think that's a good idea. I understand from the backup that the City will provide 10 percent matching funds. My comment on that legislation is, what you need is not just the accessibility study for parks and trails but basically need a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 safety study for the entire City for pedestrians because that's what most of the background talked about, you know, sidewalks and bike trails and this, that and the other thing. Now, I've lived in downtown Scranton since 1999. And I walk just about everywhere downtown . I could remember three cases of people killed trying to cross Lackawanna Avenue and another one killed on the corner right here in a wheelchair I recall, okay. The City needs to take a look at issues like traffic lights and poor pedestrians trying to cross the street, especially you have a lot of elderly that live downtown use walkers , use wheelchairs , walk slowly. You're going to have more accidents if something is not done. How many times has Ron Ellman come up to this podium and mention the safety issues with no sidewalks in his neighborhood ? If you have to walk and you have to walk out on the street, you take your life in your hands. So, you know, this is good legislation . I have no problem with it. But sooner or later we need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 to address the issue of pedestrian safety throughout the entire City because people are getting hurt. And with regard to 5-B, the lease agreement with with Deutsch Institute , I like that too. Where is Robinson Park? MR. GAUGHAN : On East Mountain . If you go all the way up East Mountain Road until you can't get any further and take a right, you keep going down -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, is that the 98 East Mountain Road? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Because it's -- address of the Deutsch Institute in the contract . I saw that the Institute is going to have a million dollars in general liability insurance . Does this mean you're going to remove Robinson Park and its two-story building from the Knowles ' Insurance contract ? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know. We'll find out about that. MS. HODOWANITZ : You should because like the public library , we don't want to be double insuring buildings . That's just a waste 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 of taxpayer dollars . And it said with regard to renovations , they will take place as funds become available . Who provided those funds? MR. GAUGHAN : The Deutsch Institute will make any improvements . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, so they will then pay for those improvements themselves . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, now, the City went for grant funding to Robinson Park. But we're talking just about the building . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. So this is a three-year lease. And I think it's a good idea. But just make sure we don't double pay for insurance . I don't like that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : And I would imagine too just to add to that that the Deutsch Institute is probably going to apply for grants towards the rehabbing the building . MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council . You know, the first thing I have here is I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 don't know if you've been paying any attention to the Russian investigation . But, you know, Hillary Clinton may find herself -- MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Morgan, excuse me. MR. MORGAN: You don't know the context of what I'm going to say. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I just want to preface your -- to tell you before you speak -- MR. MORGAN: No, I don't -- MR. GAUGHAN : -- if you could somehow tie the investigation of the Hillary Clinton to the City of Scranton -- MR. MORGAN: -- the City should name a street after Hillary Clinton -- MR. GAUGHAN : -- City business . City business . MR. MORGAN: -- because if we have one after Joe Biden and people in the country , his approval rates are 38 percent and the vice president is 28 percent ; and we've got people in the country yelling let's go Brandon or just profanities in regard to the president because his job is so subpar, just so terrible that the country is in a free fall. And on the world stage, he's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 laughing stock of the whole world. And he's going to go meet the president of China next week. We're going to see how that goes because it didn't go very well in Alaska. And that's the person you've named a street after in the City and the ramp that comes into this City. It's just atrocious . Now, I think it's very important for the resident s to understand one thing here. As we get ready to exit Act 47, we need to have a thorough investigation of where we were at the time we entered Act 47 and where we are when we left. We lost the golf course. We lost parking garages . We lost the Sewer Authority . We lost various other things. And I think it would be important for this Council to do an analyzation of where we were and where we are. And the other thing I have here is the Home Rule Charter commission -- study commission that's going to change the charter for the City has to take place without a doubt. And when you write this charter , you have to put certain things in it so that the Council has to do what the charter says.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 And if we have a mayor at that time or if we don't, if we -- if the charter -- if the commission sits and it decides that it's going to have a Council President act as mayor at times and they abolish the office of mayor, there's a lot of things that could be determined here. We have to realize one thing. We have to do something about property tax. There is residents all in high rises that at one time lived in a property -- most of them did in the City. They couldn't afford to pay their taxes. We've got a City whose tax base has been eroded by corruption in my opinion over an extended period of time. We have a Council man like Mr. Gaughan who wants to control public speech who doesn't seem to understand what freedom of speech actually means. But maybe you should educate yourself , Mr. Gaughan , on exactly what that means because my rights don't come from you. They come from the Constitution . And this Council was warned by the judge not to stifle free speech here. And I had that discussion with your clerk. You have no respect for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 people. And you think that you could tell people what they should say and what they should think and how they should express themselves -- MR. GAUGHAN : No, I just said keep your comment s to City business -- City business . Nobody wants to hear -- MR. MORGAN: No, no, that's not what the judge said. MR. GAUGHAN : Nobody wants to hear -- MR. MORGAN: -- the judge said something totally different and you -- ATTY. HAYES: You're out of order. MR. GAUGHAN : Excuse me -- MR. MORGAN: -- your opinion does not stand over the top of a judge. MR. GAUGHAN : You don't -- you don't have the -- ATTY. HAYES: Mr. Morgan, you're out of order. You're out of order. You're out of order. MR. MORGAN: Your opinion does not stand over the top of a judge and neither does 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 yours. ATTY. HAYES: You're out of order. MR. MORGAN: No, I'm not out of order. ATTY. HAYES: The President of Council controls -- MR. MORGAN: The judge -- ATTY. HAYES: Excuse me. Excuse me. MR. MORGAN: -- here and what can't, not you, not the police officer sitting there and not the Council President . ATTY. HAYES: Then go get an order, okay? MR. MORGAN: No, I don't need an order. The judge gave you one. And I asked your council clerk to produce it and you don't have it. ATTY. HAYES: You're out of order. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Let me say this to -- MR. GAUGHAN : Calm down. You don't have to yell. MR. MORGAN: No, I'm not -- I am calm. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. GAUGHAN : Well, you're screaming into the microphone . I could hear you fine. MR. MORGAN. Let me say this to you. You do not tell a judge what he's going to do and neither do you. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, then you go down to the -- MR. MORGAN: No, no, no, no, no. If I go down, you'll go with me. And then you'll show -- tell the judge why you showed defiant indifference do his order. It's not my order. It's his. And it didn't have to do with one council . It had to do with all of them going forward . Do you know what that means? You're an attorney . ATTY. HAYES: You're out of order, okay? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, excuse me. Sit down. Sit down. Yeah, have a good night. ATTY. HAYES: This is the only five minutes of the week that people actually have to listen to him. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Yeah, Supreme Court Justice Lee Morgan. Okay. Anyone else want to give us their take on legal proceeding s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and Fox News or anything else? Would anyone else like to address Council ? Come on up. MR. COYNE: Good evening. Tom Coyne, Minooka . It's going to be a little anticlimatic after that. But I'd like to talk first about the Deutsch Institute . I think that is actually a fantastic idea. It's a fantastic use of a City resource. And reading proposal s that originally called for a monthly fee, I understand the document before you has a yearly fee of one dollar. It's kind of silly to have it as the bids -- the bidding contract called for a monthly fee to be paid which is 8.3 cents. So those documents don't quite match up. In looking at them, it's -- even though this is a park from the City, it seems that trash collection is changing over to the Deutsch Institute . Considering what they do for the City and for the disadvantage d, I would hope that Council would at least consider having the parks services or the trash company , the DPW continue trash pickups at that facility . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I don't think that even though it -- even though we could charge for an -- have an outside hauler, I don't think it would be that much of an impact on the City to actually stop by there with the truck and pick it up. They are doing a service for this City and the City's people. And I believe that would be a just compensation for the City to extend one property stop for that facility . And last is, you're going to have the directors from various departments come forward . Is there going to be an opportunity for citizens to submit questions to Council so that citizens can get their questions answered from the directors rather than just Council themselves asking the directors void of representation from people's questions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. Yeah, you mostly certainly can do that. MR. COYNE: Awesome . What method would you prefer for questions for Council for the directors ? And if there's a list of when they're coming in, is it possible to put notice out there so we can submit them a week beforehand? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, there was an advertisement in the newspaper I think Sunday, Frank, was it? Yeah, there was an advertisement with a listing . We could give it to you after the meeting . Another one should be in this Sunday with a list of when they're coming. But if you want to e-mail us the question s, we'll forward it in advance to the department s and then hopefully they'll provide the answers . MR. COYNE: Could it just be also for the meeting s for you also just attach it as a note to the meetings for next week -- MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. COYNE: -- so that anyone has it, they could have a copy of it for their notes. MR. GAUGHAN : Yep. MR. COYNE: Thank you very much. Have a good evening . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a nice evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I want to bring up televisions again this week. I have three defunct televisions . I'm perfectly willing to pay to have them taken care of. I don't want to throw them out in somebody else's lawn like people do, oh, that's right. There's also a monitor for a computer somebody dumped off on my front lawn. Mr. DeNaples doesn't seem to want to do his job. I mean, he's suppose d to be running a recycling center. And I called a couple months ago and they said, oh, we stopped that. Well, isn't that grand. You know, now what do you do with all of these televisions hanging around your house, you know, compliments of Pennsylvania Power and Light. They blew them out with their power surges. So I'd like to probably try and call the Mayor on that. And I think we need to possibly get in touch with the county too because they're involved with that. But they just keep piling up. And I walked the doggy a couple of times last week and I started noticing , there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 television s all over the courts. They're just sitting behind houses. And they've been discarded and probably sit there forever . So at least you should have some kind of opportunity to get rid of them. COVID, the official from MSNBC News tonight was 1 million by March, 1 million people dead by March. You know, we get all fired up when some whacko walks into a mall and there's 10 or 15 people -- which any death is unfortunate ; but Fox News seems to be spreading a lot of disgust ing propaganda and picking on Big Bird and everything else. I mean, it's just a shame. People should wear their masks when necessary and get out and get vaccinate d. It's just not going away. And that's part of the problem with the country is we're not set free from this. And it just keeps going on and on and on. And I don't know if these people realize it, these newscasters but they're like saboteurs , you know, just throwing a wrench into the gears and watching everything break apart. And I'd like to talk a little bit about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Social Security issues; is that okay? MR. GAUGHAN : If you can tie it somehow back to the City of Scranton and City business , be my guest. MR. DOBRZYN : Yeah, it's -- well, you have enough people on Social Security in town here. Last September -- and I don't plan to yell about it, by the way. A president declared it was unnecessary through presidential order that you didn't have to collect Social Security taxes. Well, it was exposed that he also intended to possibly try to curtail them. Fortunately , he's not here. But anyway, the Social Security fund and Medicare funds would have been bankrupt by 2023 around June. Now, you could just imagine if we have 10 or 15,000 people in the City of Scranton roaming around with no money to pay their bills, no money to pay their taxes, nowhere to go what would we do. You know, it would be a total disaster . It would be of our own making. I mean, sometimes if elderly relatives can stay independent , it's a big plus. Take my word for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 it, you know? I had a heated argument one time with an elderly relative , they told me that Bosnia wasn't a religious war. It was the Christians and Muslims . You know, so we all turn into Archie Bunkers eventually . And hopefully I won't be too bad when I get that way. Have a good day. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. You too. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd just like to say happy Veterans Day to all of our veteran s here in the City. And then just one citizen 's concern , Mr. Voldenberg . I just sent over 1829 Cedar Ave. I got a complaint about that maybe a week or so back. I sent it through but it never seemed to make the list for the LIPS Department . So I resent that and we could follow up on that later. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. Thank you. I would also like to wish all the veterans a happy Veterans Day. Thank you for your service this coming Thursday . Now, I just want to circle around with two concerns I've been bringing up for the past year or so. So I will start off with we received an update on the third on 1149 Sloan Street rear illegal garage operation . So -- and like I stated in the past couple of meetings , this has been going on for over a year. The activity is very dangerous what's going on. So the response I got or the summary that we've been receiving which I'm thrilled that Code Enforcement has now been providing us with updates but all it says is, you know, Mr. McAndrew asked about it. I said occupant s are painting vehicles and operating a garage at this lotion. So all I got back was, it was discuss ed with zoning. I don't know what was discussed . And then the update states received additional serious concerns from several 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 neighbors . So I'm glad to hear other people are coming forward . But that to me is not an update. I want to know what the next step is. I know what the previous steps were suppose d to be. And I don't think they occurred . So if you could please follow up on that for me to get more clarity on what that means -- that update means because it concerns me. And then secondly about a year ago there was this nuisance property . It was 125-127 North St. Francis Cabrini Avenue. So the same residents reached out to me over the past year share the same concerns actually . There's more police activity that's been going on there. And they would like to know if there is an update on that because they were supposed to take a good look at it. And then also, within the same stream there, I was asked that there's a property next door -- it's a vacant property . And the residents aren't sure if it's owned by the City. And if so, could you just find that answer? They'd like to know that if you could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 inquire about that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments this evening ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Just one comment that was included on the list that we received an update on from OECD, one of the properties it said it was just like Linden and Harrison Avenue and that it was condemned and there was a hit and run there some time ago. But I believe that was the wrong property , not the one I was inquiring about that I received a complaint about from a resident . So if we could check on 1600 Linden Street. That is catty-corner from the other property that I believe was -- that we received a note on. And this one just has a lot of -- a lot of overgrown grass and weeds and shrubs that are right on Harrison Avenue. And they are really getting quite high. I think there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 is an empty garbage pail somewhere in the mix there. That's everything that I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, first I would just like to wish all the veterans out there a happy Veterans Day and thank them for their service . Also, I was happy to see last week that Congress was actually able to put an end to infrastructure week after five years with the passage of a bipartisan 1.2 trillion dollar infrastructure bill. Marc Stier who is the Director of the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center which provides independent analysis on state budget matters went through the bill and created estimates based on the formulas it contain s. He projects that the State of Pennsylvania could receive a minimum of 17.8 billion in new spending allocated as follows : 11.3 billion for federal highway programs and 1.6 billion for bridge replacement and repairs ; another 2.8 billion over five years for public transportation ; 171 million to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 add electric vehicle charging stations ; at least 100 million that could increase broadband coverage, which is vital for Pennsylvania ; 1.4 billion to improve water infrastructure . As we've seen, that is desperately needed within the City of Scranton ; 355 million for the states airports ; 49 million to protect against wildfires and 26 million to prevent cyber attacks and investments in weatherization and energy and efficiency . This is long past due. And it is absolutely must needed. So I'm happy to see that, you know, they could actually pass some bipartisan legislation in Washington that actually helps real people and affects their lives from day to day. Thank you. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Just to answer I think it was Miss Hodowanitz 's question last week about the temperature s that are now getting into the teens and I think it was Code Blue Program that you had mention ed. So Mr. Voldenberg did check into it. The City employs a Code Blue Program for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 unhoused persons when the temperature reaches 20 degrees and below including windchill at the Weston Fieldhouse on Providence Road in Scranton . And then the county website indicate s the additional locations below, Anthony 's Haven, 409 Olive Street, 7:30 p.m. to 8 a.m. Those are the hours; and the Community Intervention Center, 445 North Sixth Avenue in Scranton 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Last week we asked about the Al Young situation on Wyoming Avenue. And there is a garage the City had issued an emergency declaration . So per the OECD Director , Attorney O'Brien is still working to get a gentleman to allow the City access for demolition of the garage. The City has hired a contractor who has posted a bond and pulled permits. So that is the latest update that we have. I had also asked about the fund balance policy and the investment policies , some of the things that were recommended by the Pennsylvania Economy League under our Act 47 distressed City's designation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 The City did get back to us that they had finalized their drafts of the fund balance and investment policies . They're presently undergoing one last review by PFM which is the City's financial adviser . They should be forthcoming very soon in the form of ordinances . I also asked about City employees on workers ' compensation . DPW, there is 19 employees ; police department , 14; Fire Department , 13; and the Clerical Department there is one. The City's paving list is up on the City's website Scrantonpa .gov. I know there was question s about that. So if anybody would like to look at the list, it's pretty extensive . I spoke to Mr. Preambo recently and was told that that paving project is going to begin soon, very soon. One of the streets on there -- two of the streets on there that I was very pleased to see that we've gotten complaint s about numerous times over the last few years is Boulevard Avenue and Olyphant Avenue. So finally the City is doing something about those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 streets which are in terrible condition . And finally like my colleagues , I would want to wish everyone a happy Veterans Day, especially my dad, Jack Gaughan . He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. And the Marine Corps coincidently tomorrow is its 246th birthday . So I want to wish the Marine Corps a happy birthday and semper fi. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I was very pleased to see this legislation . I know that the neighbors up in this area and the members of the East Mountain Neighborhood Association had been looking for someone to occupy this beautiful building that they have at Robinson Park. And the Deutsch Institute is a perfect fit. As was mention ed tonight by several speakers , they do a phenomenal job in supporting our community here in the City of Scranton and in Lackawanna County. So I want to thank them. I think it's the perfect space for them. And also, this goes in conjunction with the fact that the City is trying to make a major investment in Robinson Park. Robinson Park is one of the most beautiful parks that we have here in the City of Scranton . The playground equipment is outdated. There needs to be several updates there. And I know that there is an effort underway through the East Mountain Neighborhood Association in conjunction and in partnership with the City to get the funds to do that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 And I think the addition of the Deutsch Institute just adds onto the great things that are happening up on East Mountain . Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I also want to add that I had heard about this some time ago from a board member who was interested in setting up a lease with the City for this property . And I am really happy to see this on our agenda tonight . I think it will be a great use for the space. And I think they have some good plans for renovations that I hope they could get the funding for and just really looking forward to it. I have to admit that I have not been up to the Robinson Park before, but I definitely have to make the trip. That's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'm thrilled to support this legislation . I was also in contact early on with a board member and thought the concept was great. I'm glad it's come to fruition . The Deutsch Institute is a fantastic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 organization . Over the years I had the pleasure of teaching cooking and baking classes for their disadvantaged clients at the Career Technology Center. They had seemed to have a great organization where they -- where they have people that do a lot the great things. I think this will be a great space for them to continue that work. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE CITY OF SCRANTON APPLICATION FOR A PEER GRANT FROM THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND (TPL) IN THE AMOUNT OF $10,000.00 FOR A PARKS/TRAILS ACCESSIBILITY STUDY AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, COORDINATE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 AND DISBURSE THE GRANT FUNDS AS APPROPRIATE . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm going to support this grant. It's a no-brainer. What we've seen over the last few years is another big investment into our park system. If there is one thing that the City of Scranton is I think known for, it's the fact that we do have a vast and wide arrange of parks throughout our neighborhood s, which is unique I think in some respects to the City of Scranton . We a have a lot of green space, a lot of playground equipment . There -- I think we have 30 -- over 30 parks. So this grant is going to study how we access our parks. As Miss Hodowanitz mentioned earlier tonight , the pedestrian safety, linking that to the heritage trail that we have which is an enormous asset here in the City of Scranton and in Lackawanna County. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 So I am very pleased. And I think this goes in hand-in-hand with the park study that McLane Associates is currently undertaking. And I think it will be completed very soon. And I think we need to continue to invest in our park system. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I'm also happy to see this piece being introduced tonight . It is -- it's really important for us to identify the areas that we need to improve in accessibility to our parks and trails because if those are barriers , we want people to be visiting and utilizing the parks as much as possible . And if they are not going because they don't feel safe in getting to the park, then that's -- that's an issue. And I think that this study will be helpful in identifying where we need to focus on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?
