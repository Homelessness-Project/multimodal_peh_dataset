CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Present . Here. Attorney Gilbride , will you give us an update, a reminder on our Council rules, please? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Just for the public, the agenda of the Scranton City Council meeting has been placed out on the table in the hallway for those who would like that. Also, I would just remind members of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 the citizenship that on the back are the guidelines for citizens participation at the Scranton City Council meetings . Please refresh your memory with regard to those in addressing Council . Thank you. MR. SMURL: All right. Thank you. There will be a motion this evening to suspend the rules and move Item 7-C -- or 5-C and 5-D to Seventh Order for final vote. 5-C is HARB's denial of the Certificate of Appropriateness for demolition of the Carriage House at 336 Moir Court. The University wants to go ahead with this project and it would require Council to suspend the rules and to vote so the University can go ahead with the demolition . 5-D is a cooperation agreement between the City of Scranton and Scranton Tomorrow to assist with downtown revitalization . Anyone who would like to speak on either of these pieces of legislation may do so in Fourth Order during Citizens Participation . Dispense with the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 3-A. OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY THE CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED APRIL 25, 2024 FOR YEAR TO DATE. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the third party order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: Mr. President , on Friday May 10th, there will be a dedication for the Oakmont Park which was just completed up on East Mountain . That will happen at 2 p.m. There will be a ribbon cutting . So we're excited about another park getting completed for the residents of our city. So that's all I have at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So the Lutheran Academy of Scranton which is on 1546 Monsey Avenue is having a Taco and Treats fundraiser. So if anybody is looking for fun and a delicious way to support Christian education , look no further at our upcoming Taco and Treats fundraiser . And that is all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? No one else. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I was very interested to learn about the shooting on the 1700 block of Pittston Avenue yesterday morning . I was very surprised that the newspaper has yet to cover it. And it will be in tomorrow 's edition , I think. At any rate, that's the fourth homicide in Scranton this year, okay, which is kind of remarkable because I could remember years when there weren't any homicides . One a month is really surprising and the uptick in gang activity . Now, I keep thinking back on a couple months ago when some of the backup documents for City Council and there was a mention of the police department being at 80 percent manning . And, you know, I'm thinking that doesn't sound very good if that's still the issue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Now, maybe we've recruited some, maybe classes have graduated and we're coming up to par. But I could recommend when you start having your budget discussions for 2025 and you have the various department heads come in for caucuses that you sit down and ask the Chief of Police the hard questions , does the budget provide him sufficient manning because this -- if this trend continues , we're going to be hurting . And I fully understand that if you have to increase the number of police officers that's adding money to the budget. But the priority is public safety and as well as the safety of our police department officers . So if this trend continues , I think you need to be asking those hard questions . I don't like this. This makes me feel very unsafe. I've never seen this in Scranton before in all my life and it's just not good. We would have more than four had Kyle Gilmartin not survived his shooting . It would have been five. So please think about that. Whatever we could do to increase the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 posture of the police department and the safety of the citizens , I think it would be worth every penny. If you want to save money on the budget, let's get rid of fraud, waste, and abuse; that will do it. The union contracts , firefighters ' 291 days since the arbitrator signed off on it. I'm sorry, 391 days and the police 276. So I'll be looking in the next few weeks to get a response to my right-to-know request for copies of those union contracts or hopefully an explanation of why they don't exist. And after that, I'm going to start asking, you know, what have you been paying since April 4th, 2023 for the firefighters ' contract and since July 28th, 2023 for the police since that's when the arbitrator signed off on his decision . Yesterday , I went to the meeting of the city's Environmental Advisory Council . It's only once every three or four months. The next one is on July 29th. I was the only person there from the general public. But that's going to be a very important board for the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 The issues they're going to be looking at and addressing are stormwater management , the walkability study, and all the upgrades to the downtown and the effect on the environment , climate change, and let's not forget Pennsylvania American Water's contribution of silt into the Lackawanna River. So people who are, you know, concerned about these issues, July 29th, 4 p.m., the Governor 's Room. And finally , the pocket park looks pretty, right across the street catty-corner from the Cathedral , beautiful green grass, tulips and daffodils or whatever you call those flowers . There are no benches . Are we getting benches for that? And are we going to have a grand opening? And can you give us some feedback on that because spring has sprung. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. MR. KING: Joan, we're going to be passing legislation this evening for Scranton Tomorrow applying for some grants to pay for benches for that park. MR. SMURL: Mark Cordelli . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. CORDELLI : Good evening , Mark Cordelli . I actually am the new Director for Community Relations of Lackawanna County. And the reason why I'm here is just to introduce myself, say hello and see how we could actually work together representing the Commissioners of Lackawanna County to again be a sounding board and see how we can help with any needs, opportunities , objections that you might have that we might work together and overcome . Also though, I'd like to share with everybody some opportunities that are going on in Lackawanna County. If I may present ? MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. CORDELLI : Okay. For example , anyone who knows somebody is a certified lifeguard , the four parks are looking for lifeguards. Starting salary is at $18 and supervisor pay is 21.50. And I'll leave these. I did talk to Mr. Voldenberg . We'll get these into your hands and post it and things like that. Electric City Trolly Museum is presenting Star Wars Day, Saturday , May 4th.

We have one year to gather a thousand pounds of plastic . So this is something that the county is doing, but also cities, municipalities , can take a part of this. If you are able to achieve over 1,000 pounds, the company Trex will provide a free bench made out of plastic . I thank you for your time. MR. MCANDREW : Mark, real quick. The lifeguard situation , last year I believe the county provided certification training and paid for it for prospective -- of applicants . Is that -- MR. CORDELLI : I'll have to check on that detail but I'll get back with you. Thank you -- tomorrow for sure. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Good. Thank you. MR. CORDELLI : Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : May I approach ? MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. SPINDLER : Les Spindler , city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 resident , homeowner , taxpayer . Before I speak about what I passed out, I just want to reiterate something that the Council many, many years ago tried to silence us and we brought in the ACLU because the United States Constitution supersedes any rules of Council . So we could get up here and say more or less anything . And we brought the ACLU when they tried to silence us years ago. And they squashed that right away. Okay, now, what I handed out was a letter I spoke about last week that I got from Berkheimer and -- a threatening letter. So I took it to my accountant . And what you see on the second page is a letter that he sent to Berkheimer saying that somebody that owns a rental property is not subject to a payroll preparation tax. I'm not writing a payroll . I have a rental property . And right now I'm not even collecting rent from it because my daughter lives there. But they said that anybody that has a rental property is not subject to payroll preparation taxes. So you people passed legislation that you don't even know what you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 passed. And Berkheimer doesn't know what they're doing because they even have my wife's maiden name on the letter. She hasn't used her maiden name in over 34 years since we're married . And the last page is another letter that I got the yesterday for 2023 after my account ant e-mailed a letter to them that people that have rental properties don't pay payroll preparation tax. We don't have people working for us. We don't make a payroll . It's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of. Berkheimer doesn't know what the heck they're doing. And you people passed this legislation . The three of you know who you are. And you better get it together because all you're doing is sticking it to the taxpayers . You want us to pay more taxes and more taxes. We're taxed beyond belief, especially people like myself that's retired and on a fixed income. We can't take anymore. And when you pass legislation , know what you're passing because like I -- all you're doing is sticking it to the taxpayers .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 We should not be getting letters like this. And my accountant said they got many other people coming and complaining . And I'm sure it's not only accountant people that are dealing with this. And I said today when I went over, I said, this is harassment. And he said, yeah, it is. So I'm going to talk to an attorney who deals with stuff like this. And if they tell me I have a case, I'm going to sue the three of you that passed this legislation and I'm going to sue Berkheimer . So you better start looking for an attorney . MR. SMURL: Derek Raines. MR. RAINES: Derek Raines, 919 Monroe Avenue, Scranton , lived here since January of 1988. During that time I've had the same problem for years and years. I've had stories done by the media. David DeCosmo came out and did a great story about the condoms and the feces and all the garbage that just floats down our street. But it just really has reached the point where it's so bad now my dirt coming in and out of my house is just pathetic . When -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 before we left today, it was just completely , Jill, you could show them those picture s if you want to see the flood of water in front of my driveway which we've complained about time and time again. I know Mr. Pietreface who I will call a liar did not do any of the stuff he said he would do. The people that worked with him did not do any of the stuff that they said they would do. They said they would get those holes patched on the corners . The bus stop is -- still has a big hole in it. That's got to be three years I've talked about that, no chance to get that stuff taken care of. And I just don't understand why the city cannot do that. But I'm complaining about my driveway . But what about this walkway here? All these people that work here have to realize how bad these roads are and it's just appalling . I can't see how much time I have left. So, Jill, can you hand me that sign? My wife is hiding it from me. So I'm going to hold it up so everybody could see it. Hopefully it's facing the right way. How about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the gentleman who lost his son, is he here? MR. MANCINI : Right here. MR. RAINES: I'm bringing this just for you, buddy. I want you to take this home and put it in front of your house. So, Jill, you could take this up to them. My -- when I started the Hill Neighborhood Association -- I didn't start it. But one of the things that -- the first things I did was a neighborhood crime watch. And we had a man by the name of Eddie Pisano who was the best DPW worker you guys ever had. He had -- if you wanted to get rid of stuff, he had all of these different containers . You had a water heater you had to get rid of, you could take it down and put it there. And they have all of that stuff that was there. And now our city doesn't care about that stuff. They don't care how we get rid of it so people just throw it in the alley. And who gets to pick it up, all of us. And it's awful. It's just awful. But the city needs to start getting people who follow through with everything that goes with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 it. But back to my problem now, the water was so deep today it's just appalling that I cannot drive my chair down my driveway because the incompetent engineers for the city just paved and paved and paved and they never milled the road to make the road level. It's just horrible . And it's entirely caused by incompetence of the employees who inspected it and did all of that. The water company , Dr. Jessica , she's talked to the water company . They're going to take care of all this stuff. The water company are still working on Myrtle Street. They've had so many water leaks on Myrtle Street now. I don't know what is going to happen with all of those things. But now we got rid of the storm drains. So all of that water now comes up into my driveway up into my -- basically into my house. And it's just appalling that a city this size cannot do something like that. I think if I worked in this building and I had friends come here and they had to drive through this horrible alley, I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 truly be ashamed that we have a Department of Public Works that allows things like that to happen here. It's just appalling . Oh, anybody have any questions ? Anybody have any questions about how to get a Hill Neighborhood Association or a neigborhood association going because we did it for years and years with Eddie Pisano. And we got all of that garbage out and it didn't cost us anything . Everything was gone. It's just too bad that we can't get Eddie Pisano to come back. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Raines, just to give you an update, I believe an email went to you recently regarding your block. Steve Oscellinski {phonetic }, the Senior Superintendant of Field Operations with the Pennsylvania American Water Company advised that he was able to secure funding to move the project forward in front of your house. He advised that the water company is presently working on the bid. They hope to start construction in May which tomorrow is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 May. He reiterated that he will -- there will be a joint project with city DPW related to the contour of the road and that Steve Teaman with DPW have been updated accordingly . Mr. Oscellinski and Steve will keep Council and the city informed on the progress . So that's an update, okay? MR. RAINES: Well, that would just be wonderful . Thank you so much and congratulations , Dr. Jessica . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Sherri Crowley (phonetic ). MS. CROWLEY : Hi, do you guys mind if I approach to give guys some paperwork from the shelter ? Hello, I'm Sherri Crowley . I work for Griffin Pond Animal Shelter . I'm the Development Director . We're at 967 Griffin Pond Road in South Abington Township . I'm coming to you today to raise awareness of some issues that are going on in the City of Scranton with animals . In 2022 we took in 411 animals and two of those animals were reclaimed and went back to their owners. In 2023 we took in 527 and two of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 those animals were reclaimed by their owners. So far in 2024 we've taken in 218 animals . Just last week we took in 10 dogs in one week from the City of Scranton . Fifty-six of those animals were reclaimed by their owners. But we call those repeat offender s. It's the same animal that, you know, is running loose, coming back to the shelter , running loose, coming back to the shelter . We just had an incident last week where a lady that lives in the City of Scranton dumped two Mastiffs in Newton Ransom. So we have an overpopulation of animal problems in this area and we need your help. We're seeing a surge in animal neglect , which is deeply distressing , hoarding cases which I'm sure you guys were aware of a hoarding case a couple months ago on Market Street. There were 40 some-odd cats and eight -- six or eight Pugs that we took in. At the shelter also we take care of 250 animals a day. It used to be only 200 animals . Now we're up to 250 that are residing in the shelter . And that's not animals , like, living 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 in a kennel. That's animals like living in an office, in a restroom , in a dish room, in the community room, like, there's just, like, no more space, you know, at all at the shelter . It also directly affects the workload of Scranton Animal Control because if we don't have available space and they have a situation , we can't take in any more animals. You build another shelter tomorrow and that shelter would be full in two weeks, absolutely full in two weeks. We're seeing more people breeding in the City of Scranton , breeding animals. And we're asking that possibly that you guys do a pause on breeding in the City of Scranton . Or if you're going to allow breeding that anybody that breeds an animal has to obtain a kennel license . We have dogs, you know, like literally just running around the streets. We really need your help. We're seeing people that live in low income housing that are only allowed one animal. And they end up with five and then they call us because they're in trouble with management or, you know, their cat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 had a litter of kittens so we're taking in another litter of kittens. Are you guys aware that we're losing a low cost spay and neuter clinic, mobile clinic here in the City of Scranton ? That goes away in June. So then, you know, we don't have a low cost spay and neuter clinic. I did speak to Marty Flynn. And Marty Flynn's going to look into some possibly , like, grant situation to maybe attract some veterinarians for this area. So I went to Humane Day yesterday in Harrisburg and I was able to sit down and speak with him for about 30 minutes. So maybe that will be something . City Council can play a crucial role in address ing these issues. You can consider writing ordinance s for the City of Scranton prohibiting breeding with animals within the City of Scranton . If you're going to allow breeding with animals, obtain a kennel license . Mabye you can mandate that animals be spade and neutered in the City of Scranton and that they be microchipped so that way we're not overcrowded and we could possibly get animals 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 back to their original owners, maybe some education in the City of Scranton . If you need my help, I'm available . We're just -- we're at our wits end and I'm sure your Scranton Animal Control officers are too. It's just really, really out of hand. Okay? Do you guys have any questions ? The pictures that I gave you, those are three dogs that came in in the last few months from the City of Scranton from neglect cases. All right. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Raymond Rodriguez . Raymond ? MR. MCANDREW : Raymond Rodriguez . MR. RODRIGUEZ : That's me. My hearing is acting up. I'm here in support of Mr. Derek. He's my neighbor . And I did a GPS search and I'm like six minutes away from President Biden's house. So I went there to compare it with our houses. And I didn't see any water accumulated there when it rains. And that's why I'm here to support him. I think it's a great city. I left my house in Florida to move up here. So that speaks for itself. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 And what's happening is, I took some pictures of it. I don't know if I -- I didn't -- this is my first time here. So I didn't know if I could present them or show them to anybody here. I sent picture s of his house also so that he would have something to show because as they say, a picture 's worth a thousand words. I'm an ex-veteran Marine. And I have a handicap sign put up at my house so I won't have to walk that much. And when I get all of this rain accumulated , the birds think it's a bath house there. And they come and swim in it and do everything in that water. And one of the worst things that happens is that when you come home with the groceries -- and I got the picture here, no matter which door of my car if something falls out of that car, it falls in that water. And that's one of the -- it's not as serious as shootings and all of that; but it is -- it's not a good thing, you know, when you have your food fall in the water there -- that dirty water that accumulates . I'm not here -- I know you got a lot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 on your plate. I'm not here to complain . I'm here to contribute to a solution . I'm here to help you because this is my city now, okay? So I go around. I drive a lot. And I see the good and the bad just like every other city. And I want to make the city that I'm going to live the rest of my life in, you know, look as nice as possible , contribute to it. So my way of dealing with a big mountain of problem is to tackle one sand -- grain of sand at a time. What I mean by that, I know you have a lot on your plate. And from what Derek told me, you know, he's been having this situation for at least two years now. And it's serious enough for us because as you could see, he's in a wheelchair and he has to get on the bus that takes him to his appointments and all of that. So, you know, the tires get wet and everything . My shoes are wet right now. You wouldn't believe it because I came home with groceries and it was raining. So that's how bad it is and plus what I mentioned before. So going back to the topic of not coming here to complain but to contribute and to help and to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 improve Scranton , if you don't have the time for these minor things, then by all means if you were to give me or us the authority to make a hole in there and make a drain for the water to have somewhere to go instead of waiting for the sun to come out and dry it out and the birds to drink it, I would gladly do so. You know, every time kids go by they're going to school, cars splash the water and the works. So this is my first time and I just want to see if somehow , you know, I could get some kind of permission . I'll make sure there is no wires, no nothing that if I drill a hole in there that would break or cause a shortage in the city or whatever . But I'll do it because , you know, you know what the Marine Corps is all about, we take care of business . So thank you for the time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. RODRIGUEZ : You're welcome to see the picture s I took if you would like. MR. SMURL: No, I believe you. But we are not really in a position to allow you to drill holes in the street or anything like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that. Perhaps go on the city's website and contact our DPW, just send them an e-mail and get an opinion from them. But as a Council , we cannot authorize anyone to put a hole in the street. MR. KING: And hopefully -- it sounds like we have a solution with Pennsylvania American Water combination of PAWC and the DPW is suppose d to be addressed within the next couple weeks. So hopefully we could get that resolved for both of you and the rest of your neighbor s. Thank you for coming this evening . MR. RODRIGUEZ : Okay, it would be very much appreciate d. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. MARQUISE : I like to sing a lot and stuff like that. But, yeah, my name is (inaudible ) Marquise . I'm a local activist slash musician . And I came here last year to speak about the homeless . Well, right now what I want to speak about is pretty much the air pollution in the city.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Like, the air is so polluted to the point to where as though, like, when you are walking outside you could barely breathe . And I think that has to do with, you know, like, the littering . The littering that goes on in the city, I have a solution for that. And the solution that I have is maybe we could possibly , we could possibly , like, raise up the fees of the fines. I don't know how much the fines are, but we can raise the fees of the fines to the point to whereas though these people could second guess literal ly -- littering , excuse me. I haven't public spoken in a minute. So I'm kind of nervous . But these people could public -- excuse me, these people could second guess littering . So we have to raise up the fees and the fines. I don't know how much the fines are. Does anyone know? MR. SCHUSTER : Not offhand . MR. MARQUISE : How much is the fine? MR. MCANDREW : I think it's 300. MR. MARQUISE : How much is the fine for littering is what I'm asking. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. MCANDREW : Three hundred , I believe . MR. MARQUISE : How much? MR. MCANDREW : Three hundred . MR. MARQUISE : Three hundred , so, like, why don't we raise it up to like a few more hundred , you know what I'm saying? Make the people second guess because I believe in, like, being a little bit firm; you know what I'm saying? That would make the people -- that would make the people stop littering . So what do you -- what do you guys think, like, when it comes to -- when it comes to littering and things of that nature? DR. ROTHCHILD : Some of it might be due to enforcement issues as opposed to the amount of the fine. MR. MARQUISE : Enforce the law? DR. ROTHCHILD : It might need to be better enforced . MR. MARQUISE : But that doesn't really stop anything . That doesn't change anything ; you know what I'm saying? So, like, you could enforce the law; but the city is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 dirty as ever, you know what I'm saying? So what I'm saying is, like, raise up the fees of the fines and that will make somebody second guess throwing anything on the ground. Let's say if you raised the fines up to like $900 or something like that, ain't nobody going to want to throw something on the ground if you got to pay $900. Now, if you can't afford that and you don't pay the fine, then you have to go to jail. Do you really want to go to jail for littering in the city? I mean, it's an honest question . It's something that people should really think about. That's what I think. So what do you guys think about it, like, what do you guys think? What is your opinion ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, if it's not being enforced say 300 -- and that's just a number that I thought I remember ed. It's not being enforce d at 300, it's not going to be enforced at 900. I believe the people should pick up their own garbage and not litter. MR. MARQUISE : That's true. MR. MCANDREW : That's where it should start.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. MARQUISE : That's true. That's true. But how do we get them to do that? So what do we do? How do we get them to do that? We could -- I mean, we can do -- we can do recycling . We could do recycling . We could get people to do community service or something like that. But that's hard to, like, get -- that's hard to organize the community in that way, you know what I'm saying? So I'm just figuring this out as I go. You know, I really don't know. But I really felt like doing that with the fines was a good idea. I really did, you know what I'm saying, to raise up the fines. I don't see nothing wrong with that because any otherwise -- if you think about it, any otherwise why do we have -- why do we have fines? MR. SMURL: Please go back to the microphone . MR. MARQUISE : Why do we have fines if -- you're saying that doesn't matter. We have to instill the laws and this and that. So what is the fines there for anyway if that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 doesn't make a difference ? Are you understanding what I'm saying? Because -- MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I understand . MR. KING: I think we do understand . What we said it needs to be enforce d. So perhaps we need to look at our enforcement of the litter laws before we go changing the fines. So maybe if we start actually -- I'd be interested in knowing and maybe we could check with the city, find out how many fines we've had recently for people who have littered . MR. MARQUISE : People don't care. That's the thing. MR. KING: What? You just asked a question , I'm answering it. So I'd like to find out how many fines have been issued. And from there, then I'd be willing to say, okay, obviously it's not working. We either need to raise the fine or we need to start enforcing it more. Thank you. MR. MARQUISE : So you want to start where? Could you repeat that? I'm sorry. MR. KING: I said I want to look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 into finding out through our police law enforcement , find out how many fines have been issued for littering and see where we're at. MR. MARQUISE : Are they even given out fines for the littering. MR. KING: Exactly . I want to see if it's being enforced . MR. MARQUISE : So what happens if they're not? What are you going to do about it? MR. KING: Well, then I think it's time for us to meet with the city police and find out why that's not being enforced . MR. MARQUISE : Got you. DR. ROTHCHILD : And we could confirm the correct amount for the fines. But I think $300 if that is the case, that's already a pretty hefty fine. So if that's not dissuading people -- MR. MARQUISE : People don't even like -- people don't even give out fines for littering anymore . Like, why is the city so dirty? MR. SMURL: Okay. Sir, thank you. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka , AFG Media. Good evening . Let me take you back to last Wednesday . I'm entering the building . I noticed bags of shredded paper put for pickup in a blue recycling can. The shredded papers were on top of five red recycle tote, one marked HR and a copy paper box. I thought nothing of it, went into this Council ing session . I'm leaving after a brief conversation with other attendees in Dix Court. I was once again drawn to an uncovered box that had shred 2033 on its side. After others departed I went up and I looked over the uncovered edge of the box. It contained employee files. These were not old as I verified . The date on the front of the entry was from 2023. I'm well aware that Scranton has a record retention policy of three years. But this was not even a year old. And worse, the entire copy paper box contained employees and other sensitive files. I was not sure what to do. First I tried to contact DPW to verify or to get an emergency pickup, dialled DPW dispatch and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 selected one and it went right to no one's home. I did that three or four times with no response . I managed to catch a Council member who stopped in HR to make a few phone calls but got the same no answer. This was an administrative issue and not a legislative one and they went off. For the next hour and a half I pondered what was the best action to take as City Hall was closed. I stopped one of the firemen and they said DPW would be around in the morning to pick them up, not wanting to leave files because of the personal information inside, I drove to the Scranton Police Department and asked for a car so that they could take possession until proper disposal could be done. The car arrived , asked how I knew if the files were sensitive ; and I explained . And he took a look over the top of the box with his flashlight . After a brief period he said, well, they were disposed of. I could take them. As it is obviously I'm not looking -- as obviously since I went to the police, I was not looking to use them for identity theft.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 He tried DPW. And after 20 minutes I guess a police supervisor got back to him. It was decided after I had a glance into the boxes that we took the unshredded HR files and put them back into City Hall as the police officer opened the door. We took five totes and one two-third full blue recycle container back inside the building . So we have four scenarios , all bad. HR can't tell shred 2023 from 2033 or they left them out and accessible near the trash for anyone to pick up and that's how they got out to the curb or they decided shredding was too labor intensive or they were intentionally destroying records before the mandatory three year period. What was inside? Employee files containing names, addresses , phone numbers , birthdays , Social Security numbers . They even had an emergency contact numbers exposing those people and addresses on those documents . If you had a wage garnish from the city, that was in there. With no way of knowing how long they were out and who saw them, these people have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 right to know that their data was breached . There were also contractors info, condemnation letters from Licensing and Inspections and court files. All of this information has been exposed . I will not do anything with it. But as anyone who may have been outside and passed for the over five hours that it was exposed , we have no idea. On coming to this meeting I was served by the City's Law Department . The City's Law Department has just admitted that I took pictures of confidential documents . These documents were left with the trash outside of City Hall in the court itself. They're open season. I did not touch any of the boxes until the police officer that I went to get from the police station came up here to secure it. Now the city wants to come in and wants from this media association , all copies of documents , paperwork , and assurances that I deleted everything to cover their putting confidential personnel files out in the trash unshredded . It's a shame and it's wrong. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: On the littering thing, I think if you just make a -- legislate a million dollar fine. You see somebody littering, that's it; and the police officer should be able to collect it. I'd like to see some legislation to take down the Biden Street signs. Can you give me an idea how I would do legislation like that because it's just not right that we have Biden Street signs. I know it's a touchy feely thing. It's his hometown, but he's opened our border. He's ruining our country and people have to connect the dots and it just makes -- it's just a finger in the eye to see that on Spruce Street. About the papers, I was recently evicted from Scranton Housing Authority in the court system. And it was completely unfair because people don't understand what the court system is. They don't even understand what law enforcement is. I hear, you know, the police are going after the homeless and everything . But, you know, after I -- it almost killed me being homeless . I lost most of my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 property . And then I'm trying to find a place to live. I mean, I was fighting four years with these people because I knew that -- because I took the time to learn Pennsylvania law and then when I realized that's completely -- they're not going by the law. They're going by their own little process . And I'm an outside r. I don't fit into that thing. So I started , you know, had to study federal law. They don't know anything about federal law. But there's no housing here. There's no housing . I got people at the northeastern -- or the neighborhood center. It's so confusing because there's a million places called neighborhood this, neighborhood that. I finally found a neighborhood place and I made, you know, I had a few appointments . But I'm trying to get into the Finch Tower. And I couldn't believe the sign I saw on the door of the manager of Finch Tower. It's this paper for -- you have to -- they have to pay a caregiver license . And I -- all these licenses , I mean, you have to have a rental license according to the law 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 in order to rent. But there's no rental licenses for Scranton Housing Authority . But there should be because it's in the lease that they made in 1996. And that's where the problem started . Scranton Housing was a great place. But ever since then that's about the year that Judge Farrell -- and the courts are just rubber stamps. This is HUD. But they're not HUD. They're not following the HUD rules whatsoever . And what was crazy is, like, you need a Certificate of Homelessness . What? You know? And this is what you have to get for them to start to help you. And you go to Catholic Social Services and CIC for the daytime thing. And I even went to Keystone Mission which is sort of an outsider thing. But there's no housing . And there has to be some responsibility to find out what's going on in Scranton Housing Authority , who works there, what people are in there because I could promise you the building has been cleared out several times over in the time I've lived there and new people come in. And I found out that, yeah, these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 are the CIC workers . They're working for Matt Cartwright's office, you know, and then they get free housing . I'm out on the street after fighting for four years. And I get Catholic Social Services . They're flying people in. They're bussing people in because this is a sanctuary city, you know, it's -- that's what really messes my mind with Biden Street because , I mean, this is treason. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . First, I would like to know how many of the Meadow Brook easements have been obtained . Have they all -- are they ready to go to work? MR. SMURL: All of them, I don't believe they have. Have we gotten an updated list, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we haven't. I spoke with Attorney Boyd Hughes today. And he's moving rapidly on securing them. MR. SMURL: We don't have a total right now. We don't have a total right now. MS. SCHUMACHER : Could you have it next week? MR. SMURL: I'm sorry?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MS. SCHUMACHER : Could you have it next week and the start for the project ? MR. SMURL: We'll try. MR. SCHUSTER : Frank, do you know offhand how long Mr. Hughes has been contract ed with the city? MR. VOLDENBERG : Approximately two months. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so he's been here two months. I mean, I can't say how much has been done at this point in time. We haven't had an update. But he's only been here two months. MR. VOLDENBERG : He does have all the paperwork in line though. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank. MS. SCHUMACHER : Next, I'd like to know why can't one of you or all of you get those contracts that Joan is talking about so that they can be available to any person in the city who would like to read those? MR. SMURL: We are working on it. And our attorney is also working on it with the City Law Department . MS. SCHUMACHER : What needs to be -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 I don't understand what needs to be worked on. I would think if a City Council person asks for that, they would hand it over right then. What do you have to do to get it? MR. SMURL: They are working on that process right -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Who is they? MR. SMURL: I just said our attorney and our law department , the City Law Department . MS. SCHUMACHER : That is terrible . Would you tell me what the cost of that pocket park at the corner of Linden and Wyoming has cost us from the beginning ? MR. SMURL: Linden and Wyoming , I don't believe -- Mr. Voldenberg , do we have a contract for that or was that a pure city project or was it -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I could find that information out for Miss Schumacher . MR. KING: I think it was a combination of funding. So if you could find out what the total cost is and where the funding sources came, that would be greatly appreciate d. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. VOLDENBERG : I could get that tomorrow . MS. SCHUMACHER : While we're thinking about what things look like, that wall that is between the Lackawanna -- on Lackawanna Avenue between Adams Avenue and the Radison Hotel is terrible . It needs to be knocked down and redone. And it just really hurts when you pick up the paper and you see what's going to be painted on the tunnel going out to South Side. Now, what is more important , a mural or that wall? MR. KING: Marie, I just recently saw from the engineer the drawing s and the plans that have already been developed for that wall that's going to be replaced. First of all, there's that wall that kind of leads up the ramp. That's going to be actually restored to what it originally looked like. It's going to look really nice architecturally and the other wall is also scheduled . We have funding to get that repaired as well. So that is on the docket. MS. SCHUMACHER : And what's the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 timing for that; do you know? MR. KING: I'm hoping that that's going to begin this summer. But I'll try to get -- Frank, if you could get a timeline on that for us? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And would you please report to us next week the number of employees who were -- received some kind of issue for putting out those confidential paperwork that Tom talked about? MR. SMURL: Do you want to know who put them out? MS. SCHUMACHER : I want to know what -- if anybody -- if the people who put them out were -- MR. SCHUSTER : If there was any repercussion s. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. SCHUSTER : If there was any repercussions or reprimand? MS. SCHUMACHER : I still didn't get it. MR. SCHUSTER : If there was any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 repercussions or reprimands , is that what you're asking? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. Yeah, I think we deserve to know that people are -- have a reason to not do that again. Thank you. MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta . It's been brought to the attention of our group there's a Case skid loader manufactured by Case if anyone can recall. This piece of machinery may have been park or recreation 's. And it may have been donated to the Rec Authority . If that's the case, why not just give that to the DPW and DPW can use this piece of equipment ? Before anything is donated , shouldn 't it and doesn't it have to be approved by City Council ? If so, does anyone remember this donation -- the Case skid loader? Do we know which of the many director s that may have been involved in this? Mr. Smurl, this is the Case loader that you've been riding on that you frequently use up at the park. That's the one in question , sir. Can you tell us where the piece of machinery is stored and whose house it's at, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 who maintain s it? And if anyone is injured , who's insuring that vehicle or piece of equipment ? Is the city liable for that? Are there any records for this vehicle , piece of machinery ? We didn't forget about the power washer issue now, did we? It's a Case skid loader and it's been used up at Nay Aug Park. And, Mr. Smurl, you've been a driver of it recently . MR. SMURL: I've been driving it for five years. MR. ARGENTA : You could answer after this. There's no secret that the police are under attack and the youth violence is high, no secret to that. Business es and citizens support and offer their help to local law enforcement and the police who are under attack daily. You would think we would all be on the same page -- you would think anyway. You would think that the non-profits that are concerned with youth would also agree and contribute in a positive way to law enforcement and to our community . Well, this particular 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 organization has contributed . They had made a request that the police are not welcome on this particular high profile neighborhood corner, the property . It's a high visible intersection . That's okay. It's their property . Let's start {inaudible } the 501Cs. It's sad when people are getting money from us and we're giving things away and they don't support our police who are under attack day in and day out. Did you see what happened in North Carolina ? These are the guys that are out there taking care of the things that we fear. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? Sir, you're finished . You're finished. You already had your time. You're finished . Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer , and nobody special but I am here. We need to hang a sign on that railing over there that it's not a footstool. It's probably 150 years old. Getting started , people should be copiously awarded for cleanup projects , especially if it's at the hands of the citizens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 and they're donating their time. Try to keep track of it and give them a little plaque or reward. And there's nothing wrong with that at all. Now, the landfill once again, we better jump on that leachate problem because they're looking to pollute the hell out of the Nay Aug gorge. And the utility bills, I don't know if you had a chance to check that, Mr. King. But I have a utility bill where the delivery service exceeds what I use. And I hope that's not for the whole summer because then I'm out a couple hundred dollars . It seems like they've dumped so much on these different bills, insurance and utility . And, of course, it's all the essentials . That's what's causing the problem . That's why people at the bottom are so fired up. And by the way, I don't believe in fixed income arguments . I asked the boss for a raise back in I think it was '86. And you know what he asked me? Isn't your wife working? I mean, give me a break. I quit the job shortly thereafter . I mean, it was just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 disgusting . Now, I started talking about a news article here last week. And it's here. It's there. It's everywhere. As far as I know, we don't have a planned parenthood agency in town. But before a doctor takes care of a woman in the middle of a crisis with -- say like anything to do with pregnancy , miscarriage or whatever , he has to call his lawyer. And these hospitals have teams of lawyers that will not let them work until it's critical . I mean, there's no hope in the case of a miscarriage . And our Supreme Court seems to think that they should turn contraception back to the states on top of it. What kind of idiot wants to have a woman -- a young woman that doesn't have the price of yesterday 's paper pregnant just laid off. You know, we have protest ers down there thanks to our 501C3s. And if they want to stick their nose that far in our society , that's great. But then individually they should be taxed, not everybody . But it's time to pay taxes. If I want to give any of you people $20, there was a time when I had to earn 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 30 because my tax rate was 30 percent . I had to earn 30 bucks just to hand you 20. And they take their money in and whatever they have or get their little groups going and they're a great machine . But these women are really hours away from even possibly dying and it destroys their organs. It's unGodly to think that somebody could be that stupid to think that something like this is okay. It's not. It's not and we have to do better and some people just don't care. They just want to create a crisis in people's lives to make them miserable . Thank you and have a good night. MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I don't know where to start. We sit here week after week and we have residents pour our hearts out on things that are of a concern to us. Recently we had the people here that were concerned about the homelessness . I went to a seminar at the University of Scranton on the homelessness situation here in Scranton . It was very informative . So we have the issue of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 homelessness . We have the issue of gang violence . And as I sit and I think when are we as citizens of Scranton going to be given an update? How do we find out how the city is doing and what are they doing to help us with the situation ? As a person spoke here earlier about the situation over in South Side, we have two different things. We have domestic violence , which I'm not not sure the police department can really do anything about domestic violence . But as far as the gang situation , yes, we could help. We could do and we must do something . We cannot shelter ourselves and go into our homes and say that we're just going to turn the streets over to the gang members . We have to be active. We have to get out there. We have to help. But I still don't know how and where to help. I still don't know -- and I'm not sure maybe citizens know exactly the advancement that's being made. I did read the post that the School District put up that they're concerned and they want police protect ion for the student s at West Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 High School and for the Memorial Stadium area. Is that how we're going to learn what's going on in the city as to what's a concern as far as gang violence is concerned ? I just feel that we as citizens of Scranton should get some kind of an update at least monthly as to what's going on. Are there meetings being held? Is any advancement being made at all? I'm not sure how -- the rules behind getting a gun. If someone was to say to me right now, Norma Jeffries , go out and buy a gun, I don't even know where to start. So, you know, what are the rules? Are the rules being broken as these individuals go out and buy guns? I don't know because , like I said, I wouldn't even begin to know how to go and buy a gun. But I just think that we need to know more about that. And, of course, when Tom Coyne was up here talking about the papers that he found out there, my HR hat went on. I think you all know that I was an HR general ist. I was, you know, I did all kinds of things in HR. So my HR hat went on as I heard that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 And I thought , oh, wow, sensitive data that's out there. That's one of the things that you as an HR person should take very, very seriously when you are dealing with someone 's personal information . So I'm not sure does -- whoever did it doesn't really matter. What matters is, is the city going to take those names and get their names and their individual information protected ? Are they going to be given Experian or whoever the credit bureaus are out there to watch their credit history over this next -- I know that's what we get when I think the last one I got was Discover Card. I think their database was jeopardized and I got, you know, something in the mail saying that they were going to watch my credit or something . But something needs to be done. You know, and I'm not sure -- I think each one of you individually have a responsibility and you oversee the different functions of the city. I'm not sure which one of you oversee the administration . But I think that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 they need to be watched . The first thing I thought was I do have the handbook. And I thought let me go scan that handbook and see just what is in there when someone violates things in that handbook that they should be suspend ed? Is that what the handbook says? I'm not sure. But I will be looking at the handbook just to see what it says. And I'm just hoping going forward that we -- the citizens of Scranton can get an update. I won't even mention the street signs $330,000 that's out there. I just hope it's not going for something and I don't see -- not just me. I don't just like to say I. It's the citizens of Scranton to see an improvement in our street signs. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the HR Department and the Business Administrator just to see, I mean, we don't need any name of individual s that were involved here but what actions have been taken to protect our employee s' identities if we could get some kind of update from HR or the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 administration as to what actions have been taken since this incident has occurred . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , City Council , Mike Mancini , resident of the City of Scranton . It happened yet again. Every single week I come up here I talk about safety, the importance of safety, getting to know our neighbors again and understanding what's ahead of us with a railway system in the not so distant future. As we move ahead we have to strive to put ourselves in the right direction as one person. I identified a problem and that was canines . You know, we are supposed to have four that could hit on drugs and guns. And we're going to be down to one. Come Thursday I'm going to be meeting with Chief Carroll along with Shadow Romano and and Ed Adams, a breeder and trainer . Hopefully he accepts Honor and Justice that were named by Mary Wilding . What great names. We're hoping for a third. I'd like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 to name that Gil after Detective Gilmartin . These are tough animals . They are strong just like our police officers . They will complement each other. One thing we have to do is we have to complement the police department because they are short-staffed , all right. Incidents like this happen far too often. Frequency is out of control . The type of calls that we get become more severe. These are just the ones that we hear about. As a citizen here in the City of Scranton growing up in West Scranton , you know, you grow up strong. You grow up with your convictions and you become a better person, you know, other kids toughen you up. I have never in my years expected to see anything remotely close to this. Four people died in the last four months. You know, and I have to look at it from the other side of it because there's people that have been impacted on a daily basis losing a family member. We almost lost a police officer . I heard those shots, 13, 14 in a matter of four or five seconds not knowing , the first one to pray, the first one to call 911. Thank God 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 that prayers do work, was the first one to pray throughout region. And in return, we have the bravest police officer on our police department . We have many others that you don't even know just like Detective Gilmartin ready to knuckle up on a daily basis for our city. I want to thank, Mr. Raines, for this sign. Signs are one thing. Signs are changing . Calls are changing . We need to change. We need to knuckle up as citizen s and we need to take our streets back. In the Hill Section I would hope that you get ahold of Mr. Raines. Let him be your point person. He's got a great amount of experience . And speaking with Senator Flynn once we get West Scranton up and running , I'm assured by him that he will do whatever he can to help our community , help West Scranton and other communities just like that Hill Section , Green Ridge, North Scranton , South Side, West Side the five families . We have been here forever . These gangs have been here since, what, I think 2008 was the first sign of it. And over the years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 it's just gotten worse. Well, it's about time that we knuckle up and we fight against this. You know, I would hope that the Mayor would have addressed this issue by now. Remaining quiet doesn't make the problem go away. You know, now is the time where you need a leader to step forward . And I don't think we really have that procrastination Paige has done nothing for us. Instead of rectifying the situation , we as citizen s get rectumfied on a daily basis. When you have somebody from out of town, with out-of-town money, you get out of town problems . So this is a problem that we have to handle internally . If you want to get involved , if you want to make a difference , join a neighborhood crime watch. And prayers again and thank you to the Scranton Police Department . Good evening , City Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments , I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 going to ask Attorney Gilbride if he could reach out to the city administration and ask them, number one, if they could kind of look into the situation , investigation , whatever , to find out exactly what happened with the HR records . That's pretty serious situation where you have people's HR files left out on the corner in boxes like that. So, number one, I would like that. Number two, if we could set up an executive session to discuss the situation with Council in the near future. Number two, I know that we talked about having a caucus concerning the homeless situation . We were trying to coordinate with a woman. I'm just wondering where we are with that and when we could possibly jump on that issue and have a public caucus dealing with the homeless situation . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into that, Mr. King. MR. KING: If you could. Also in terms of the police, I recently had a conversation with our police chief concerning the issue of understaffing . And he indicated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 to me that they are actually about five to seven officers shy of a full complement . But unfortunately , there is about 20 or 22 that are on comp which makes it, you know, a bit challenging . So they are -- it's the truth. They are operating around 80 percent . The comp part makes it difficult and challenging . They are still five to seven shy of a full complement . I think 147 is the number. So that makes it tough on the rest of our police officers who are out there, you know, trying to fight for our safety. And as always, we appreciate what Scranton Police Department does to protect all of us in this city. Next, if I could get an update on that castle house located in the Green Ridge section . Is that on Richmont or is it -- MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MR. KING: Which one -- the one on Richmont . If we could get an update, I had a citizen reach out to me today that lives near there just wondering . I thought that most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 recently the judge ordered that it needed to either be sold or demolished . MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , Mr. King. MR. KING: Okay. Just if we could find out -- if we could reach out to Solicitor Jessica Eskra and find out where we're at with that. That's been a long time that castle house. That's been a battle back and forth for years. I think the neighbors deserve some resolution to that, if possible . And the last thing is the Davis Trail at Nay Aug Park, the Davis Trail if you go from the greenhouse and travel down along -- I guess it would be the upper part of the gorge working toward the gorge, that is completely deteriorated . I know I brought this up probably eight to ten months ago. I'm asking to see if we could reach out to Parks and Rec and see what could be done to help remediate that situation up at the Nay Aug Park. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: And I think that's all I have at this time. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few comments . First, I'd like to thank DPW on some of the recent cleanups they've been doing. I know a lot of hard work is going into that. I saw recently they were behind the car wash on I think 7th Avenue. So it looked like a lot of debris was back in that area. Last week, we got an answer about parks as I met with some of the neighborhood s in our city that have parks within the neighborhood . They stated to me that they were concerned about the fences not being locked. We did reach out to the administration , ask about what's going to occur. And we were told specifically Weston Field wouldn't be locked in case emergency vehicles had to get in there. I asked if we could get a deeper dive on that, maybe look at some of the parks specific ally. I know we do have -- recently we've hired an assistant parks director . So I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 with our current parks director and his assistant , we should be able to get some kind of answer if we could reach out to the Parks Department , Mr. Voldenberg , and see if maybe more specific ally individual ized, you know, plans could be had for monitoring and keeping these parks safe after dusk. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did include that in last week's question s but we have yet to get an answer, but I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. The recycling calendar , if we could possibly reach out also to recycling or refuse and see if we're going to get a recycling calendar out as it is now in May. We have May and June left on our six month calendar , so just making sure that they are ready to go with the next six months as we move forward with the year. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll secure it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Last week I asked for -- I actually did two things. I put in a right to know about pave cuts and what we're getting in receivables for pave cuts over the last few years. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 I know I'm waiting on a response there and I got a response to my right to know saying that we didn't have adequate staffing to get me that information . But as of right now, Frank, we're not in receipt of any information on pave cuts that I asked. MR. VOLDENBERG : We have not. MR. SCHUSTER : Could we ask if we have an active pave cut inspector while we're waiting on that other information ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We don't at the current time. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : But I'll find out when. MR. SCHUSTER : Other than that, I know zoning -- I've attended some of the recent Zoning Board meetings. And I know at those meetings they've expressed that we may have to take a deeper dive into our recent zoning ordinance as they have been encounter ing some concern s that they have. So I think a conversation with them in the near future could help with some -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 alleviate some of that. But other than that, that's all I have for tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I have quite a few that I'll try to get through quickly . First off, I just wanted to touch on some of the updates and issues with the homeless population . So Councilman Smurl and myself, we went along with Jennifer Reed who's been here before to speak and wanted to have a group of -- I think they said maybe 70 people who take different nights during the week and contribute food and different supplies for the homeless . So we had the opportunity to go along with them to several locations where they gave out meals to the homeless and then offered many different supplies to be able to help them. And we had some great conversations with them about what some of the more immediate needs or concerns were and if there is anything that we could address at least immediately for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 them. So we're going to continue to do that. I plan on going out with them again this week and doing whatever we can on our end to help. And in addition to that, the unsheltered task force that the city has, I requested to be a part of that committee . And I'll provide updates through Council based on that. They're going to have a meeting in few weeks. I believe May 17th is the next date for a meeting that they're holding . And the NEPA Youth Homeless Shelter , they had a fund-raiser on Friday at Vidoo that I attended . And it was very well-attended. And it was great to see a lot of support for their organization and what they're doing and Andrew Cutillo wasn't too bad on the guitar either. We enjoyed listening to his music. And Mr. Raines had come again and I appreciate you coming. And I try not to respond and take up time during citizens participation . So I just wanted to respond here. And I know that Councilman King had brought up the e-mail that we received and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 latest updates . But originally I think they said they were going to try to get to it in the fall of 2023 but it might get pushed to 2024 and it depended on funding . And I think it's been like the same story. So then I didn't see it on the list that we received maybe a couple months ago from them. And I said, what's happening ? Why is it not on the spring list for Pennsylvania American Water? And it was -- they said, oh, this is for 2025. And I said, No, it's not. This is -- this needs to happen. So we have been working with them and pushing them to make sure that it gets done and, you know, latest we heard was May. So we're going to continue to stay on top of them and make sure that this gets done because they have to do their side of it first -- their work before DPW can then do the rest of it. So we'll make sure we keep our end of the bargain here and get the roadwork done. I know you've heard it before and you've been waiting , waiting , waiting . It's the same situation with some of the other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 streets. So there is another street that I took note of that we'd receive d a complaint about quite a while ago. And, you know, we were trying to get on the DPW list and then American Water said, no, this is going to be a project of ours. And I thought it was supposed to be this year and now it's another one that was pushed to next year. And that's the 600 block of North Webster . So we're trying our best but continue to bring these streets to our attention so that we can work to get them done as as soon as possible . And we receive d a complaint about Vine and Clay, a property on the corner there that was sent over to SPD and code enforcement . There were parties being held there and it was, like, an unoccupied residence . And I think University of Scranton student s might have been using that to their advantage . So they said that they would visit the property . I did request a further update on that if they did find that there are parties going on or, you know, what's going on with the property at this point. So once I receive an update I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 provide that. I also requested an update on the 400 block of Prescott Avenue. There's a property that had a fire that was supposed to be demolished . At first it was going to be renovated and then it was going on the demo list. I didn't hear anything back on that if we could check in again on that, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And another property that is on the demo list but some of the neighbors are patient ly awaiting that to occur is on Cottage Avenue. So we know that I brought that property up many, many times. I just want to see if maybe there's a date for that demolition . They just want to make sure that it's actually happening . MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . 1068 Cottage is finally on the list. So I'll get a date. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Excellent . I did -- I believe last week I requested an update on issues of gun violence and gang 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 activity within the city and was hoping that Chief Carroll would be able to come in for a caucus. I've also arrange d a meeting with him to get a further update and, you know, hopefully get a date for him to be able to come in and have more of a discussion of where we're at with that at least from the SPD perspective and what we could do further . That is all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a couple. So I took a quick look at the code regarding littering and fines. All right. And there's a couple different levels when it comes to fines for littering . I guess, you know, if you just throw something on the street it's $50 bucks. If you throw something from a vehicle it could be up to 100 and illegal dumping is 300. Maybe that's what resinated with me. But there's fines. They're on the website . If you're not sure where to look, just take a look at the code. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 Secondly , so I agree with Mrs. Jeffries and Mr. Coyne, you know, the issues related to identity theft. Someone has to be held responsible for this. We're all responsibile for our everyday lives. And at work, we all work. Wherever we work we're responsibile . And this -- this isn't a good one. These documents laid out there for hours and it doesn't matter whether they are current or former employees , their identity -- their information should be protected . So and I also concur with my two Council men to the right of me. Something has to be done to protect these people. It should have started already . It shouldn 't take this forum to get something started in HR to protect these employees ' identities or Social Security numbers or any other pertinent information that could be out /there now. So, I don't -- I really don't want to hear, oh, we're looking into it. I don't want to hear that. I hope it started already . I hope these -- because the files came back. They were brought back. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Hopefully all of them were brought back to this building . Who knows. They were sitting out there for a couple hours. But the files that were brought back and the files of the persons that were in that box, I hope that HR already started something to protect these employees ' past or present information . I'll be very disappoint ed if nothing has started yet. Secondly , so maybe a month ago I brought up -- and actually a couple speakers brought up a very unsafe situation on 12th Avenue, 511-513 12th Avenue. There's a huge hole in the ground and I mean huge. I could get in it. And I'm not the smallest guy in the room, right? So we wanted to determine either from code enforcement or the water company who's responsibile for this hole. And I guess what has been determined that it's the resident that lives at this property , right, so that was March 27th a stop work order was put on this property . And they have 30 days, you know, and they were fined a hundred bucks and 30 days to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 rectify this. So guess what, I drove by it today. And I talked to a couple people over the weekend that actually came up to me, Mark, that hole's still there. So it's right up the side street we call West Side hill near the school when I was growing up. And this hole -- when I tell you it's huge and deep, just think about by accident someone falling in the hole or, you know, two kids on their way home from school you know how kids could be maybe pushing either or screwing around. Someone gets in that hole and gets hurt, who's responsible ? I'm starting to feel responsibile because I brought this up three times, right, so could you please reach out to code enforcement ? You know, it's past the 30 days obviously or very close to it to see what action's been taken. Fill the hole. You know, if even if DPW has to fill the hole I'm okay with that. Maybe it's not protocol , but this is a very unsafe situation that needs to be rectified . And I don't want to hear, oh, we gave another fine and it's another 30 days. That's unacceptable because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 the fines say we'll continue to increase daily and reach 2,000. I doubt that happened . So this has to be -- the hole has to be filled by somebody or some entity. All right. So also, you know, I brought this subject up months ago. And it's regarding people doing construction work without permits on the weekend . And we're told that's the way to go. No one bothers you. You want to get a roof on, have them put it on the weekend . You want gutters , have them done on the weekend . You don't need a permit. No one's watching . So that was a concern . And you know what -- and I actually drove around and saw this happening . And I brought it up at a meeting and I think the response was we're looking into that. It might be a contractual issue. But guess what, it continuous . We're losing revenue , number one. We don't know how safe these operators are that are putting roofs on or gutters on or doing construction . So I hate to have to -- can we please revisit this with code enforcement or administration , get an update as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 what -- we never got an update. So let's see if they're still looking into it because these people are breaking the law. MR. KING: Mr. McAndrew , maybe we could recommend if code enforcement can alternate weekend s so that we get some people working on the weekend . MR. MCANDREW : Or rotate a schedule , I don't care. It's not -- you know, they were suppose d to figure that out and haven't by now obviously because we didn't get a -- it's a great idea, Mr. King. You know, maybe some people want to get some overtime . And it's justified if they are going to, you know, get revenue from -- revenue from this. But it continues . And so if it continues it's still a problem and the problem hasn't been fixed. So please let's, you know, get some information on that or a final answer on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then resident s up on the East Mountain reached out to me over the weekend . There was some issues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 with water pressure. It dropped consider ably over the weekend . There was a broken main, pipe separation , leaking hydrant , etc. Normally I -- I don't know about all of you, but I get an alert if there's an issue like that in my neighborhood or my address . And I appreciate it. But I guess the resident s up there have not. And, you know, they even spoke to a firefighter who was at Gerrity 's up in that area and they're like, you know, we got an issue with a fire with this pressure not knowing and not being alerted by. So, you know, this resident is right. You know, our water bills and our sewer bills are ridiculously high. They're trying to do an increase . And, you know, they have should have been notified , one. And number two, they said there is no number to reach anybody locally anymore. So can we just reach out -- I know we've been in contact with the water company as they're working downtown . And they have been very responsive to, you know, our inquiries and updates with the work being done downtown . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 Whoever you spoke to with regard to that, could you reach out to them and say, you know, we got a section of the city maybe they're not getting the alerts that they are suppose d to. Is there a number -- reachable number for resident s or actually customers instead of kind of being there in limbo when there's -- a situation arises? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out in the morning , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And I think -- yeah, that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I just have a few for -- request for abandon ed vehicle s and stuff on Orchard Street. That has all been turned in. And also 1400 block of Pittston Avenue there's a house with new shingles blowing across the neighborhood into the yards. And also on that block, garbage and neighbors complained of rodents have been seen in the yards. As for the skid steer at Nay Aug Park, the skid steer belongs to the Recreation Authority . It was given to them -- I don't know, many years ago by the DPW. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 It is over 30 years old, therefore , unusable by the DPW. The maintenance is paid for by the Recreation Authority as is all of the equipment that is at the Nay Aug Park and Rec Authority garage. That is all maintain ed by the Recreation Authority and not the city. I did last year and the year before do testing and gave the city and the Recreation Authority the certification that I passed for the examination on that equipment . And I also supplied them with the liability insurance for me to operate it. So hopefully that's the end of that. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A FORMALLY 5-C - FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION – A RESOLUTION – NO. 34, 2024, ACCEPTING THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD AND DENYING THE CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS FOR DEMOLITION OF THE CARRIAGE HOUSE AT 336 MOIR COURT. MR. SMURL: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend a final vote of Item 7-A. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , just to be clear, if we're to vote yes to this, we're attempt ing to save the property at 336 Moir Court. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yes, Mr. Schuster . A yes vote signifies that you are agreeing with the decision of the -- MR. SCHUSTER : Correct . I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so we had a discussion in caucus about this building . And, you know, I'm a lover of old historical buildings . I have a house that's 100 years old and I love it. But after speaking with our Solicitor and fellow Council people, at least I've come to my own conclusion based on, you know, discussion that this building is not safe and to the effect where it could really seriously hurt someone . So with that said, if I vote yes to have this building still stand and someone gets hurt, I don't want to be that guy. It doesn't look like this building is going to be rehabilitated or remodeled . It's just a building or that is not -- you know, it was inspected by some people. So with that said, you know, I'm the Chairman of Public Safety, how can I in good conscience vote to have a structure stay or stand that's unsafe and it's not going to be, you know, made safer in the near future. So that's why I'll be voting no. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , we have a building here from the 1890s. It's coming to us late. It's coming through Fifth Order right to Seventh Order. I would have liked to have a longer opportunity to address the situation to take a look at the building . I have not taken a look at this particular building . We really haven't had a chance to see any groups step forward to say, you know, if there is any ideas out there for revitalization . I'm going to be voting yes to agree with the HARB Board tonight . And that's my opinion as to what we should do with this structure . I would have liked a little bit more time to digest what has occurred . But I feel like it's being rushed through . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Anyone else? MR. KING: On the question , while I am currently working in school construction , I'm not an architect. I'm not an engineer . I have a decent set of eyes thanks to these glasses . When I drive down Mulberry Street and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 I sit at that red light and I take a look at the left side of that roof next to the dorm, I see a roof that's sagging and looks like it's in serious jeopardy of collapsing , especially with the type of snow and the weight of the heavy snow that we get in this area. I don't -- I'm always one for trying to save buildings of great architectural value. But unfortunately , it doesn't appear as though there is going to be any attempt to try to rehabilitate this building . And if they were to try to rehabilitate this building , the cost would be I think astronomical to repair because we're actually talking about high beams and structure reenforcement . So, therefore , I will be voting no this evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I also would have liked more time on this piece of legislation rather than rushing it. And I also would have liked to see if there was an inspection done and what the results were of that inspection . I also don't know what I would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 looking for. I did pass by the structure also that hasn't been used for quite some time other than for storage . It doesn't seem that there is a use for the university for it in the future. I do appreciate the HARB and what they do to protect building s and structures within Scranton and downtown . But on this one I do feel that, you know, that maybe the denial was not what I would have approved . So I will be voting no. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . I also -- the reason this was rushed and pushed through was there was a lot of confusion when the University took down the front building , the more modern building . And then it came back to evidently the Law Department and then it sat there for a while. I don't know what happened . But I heard that the university had called them back and said we're still waiting for the back building . So that is why this is being pushed through . And we only have 45 days to bring this up and vote on it. Otherwise , we lose if we choose to go a different way.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 And I also looked at the building . There are a lot of deficiencies in the building . And I believe it should be razed. Roll call, please. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, one last thing before we move on. And, Attorney Gilbride , you may know this offhand, you may not. Is there anything in the process here for us to push this back to the HARB Board? I understand that once 45 days passes their decision is final. But is there any type of appeals process or something that we could push it back through to see if they've had a different opinion ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : A majority vote yes vote today or no action at all means that you accept the findings of the Historical Board. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Okay. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. Smurl, that was not adopted . MR. SMURL: I'm sorry. ATTY. GILBRIDE : It failed. MR. SMURL: I'm sorry, the motion has failed. MR.
