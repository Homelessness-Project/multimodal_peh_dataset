LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT EVALUATION REPORT REVIEWED DECEMBER 20, 2020. 3-F. MINUTES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION MEETING HELD DECEMBER 3, 2020. THE COURT: Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? Just one on the overtime report and I mentioned this last week, Controller Murray has issued an overtime report for the end of the year. And when you look at the report, you'll notice that we are obviously over by significant amount in overtime just overall . I did report last week that the Business Administrator , Carl Deeley answered my questions in terms of why we were over in police and fire -- the police and fire departments . So he did provide justification for that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 I had additional question s about the DPW administration overtime . I believe there was only $250 budgeted . And we were over -- I think they spent about over $5,000 in overtime . And then we also spent overtime in OECD which I don't think I've ever seen before. So I wanted justification for those two items. And they have been submitted to the administration . Anyone else have any comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. This Saturday , January 16th from 2 until these dinners run out, the Elm Park United Methodist Church on 712 Linden Street, Scranton will be having a drivethrough walkup takeout chicken dinner sponsored by Pioneer Construction and Pennsylvania American Water. There's -- (audio interruption .) ATTY. HAYES: Mark. MR. GAUGHAN : Mark. We lost you, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : -- Elm Park United Methodist Church. I'm sorry, what? MR. GAUGHAN : Sorry, Mark, we lost 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 you for like 10, 20 seconds. DR. ROTHCHILD : We do this every week. ATTY. HAYES: Someone 's hacking you. MR. MCANDREW : I know. I believe it. Believe me. I'm not saying nothing . Don't get me going. So I don't know where you lost me. But the dinner includes chicken strips, potato, vegetable with a roll and salad, also Subway chocolate chip cookie. Deliveries are available for people who can't make it and that's fantastic . So if you want a delivery , you could contact the Elm Park United Methodist Church, 570-878-0206, Monday through Friday 12 to 5 p.m. Great job guys. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : All right. Thank you, Mark. Anyone else have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I wanted to add I saw that Nay Aug Park had announced they were going to be having a food drive the week of Valentine 's Day. So it will be in February . So they'll be collecting donations for it; February 11th or February 13th from 5:00 to 7:00 at night and then February 13th or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 February 14th from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. And it's for non perishable food products . And those will be then deliver ed to local food pantries. In addition to that, I think cash donations will be accepted to help buy gift cards for local grocery stores. So once again, that is Nay Aug Park food drive. It's going to be the week of Valentine 's Day. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I just wanted to make a brief comment about Nay Aug Park and what a really nice job our Parks and Recreation employees and the Recreation Authority Board did with the lights at Nay Aug this year. It was really, really nice. I took my kids up there with my wife quite a few times and really, really good job. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Fay Franus and Marie Schumacher ? MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first comment is from Fay Franus as follows : Council , Last week I asked you a question . You did not answer me. I felt it was very important to have Mayor Cognetti come to a meeting via zoom and express her viewpoints on the 55 amendments you made on her budget. I asked you if you would consider doing that. Here are my direct two questions to you today since I got no reply last week. I would appreciate yes or no replies . Repeat yes or no replies . 1. Have you reached out before last week's meeting to have Mayor Cognetti attend your meeting of January 5th? 2. Had Mayor Cognetti reached out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 to you about her attending your January 5th meeting ? MS. REED: The second submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O According to the Times Tribune the City's Human Resources Department gave City employees about six weeks or until December 1st to satisfy any debts they might have via payment or payment plan at which time an audit of employee tax and fee statuses would be conducted . What were the results of the Audit? O I notice the Civil Service Commission has scheduled about three meeting at the new conference room located near the pool complex . When was this built and what funding was used. Is there any chance City Council could start meeting there as well? O 5B What is the point of amending a budget after the year has closed? Why wasn't this done in December 2020? O 6A Will St. Joseph's be responsible to verify the income documentation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 prior to each award? Did St. Joseph's request this funding last year and not make the cut or is this a new need? Is this only available to low income or do moderate incomes included . Unless I missed it the backup never mentioned a father. Is their income included income in the evalutation ? O 6b As I recall, the Grantee has an agreement with the County regarding the flooding of the parking area, how does the lease impact this? Also, is there a possibility Council can start meeting there as I think it is time and the building seems sufficient to provide proper social distancing . O 7B There have been many loan to grant "loans." How many stay a loan and how many are converted to grant? O 7C Why do we need a pass through , can't this be done in-house. O Any idea when the 2020 unanswered questions may be received ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that conclude s the Citizens Participation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? Anyone on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , I want to answer Fay's questions that she posed last week and this week. Number one, no. Number two, no. That's it. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? Yes, on the question just related to Miss Franus's question from this week, the Mayor was here tonight at our caucus. The Mayor is always welcome in our caucus. I spoke to the Mayor earlier today. The Mayor replied to the -- to Council 's amendment s in a letter that was sent to Council and to the newspaper . And we've been over this the last few weeks. The 2021 budget was unanimously passed by Council . The Mayor did not sign the budget. The Mayor has 10 days to either veto or sign the budget or not sign it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 So after 10 days the budget became law. And that budget was the one that was passed by Council . So, therefore , at this point it's a moot point. If the Mayor wanted to discuss the amendments , she could have brought those up tonight . Again, she already gave her views on it in the letter. So there's really no point to rehash everything . We all made our thought s known on it. And now, you know, it's time to move onto something else and other business that has to be conducted by the City. So hopefully that answers Miss Franus's questions . The second thing here regarding Miss Schumacher 's questions , her first question about the audit of the -- that was announced by Human Resources Department . I did speak briefly about this with the Mayor earlier today because I did see Miss Schumacher 's questions a few hours ago. And the Mayor did say she will provide results of this audit at some point within the next few weeks. So when those are available , obviously , they'll be available to Council and to the public. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 The second question about the Civil Service Commission meeting in the conference room located near the pool complex and if Council could start meeting there as well, we're going to meet in Council Chambers when it's safe to do so. If you haven't been living under a rock, the pandemic is killing over four thousand people a day. So, I mean, just me personally I'm not in a huge rush to cram into Council Chambers or any other conference room with members of the public and put not only the Council in danger but more importantly the public. So to both of those questions about meeting in different places, no, we won't be doing that until it's safe to do so. 5-B, she mentions what's the point of amending a budget after the year has closed. Technically , the budget is not being amended . They're transferring money between the contingency -- from the Contingency Account to the Professional Services Account in the Law Department . And this has to be done if you transfer money between department s, it triggers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 legislation that Council has to vote on. There's all historically been a lot of transfers towards the end of the year that are interdepartmental . And we get copies of those. This just happens to be from the Contingency Account to the Law Department Professional Services . And that's to supplement the account . And that has been done before since I've been on Council . I did have a question and wanted additional information . And the Mayor said tonight that she's going to provide that. MR. DONAHUE : Councilman Gaughan , can I just add to that too that this is just part of the normal reconciliation process in January where you're paying bills that, you know, were accrued in December and that apply to the 2020 budget year. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. Correct . Thank you. As for the questions about the agenda items, I don't know off the top of my head that the specific answers to Miss Schumacher 's questions . But as I said a minute or two ago, I did review Miss Schumacher 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 questions earlier . So I sent them to Eileen Cipriani the Director of OECD. And I know that Director Cipriani , she usually gets back quickly . I should have answers to those before next week. On 7-C, why do we need a passthrough ? Can't this be done inhouse? I believe we voted on an agreement a few months ago to use this organization as a passthrough for these grants. And the reason given to us at that time was that they didn't feel it was reasonable to do inhouse. They didn't have the bandwidth to do it inhouse. I believe there's a one percent fee which I don't think it is, you know, outrageous or unreasonable . And as for the last question , any idea when the 2020 unanswered questions may be received ? Mrs. Reed, our City Clerk has been in contact again with the representative from the Mayor's office. And those questions have been received by the Mayor's office. And we're still waiting for answers to be given. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : One thing I'd like to ask is maybe we send correspond ence to the LIPS Department . Right prior to the meeting I did get a message about there's a car on cinderblocks on the corner of North Rebecca and Elizabeth Street. It's been there for quite some time. Maybe they could take a -- stop by and see what's occurring with that vehicle . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : All right. Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments at this time?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. MCANDREW : Yes. Last week I posed a question regarding removal of snow on the bridges during snowstorms . So I'm happy to report that Mr. Preambo actually -- he came back with an explanation or the protocol whatever we were looking for. So the during post winter storm cleanup , the Department of Parks along with Public Works employee s are deployed to various bridge locations in the City for snow removal or deicing. This deployment of staffing resources may require multiple day and/or multiple visits depending on intensity of the weather event in order to provide service s to all subject sidewalks . The deployment of staffing resources from these activities also depending on availability of staff throughout both departments . Nonetheless , this activity is monitored by the DPW management team to be complet ed as soon as possible under all situations outlined above. It is worth noting that many times once a subject sidewalk is cleared from the snow or ice, it is covered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 again by continuous plowing activities by other entities . When this happens, the redeployment of staff is necessary sometimes days later after a weather event. Okay, so I'm just glad -- I'm happy to report that. Also brought to me is another -- is a safety hazard. And, Mrs. Reed, if you could send some correspondence regarding this one. There's a hazard on the corner of Linden and Penn. It seems to be a metal stub projecting about 4 inches up from the pavement . It is where a sign was sawed off. Maybe it was intended for another sign to be attached . But as it stands, it's definitely a possible cause for unwary pedestrian s to trip and fall or for a car to back over it as there is a small parking area there too. To the least, maybe an orange cone could be put there until it's identified if it's a new sign or not to prevent an accident or tire damage. All right. So please if -- if you could please look into that, Mrs. Reed, for me. And that is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : No motions or comment s right now. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have two things, number one, the Mayor addressed this in the caucus. Last week I brought up an issue that was brought to my attention from some of the business owners across the City about an ordinance that was passed a few decades ago regarding an entertainment fee that businesses would pay in the amount of $500 a year. Obviously businesses have been affected by the pandemic . And the fact that they're really not -- no one is having entertainment at this point because of everything that's going on. So when I spoke to the Mayor earlier and in the caucus tonight , there -- her and her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 administration are going to take Council 's suggestion into consider ation about waiving that $500 fee for 2021. Unfortunately , the bills already went out and some of these business owners, you know, paid that money already . So they're going to have to work out logistically what that looks like. I think last we only brought in about $15,000 from this fee. And in the 2021 budget I think it's somewhere -- they're expecting somewhere around $20,000. So again, it just comes down to an issue of fairness . You wouldn't charge somebody a fee when they're not, you know, giving out that service . So that was the first item. Secondly , last week I had asked -- was interested in the paving program for OECD. And Eileen Cipriani , the OECD Director did get back to me. OECD has $734,016.75 that is going to be available for 2021 paving projects . A project engineer has been selected . And we are expecting legislation to Council to enter into a contract with an engineering firm shortly . And they are or did supply a list of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 streets in low to moderate income areas of the City to be consider ed for this project . And they anticipate the paving project to go out for bid in March. So we should see the wheels on that whole process start turning very shortly . Secondly , there was a gentleman Mr. McNany who posed a question about an expenditure that the City made and they wanted to be reimbursed through the CARES Act Program . And it was a $28,000 expenditure for the IT Department for the website -- City's website . And the Mayor's office got back to me and they stated that that was $28,000 state COSTARS contract . The City was going to engage Bedrock Technologie s as well as the City's IT manager that would complete the project . The current version of the City's website was written in the early 2000s with some kind of different coding language . This means that all updates must be done with knowledge of that specific coding arrangement and that code, in particular . A large portion of this project will be transitioning the current website to WordPress 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 so that any City employee given the permissions by the website administrator could update their page. This is going to allow the residents to get the most up-to-date information . And it frees up time for the IT Department to focus on helping employees to work from home and perform other vital functions . It's going to be able to provide a good foundation so that they could fully complete the website update by the summer of 2021. That $28,000's worth of funding also includes administrative training for staff on how to work on and update the website. So hopefully that answers Mr. McNany's question . And finally , one of the questions that I've had in the past, didn't get really an update lately on it. I think it's very important . In our Act 47 Recovery Plan, there were several -- in fact, pages and pages of recommendation s that were made a few years ago in 2017 for the City to complete prior to the exit -- the City's exit which will be soon from Act 47. So, Mrs. Reed, I would like if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 could send to the Business Administrator a list and I'll send this to you an e-mail asking for updates on all of these recommendations . There was 17 of them for workforce cost containment provisions . One of the things that I'm interested in is the adoption of a debt management policy, a fund balance policy. There was all sorts of recommendation s on workers' comp funding , pension system funding improvement s and disability pension reform. One thing that I'm interested in there is the adoption of pension fund governance policy. There was other economic development initiatives and revenue and financial management initiative s and recommendation as well. One of the ones that I've been interested in and could never get an answer on with the last administration was an update of a Human Resources Management Plan. So, Mrs. Reed, I'll send this along to you and if you could send that to the Business Administrator just asking for an update. I know that over the past few years there have been several of these initiatives 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 which have been met and several of these recommendations which have been met. But there are a few that are outstanding and I just want to get an update on what the progress is with each of those. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.
