DPW is going to be working on Saturday -- next Saturday . So collections will be picked up -- Friday's schedule will be picked up on Saturday . I announced this in the caucus but Carl Deeley our Business Administrator and PFM the City's financial advisor will be coming to our caucus next week at 5:45 to discuss agenda Item 5-B. I'd like to take a second to welcome everyone back finally . Our last meeting in these chamber s was March 10th, 2020. Then, of course, the country shut down due to the pandemic . And it's been a very difficult journey over the last year for the people of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 our City, the people of the State of Pennsylvania and around the country and around the world. Tragically we lost many loved ones here in Scranton and Lackawanna County, in our state, in our country and around the world to the virus and will continue to remember them in our prayers . One of the things that stuck out to me over the last year was how we all came together as a community to help one another was one of the great characteristics about Scranton ians and about those of us who live in Lackawanna County. And we'll continue to do that. I'm very confident of that. Hopefully we're on the other side of this pandemic . It's a been a surreal experience . But we continue to persevere and we continue to move on. Since it's been so long since we've been here I thought it would be appropriate at this time to go over some important parts of the Rules of Council . So I just want to take a second to do that. So the first thing I wanted to mention and you'll notice when you came in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 tonight posted on the door were capacity limits for this week. That would be for this week only. Obviously we're not going to -- I don't believe we'll hit the capacity limit tonight . It's 27 for the ground floor here in chambers . Those are going to be lifted Memorial Day weekend per the Governor 's order and the press release that he put out. So they won't be in place next week. We are requiring anyone who enters chambers to wear masks for your safety and ours. We don't yet know when this will change. But hopefully when we get 70 percent of the population in Pennsylvania being vaccinated that the masks can be lifted. You can take your mask off or pull it down when you speak at the podium so that we can hear you and understand you. But we would ask and it is in our rules that you put the mask on when you're walking back and when you're seated in the audience and that goes for Council members as well. The other thing I wanted to take a second to just highlight is in our rules 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Article 5. Article 5 states that no person shall address Council for more than five minutes unless extended by the Council President . Persons addressing Council shall state their name for the record and shall direct their comments to the Chair. One of the things that you'll notice and this was prepandemic was the timer that we have which makes it much more transparent when you are getting up to speak. It will count down from five minutes to zero. When it hits zero, your time will be over and you'll be asked to be seated. So that is the same rules that were in place before the pandemic . You'll notice on the podium there is a button -- a green button, a yellow button and a red button. So when it's green, it's your time to speak. When it blinks yellow, I think you have two minutes . And when it's solid yellow, one minute. And when it's red you don't have any time left. Also under section -- Article 5 Section 1, it says no person including members of Council shall use their time during citizens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 participation to personally insult or attack any individual . Name calling , profanity , racial or ethnic slurs, discriminatory remarks based on race, color, religion , national origin, ancestry or place of birth, sex, gender, identity , sexual orientation , disability , marital status or age or any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall not be permitted . As you may have noticed , the tenor of public debate in meetings has become very disrespect ful and heated throughout our country unfortunate ly. We would want to try to avoid that sort of behavior here in Council Chamber s. We're here to listen to you because your voice is important . It's the reason we're all sitting here. But at the same time, we have to conduct the business of the City and be respectful of one another and engage in meaningful public discourse. So we just want to make sure that that reminder is out there as we move forward and conduct ourselves in a respectful manner. The other thing I wanted to mention is Section 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 19 and 20. Any person who requests information from council during Citizens Participation shall do so in writing and shall include the name of the person making the request . All requests for stop signs, streetlights , street signs, safety signs and traffic signs shall be made in writing and signed by the requesting party. All such requests will be acted upon by Council . A majority of the Council in its sole and absolute discretion shall determine whether to place such request on the Council agenda. We have been liberal with this in the past. You know, if you're coming up to ask a question on the agenda if we can answer it, we have no problem doing that. If you need information and you have a question that's more involved then we would ask that you put it in writing whether it's signing a -- putting it down on a piece of paper and handing it to our City Clerk or to Miss Carrera or Mr. Herbster, just so that we can keep a record of that in our office, which we do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And then we can try to track down and answer and track down any information for you. And that is all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : I'd like to make a motion to accept public comment submitted in writing by Mr. John White. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , we did just for this meeting particularly because of the capacity limits and we weren't sure if we were going to get a big crowd or a small crowd, we wanted to make sure that the public had an opportunity to submit any comment s in writing if they couldn't make it here or they were limited due to the capacity limit. So we did that. Mr. John White submitted a comment . So we're going to put that in the record and that will be reflected in the minutes of our meeting . Anyone else on question ? All those in favor of the motion say aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MS. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I'm sorry. No, we have to go to Fourth Order. We're used to being in Zoom. Okay, the first -- we got to get out of Zoom mode. Nobody will be freezing . There will be no glitches tonight which is nice. The first speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton ; I'm very happy to be back. I'm not a fan of governments by virtual reality . But that was what we lived with for 14 months. A lot of the citizen s of Scranton are not tech savvy. I'm not tech savvy. But I choose not to be because I'm too cheep to pay for digital devices when I could get it for free at the library . However , many people buy digital devices and then they don't know how to access 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Zoom or they don't know how to download a file, an app and so on and so forth. The Scranton Public Library has a new service that is perfect for this pandemic season. It's called tech table. You could receive help with any of your digital devices from the library 's computer lab instructor . This guy knows everything . And they have hours where you could walk in. You don't have to register , Monday and Wednesdays from 5 to 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays from 1 to 3 p.m., up at the Albright Memorial Library on the second floor. And the guy will walk you through any technical issue that you have. He will not talk over your head. He will not talk down to you. He will sit side-by-side with you. You will get the money you paid for your device. You know, a lot of people spend big bucks on these things. And they don't know how to use them. Now, he won't do things like you drop your phone and you cracked your screen. That's your problem . Okay, this is how to use your technology . And this will help people be able to access meetings like this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 So that's one thing. I was very pleased to see some of the recent article s in the Times-Tribune . One was on Glynis Johns and PNC Bank where the Black Scranton Project found a home in Providence , the PNC Bank up there in Providence Square. I got to the say, the last two or three years we have been very, very fortunate as a City some of the talents that have come our way. Mayor Cognetti is one of them. Glynis Johns is another ; Norma Jeffries who is here tonight . We need to see more people like this. It's ironic they're all female. But be that as it may -- Dr. Rothchild . Okay, we need more diversity participating in municipal government . And I just hope that everybody supports Glynis as she starts the Black Scranton Project in Providence Square because I think it's part of our cultural heritage . And it benefits everybody , especially what we've gone through in the last year. Some of the things I saw recently I'm not too happy about and one of them was an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 article on the City fixing a pipe without a permit. Now I understand that people make mistakes but the issue of permits and licenses is something that has been a bugbear for a number of years and was under a great deal of scrutiny before the pandemic hit. And we were looking at LIPS with great care. I don't understand how this could have happened last October , you know, that the pipe was installed even if it was an emergency without the proper permit because there's a procedure for that. And next week I'll give you a written request for some information . I know you cannot tell me what kind of cost this is going to be to the City for having to fix this pipe that was the wrong size that may cause some flooding upstream according to DEP. But I will be asking in writing about what intern controls have we set up so that a thing like this does not happen again in the future. Things that require permits should be easily controlled . There should be a process that it doesn't happen again. And also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 starting next week you're going to hear me asking what's going on with the 2020 audit. And I will put that in writing . But you should expect me to ask for a status because remember , the Home Rule Charter says it's due on May 30th which is this Sunday. And I know we're not going to meet it. But I hope we meet the September deadline that they have promised . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I just wanted to come and talk to you today specifically after looking through a bunch of the regulations for putting referendums into action in the City of Scranton . Coming from Baltimore myself as for my political activity during my life rather than with my father and all that he did in political actions in Scranton , the referendum process in Scranton I believe requires not only five people to organize it; but it requires written referendum documentation . It needs to go (inaudible ) sign and it's all done by physical paperwork . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 In Baltimore and in Pittsburgh and a number of the other municipal ities, even in other areas of the state, it is now acceptable to go out and create an electronic though verifiable by name, address , Social Security number, whatever these referendum groups make to make verifiable lists that you could put online and draw a referendum without having to knock on doors and with having a confirmable list for charges that you want to bring before your City Government . I think the paper referendum s are a little bit old fashion ed and overburdened . And it does restrict the population 's ability to petition the local government for changes by putting a barrier in their place. I would hope that sometime in the future before a referendum has to be made to change how referendum s are introduced we look at the ability to present and provide an electronic request for a referendum and actually put that into policy and procedure for the City of Scranton . And second, the government -- recently we had referendums in the last vote for the Governor 's powers. The Pennsylvania 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 voters ruled to restrict those powers to take away unlimited and unrestricted extensions and ability to invoke emergency powers by the Governor . I've had an issue in the City of Scranton that the Mayor in her action has put forth similar procedures and Council has in -- example in hiring, staffing , making changes on the fly has requested clarification on this process which was even done in written but nothing was brought forward to Council . It was directive toward the question asked. The City charter allows City Council to call the Mayor before City Council . That wasn't done. I look at City Council 's authority similar to the Senate in the legislature in the state Government as there are powers that are given to City Council . And part of my disturbed feeling is if the Mayor breaks a policy, the process should not be you've broken the rules; we're going to send a severe letter to you to rebuke you not to do that again. If the rules and orders are broken for whatever reason and the response is not forthcoming in a letter, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Mayor should be called before this body for direct questioning to answer why procedures were not followed and be brought to accounting before Council who has the overseeing authority for that. Public safety is the -- under the Home Rule Charter is the confines of the City Council . The Mayor has the ability to enforce it. But City Council is the one to create and direct all public safety procedures . Even under emergency , the Mayor does not have that power. I'm concerned about a lot of the acquiescence for the Mayor extending these emergency orders or hiring well after the time periods involved completely isolated from City Council 's input. That action by fiat is an antithesis to the Home Rule Charter and what this body was made for. I hope going forward it's address ed by this Council so we don't shift into that. And I did not speak to this prior purely for the reason before the election I did not want to throw too much smoke onto a topic that was -- that may have gone away by election 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 changing people who are in charge of the body. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . Well, I welcome everybody back. It's nice to be here. Hope everybody 's been safe over the last 14 months. It's great to be back. First, I want to talk about an ongoing problem which I live near the railroad bridge on Main Avenue right off of Euclid Avenue. Trucks keep getting stuck under there all the time. As a matter of fact, one got stuck under there again today. About a month ago one was coming down Main Avenue and saw that he couldn't make it and he turned up Dorothy Street and went over Rebecca to the corner I live on on Bulwer Street. He couldn't make the turn. He clipped the telephone pole. He tore the street sign off the poll. And DPW came and took just the one, the Bulwer Street sign and he never came and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 returned it to put it back up. So I don't know whose department the DPW is if you could talk to them and see if we can get that sign back. MR. DONAHUE : What was the street, Rebecca -- MR. SPINDLER : Corner of Bulwer and North Rebecca . The Rebecca sign is still there, the Bulwer Street sign they took it and never brought it back. But I have a suggestion . I don't know if it could be done. People going north, the direction that truck was going, if they turn up Dorothy Street there's a turnaround at the end of Dorothy Street. But it's Emiliani 's -- Emiliani Trucking 's turnaround . I don't know if they would be acceptable to that. If they could put a sign on Main Avenue and telling these trucks that they could turn around at the end of Dorothy Street because they're not allowed in the rest of the neighborhood . There's signs there. Dorothy Street is the only street they could go up and down. That's where Emiliani 's trucks go. And I said, maybe the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 City could talk to Emiliani and see if these trucks could use their turnaround. Moving on, an article last week in the paper about Council voting down against joining a Pennsylvania safety alliance , I just cut out one little paragraph in here I wanted to read. It says the organization is a nonprofit promoting sensible evidence d-based firearm policies aiming at saving lives and prevent ing injury. Now, with all the gun license violence and mass shooting s we had in this country the last couple months and yesterday there was one, why would you vote against something to promote safety? MR. GAUGHAN : Do you want me to answer that? MR. SPINDLER : Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, there's a few reasons . Number one, it was very hard to find enough information about the group. If you go on their website I think they are almost a startup. They've only been around for a few months. So that was number one. When the legislation was originally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 sent down to us, Mr. Spindler , there was no backup -- really no backup at all, no explanation . Then one did come. So that was one concern . The second concern is I think everyone on Council agrees with gun safety. What I personally don't want to see is that every time a cause comes up Council is joining different groups. I don't think -- this is just me personally , I don't think that's our place. We're here to conduct the business of the City. Next week are we going to tackle abortion and then the death penalty ? It's just -- that's my own feeling on it. I agree 100 percent with gun safety. I have my own views on it. But there's no -- but there was no teeth to that legislation . There's nothing that could be done to affect the laws in Pennsylvania . That would be the state legislature . So that's the reason I voted against it, not because I don't agree with gun safety. MR. DONAHUE : And just to add onto that, like, we agree with everything that was in that statement , right, but it was how do you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 that? And there was no specific s to how this group was going to advocate to do that. You know, so it was just too vague and broad for me personally . MR. SPINDLER : Okay. I only have a minute left so I want to get going. Personal ly, I'm totally against guns. I think that the gun laws of the Constitution should be rewritten . When they were written , they didn't have the guns that we have today. Nobody should have an AR-15 or an AK-47 except -- they're military weapons . Nobody should have them. All right. Lastly, watching the news tonight the State of Pennsylvania and the rest of country is doing great with the COVID cases. Pennsylvania for last three days has been under a thousand cases which is great compared to how it used to be. And Lackawanna County today was one case. So we haven't been that low since August. So I urge everybody -- my wife and I, we got our shots, very safe, no problem . And I urge everybody that didn't get their shots to please get it because we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 going in the right direction . And maybe we could open everything up and have picnics this summer and La Festa and everything . My time is up. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. That exhausts the sign-in sheet -- the speaker sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . I don't know if you noticed, there's F and V on my mask. And what that stands for is fully vaccinated . But I'm not going to take it off right now. I think you could hear me just fine. And it's in protest against the people that think that vaccines are hooey. It's a rotten shame that people are not showing up for their vaccine . I'd like to share some of my experiences on a ventilator . It wasn't for COVID. But when I came to after surgery , I was so distressed I dropped out. I didn't care, and they had to revive me. And, you know, all night I woke up. And I felt like I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 had swallowed a hot charcoal or something . And I would bite down on the tube, shut off the air, sound off an alarm. And this orderly or physician 's assistant , whatever , would come in with a big syringe and say you need to be sedated. And, good, I'm going to heaven again. Get me out of this hell. The second time, not too many problems . But the third time I almost choked because my throat was strained. So you really don't want to wind up in the hospital . I mean, there's all types of people that I see a marathon runner, a lady, and she couldn't walk a couple of blocks and that was weeks after and months after. It was three months I think it was that she came on the news and was discussing it. And she could only walk maybe 10 blocks, a marathon runner, 26 miles. That's a lot of blocks. That's well over 130 blocks or 150 blocks -- city blocks. On the other news, there's a -- in certain states there's a lot of -- and Pennsylvania is one with the legislature , voter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 suppression . They're starting to come up with all kinds of insane rules. And by and large I was happy with the election . Actually we disposed of the problem . And call your representatives and senators and in all haste support federal regulation of US elections in the territories and states. It's a crime to vote illegally . You could get about three years for it. Somebody got caught down in Wyoming . He tried to sign up for his son, another guy his dead mother. And he got five years probation . But some poor lady that was on parole in Texas tried it, and she got five years. You can't guess what color she was in Texas, you know, I don't support that. She should have just been told to leave or -- she followed provisional vote. And furthermore , if they had a camera there and put you on file when they hand you your ballot, you would be positively identified as voting and they could go back on it. And they don't know how you voted. That's what they do in the hospital when you go, take your picture . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And on the gun control business , I agree in a sense that we can't have a gun control law for every city. We just can't have it. You can't drive from Scranton through Dunmore and then hit Throop or Olyphant or Jessup and on the way to a gun range -- there is one on up on Salem Mountain out of Archbald and get arrested for having one in the trunk. Furthermore , there are gun safes. So a lot of these school shootings , our parents leave them easily accessible guns around the house and all kind of exotic firearms . They should be secured and -- immediately . And personally , I think it's time to hold some of the parents responsible for this when they give such easy access. I mean, if they wreck your car it's your problem . They weren't licensed . Thank you. See you next week. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Thank you. Miss Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : In reviewing the Controller 's report, I was happy to learn that ECTV has received half of the annual amount budgeted for ECTVs activities . So that was good news. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Mr. Donahue , I believe you are the correct member to address DPW? So I have two questions for you. One, how long will it take to complete the PennDOT recommendation s for increasing the safety of Harrison Avenue? I am really looking forward to the line of sight increasing , especially at Gibson and Harrison . But I believe when signage has been installed , may I suggest that you notify the police so that their code enforcer can give tickets , if necessary , so people get the idea that we're serious about it and people want to see. And then next, has there been any indication the City will be expected to pay for all or a portion of the damage to the inground pool on Yard Avenue as a result of the repair of the underground pipe of Leach Creek last fall? MR. DONAHUE : I don't have either answer off the top of my head, but I will get back to you on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. What procedure does DPW have in place for monitoring the leachate line that runs through Green 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Ridge? MR. DONAHUE : I don't believe DPW has any procedure . That's American Water. MS. SCHUMACHER : There is none? MR. DONAHUE : I don't believe so, but let me get the -- but don't quote me -- MS. SCHUMACHER : There are water indications that water or a -- let's say a liquid is going through that -- MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : So I think they should investigate that. While on the subject of water, has the City ever received the final report from HRG on stormwater ? MR. GAUGHAN : No, we have not received a final report. MS. SCHUMACHER : Has the City ever set a date for making the decision on whether or not there will be a stormwater authority ? MR. GAUGHAN : To my knowledge , no. MS. SCHUMACHER : You know, we have moved into the season when precipitation is no longer snow that melts slowly but rain that causes households to be flooded . Just the last weeks, it's been Froude Avenue and Brook Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 in East Mountain and did not hear anything from the Keyser valley from the Dewey/Jackson /Merrifield area. But I know there was Emmet Street I believe you spoke of. And it's just going to continue . And at some point I think DPW is going to make us do that. It would be nice if we could get moving, especially since I forget what that 69.9 million dollar gift the City received that -- from their grandchildren 's future taxes via the federal government . Since that covers stormwater , I emphatically request that Council ensure that a sizeable chunk goes to stormwater . It is really time to step up to the plate. And I also -- I know there are still people out there who have health conditions that cannot risk going out and coming into a COVID person. And so I think you should extend the ability to submit a Fourth Order input until this thing is at 70 percent or more. And then finally , I would have a request that you include minutes from the Mayor's tax policy group in the Third Order if that is possible . MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know if they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 take minutes at those meetings . MS. SCHUMACHER : They do. MR. DONAHUE : I'll request that tomorrow . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you very much. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? (E-mail submission from John White as follows :) Hi folks. Thank you for all the fine work you do. I’m writing again to request your participation in our lives. The trucks are still spreading down wheeler . Cutting dust continues to cover every thing no cleaning no communication . Enforce the ordinance for utility companies to keep it clean. Consider the options presented in previous letters . Get it done Council . We all want clean safe streets and air. Don’t let your people suffer. The denaples family will enjoy their families in their clean backyard while therst of us forccforced to breathe this toxic waste. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 It’s getting worse. Now they are staging their equipment on our streets over night and the noise begins at 7am. Loud. I could ramble on but to get to the point. Start today. Every day until it’s done. Are we going to lose our desire to be one of the cleanest , art safe cities in the US? Every day til it’s over. Our plan not threat is to pursue your intervention . If not stared and continued this letter will be forwarded today to the Scranton times. Also Kelly will called and will be invited to neighborhood for coffee and some deep breathing . Cough cough. I’m sure he will accept. Cmon Council . Give us a break. Again thank you for your fine work. Peace John White. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Mr. Volderberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Council man Schuster , do you have any motion or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : So just one comment , I did receive another e-mail about the stormwater and drainage on West Mountain . So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 know Mr. Donahue has reached out to the flood control with DPW. So I hope that they will be for the future for a caucus meeting to discuss that and start on -- start on a plan for that. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So a concerned resident reached out to me. She has -- she owns a property on Main Avenue in West Scranton next to a business . And she pays for the handicap sign in front of her house. But her question to me is and she got conflicting answers from the people she reached out to at City Hall and the police department . So if she pays $10 a year, is there any way she could get that sign or make that sign become a resident only sign because everybody keeps parking -- I heard that there is. I don't know if it's true or not. But I heard that that's a possibility . So I said I would ask. And that's why I'm asking. If, you know, Mr. Voldenberg or someone here could respond . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that's for handicap parking ? MR. MCANDREW : Right. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, it's my understanding that -- and I could be wrong. You could double-check on this. If someone has a handicap parking, like a parking tag, they could park there. That handicap parking placard does not unfortunate ly give you the ability to, you know, park -- although it makes sense to park right in front of your house because this has come up before. And so I don't think you could make it into like a residential only type thing. But you could double-check. But that's my understanding . MR. MCANDREW : All right. So please if you could double-check on that for me just so I could respond to this citizen . Also Mrs. Hodowanitz talked about permits . And someone else reached out to me. And it's a question that I don't have the answer for because I was on the school board for six years. But the question was, do schools or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 even the CTC where I work, have to pay for permits ? I mean, they understand they have to pull them. They understand they have to be inspected . But do they have to pay for permits for renovations because they're both tax collecting entities in the same city. You know, I understand the inspection piece. I understand they require a permit. I'm just asking, you know, a question I couldn't answer. Maybe if we can find out and clarify that, please. And then also -- so over in West Side I saw some great things this week. So after proposing Scranton 's very own hometown hero banner's program at a Council meeting last year, I was happy to see this come to fruition . This was piloted this week in West Scranton through the collaboration of Todd Pousley of NeighborW orks and Leadership Lackawanna . They piloted 30 banners. There's going to be a little ceremony this Saturday at 11:00. And Mr. Gattens over in South Side is spearheading his own program with banners which is great. And he has tonight between six and eight at the community room at Nay Aug Park 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 located adjacent to the pool, they are handing out applications explaining the process and answering questions and also this Thursday . So I look forward to when there are banners displayed throughout the City for all of our hometown heros because Leadership Lackawanna only took this on as a core project . They will be handling -- be handing this off to the City, you know, after Memorial Day. I don't know how far after. I met a couple times with the City. So there's logistic pieces that we're looking at. Maybe we get more involvement from the veterans groups which I believe we should. But also, like I said, Mr. Gattens took it upon himself which is great to get South Side up and running . Maybe that's something we'll have to do as a whole because it's a large city. You drive through Taylor, there's 10 banners . But, you know, the excitement of all of this throughout the City the people want to recognize and we should, our hometown heros. That is all I have right now. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay. I have a few. Welcome back everyone . It's great to be in Council Chambers as I said at the top of the meeting . It's been a surreal experience the last year trying to do all of this over Zoom but we did make it work. And I want to thank our office for all that they did and making sure that the transition was somewhat seamless . And, you know, I'm very proud of the fact that we were one of the first Councils I think in the state that went directly to Zoom and really went off without a hitch. So I want to welcome everyone back and hope everyone 's safe. I do have a few things that I would like to start with. So I want to welcome -- officially welcome Frank Voldenberg if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 haven't noticed . We did make that announcement a couple of weeks ago. But it's our first meeting back in chambers . And I also want to welcome Allison Herbster who started with our office a few weeks ago. So I want to welcome the both of them. I do have a few items, citizens complaints who've reached out to me. The first one was an older gentleman who lives on Pike Street. And he wrote us a letter about Pike Street not being paved in over 30 years. He has an older gentleman and in the letter he said all he wants is to drive on a paved street before he dies. So, Mr. Volderberg , if you could try to make that happen I would appreciate it, reach out to DPW. The second issue that was brought up in the caucus was the pools. We would like an update on which pools are going to be open, what maintenance has to be done to the pools. Usually by this time we would have received some sort of notification on which pool was going to be open. We know that Nay Aug Pool is not going to be. And I do know that the City has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 started to hire lifeguards. So I'm assuming there is going to be a pool open. But we just don't know which ones. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could reach out on that matter, I would appreciate it. Also number three, last year or the year before, I can't remember . I had talked about a Park Ambassador Program for our parks in the City of Scranton . And the Mayor at that time put out a survey I think of some sort and was collecting information from resident s on whether or not they would be interest ed in that sort of program . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could check on that if that's taking off at some point. The other thing I wanted to speak about tonight -- I'm actually very disturbed after being out at Leggett 's Street, Leggett 's Creek and Leach Creek -- Miss Schumacher brought up flooding tonight . I have never in all of my years on Council seen anything quite like this. The only thing that may rival it is the issues over on Wyoming Avenue with Mr. Young. I was out within the last two or three weeks on Leggett Street and up on Yard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Avenue with the nice woman who lives there who her backyard was ruined and her in-ground pool ruined. And the devastation and the situation there is really unbelievable . It's hard to describe without actually seeing it and the things that have actually gone on there over the last few years. So when I was out there the neighbors had explained to me and you have to understand that the people that live here have lived their -- almost their whole entire lives, 60, 70, 80 years, sometimes even further than that. And they explained that really what's going on here is the debris that is in the creek. And I saw it firsthand with my own eyes that the debris has kind of piled up in the creek. And it's making a situation where the water flow doesn't go like it used to. Now, according to one neighbor , the woman who lives on Yard Avenue, the last time that the DPW was out on Leach Creek was in the mid 2000s to dredge it or to clear out the debris, whatever term you want to use. Over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 time the banks have degraded to the point where they're down way lower than they ever have been. I was told by our DPW Director that a FEMA project is going to take place somewhere around the Rockwell Avenue bridge and that the DEP was also going to issue a permit to DPW to shore up the banks where Leach Creek runs into Leggett 's Creek. But they were told that they can't build it any higher than it already is. The disturbing part for me was in speaking to a representative from the DEP who told me that they will not under any circumstances authorize the City to go into Leggett 's Creek or Leach Creek along Yard Avenue. And they are claiming that there are no obstructions there. And I find that hard to believe because I was out there and I saw it with my own eyes. And if you ask the neighbors they'll tell you that as well. The gentleman from DEP also stated that they would never authorize the banks to be built up along Leggett 's Creek and, you know, basically said that the people built their homes in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 floodplain and it is what it is. And there's really -- and he told the one woman that they can't fix anything here. I will not accept that as an answer. These people that have lived on Leggett Street have lived there their whole entire lives. They couldn't sell their homes if they wanted to, which everybody here understands . It's common sense. They have nowhere to go, couldn't get out if they wanted to. And they are being told by the DEP, nothing we can do here. The gentleman told me and he's probably -- I'm not disputing what he's saying because he's probably right that they would not invest in fixing the banks or make an investment down there because there's not -- there's not enough homes. So he did tell that to the woman on Leggett 's Creek and obviously , you know, the neighbors are upset and I would be too. So what I would like down -- first of all, I want to see this in writing . Let's do an analysis of Leggett 's Creek and Leach Creek why these properties are constantly getting flooded. They have to hold their breath every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 time there's a downpour every time it rains heavy. So I would like an analysis of what's going on there. And I want to see a report and I want to see it in writing . I'd like a letter to go out to the DPW asking for a report on what work has been, if any, on Leach Creek and Leggett 's Creek and what the plan is to mitigate the flooding that has been occurring there and affecting these residents . To the DPW's credit I did meet with the Mayor and Mr. Preambo out there at Leggett 's Creek and I know they've been out to the home on Yard Avenue. And I spoke to Mr. Preambo today. And they stated that they would do anything as long as they could get approval from the DEP. And they are going to do some things, but it's not fixing the actual problem that is going on here, I don't believe . I would like a letter also sent to DEP asking them why they are refusing to allow crews to go into the creek to clear out debris that according to neighbor s is most likely causing the issues here. And I'd also like to reach out to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Senator Casey and soon to be Senator Flynn and I know Senator Flynn -- State Senator Flynn is already aware of this because his office is involved . But I would like to get a paper trail on this and get them involved in it. To me when I hear that nothing can be done to put those people in that situation where this woman -- or these people every time it rains, every time they get flooded , this lady had to spend $2,500 to get her basement cleaned out, lost a washer, lost a dryer. And to hear, well, they shouldn 't have built their homes there, that is just unacceptable , totally unacceptable . There has to be a way that we can help them. There has to be a way. And if there's not a way, we have to find a way because there is no way in good conscience I could allow this to go -- first of all, I live by these people, number one. And number two, what if it was me? What if it was you? The answer that, well, you know, we can't do anything or we're not going to do anything . We won't issue -- the DEP won't issue a permit; that's just not going to fly with me. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 So I do want to see something done on this. Mr. Hayes and Mr. Voldenberg , if you could draft a letter, let's get this process started and we need to move quickly because , like I said, they've been told in the past, in fact, this woman told me in the past someone had actually said to her you shouldn 't have built your house here. There's nothing we can do. It's suppose d to flood down here. I mean, that's just absurd. I think my own personal opinion -- I'm not an engineer . I'm not the smartest man in the world, but the banks degrading over the years, the fact that the creek has not been maintained , the debris has been allowed to build up there. That's the reason that all of a sudden it's just gotten really, really bad. Again, I want to thank the DEP for doing what they have been doing and meeting down there and trying to help the people. But we need the DEP to step up to the plate and I think we're going to need state and federal assistance . And I don't want to hear that just because there is three or four houses down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 there we can't help you. There has to be. They pay their taxes every year. And they don't have a way out, so we have to help them. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

The lowest interest rate was from M&T Bank 1.710 percent . And the reason for this is the market conditions and the overall strength of the City's credit was conducive at this point to refinancing . So according to backup here, the City's going to save roughly $388,689 over the life of the note compared to what's been budgeted . So I just had a question about the new money portion of the debt. So what capital project s are those dollars being used for and why. There's not really an explanation of that in the backup. That's all I have. Anyone else on the question ?
