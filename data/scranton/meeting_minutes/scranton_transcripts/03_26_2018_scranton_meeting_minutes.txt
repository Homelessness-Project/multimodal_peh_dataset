MR. DONAHUE : Yes, real quickly , I would just like to commend all of the students who took part in the March for Our Lives demonstration s against gun violence both locally and in Washington over the weekend. Their courage and passion to stand up and take action is just truly inspiring . I urge you to just keep at it, don't get discouraged . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Briefly . I would like to concur with that. As someone who was a -- I hate to give my age away, a teenager in the 60's I totally understand what is going on right now. There is no excuse we can't find a way to follow solve this problem . Shame on this country and I have all of the respect for the young adults that are trying to get their voice heard. It's initiative is far too important for us to ignore so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 keep up the good work. The new parking system at the Marketplace at Steamtown begins today. I think the resolution on how to handle the rates and the validation system at the Marketplace by NDC and ABM was a fair and equitable solution to a very difficult problem . Also, on the parking issues, representatives of NDC and hopefully ABM will be attending a public caucus in City Council chambers on May 21 at 5:15 p.m. It is expected that they will be giving city council an update on what they are doing so far and what their future plans may be for the parking system and, of course, the questions from council . I was going to talk about reassessment tonight , I'm going to let that simmer for another week or so, but I will say a couple of the speakers commented about the vote. The question wasn't validated by the Court, it meant nothing . MR. SPINDLER : The people spoke. MR. EVANS: Excuse me, I'm talking . MR. SPINDLER : Yeah. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. EVANS: The question was designed to fail, the question basically read, "Let us borrow $4 million so we can raise your taxes." No one is going to vote for that question , so I don't have much credence in that 26,000 vs. 14 because people the were deceived so with that said, I'll comment on the reassessment in future weeks. All I know is tax equity is a right for every single citizen and property owner in this county and the system is not equal. The system protects the wealthy , this system protects the well-off, that's who is getting all of the appeals. That's who gets to hire all the high fancy attorneys , not the little old lady who is paying her fair share day in and day out. So this is a very volatile issue, I understand that, but we have to get the facts around this issue and I certainly appreciate everyone 's opinion , I happen to disagree because that is just my opinion and I'll continue to be a voice for reassessment . That's all I have tonight . Oh, one more thing, I think, I sound 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 like Mr. Gaughan . I want to leave you this one quote by Stephen Hawking , "The greatest of knowledge is not ignorance , it's the illusion of knowledge ." That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, just a few. First of all, Ms. Marriotti got up and spoke and I appreciate that. Very well said. I, too, was impressed with the rally that was held this weekend , the Never Again Movement and I do think as one of the young people had said it's not a movement -- or it's not a moment it is a movement so I am very encouraged by all the young people that are continuing to voice their concerns and to get involved . And I would encourage young people to run for office and to continue to be interested in local government . We have another young student who has been coming to the meetings , Abby Walsh, she goes to Holy Cross High School and she wants to be involved in local government so she has been coming to the caucuses and to the meetings 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 and we are actually discussing how we can get young people even more involved in our government so I just want to say thank you again, that was great. I attended a Bullshead neighborhood meeting and one of the main issues was the Lace Works project , so I did ask Mrs. Reed if she could get an update on how that is progressing . Last week I mentioned the issue with the business administrator moving from his position to a position in OECD. We did receive the title of the position . It is the economic development specialist and the salary is $43,000. Now, my question was to the administration how can they make that move because there is line item in the budget for that position . We did get a response from the city's solicitor and she said the following: "The salary for the position of economic development specialist is a hybrid of two vacant positions with within OECD. This salary entails an interdepartment al transfer authorized by the business administrator pursuant to 6-13 of the City's Administrative Code which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 expressly states that the business administrator shall have the power to authorize the transfer of any unexpended balance of any appropriation item or any portion thereof within a department ." And then it goes onto cite File of the Council No. 29-1994 which was repealed by File of Council No. 195-2003, and it goes onto say that the administration was acting well within it's authority to conduct the interdepartmental transfer for the salary of the newly appointed economic development specialist . I did ask attorney Minora in caucus to research this further because my concern here, I understand that they combined two salaries from two vacant positions , but my concern is that the title Economic Development specialist , is not an actual line item in the budget, so I am concerned because we are dealing with federal funding from HUD, we wouldn't want to put that in danger and have to pay money back so I did ask Attorney Minora if he would look into whether or not the administration violated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the Administrative Code or the Home Rule Charter. Again, I understand combining two vacant positions , but what I don't understand is that this council voted on a 2018 budget and that position Economic Development specialist was not in the budget. There was no line item for it. So hopefully we'll have an answer on that by next week. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just a couple of items. Agenda Item 6-A will be tabled this evening and sent to the County Panning Commission for a 30-day comment period. The legislation is tentatively expected to appear before council again on April 30 with a public hearing to be scheduled for that night as well. I did want to bring up a bit of good news, I know we had so much positive energy in here tonight so we'll keep it going, we did receive a press release from the mayor's office that was issued today regarding the city's streetlight program and the release reads: This year the City of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 applied for the Governor 's award for environmental excellence and is pleased to announce it has received this distinction for it's LED street lighting conversion project . The awards for environmental excellence are awarded in and by the Department of Environmental Protection to highlight the best in environmental innovation and expertise . This project focused on replacing streetlight fixtures and refinishing painted aging poles and installing lighting controls . By replacing the streetlight system, the city reduced it's energy consumption and maintenance , improved optical control , visibility , increased safety and decreased hazardous waste and energy consumption . LED technology has been found to be the least environmentally harmful lighting source available . The system also managed software in realtime and provides the city with data on use and action, histories and diagnostic registered system failures , load failure s, field outages and line volt changes . LED 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 lighting is increasingly emerging as a way to capture energy efficiency savings locally , statewide , nationally across the globe. The new LED lighting is saving the City of Scranton approximately $32,000 per month. That's quite a staggering sum of money. The project has major benefits to the overall community of Scranton with respect to safety, including facilitating the work of neighborhood watch groups and law enforce ment. So I did want to read that bit of good news to end the meeting. I do want to thank Mayor Courtright and his administration for their leadership on this issue and getting the streetlight program up and running throughout every nook and cranny of Scranton . That's all. MS.
