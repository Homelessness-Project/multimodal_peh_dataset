MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for all those who have passed away recently in our community . Let us also take a special moment of silence tonight for people in our community and throughout the world who are suffering or who have passed away from the coronavirus . May those who are sick receive the proper treatment and recover . And may their caregivers , families and neighbors be shielded from the onslaught of this virus. Let us give solace to those who grieve the loss of their loved ones. And let us thank the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . We continue to hope that their work may conquer this disease and restore communities to wholeness and health. Whether we are home or abroad, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 surround ed by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together , persist and prepare together . And in place of our anxiety , let us continue to hope and find peace. Okay. Thank you. Miss Carrera , roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Here. At this time I want to take a moment to read a proclamation into the record. This proclamation celebrates the retirement of one of our own here in Scranton , James Thomas otherwise known as -- his friends call him Sam Thomas. I think some of you know him. He ran and operate d a barbershop in West Scranton for 44 years and recently retired. So we're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 taking a moment from our Council meeting today and we are going to honor Mr. Thomas. So I would like to read this proclamation into the record now. And I know that Mr. Thomas and his family and his wife Carol are currently watching . WHEREAS , the COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON is desirous of honoring “JAMES THOMAS” as he celebrates his retirement after 44 years of ownership of the James Thomas Barber Shop in West Scranton ; and WHEREAS , "JAMES" was born and raised in Scranton and is the son of the late James and Eleanor Thomas. He is brother to Mary Jane, Lori, Eleanor , George and Patrick . James has been married for 46 years to his wife, the former Carol Wheeler . They are the parents of a son James and his wife Eva and the proud grandparents of Lars and Samantha ; and WHEREAS , after “JAMES” graduated from West Scranton High School Class of 1970, he attended the Wilkes-Barre Barber Institute . Upon receiving his license from barber school, he worked for Altieri 's Barber Shop in downtown Scranton for two years then opened his own shop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 on Main Avenue in West Scranton ; and WHEREAS , “JAMES” has been involved in many organizations , including , as an officer in the West Scranton Business Association , Secretary /Treasurer of the Master Barbers and Beauticians Association , West Scranton Little League, and Cub Master at the Hyde Park Presbyterian Church. He is a member of the Trinity Congregational Church. NOW, THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED , that on TUESDAY , JULY 28, 2020, Scranton City Council wishes to congratulate “JAMES THOMAS” on his retirement , for his commitment and dedication to the various organizations in which he has served and for being a successful Scranton business owner for 44 years. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that this Proclamation be made a permanent part of the Record of this Council , as lasting tribute to “JAMES THOMAS." And signed by the members of Scranton City Council . I just want to take a second again to thank Mr. Thomas. One of things that I also want to say about him, he's been a long time member of the City Planning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Commission and has really been an asset to our community . His wife Carol has been an asset to our community as well. They're just a great family, great Scranton people. And to run and operate a business for 44 years in this community is an outstanding accomplish ment. So I once again wish him and his family the best and hope that he enjoys his retirement . Anyone else want to add anything ? I know some of you know Mr. Thomas. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I just want to say the best of luck to Mr. Thomas in his retirement. And I had the pleasure of serving with him and getting to know him on the City Planning Commission . MR. GAUGHAN : That's right. Yes. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, this is a wonderful tribute to a great West Sider. Congratulations . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Congratulations . DR. ROTHCHILD : Congrats . MR. GAUGHAN : All right. There will be a motion this evening to move Item 6-A to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Seventh Order for a final vote. And there will also be motions to amend Item 7-A and 7-B. And Solicitor Hayes will go through those on the question when we get to those agenda items. MR. DONAHUE : I would also like to make a motion to table Item 7-G and 7-I. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, we're tabling both of these items tonight . Number one, we talked about one of them with the Mayor, the acceptance of the equipment from Keystone Sanitary Landfill . We're still waiting for more documentation on that. So we want to make sure we dot our I's and cross our T's before we officially accept that equipment . And also on 7-I, Solicitor Hayes, I know the reason -- can you just restate the reason why we -- why we're going to table that legislation , just restate from last week. ATTY. HAYES: Sure. With regard to Item 7-I, it's a resolution requesting that the Pennsylvania Department of Health permit the City to form a City Health Department . Concerns I had -- I think what Council said is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 we're fully supportive of exploring the creation of a City Health Department . The concern that I raised was the citation to the Local Health Administrative Law I thought may only pertain to counties and not necessarily municipalities that are situated like the City of Scranton . So I reached out to the Law Department and I'm going to work with them in recrafting a resolution that doesn't make reference to that particular law. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I mean, I had some concerns about the propose d function of the department and the propose d budget of the department and also, you know, why the department went defunct in the past as well as it was just stated in our memo from the Mayor that it would be an outside source. So I'd love to know the outside source that's going to fund that department . MR. GAUGHAN : I think the goal -- I think the -- in speaking with the Mayor, I think the whole kind of idea behind it was to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 form an exploratory committee , which would I would be in favor of just to explore the idea. And then at the end of that process to be able to say either this is a good idea or not a good idea. So I think the fact that the Mayor and the administration want to form a committee is a good thing rather than just launching into this idea. However , I agree with Mr. Schuster and Solicitor Hayes that we want to make sure we're doing it the right way and not passing something that is potentially unnecessary . So anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just from my knowledge , again, Mr. Hayes, what other cities in the state have this department ? ATTY. HAYES: Well, I know for certain that the city of Wilkes-Barre has some type of Department of Health because I have seen reference made to it in press articles . I don't know that it was formed pursuant to the Local Health Administrative Law. But since we raised concerns at our last meeting , the Mayor has indicated that she is just simply interest ed in forming an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 exploratory committee and whether this health department resides within the county government or within city government that's -- she's open to any proposal . It's just to start getting the ball moving. So I think the revised resolution that you guys will see will be reflective of what the real intent is here and that is to just start forming an explora tory committee on it. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. Yeah, I've been looking into Wilkes-Barre. It seems like the health department runs similar to Code Enforcement or the LIPS Department . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, my only concern is, so if it's going to be privately funded that's wonderful . But is it for one year and then we're left paying the salaries and the City is left, you know, covering the cost of that department ? I've seen that happen before in different entities. So it's just a concern of mine. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 ATTY. HAYES: Well, I mean, ultimately we approve the budget. So if it's not funded in the budget then it can't really function from our standpoint . MR. GAUGHAN : Correct . Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Item 7-G and 7-I have been tabled. Mrs. Reed, please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MS. REED: Thank you. THIRD ORDER. 3-A. TAX ASSESSOR ’S REPORTS FOR HEARING DATES HELD JULY 22 AND JULY 23, 2020. 3-B.

LIQUID FUELS TAX FUND INDEPENDENT AUDITOR ’S REPORT FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY 1, 2018 TO DECEMBER 31, 2018 RECEIVED JULY 24, 2020 FROM COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL . MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd like to make a comment . Looking at the 3-E, the fuel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 card analysis and we did get a public comment about the same thing. But when I was looking at it, I thought the same exact thing, was there is no comparison to previous years. So maybe if we did have a comparison to previous years that may be a help. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Any other comments on any of the Third Order items? All right. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. Let's see here. So over here in West Side, the Victor Alfieri Society normally has their monthly luncheon at their facility . But moving forward , actually being the one this Thursday -- they're normally on Thursdays . These will be held at outside at the Villa Maria II. There will be plenty of room for seating . Wear your mask to enter and be seated and also when you're moving around. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other announcements from anyone? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. SCHUSTER : I had a few. The Electric City Steel Drum Project is performing authentic steel drum band music every Thursday night from seven to eight, weather permitting on the roof of the parking tower at the Marketplace at Steamtown . These performances are free. And you're allowed to bring a lawn chair and a friend. And they're saying that they are outdoors so there is plenty of room for social distancing and you could check out their website at Ecsteel.org. Also, there was a nice memorial this Saturday . I was unable to attend the Memorial Stadium for the veterans memorial down there. And there was a nice article in the paper over the weekend about the owners of Kelly's which was a delight to see. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I have two announcements . First, the Black Box Cafe which is in the old Ritz Building on Wyoming Avenue, they have a new menu that they put out. And it looks amazing . I haven't gotten to try it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 because of their hours and my work schedule . But they are open Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. And they do free delivery to downtown . So I just wanted to make the public aware of that. They could find out more on their Facebook page. And then the other thing over the weekend I stopped at one of our farmers markets , the South Side one to just pick up some fresh meat and eggs. And I just wanted to remind the public that we have some wonderful farmers markets within our City. We have like the co-op one which has some different hours and then the south one. I know they're open Saturday s. So it's a great way to be able to support our local community and our local farmers to buy local. And it can certainly be a healthier option too. So I just encourage people to visit the farmers markets. And they're outside and everyone adheres to the guidelines and wearing masks. So it's -- I believe it's safe. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any announcements ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. DONAHUE : No. MR. GAUGHAN : No? Okay. I have one. I wouldn't be able to show my face in North Scranton if I didn't mention this one. Mary Mother of God Parish at Holy Rosary Church in North Scranton will be having a drive through block party this Friday, July 31st and Saturday , August 1st from 4 to 8 p.m., both nights. The block party will be held on church grounds at 316 Williams Street. There will be food and basket raffles . For more information and preorders, you can call 570-342-4881, extension 122 or you could go to www.marymotherofgodparish .org. And you can look up at Mary Mother of God Parish on Facebook or Instagram. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Bev DeBarros , Patricia Nestor, Tom Coyne, Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , as I mention every week, we review the -- all Council members review the public comment prior to the meeting . We take the public comment up until 4:30 the day of the meeting. And I just want to say since we're coming up on the last meeting before the August recess and we come back in September , we have -- I have personally went in and went through every public comment , taken every question and if the question were to be sent to an appropriate department , I put that in an e-mail to Mrs. Reed and Mrs. Reed has forwarded that to the appropriate department . For the most part, Mayor Cognetti has gotten answers back relatively quickly on I'd say 90 percent of the questions . Some of those questions take a little bit more time and digging to get the information . But I do think we have a good system in this COVID-19 world, not what we're used to; but I think it's worked out pretty well so far. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 We are being very responsive to the public and the public's questions . So similar to the past few months, I will send any and all questions to the administration and any questions related to legislation , obviously we will -- we will address . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion to accept public comment , signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (The following are e-mails submitted to Council for Public Comment .) (Bev DeBarros ) Dear Council ~ who thought it was a good idea to have non-commercial fireworks exploding in our city neighborhoods at 7 AM and throughout the day til 9 PM ? How about 7 PM til 9 PM ? And limit the days, to 2 days prior 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 to and 2 days after a holiday seems enough to me. Bev DeBarros 914 Quincy Ave (Patricia Nestor) I read the paper about Scranton 's chief marketing exec that some people call mayor. She's marketing Scranton to big city people with big city paychecks to come here and work remotely in what she calls affordable housing . She doesn't bother fixing the problems for the poor citizens who already live here. Her plan is to tax us out of our homes and replace us with wealthy New Yorkers . Might as well fire up the old iron furnace and throw us in. You'll need a plan for our bodies after we are taxed to death. The New Yorkers aren't going to like the smell. Her trying to replace us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Scrantonians started with the flag. Get rid of the flag and then get rid of the people. We don't need people from NYC coming here to live in our “big affordable houses so they have room to stretch out like” our marketer in chief says. The people who need more space are the homeless families crammed into tiny motel rooms like the Rodeway Inn, etc. Everyone is building luxury apartments when families need affordable housing . We need to take care of our own. Ecclesiastes 4:1. Another question . The mayor says housing in Scranton is affordable . Then why do her friends need waivers to live outside the city? Why hasn't she bought a house in Scranton herself ? Discuss . (Tom Coyne) Greetings members of City Council , Last week's entry seems to have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 confusing due to my laptop needing a new keyboard , as it is also activating my touch mouse and moving comments all over the place. The parts that were moved improperly are added here. Correction -Fireworks Smoke producing Item and the category of fireworks listed as Silent fireworks /noiseless fireworks . I also believe that firecrackers should be allowed with parental permission or someone over 21 supervising . Though they do produce reduced noise they are effective for small groups and use with music accompaniment . For large displays they are not practical . Cities have adopted them due to pets, PTSD, and younger kids who are trying to sleep. ** Should have the highlighted moved to the end Smoke producing Item and the category of fireworks listed as Silent fireworks /noiseless fireworks .

Onto New issues PEL expects a 2.3 million shortfall , the city expects a 6-8 million shortfall , if the act 511 appeal fails, the City would be looking at a shortfall estimate of - 12.3 for PEL and 16-18 mil based on random un-backed City guesses . (Marie Schumacher ) INPUT FOR FOURTH ORDER OF 29 JULY 2020 SCRANTON CITY COUNCIL MEETING O 5F on last week's Agenda listed the COVID-19-related expenses . Please provide a like accounting of the savings over that same time period (salaries , utilities , etc.) o Per Code, the Mayor shall submit to the Council to the Council at least three months prior to the final date for the submission of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the budget. As this falls smack dab in the middle of your month of August would you please direct the Clerk to make this available to the Public when received ? O I stand against 7A &B as they are impossible to equitably enforce . I oppose 7I as you are trying to transfer the City's problem to Federal Taxpayers . Do you really believe the Federal taxpayers should help bailout some municipalities as they certainly can't bailout all local and state revenue shortfalls . I call this greed. Perhaps the City could address other ways to balance the budget that aren't dependent on the workers . O I seem to recall the local newspaper reporting on which health inspections did not meet code. I considered this a public service for consumers . It sure would be nice to know whether or not a restaurant or other food service t is experiencing health issues when deciding where to dine. When may we expect a running report on where health inspections were accomplished and passed or failed.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 O Is there a date scheduled for the electronics recycling ? O Agenda Item 3C provides an impressive resume with knowledge of the Downtown familiarity with parking issues. o Agenda item 3E would be more helpful if it showed the figures for the prior year so I suggesT you request this be added to the Report. O Agenda item 3D shows the Police Department overtime is $75 thousand dollars over year-to-date budget. This is a concern for two main reasons : (1) it does not comport well with the 2015 Agreement and (2) the Mayor and Police Chief announced significant cutbacks on issues to which the Police will not respond leaving citizens to complete their own Reports on line and not all households have the internet required . How much revenue did the two Code Enforcers that were part of the 2015 Agreement bring in to help offset this significant overrun ? Please have the Controller provide the revenue by month.. How is this issue being addressed and what plan does the Council have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 to rein in these overruns ? O Agenda items 3H shows a Liquid Fuels Tax balance of $657,107 at the end of 2018. Why was a balance such as this remaining when our roads and bridges are so needy of work? When do you expect the 2019 Audit and what was the balance at the end of 2019? O Agenda Item 3F more or less answers when we should expect the Audit. Sadly the outstanding items needed to complete the Audit are needed from the City. Why? Were any employees responsible to these provisions considered "non-essential " and furloughed ? Also, the Scranton Redevelopment Authority , as pointed out many times from the Podium, use a different fiscal year. Perhaps Council needs to request they convert to a calendar year fiscal year and this "problem " delaying the Audit will disappear . O Agenda item 2B, once again I ask who is representing the City at the Tax Assessor 's Hearings ? I believe all taxing bodies are allowed to participate . Finally , I would ask Dr. Rothchild to report on what the City will provide to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 address the Homeless situation . Surely between the City, federal OECD funds, and far-too-many empty buildings a plan should be in place before the frigid temperatures arrive. Incidentally , are you able to obtain current Census figures for the number of homeless in the City? (Fay Franus) I am asking for you to get a full report of every penny Scranton Tomorrow spent with money they received from grants and from Scranton and from The University of Scranton . CI want to know exactly what this money was spent on and what any remaining money not spent will be spent on. We need complete transparency from them. Please not even think of telling me to do a right to know. It is your job to gather this information for us. I also want to say when the University of Scranton gives Scranton money in lieu of taxes and they proceed to dictate how this money is to be spent I am counting on you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 to put every dollar the University of Scranton gives you into the operating budget. Who are they to tell you how to use this money considering they have taken millions off of our tax rolls that we must make up for. Scranton Tomorrow only cares about downtown . Most of the people in this city live in neighborhoods not downtown . Why this city is handing out money to this group shocks me-- when our neighborhoods are going down the tubes. Your priorities are all messed up. I also need to hear from each council member as to why they do NOT feel our questions and comments should be read aloud? Bill Gaughan has told me his views but no other council member has. I seriously want to know EXACTLY why EACH AND EVERY council member does not feel the people need to hear questions and comments ? You surely have the time to read aloud our comments and questions . One meeting was over in 16 minutes another 30 minutes -- so time is not the issue. If we were there in person you would have to hear what we say and people watching would hear as well THEY SHOULD. So I would appreciate it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 if I heard from each of you, your reasoning for not reading aloud our questions . I do not want to hear "People can go on line and read what we asked or said". That is a cop out-- You know as well as i do that many people have no access to computers nor will they look. Bottom line I want to hear from you . I've asked this of you before with no response . This practice needs to stop. Fay Franus (End of Public Comment .) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS.

MCANDREW : Not at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just wanted to add that even since our last meeting I've receive d a few e-mails with different complaints . And I forwarded them along to Mrs. Reed who then sent them off to the appropriate departments . And so over the next month even though we wouldn't be meeting weekly I will continue to follow up on those requests and complaints . I wouldn't go through them all right now since I sent them along. But I just wanted to let people know that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just a couple followups from last week. We did send correspondence to the Northeast Railroad Authority regarding the railroad crossings that Dr. Rothchild did bring up last week. And we did get a response . And the response is basically they're aware of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 current condition of the crossing . And they're working on obtaining materials and scheduling with the pavement contractor for repairs and they will keep us updated as they move along. Also, you know, we made the motion to send correspondence to Kohanski . And that was in Third Order. So we -- the Mayor gave us some updates on the paving list we requested the information on that that's really just going to be delayed hopefully and not, you know, cut complete ly. It's just going to be delayed into 2021. So it won't affect our liquid fuels. That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I have a few things. First, I just want to say that to piggyback on what Councilman Schuster had said, I had the opportunity to speak at the event this Saturday down at Scranton High School which dedicated the memorial honoring all of those residents from Scranton who gave the ultimate sacrifice from -- and who died in WWI up until Afghanistan and Iraq. There was over 900 names on this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 monument . And if you haven't had the opportunity to get down and take a look at it, I highly recommend it. It's really one of the great assets that we have in the City of Scranton . And I personally want to thank Commander of the VFW Post 25, Jim Kuchwara and Pat Ahern who was the Committee Chairman for all of the work that they did. And as I said in my comment s this past Saturday at the dedication , it's easy to form a committee . It's easy to have an idea. But it's another thing to actually get it done. And the amount of time and the level at which these guys operated over the last few years to get this project complete d was unbelievable . So they really have to be commended . And it's a great opportunity for not only Scranton High School but West Scranton High School, all of our schools in the City to be able take the -- these student s down there and to teach them about our veterans and those 900 -- over 900 men and women who gave their lives for our country right from our City. We have a really rich history of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 military service here in Scranton . So if you didn't have an opportunity to get down there, please take a look. It's something to see. I just wanted to go through a couple citizens ' issues that we have already sent to appropriate department . There was quality of life issues on North Bromley Avenue and some serious quality of life issues in the 300 block of North Sumner Avenue. So we did send that to the Department of Licensing and Inspections . I also want to take a second to just thank the DPW Director and the DPW workers for their quick response to many of the issues that have been reported over the last few weeks. It doesn't go unnoticed , especially from citizens throughout Scranton . I've actually in the last two weeks received three calls from people, one on East Mountain and two in other parts of the City who were just impressed with the speed at which these issues have been taken care of. And even if the issue couldn't be taken care of right away, they were informed that it was going to be looked at and were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 really spoken to in a professional manner. So I just want to say that I really do appreciate that. I know that we submitt ed a Right To Know -- Mrs. Reed submitted a Right To Know regarding information that we had wanted from the Recycling Center. We did receive something from Solicitor Tom Cummings late today. I really haven't had the chance to go through it. But, Solicitor Hayes, do you want to speak about this? ATTY. HAYES: Yes. This afternoon we receive d a response from Tom Cummings who is the Solicitor for the Lackawanna County Solid Waste Management Authority . As you recall, Council directed me to submit a letter on July 8th to the County Commissioners in response to a meeting that was held on July 7th where the county announced that they would be implementing this new Recycling Program requiring municipalities to make contributions for depositing commingled recyclables . And what we -- what Council directed me to ask is why we're making changes to the program when there was an existing agreement in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 place. The -- what had been reported to the municipalities was that this change was needed as a result of the county no longer supplying inmate labor at the Recycling Center. So basically what -- from what I could see -- again, I just got this -- received this response this afternoon is that Attorney Cummings basically said that the -- providing inmate labor was an essential part of the agreement . As a result of that no longer being provided , they needed to amend it. The amendment was not approved until July the 16th so after the announcement had already been made that there was going to be this new program being implemented . And he provided -- Attorney Cummings had provided us with the names of the Authority who are Richard Miller, Manuel Griffen , Al Lawrence , and Al Senofonte . And this new pricing program again was approved on July 16th so after the announcement had been made that they were going to be imposing these new pricing -- this new price schedule upon the municipalities . But at the conclusion of his letter, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Attorney Cummings indicate d that he would make himself available to answer any questions that Council may have. So that may be an opportunity for Council to revisit this issue and understand why this change was made and what it means going forward . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. You know, I continue to -- I appreciate the response . And I look forward to having a discussion with Solicitor Cummings and hopefully in September . You know, I just feel that the hole thing was rushed. I found out about the meeting at the 911 Center literally a day before. And to me it seemed -- you know, it seems like we're -- the Solid Waste Management Authority is doing this to the benefit of the operator because they can't have prison labor. Now we're paying $40 a ton. There's still questions outstanding of whether or not we can actually use the DEP funding our -- its 904 performance grant to offset that cost moving forward . And the unfortunate thing really is that we would normally use that grant funding to pay for a recycling truck or to pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 for different things at the DPW. So I look forward to receiving more information about that. Before we recess here for the month of August, I want to bring up just two things that I am concerned about. And I have raised these before as has Councilman Donahue . And I know the Mayor was here tonight . And she had stated that with the sale of refuse receivables they are, you know, still evaluating that and they're still going to attempt to get that out -- put out an RFP. I would like to see that and I would like to see that as soon as possible because I'm really concerned that we're cutting it awful close here to the end of the year. Within our budget this year under sale of assets, the refuse receivables , we had pegged that in and the former administration had pegged that in at $1,520,823.89. It is imperative -- it is imperative that that RFP go out as quickly as possible and that we vote on that whatever way the bid comes in. Hopefully it comes in at that amount. But again, I just -- I know how long these -- these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 things take. And one hiccup or one unforeseen circumstance and I just don't want to be at the end of the year and not have that money because that will blow a major hole in the budget. And we already are going to have budgetary problems . The other concern is -- and I don't know that we can do anything about this is the revenue that's in the budget for the Payroll Preparation Tax. That's obviously not going to come in because we don't have the Payroll Prep Tax implement ed for various reasons . But that was pegged at $647,918. So the total of those two is a little bit over 2 million dollars . So based on what the Mayor said tonight , I am hopeful that we are going to get the RFP and the -- hopefully this will work out. But again, I'm just concerned we're at the end of July going into August. Our first meeting back is September 1st. And I know how quickly things move. So we'll really have to keep an eye on that. The other thing that I'd like to talk about I understand the paving project is not going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 be occurring this year. I know there was an OECD paving project , but the paving project with liquid fuels money with City funds won't be occurring until next year. The Mayor had stated from what I could see in her memo that that was due to the pandemic and things that happened with that. I would just say that, you know, I don't understand why the RFP for engineering was not put out earlier in the year. I don't know whose fault that was exactly or who dropped the ball on that. But historically the RFPs went out, you know, February and March. I understand the pandemic hit in March. But it is disappointing that there won't be any paving using those funds this year. The last thing I want to bring up -- and this was touched on in the caucus with the Mayor was Northeast Revenue Services . Now Northeast Revenue Services has changed their name to Elite Revenue Services . So they do have -- they're under a -- under a different title. I was happy to hear from the Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 and Mr. O'Brien that they are in negotiations with this company and happy to hear from the Mayor that the -- she wants to get out of this contract hopefully by the end of this year. I just want to restate two of my concerns and one just my opinion that I've had now for quite a while. I think as I said last year when the corruption probe and the corruption -- the whole thing with Mayor -- former Mayor Courtright broke that this is, you know, getting out of his contract with Elite Revenue s, formally NRS is all about restoring the public's confidence in the City and the vendors that the City does business with. Continuing to do business the way it was done under the Courtright regime is wrong. So tonight I was pleased to hear that the Mayor does want to move in a different direction . My concern similar to with what I stated about the sale of assets and the potential implication in our budget is that we're cutting it close. I'm hopeful after what I heard tonight that we are going to be able to get this done by the end of the year. But again, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 from the conversation s that I had last year, I know that it takes a while. The transition takes a while. And I'm hopeful that we can get this done in the amount of time before the end of the year. The thing that concerns me is what was relayed to Council last year was that we were going to get out of the contract by the end of 2019. Obviously , that has come and gone. After it was revealed that NRS was referenced without being named in the federal corruption charges in July, 2019, we made it clear as a Council that we wanted to move -- we didn't want -- we didn't believe that the City should work anymore with NRS. And we felt that the City should move in a different direction . In April of 2019, we had requested that NRS at that time come to a public caucus to answer questions along with administration officials . And I had asked at that time to I believe Sean Shamany , an official in NRS, "Have you or anyone associate d with NRS given a gift to the current Mayor in exchange for a contract ?" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And Mr. Shamany at that time said, "Not that I recall." I also asked, "Are you or anyone associated NRS a part of any current FBI or other law enforcement investigation ?" Mr. Shamany said, "No." Then it was announced in October of 2019 by the Evans Administration , the contract with NRS would end in December of 2019. And Solicitor Eskra at that time had written a letter in October of 2019 basically stating -- stating that. In November of 2019, it was announce d that the county would take over collection of delinquent taxes from NRS. The County Commissions actually introduced an ordinance to have the county Tax Claim Bureau take over collections starting January 1st. That would include delinquent taxes from 2009 and earlier as well as going forward . Now, the county eventually tabled that vote at the request of Solicitor Eskra. They said at that time that they wanted to make sure that language and City legislation establishing the arrange ment more or less mirrored language in the county ordinance .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 But the delay of the vote didn't mean the partner ship was off in any way. Now, that was in November of 2019. There was a letter sent May 22nd, 2020, again from Jessica Eskra to NRS stating that they were going to terminate the contract now by the end of this year. There was an article June 4th, 2020, a headline, "City To End Contract With Tax Firm." And at that time Solicitor Eskra said that at this point we're still evaluating all of our options . And they were going -- still evaluating seeking professional service proposals on collection functions . I sent question s to the administration about that October letter that Solicitor Eskra had sent basically with things that she wanted to see from NRS. I had asked did they respond ? Was there any communication ? I sent that on June 9th and July 16th. Councilman Donahue requested an update on the NRS contract May 19th. And I have not received my specific answers to those specific questions that I had asked. So again, I'm hopeful after hearing the Mayor tonight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 that this will get done. But I still -- I have to relay my concerns to the public that I do think we're cutting it close. I think that this is so important and this has to be done because it is about restoring the confidence that the public has in our City and in our vendors that we do business with. You know, it's a little bit frustrating that we've been talking about this now for the last year. And it's disappointing to sit here in July and we still are not there yet. We're still talking about an RFP. We're still talking about working with county. There is no actual action that has taken place yet. So I would just, number one, like my questions answered that I previously submitt ed. And number two, am hopeful that when we come back here in September we are looking at legislation , an RFP or some kind of game plan to move forward away from this company . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 19, 2020 – AN ORDINANCE – PROHIBITING THE USE OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLE BRAKE RETARDERS ON THIRD AVENUE IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON BETWEEN ELM STREET AND BROADWAY STREET.

Just -- I just wanted to restate what I had said last week that I really want to thank the Mayor and her administration for moving quickly on the issues on Third Avenue. I know that the residents of Third Avenue are really pleased that something is being done. It's been relayed to them and unfortunately we can't stop the truck traffic from occurring there. But we can limit the brake retarders on the trucks that really have damaged their quality of life. So once this legislation is passed, I know that they are going to put signs up and they're going to start enforcing that. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 again, I want to thank everyone who was involved . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR.

MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to amend Item 7-A to incorporate the revisions outlined by Council Solicitor in his July 23rd, 2020 memorandum to Council , which is included in Third Order of the agenda for tonight 's meeting , specifically the amended ordinance will include the definitions of APA 87-1"; consume r fireworks and person. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Solicitor Hayes, can you just run through and explain the amendments that you had proposed after you researched the ordinance ? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. The Administra tive Law Department did a really nice job on crafting this ordinance which is intended to address an important issue which is our resident s are confronting . The intent -- my intent in adding revisions was to make it as clear as possible to the law enforcement officers and the district magistrate judges who will be interpreting and enforcing this ordinance so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 there's no question as to what constitutes a violation . So in short what I did was, we just added definitions with respect to consumer fireworks APA 87-1 so that they are identical to the definitions which are provided in the legislation which is currently pending in the Pennsylvania Senate which would hopefully be enacted and provide potential relief to the City of Scranton . But I wanted those definitions to be identical . And then also, I provided a definition of person so that it applies to both individual s and entities that may violate this ordinance . In other words, if a business or an association was launching fireworks in violation of this ordinance , they could be held responsible , culpable for those acts. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Solicitor Hayes. And just to note again that if anyone from the public would like to review the amendments , you can. It's in Third Order. I believe it's Item 3-G and the legislation -- the actual places where anything was added or removed , you could see that in the backup as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 well. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion to amend Item 7-A signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules I recommend final passage of Item 7-A as amended . Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just like Solicitor Hayes had noted, we are still waiting for the State House to act on a State Senate passed bill which would give the City of Scranton the ability to ban these sort of fireworks outright. And until we do that, until we get that from the state legislator , we can't -- this is as far as we can go. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. Roll call, please.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A as amended legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 15, 2020 – REGULATING THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF GASOLINE DIRECTLY INTO THOSE VEHICLES THAT FALL UNDER THE CLASS OF VEHICLES DEFINED BY 75 PA.C.S.A. 7702 AS BEING AN “ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE ” OR “ATV” OR A “SNOWMOBILE ” WHILE SAID VEHICLES ARE RUNNING AND PROVIDING FOR ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THIS ORDINANCE . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to amend Item 7-B to incorporate the revisions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 outlined by Council Solicitor in his July 23rd, 2020 memorandum to Council which is included in Third Order of the agenda for tonight 's meeting , specifically the amended ordinance will include the following , technical corrections related to the citation to Section 7702 and 7721 of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code and provide definitions for the following terms: Gas station , highway , person and street. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Solicitor Hayes, can you just go through this legislation and the amendments as well? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. Again, the Administration 's Law Department did a nice job in developing another piece of legislation which could restrict the amount of ATV activity and snowmobile activity on our streets . As you know, under the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, no ATVs or snowmobiles are permitted to operate on our highways or streets . So this propose s another restriction to hold the gas station s responsible if they allow these ATVs and snowmobile s to be operated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 and fueled at their gas stations . In order to assist our police officers and the magistrates in interpreting and enforcing this statute which we all hope will be -- will be utilized to limit the number -- the amount of activity we're seeing on our streets , I just put -- made some technical corrections with regard to citation s to Sections 7702 and 7721 of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code. In addition , in order to ensure clarity with regard to the interpretation and enforcement of this ordinance , I defined the terms gas station , highway , person and street so they're consistent with the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code or our own City Code specifically with regard to our City Code and its definition of gas station and gasoline products . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Solicitor Hayes. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , Solicit Hayes, in your opinion do you think this passing the enforcement of ATV riding onto the attendant or the clerks at the gas station ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 ATTY. HAYES: It applies to the -- I believe it would apply to the -- they wouldn't be -- it would be imposed on the gas station and its officers and directors -- its owners. So I don't see that it would be -- the definition of person or I'll read it to you would be -- it would be passed onto the officers and directors of that gas station . MR. SCHUSTER : So it would be the gas station owner that would be fined, not the actual attendant. ATTY. HAYES: That's correct . MR. SCHUSTER : Do you see that that might pass down to the attendant , I mean, in some sort of retaliation for loss of revenue or money? ATTY. HAYES: It could. I mean, that would be up to the individual -- the agreement between the employee and the gas station -- the employee and its employer . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, how about in your opinion , do you think this is putting another law on the books that maybe is unnecessary and that we should just continue to enforce the already law on the books that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 vehicle s can't be ridden on the city streets ? ATTY. HAYES: This is a policy decision for you the policymakers. Do I think -- let me tell you this. This type of legislation has been passed, adopted and enforced in other municipalities throughout Pennsylvania . So I assume -- and from what I've seen, it's been effective . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. But, I mean, without this -- this specific piece, the police officers and the police force in the City of Scranton could still enforce ATV riding on the streets , correct ? ATTY. HAYES: That's correct . This is just to provide one more tool to limit the amount of activity on our streets and highways by cutting off the source of fuel for these ATVs and snowmobiles . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion to amend Item 7-B signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : Opposed . MR. GAUGHAN : The ayes have it and so moved. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B as amended . MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to state, you know, over the last two or three months we have gotten inundated with complaints about people riding ATVs. I think everyone understand s that if you have an ATV, you want to use it. What we're saying is, you know, you can't be irresponsible . And there are a large amount of people whether it's because of the pandemic or I don't really know why who are using their ATVs in a completely irresponsible way. The bottom line is, you cannot ride an ATV on a City street. It's a state law. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 It's illegal . This legislation is another tool to get ATVs off the street. We have calls from East Mountain , North Scranton , West Scranton , South Scranton , Minooka . I had a woman who is very ill on East Mountain who is plagued by ATVs going up and down her street at all hours of the day, can't sleep, can't work, can't do anything because these people are constantly riding ATVs up and down the street. It's not like they're riding them in the woods or, you know, doing anything like that. They're doing wheelies up and down the street. I see my own neighborhood , young children without helmets on. It's just unsafe. It's unnecessary . It's a huge nuisance . And the vast majority of the people in our City that I've talked to want it to end. Is this an end-all be-all piece of legislation ? No. Will there still be ATV riders on our streets? Yes. Will this hopefully give the police department another tool in their toolbox to help our residents ? I think so. And that's why I'll be voting for it. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR.

I just want to say I hope everyone stays safe during the month of August and that when we come back hopefully we have good news on a treatment or a vaccine for this virus. I would just ask everyone to continue to stay vigilant . I think we have done a relatively good job in Scranton and in Lackawanna County in terms of if you look at other places around the country . But I do think it's important to follow the advice of the medical professionals to wear a mask when you're out in public and to continue to -- try to social distance when possible . I do know in speaking to some people over the last few weeks that there are groups 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 of people that are having a very difficult time with this in terms of mental health. And I would like to let people know and as I said before if you are having issues in that regard or if you're having issues in terms of not having enough food or a place to go, somebody to talk to, the City has done an outstanding job on the website www.scranton pa.gov in putting resources there for those who need it and those who don't have access to the resources that we have. And for those of you who cannot get to a computer , you can dial 211 and you will get hooked up with some of those resources . So again, I hope everyone stays safe and healthy and good luck to you and your families . And we will see everybody back here on September 1st.
