CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE MONTH ENDING MAY 31, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? I do have one. Our city is -- City Hall and DPW will be closed tomorrow , Wednesday in observance of Juneteenth. So both trash and recycling will be delayed by one day. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . My running total on the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the firefighter s are at day 440; for the police, 325. And we paid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 Ufberg and Associates $38,000 last month. So I'm just hoping that this doesn't all get settled like one month before the contract runs out in 2026. That will not be very amusing . I saw in the paper that there was a public forum on the Climate Action Plan on June 13th. And it was held entirely on Zoom. And I would have liked to have participated or at least observe d that. But I don't do Zoom. I don't do the internet at night. I only do that in the library . But it seems to me that something as important for the city as a Climate Action Plan should be open to the entire public. You know, we did the walkability study twice at Lackawanna College . So I hope if we readdress this issue, we don't have a Zoom only public forum. That's not very public. Did any of you happen to participate in that for any feedback ? No. Okey-dokey. I also saw in the paper that there was an RFP issued on June 1st for the Antiviolence Initiative and responses are due by June 17th. I would like to remind everybody including those watching this on ECTV that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 school district is closing for the summer. The library is open all summer long with all kinds of programs for children from infancy through 18 years. So there's something to do for children of all ages. And it's safe. It's educational and it's fun. And it's free. What more could you ask for. I saw in the paper a story on the progress of the cleanup of Roaring Brook after the little disaster with Pennsylvania American Water dumping all that silt. Have you had any further updates on how that project is going and whether we're going to be made whole again? MR. SMURL: Joan, I don't know how it's progressing . I do know they were cleaning , you know, down behind Chamberlain that big -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah. MR. SMURL: I know they just cleaned that out. And I assume that was from that silt that came down. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, if memory serves, the last Monday in July which I think is July 29th is the next Environmental Advisory 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Council meeting at 4 p.m., in the Governor 's Room. And Bernie McGurl is a member of that Council and hopefully will be able to update everybody on where we stand. It's a damn pity though what they did to Roaring Brook after all the work he and his associates did to clean up the Lackawanna River. It's just a crying shame. The heat wave, it's a two-fold issue. One is what we're doing to ensure our city employees are kept safe, especially those on DPW workers , maintenance , Parks and Rec, that their outdoor activities are tempered in such a way that they're not going to be victims of heat stroke, number one. There is nothing so essential that we have to make employees sick. Number two is, what about our homeless community ? Do we have the equivalent of a code red for people who are looking at these temperatures ? I mean, they are bad and with the humidity and with the heat. So what are we doing for the homeless ? What are we doing for the elderly who have no air conditioning ? What are we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 doing for our vulnerable citizens ? And I'm running out of time so you could answer that in Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton , resident . I want to start tonight by giving out thank yous to, you know, I was just so pleased to come in here tonight and see the gathering for Officer Gilmartin , you know, and to see him standing up and greeting people, you know, that's such a blessing that we have been allowed to see someone who was just so critical and to see him standing here and greeting us all and having his picture taken. So I thank the medical team, you know, at Geisinger . I guess they were the first ones that worked with him and then onto Philadelphia . So kudos to the medical staff that worked with him. And I know that each day as we prayed for him, our prayers were certainly answered as I saw him standing here tonight . I was able to get my picture taken with him which I was thrilled to do that and he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 was just so gracious to introduce himself to me and everything . So I thank whoever arranged that tonight . I also want to thank and wish all the student s that graduated from the Scranton School District this past -- I think it was Friday night that they graduated . I wasn't sure if it was just Scranton High and then West Side. But I'm sure that there were others that graduated as well. And for those that don't take the time to learn about our Scranton School District , just look at some of those kids and where they're going on to further their education . There's a lot of good things that are happening at the school district . I don't have any kids there. I don't know what I would do if I did have children that were coming through . But I do read a lot about the good things that are going on at our school district . And one of them was a testament to all the graduate s. And they were just so thrilled and excited to call themselves a graduate of the Scranton School district .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 The next thing I want to talk about is I guess it's advertisement is for our Electric City Flower Show. We have one more week. It will be a week this coming Saturday . And it's going to be at Nay Aug Park. And one of the things I wanted to let everyone know tonight is that the number 18 bus, I did find out, goes straight up Mulberry Street. You could catch it downtown I think at the transportation center. And that will take you right there to the Flower Show if you don't have transportation . Also, the museum is partner ed with us. And they will be doing activities for the children as well as far as face painting. I think there's going to be a balloon guy there as well as there's free admission to the museum. If anyone hasn't gone and taken the opportunity to go to the museum, you know, it's a rare treat that we have right here in the city to go to the museum and to see the things that are happening there. Also, as we go through the day with the flower show, there's going to be -- anyone that's been around knows 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 where the old zoo is. There's going to be children 's reading s over there. And we have been fortunate enough to find a huge chair that our readers will be sitting in and they'll be reading different stories to the children at that particular spot. And we do have the participation of the fire and the police department will be in that area down there so that the children will have their own sort of a little area down by the zoo as well as at the Everhart Museum as far as the activities that are going to go on as well. The time is 10:00. It starts at 10 and it goes to 4. So we're just hoping for good weather because it's rain or shrine. So we're hoping for good weather . Also at Nay Aug Park at Wednesday night at 6:00 we have concerts , you know, concerts in the park. And that just takes you back to maybe things that we did as a youth and you take your blanket and your folding chair and we have concerts in the park on Wednesday evenings . And then we also have them at 2:00 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 on Sunday afternoon . These concerts are local musician s that come to play. They usually play for two hours. And there's dancing if you want to get up and dance. There's people up by the podium that do dance. So it's a fun activity for two hours for not only adults because the children enjoy going there as well with their parents . The only thing that we do need to stress is that parking is becoming an issue at the concerts . So we don't want anyone to get a ticket and that did happen at one of the other recent concerts . So just obey the signs where they say no parking and just to, you know, know and do your duty and not park on the grass because , you know, the weight of those cars do affect the growth of the trees in the park. So that's it of what's going on at Nay Aug Park. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you, Council . This weekend I passed that Juneteenth affair at the church -- at the bank. And I mean to tell you there was a mob there. There was cars 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 probably all over the up and down the street. I passed there a little after seven. And there wasn't a spec of paper bigger than a postage stamp. I don't know how they cleaned that place up. But I'd sure like to commend the organize r for just an excellent job. And they could show the people with all of these affairs how to do it, how to conduct one. And occasionally , Council , someone will address this mismanaged Code Enforcement office that is allowed -- allowed by you people and this mismanaged bunch downstairs in the Mayor's office. They abuse their office, their positions . It's just -- it's just something has to be done. Last year Mr. Sunday gave me a ticket for a case of water sitting on an outside lawn chair because of all the trash next door. Then he lied like hell in Mr. Ware's court. I challenged him a half dozen times to come in here and he didn't do it. A few months ago I kept getting -- I got a letter and a notice blocking the door. It's a window. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 It's been a window for over 25 years. This week, here comes another bit of harassment . I'm not going to stand for this from Code Enforcement . If I don't follow their advice here they said they will have my house condemned in 30 days. It might be a favor the way they're raising taxes like they said on the news tonight . You people have a short memory. It was, I don't know, three or four years ago, August of 2021, mister -- I don't know how to say his name properly -- Valor Garanin . He won $285,000 from the city. You want to know what for? Just harassment, exactly what's going on with me and the city. And this -- I got it right here if you don't believe me. He was given $285,000 because Code Enforcement employees disliked him. I told my son. He didn't believe me. Right here in the paper that's the reason he was given that. Here I go through this nonsense . She said a walk in -- she didn't see an antique plate that's been on my car since '96. That's like 30 years. She said no license plate. Antique cars don't have to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 inspected . She said there's no inspection . Besides that, it should be a state issue. She mentioned something trash next to the house. The only trash I know of is the two people next door. And they have been trimming the trees left and right for years. All of a sudden he complained I didn't trim the tree that's in the backyard . I could do that but it hangs over next door. It hangs over an illegal fence that's on my property . They won't allow me on my own property to fix the garage roof a few years ago, yelled and screams . So I didn't fix it properly . And the car and the thing -- let's see what else was it, three of them here they complained about. How could this woman have so much power and abuse. She is completely -- it's like Lee Morgan said a couple weeks ago. They're not trained for these things. And if you have a car cover on something , it's none of their business what goes on under the car, just like boat covers all over the city. They're not a Code Enforcement issue if it's covered up with a tarp. Next week I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 get into this issue with my neighbor . Twenty years I have been arguing with them and fighting with them and going to court. She stood right here saying I fell through my garage roof. I'm growing marijuana in the driveway because I have a -- you can't imagine what I'm going through . Now they're complaining about a tree that's hanging over in their property . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That's all that is signed in. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Some of my glory was stolen from our first speaker here, but hearing it a second time isn't going to hurt anyone. First, when are the statement of financial interest going to be up on the city's web page? We still have 2022s and 2023s are missing from the uploaded from the city's information page. The deadline was May 1st to get them in. So we've had 49 days to actually scan the documents . What's the delay in actually getting them up there for the public to actually see them?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Second, have we figured out yet if Iron Mountain Shredding is actually a good solution or are we still under advisement for how to take care of papers in the city? And last, I looked to tonight 's agenda. Then I looked to the Scranton Times and I laughed . Scranton plans to hire a consultan t for an invention program for its Antiviolence Initiative . Though we already paid for one consultant , it was pushing that former military are the biggest threat for radicalization . But when pressed they balked and said, well, that is not what we intended to say. Pay us, and we'll deliver a solution . I guess the solution is to pay the consultant . And then when violence continues while the consultant is working on it, just to hire another consultant . I looked at the article and noted the sacred words by identifying stakeholders . But the only one able to afford steak in this city are those contractors and city workers who do not have to live in Scranton . Maybe the stakeholder should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 changed to let them eat cake holders . The first priority we're looking for is the ability to partner and maintain relationships with nonprofits . Hell, I don't even think we've had a single pilot donation this year. But nonprofits are our priority and violence . Let's be real for a moment. We're hiring two separate consultant s to come up with plans. They're each going to provide separate solution . Since there's a conflict in the direction s, we're going to have to form a Mayor's task force or a committee or maybe a new blog. They will argue and parse. And after much mashing of teeth, we'll have a new plan that looks nothing like what the advisors actually proposed . Then it will be time to put the plan into motion. But, wait, we don't pay for anything . So we'll at the very end start the search for federal grants and other funding so we could hire another outside contractor who will have to make an implementation plan first in stages. One of the key goals listed is helping youth move away from a deeper 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 involvement in the juvenile justice system. But we don't have that. There are no facilities and punishment . It's a turn style and they all know that. We are almost half done at the year. How have we done helping ? Code red for heat, we'll think about it. That was from the smoke from Canada last year. Homeless , we don't want them, not willing to fix the issue. Let's look at the Controller 's report on the books tonight in our effort for humanity . Hunger initiative , allocated $10,000, spent nothing ; homeless outreach, allocated $10,000, spent nothing ; youth engagement , allocated $20,000, spent nothing ; beautiful blocks, allocated $40,000, spent nothing ; veterans organizational , allocated $85,000, spent nothing : It all looks good on the budget to have these humanitarian issues as well as at the end of the year it can be line itemed over to covering overtime or maybe a new outside contractor . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Virgil Argenta , Scranton . How long is too long for a refrigerator with its doors still on it to sit on a front porch of a seven-unit apartment building with young children living at it? 1107-1109 Fisk Street has had one on the front porch for the last three weeks. Code enforcement stated a sticker was put on the property and no one respond ed. So what do we do when there's a serious threat to the danger of children ? Do you know how to handle that? Infrastructure repairs, are there any being done in the City of Scranton ? Most crosswalks in town and neighborhoods seem to be nonexistent . Walls and bridges are crumbling . Light poles are either cut in half or held up by other poles. Traffic lights are held up with metal straps. And most traffic signals are (inaudible ) discolored , bent, or free falling . What do you think of the Friday night adult swim chaos at Montage ? Are we prepared for more of that? Come January , our police officers go to 12-hour shifts. Has anybody really investigated this? Has anybody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 looked into the pros and cons of 12-hour shifts for police officers ? Maybe you should. The only one that will benefit from this is the city. Council , will you able to provide the total number of city employees who are currently receiving unemployment compensation benefit s? Will you be able to provide the number of employees that were directors or held key positions within the city collecting unemployment benefits ? Will you provide the number of employee s that were terminated and the number of employee s who have resigned? Will you provide the number of cases that are in litigation ? Can you produce the total cost incurred by the city due to unemployment benefits , including both direct payments , administrative expenses and labor attorney costs that us taxpayers in the City of Scranton are liable for. Did you get the number of applicants for the police test yet, the pass and fails? Any update on the Scranton Police promotional exam lawsuit ? Are the minutes of the meeting for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 the Housing Task Force meeting available that was conduct ed on Friday, May 17th, 2024? Is Council aware of the new towing and storage fee charges for city towers? How about the reason why they were hit with such a drastic reduction in fees? Is anybody aware of that? Will the city now not get their cut for the tows and storage fees due to the reduced fees? This is a good one. Do you know who is now tasked with checking and inspect ing towing facilities and their equipment ? Do you know who's handling that? It's not the police. Lackawanna Little League West Scranton Falcon Field for the mini Invaders , the stairs were damaged in the flood of September , '23. Will they be repaired before the start of the mini football season? Thank you, Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MENACHEM : Abiyah Menachem , Quincy Avenue in Scranton . MR. SMURL: Your last name, sir? MR. MENACHEM : M-E-N-A-C-H-E-M. It's been a few years since I've been here. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 believe it was for a Zoning Board, not a public Council meeting . So let's get right to it. On Thursday , the City of Scranton has arranged for the SRI Demolition to come in and destroy thousands of hours of my work that I built with permits for no reason. They claim it's hazardous . Why is it hazardous ? No answer. They claim it's debris. And it doesn't even resemble a structure . Well, anyone can look at it and see it's not debris. It's a structure . And my permit should still be valid. I should be able to build those. I shouldn 't have someone coming in and destroying it. But their intention is to but put a lien on my house for the cost of the demolition , which is close to $36,000. That's a lot of debris if that's all it is. It started with the yellow door tag, Code Enforcement Officer Mike Gowarty , January 5th, 2023. Kindly clean trash, less debris within 48 hours. Okay, so middle of winter, not really the time I'm going to be working outside . But I didn't have any trash, debris 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 other than under a tarp which we were trying to get a dumpster , etc. Turns out he was talking about my building materials on my front porch, which were messy looking , but nonetheless they were two by fours, OSB plywood . They weren't trash and debris. So cleaning up the actual trash and debris which I did, did nothing . Then he came out on the 9th and put three quality of life violations . I never saw them. I don't know who took them off the door. Maybe he did it. He filed a lawsuit February 22nd for a May 3rd hearing before the magistrate , didn't look at any of my evidence , guilty, guilty guilty. It was Commonwealth of Pennsylvania versus me. Unjustified three lawsuits , one of them was the debris which didn't exist, one of them was the tree in the backyard which I started cutting before I even bought the house because I thought this branch was dangerous so I had that cut off. And we trimmed it down. We were planning to cut the whole tree. It was the middle of winter. Maples don't have leaves. Code Enforcement said it's dead and dangerous. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I brought picture s before and after, guilty. And then the structures under construction , Code Enforcement said, oh, he didn't have permits for this. I said, Your Honor, I did have the permits . They're right here. She wouldn't look at any of my evidence , guilty, guilty, guilty, just fines though. A couple weeks later I was -- I got a stop work order. I went in when I had a stop work order. It was for violating a court order, which was the demolition that the magistrate had ruled I had to demolition everything . So we investigate d that. She didn't rule that. Code Enforcement never went in there to talk with the magistrate to get that ruling like they said they were going to do. Code Enforcement made up the ruling. I appealed . That was foolish . I went to Judge Jarbola in September . He called the building materials , oh, that's not trash and debris. But you know what is? The baby stroller , the broom, the kids' riding scooter s and that stack of plywood there. That's all trash and debris, guilty. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 And he threw out the tree immediately . The structures were their main intention . Their whole goal from the very beginning was to stop me midway of constructing things with permits that Mr. John Eastman, he was the code enforcement manager had lots of photos and he said you should get a second permit. So I did. Everything was fine until they hired the new Code Enforcement officer who cancelled our permits , came out and started giving tickets , sued me and in the next 20 seconds , I want to plead with you to stop them from destroying our structures . Thursday morning 8 a.m., they are planning to be there to rip down my privacy screen and destroy everything we built for the whole purpose of liening our house so they could throw my wife, our seven children and I in the street with nothing . I did send e-mails repeatedly . I've heard nothing . I would appreciate it if there is a more significant response to that like firing Tom Oleski, firing Mike Gowarty, etc., and stop the demolitions because the e-mails I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 sent should be enough. MR. SMURL: Thank you, sir. We have no jurisdiction or say over the Code Enforcement , nor the judge, nor the magistrate jurisdiction . There is nothing we could do to change any of their decisions . So I would definitely if you're looking to stop this, go back to court and get an injunction or try to stop it that way. But there is nothing I can do or Council can do to make anyone stop what has been going on. I apologize , but there is really nothing we can do. We can't stop that from happening. MR. MENACHEM : They pigeonholed it into Judge Jarbola who is let's say less than sympathetic to -- MR. SMURL: Okay, well, I'm not going to -- Attorney Gilbride , are we allowed to even speak of this if it's in court or if there's a court order to do this? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , it seems that your first recommend ation to Mr. Menachem is a correct one. If you are having a problem with the legal system, then you need -- I would suggest you talk to counsel , see if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 there's something that they could do to get that stopped . There are things in the law that can do that. But this Council cannot do that for you. It would have to come from a ruling from a court. So I would suggest if you haven't done so already , reach out to some Council and see if they could get this stopped before Thursday . MR. MENACHEM : I've talked with attorneys . I filed legal petition s myself, got the first one signed. The second one had to go through Judge Jarbola . They said no other judge can have anything to do with this. And, of course, he's not going to stay his own rulings . And so I would have to go to Superior Court or Commonwealth Court, whichever one. The attorneys I was working with said I've seen your work. You could file a petition the same as we can. And you do it and you'll save $2,500. So I did that and that's it. So Thursday morning I don't know what's going to happen. I'm doing everything I can. I've taken up too much of your time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 already . I would appreciate it if there is anything that can be done to stop this from happening, otherwise it's going to be a disaster . MR. SMURL: Thank you. I'm sorry. That's all we could do. Anyone else? Thank you, Attorney Gilbride . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Again and again you hear stories just like that, people being impacted the wrong way by somebody who doesn't know who they're impacting. I'm talking about our current Mayor of Scranton . Virgil Argenta two weeks ago opened up a box. And that box included a property that's been on the books since 1988 with just land without a dwelling on the property where you just pay for the land. Now, the question was, how many are there actually out there according to the reassessment . We're looking at thousands according to Solicitor Gilbride . There's no statute of limitations when it comes to the City of Scranton or any municipality or any church. I know this firsthand because I was responsible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 for the city and the county delinquent taxes for collection . We went back to 1940. So if you are looking at a thousand properties going back 10 years with an average amount of $2,500 between the city, the county, and the school, you're looking at 25 million dollars . You know, the city split would be, what, 10, 12 million . A dollar saved is a dollar earned. You're looking at about 25 million dollars if you go after it properly . Like I said, there's no statute of limitations . There's a lot of good people that pay taxes, hard working dollars . They're actually afraid to sit on their porches in fear of the current climate . The least we could do is pursue that effectively , get those on the books, get them paying properly because it's not fair to the people that pay taxes, upkeep their homes and be responsible citizens of the city. Now, another thing I want to talk to you about is the pave cuts. You know, Mr. King addressed this by asking Solicitor Gilbride about our ordinances . I looked into these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 ordinance s. I don't know exactly what they are. The utilities are not sealing our pave cuts properly . When they don't seal them properly , we end up having to foot the bill. All right. Again, a dollar saved is a dollar earned. You're looking at $500,000 to fill these pave cuts. It becomes an issue. All right. So here's my question . Reilly Associates is going out looking at these pave cuts, simple question . How many have they determined that weren't done properly ? Because in my estimation , none of them are done properly . How many of them actually received a fine from Reilly Associates ? Are we getting our bangs from our buck from Reilly Associates or are they not even going out because my opinion , it's the latter of the two. We need a swerve pattern for pretty much every street in the City of Scranton . We have utilities cutting open our streets months after they are being paved. There's no oversight . The least we could get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 is oversight from this Council . All right? We have these ordinances in place. It's up to you to effectively address them and enforce them because people are living paycheck to paycheck . If you notice the current climate of the city, it's harder for people to take care and manage their properties effectively . With that being said, when our roads get affected, people really don't want to work on their houses as much. And that's how we start with our blight. All right. Let's move onto curfew. I watched the County Commissioners meeting today. To my surprise , there is 909 cases from family youth court -- sorry, Children Services that are backlogged . They have 23 caseworkers at the beginning of the year. They're up to 40. All right. It's alarming that the school system cannot notify the family court system about any type of gang active members . All right. So we're not helping each other here. The least this body can do is do its part. Each one of you are parents . Start a curfew. It's very important to our city, our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 children are our future. Like I said last week, the railway system is coming through in the not so distant future. Please do things the proper way. We expect you to do so. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hi, Council . Rik Little, Scranton . It's like a never-ending movie where you watch it, you live your life. You're watching these things. And certain people, you know, pay attention to the details and notice all the déjà vu that's happening . I see a lot of that in Scranton . I remember this was the last place where Robert Kennedy came before he went to the Ambassador Ballroom and alleged ly was murdered by a lone gunman dashing his Democrat presidential election . But these people who are really running -- because he wasn't shot by Sirhan Sirhan. What we have here is no accountability in the government because the world is really a bunch of mobs if you want to look at it. They're mobs. They're people in power who have a certain thing. And, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 we talk about government power and they have certain sticks that they could use. And the sticks are the law with enforcement by the police. And what I see happening all across America is just Communism coming in, you know, but it's really been a progressive thing. The family courts, the most funded courts of all courts and then I -- and they are making single mother families based. But you have to go back to the 1965 LBJ's title -- what was it Title 6 or something , all of this money, you know, the welfare money, the welfare mothers , the fatherless families , you know, we just had Father's Day. But in the media it's like, oh, this is Pride Month the whole month, you know. But there was no funding -- federal funding for schools before 1980 when Jimmy Carter came in and said, yeah, we're doing it. People got used to the whole federal funding of education . And it's a generation al thing. It's gone on here and everywhere . And this upcoming election it's most important because mainly because it's the same people and the same 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 positions with the same fear stick tactics have been running the show. And, you know, they got everybody arguing on the sidelines about pothole s and signs and, you know, the murders , the muggings , you know. This is a sanctuary city. And they are trying very hard to keep to it, oh, this isn't a sanctuary city. But I think people could see how the crime and all the people that are coming into the city, you know, being put up by the mob or government or whatever you want to call it, 5013Cs. I mean, people have to look into the 5013Cs because they are doing the same thing. What is wealth, you know, the church, you know, separation of church and state. They are not even teaching the kids what they need to know otherwise people wouldn't keep saying that phrase. But there's a -- I lost my thought . Anyway, this Congress ional district has had the same person in office for six terms. He's running for a seventh term. And he is one of the biggest problems in this area. I hope everyone votes for Ron Bresnahan -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. SMURL: Sir, this is -- we're not here about votes. Please stick to your original thought . MR. LITTLE: What? MR. SMURL: We're not speaking about elections . MR. LITTLE: I'm talking about change that has to happen. MR. SMURL: Then talk about change, not elections . MR. LITTLE: People mixing up what politics is and what right and wrong is. That's the problem . That's the problem and divide it. The media divides it in two things, Republican /Democrat , black/white. All this division , people have to come together . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Yes, if we could -- I think I had asked before when Mr. Argenta had mentioned about some of these properties that have obviously not paid tax for since 1988, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 1989. Is it possible to get a list of the city properties and if we could find out exactly how far back we could go to recoup if it's all the way, perfect and what the process is going to be for trying to recoup that. ATTY. GILBRIDE : I guess towards the end of the reassessment they will at that point we'll be able to get the information . MR. KING: And then they'll hopefully be able to pursue them. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Correct . MR. KING: Great. Thank you. The statement s of financial interest , can we check with the administration and find out why those haven't been uploaded since 2022? I think that's important . MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. King, our Council office and the administration are following up with the respective boards, authorities , and other public official s to finalize the list. MR. KING: Thank you. And I know it was brought up about the sign coming into the city. It was overgrown. It's my understanding the DPW took care of that and knocked that down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 correctly , weed whacked it and cleared it and made it presentable . So I appreciate that. And tomorrow is Juneteenth , celebration , a lot of people are off work tomorrow . You know, a lot of people including myself never really knew the exact meaning of Juneteenth . And the celebration marks the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Galveston , Texas actually found out that they have been freed. But this was two years after President Abraham Lincoln, you know, had done emancipation proclamation . So it's kind of a really big deal. And it's a national holiday tomorrow . So I think it's important to recognize that. So I want to do that now. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I do have a few. So I have some answers from last week. One thing that came up in public comment tonight though, since Reilly Associates has been doing our pave cut inspections , can we ask that question as to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 has Reilly Associates found any cuts that have not met our city ordinance in terms of restoration ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . Last week I asked about Meadow Brook Project , the easement process and how they're being handled and where we are with that. The city let us know or the administration let us know that they're working a way to schedule a public meeting. So they're hoping to have a public meeting with the resident s that are affected by that Meadow Brook Project hopefully as early as June 24th is what the -- the date that we have been given. So we are looking to -- they are looking to get that schedule . I asked about could we have an update on the timeline for the West Scranton Stormwater Project . And the answer we got back was Borton Lawson is current ly in the study and predesign phase of that project . So results of the phase are due shortly and the city is going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 to hold a public meeting to share those findings and those potential areas as well. So with West Mountain , it's going to be they are in the study and predesign phase and they will get a meeting with those residents . There was some questions asked about Engine 15 if the building was out for appraisal and will the building be placed for sale, if possible . And the answer that came back was the appraisal of Engine 15 property at 1409 Ash Street was last conduct ed on July 28 of 2022 by Kanton Realty. And at the time, the building was appraise d at $150,000. The city has not develop ed a plan to sell the building and as Council may recall, some other responses were given on March 26th about animal control officers that are currently utilizing that facility while the Serrenti Center is being completed . So they are the answers to those question s. And that's all I have, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. First I want to thank Councilman King for bringing up Juneteenth . I want to wish people a happy Juneteenth tomorrow . And I'm sad to have missed the celebration that happened over the weekend that is hosted by the Black Scranton Project . I think it was their fifth year doing it. And I have been able to attend most years. So I missed out. But I heard it went very well and it was a great time. So I'm glad that they are continuing to celebrate and host that at their place on Main Avenue. I wanted to bring up a few responses that I had received . I think some of them came in last week. But I had not brought them up during Fifth Order. So I just wanted to go through a few of them on question s that I had for the administration . First, I know we had been asking about meeting minutes for the Unsheltered Task Force. They said that minutes were not being recorded at the meeting and that I'm a member of the task force, which I'm aware of. And I was there and I was happy to provide a report 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 or summary after the meeting during one of our Council meeting s. However , I may not be able to attend all the meeting s, especially now that I'm back at work and done with my maternity leave. So I don't have much availability during the day to be able to attend those meeting s. So I think it would be helpful for us to have minutes. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could request that in future meeting s they do take minutes and are able to provide those. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll request that, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Excellent . I also had received some responses on questions I had regarding the pave cut agreement or the ordinance that we have on pave cuts. And they said that the city does not enter into agreement s with the utilities , rather they apply for permits for each project . But am I not right in saying that we could still revoke the permit if the work is not being done properly , are there still consequences for violating those permits ? So I'm a little unclear on why there are still no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 consequences for these issues that we're having with pave cuts and with the utility companies . But I'm hoping we could explore those more and determine how we can hold them accountable as I know everyone in our city would like to do. And also, on the matter of the OpenGov monthly reports we had asked about updates on Code Enforcement , Licensing and Permits on the reports that we had previously been receiving . They said that we do receive quarterly permit license reports and monthly Code Enforcement reports , will provide any updates to complaint s submitted through Council biannual Code Enforcement reports which provide information on the number of door tags, quality of life tickets, citations , vacant properties , etc. And the city had switched to a quarter ly report following an e-mail received from our clerk in early March. So we do receive those quarterly reports. And I believe those are included in Third Order. Also, last week I discussed about concerns of the work that's been occurring on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Myrtle Street and had gotten some more information on that from American Water. They had said that as for the issues on Myrtle, the first was a sinkhole caused by poor compaction . They said it was on a UGI cut, not from American Water and all American Water project s have compaction testing done along trench line and all service cuts. This testing is done by Reilly Engineering . The second cut that I spoke of last week that was made because a customer was missed and waited over two months to inform American Water that they were without water. But it's still not clear on how they were missed in the first place. And they schedule d a meeting to discuss the cuts with the city and Reilly our engineer and they'll mill and overlay any section of Myrtle Street per our ordinance . There is also a question that we received about 806 North Irving and that was a sewer issue backing up into a customer 's home. And they are also going to have a discussion with Valicon and the paving subcontractor about moving equipment during the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 night. And the stone in the tree lawn will be replaced with topsoil, topsoil and concrete restoration and typically four or five weeks behind excavation . So that's -- those are the response s that I received on that. And I believe that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a couple responses from question s I posed last week. There's been a lot of questions about the Serrenti Center and the newly propose d CTC command center. So what I got -- I didn't get a lot. It's a little vague. But we'll see what's going to happen. The Serrenti Center is primarily used to secure both police and fire special purpose response equipment for high risk operations . Also, it said the site holds assets acquire d through federal grant funding and should be protected . We get that. So and they said there is some type of training going there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 So we did ask for them to come in. And, you know, there's going to be the central and (inaudible ) after the buildout at CTC. So we'll probably get more information when we have the -- they come in for caucus. I just wanted to report that out. Also last week I posed a question to DPW administration if the city has a record of basins and, you know, determine whose responsibility are they, the storm drains. You know, the city owns some, Pennsylvania American Water is responsibile for some also. So the response I got was there are occasions that require our teams to establish ownership of a particular drain between city and Pennsylvania American Water on the spot. DPW is improving how to test -- I'm sorry, how to track these drains moving forward including filtering , map data, stamping physical basins, etc. So we're going to get some information from that. So then I got from a resident on the corner of Penn and New York, there's an old Greyhound bus. I got pictures , Mr. Voldenberg . I'll send them to you later that has flat tires 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 and it's loaded with junk. And so for that case, can we have zoning Officer Negron go out and maybe, you know, also Code Enforcement to take a look at this. When you see the picture s, you'll see why they both need to go. All right. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Also, somebody sent me a picture . So we all know what our red recycling bins look like, right, and what they're used for, correct , right? I know there's a lot of confusion this year with the calendar . We only got half a year calendar . So now added to the confusion for the residents , someone sent me a picture of the new red recyclables that they're, you know, you come and get and pick up. But guess what it says on it? Now these are -- historically they're for paper. The new ones state Scranton recycles plastic , glass, aluminum , steel and tin, nothing about paper on here. So here we go again because I know resident s come here and complained and said, you know, I put my garbage out in one of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 blue container s and they refuse to take it from administration 's directive or I put the wrong stuff in the wrong recycling bin and because the administration , you know, directs DPW not to pick it up, can't pick it up if it's in the wrong bin. So guess what, this bin states now the usage should be everything but paper. Even if there was paper written on here it would make a little sense and they'd say we do recycle everything . But, no, the red has always been for paper. So I want to know what happened here. Something . This -- something happened here. It doesn't make any sense. Please find out because now we're adding more confusion to the resident s how to put out recyclables . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I'll start with 421 Colfax Avenue. I had asked about where its place is on the demolition list. And now I'm told it is not on the demolition list. I believe it was on the demolition list. But they said they were going to send code enforcement up and look and see if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 there is anything they could do with the sidewalks up there. They are really in terrible condition . I also asked about Pennsy Supply getting to Nay Aug Park and backfilling the side of the pavement. They haven't gotten to there yet, nor have they got to, Mr. Voldenberg , the one on Hemlock Street if we could set a reminder . They're having a flower show at Nay Aug Park. Hopefully they'll get that done before we have lawsuit s. And also, the people on Hemlock Street they told them they would take care of it. I believe that was two weeks ago and they have not. So I don't know how far behind they are but it's only matter of backfill so if they would please attend to that. Also, the house that I mentioned last week it was Rear 516 Palm Street. So the actual address is 1649 Hamm Court -- the corner of Hamm Court and South Lentz Place. Code Enforcement was to follow up there again. I believe it has multiple citation s at the magistrate 's office. I hope there will be more citations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 written . And I don't know what we could do to push this through faster to get this thing demolished . This has been many, many, many years. If you go by there now, you could hardly see the house. So I don't even know if it's a full house anymore, but hopefully we could move forward on that one. The 800 block of North Main Avenue, we asked to have a damage vehicle with no license plate removed from there. I don't know if that was done this week yet. And also, on the corner of Crane Street and Cedar Avenue, a person had sent me pictures of a broken piece of the bottom of a stop sign. And he actually tripped on it, wound up in the hospital . And so we're asking for DPW or somebody to go down there and pull that thing out of the ground. I also have an update on the Green Ridge Street bridge. This is from DOT. And it is what they are going to be doing in the near future. On approximately July 15th, Nay Aug Avenue will be closed from Green Ridge Street to the entrance of Pioneer Beverage .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 So you'll be able to still get into Pioneer Beverage . The area is going to be used for construction of the temporary bridge that they are going to installing across the creek. It will be two lanes. There will also be a walking lane on it. There will be no restriction s for tractor -trailer s. So it will not hinder deliver ies or anything . While that temporary bridge is up, they will then take down the existing Green Ridge Street bridge and detour for the first part of the part they are doing by Pioneer Beverage on Nay Aug Avenue, I have that. It's pretty long. So I will give it to Mr. Voldenberg , maybe put it on the city's website to show the detour for that one. And then when they get closer are with the bridge if there are any detours but I don't believe they're going to because the bridge is going to be open. The start of that will be right around Labor Day. They said around Labor Day. So a week or two, either way they said. That's when they are going to start taking down the other bridge. And also, they said the walking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 trail may be closed at times. But their plan is not to shut it and not to close it if they don't have to. So hopefully they will keep that open for people that use it. And final thing I have is did some research and this is kind of a response to question s I had about starting a curfew and the rise of juvenile crime in the City of Scranton . So what I had found in Pennsylvania is PA Title 23, Chapter 55 liability and tortious acts of children . So what that is, it describes the way that criminal proceeding s can be held against a child or juvenile in Pennsylvania . And it shows how it's proceeded with their parents or guardian s of a minor and who is responsible . It also gives the monetary limits of what these families can be charged . And the monetary limit is $1,000 for an offense . And then the maximums to any one person is $2,500 for all injuries or destruction or more than one person involved . So the most any parent can be liable for is basically $2,500 for their child or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 their whoever they're guardian of. So what this means is if the parents are to be held accountable for their child or their children 's criminal actions , it is allowed in Pennsylvania . So I don't know how we could enforce that. So what I want to know is if a juvenile is charged in the City of Scranton with underage drinking , retail theft, shoplifting and they go on and on with a bunch of offenses . I want to know how we can, if we can, hold the guardian or the parent responsible for these fines. I believe we can. If the State of Pennsylvania says you can, I believe the City of Scranton also can. So the reason for all of this is not to try to punish kids or fines or push fines. My reason for this is that I understand everybody 's idea about a curfew. But I don't want to say that a juvenile -- there should be a curfew. It's really not what I want to do because this isn't really people that are committing crimes. If the people that are committ ing the crimes should be cited and then if their parents are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 held accountable for this. But at this time, if we do have a curfew and the police department picks this underage child up and there are no parents at their home, we cannot legally drop that child off. We become -- in turn, we become babysitters . So please don't -- so if the police officer -- if we pick a child up after curfew 17 years old, we cannot do anything with them except take them to their parents or take them to police headquarters . And what do we do? Should we put them in a holding cell? No. I don't think that's the answer. So with that said what I want to do and with the agreement of my four colleagues is I want to ask our attorney , Tom Gilbride for his legal opinion how we move forward on advise us on how we can hold the parents of all juvenile children or the guardian s of these children responsible for basically paying all of the fines that are created . I know right now we are really not collecting all those. So if everybody is in favor of that, I would like our attorney just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 to investigate that and then to come back and give us an opinion if that is possible . Anybody have a comment on it? MR. SCHUSTER : So we're going to explore looking into adding -- I mean, I guess this question would be for Mr. Gilbride . We're going to explore adding an ordinance . Would that be the route that we're going to take on this to add an additional fine? ATTY. GILBRIDE : The state has already limited your ability to do that. State law take precedence over the local. They have told you what you are able to do by virtue of the statute that was cited by our President . That right now is the limit of your -- not what we're able to do but what the enforce r, which would be the Scranton Police. That's what we're talking about here. That would be what -- they could cite them and then any damage that they did -- and when you say -- the interesting thing with that -- I know we talked about this briefly when you talk about tortious activity , you know, it's kind of like the old Supreme Court case. I can't tell you what pornography is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 but when I see it I'll be able to identify it. Well, that's the same thing. The judges and the courts tell you what that activity would be. It does list certain activities that could be examples of tortious activity in the actual legislation that our President cited. But to the extent that that legislation talks about what the penalties are, that's your limits. MR. SCHUSTER : That's the what? I didn't hear the last piece you said. ATTY. GILBRIDE : To the extent that the legislation speaks to the -- you're limited by what that legislation says. So if it limits to it $2,500 which it does -- MR. SCHUSTER : At this point we're going to explore what route the city has to take in order to enforce it or -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : Well, that's -- enforcing is the police have to enforce it. This Council can't take any activity to encourage more enforcement other than letting it be known that you would like it enforced . It's on the books. MR. MCANDREW : -- from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 administration to help facilitate this and hold parents accountable . It could also be a deterrent for some of the current behavior . I'm for it. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. KING: And I'd like to get some feedback from the Scranton Police Department . ATTY. GILBRIDE : With regard to what issue, Mr. King? MR. KING: With regard to their feeling s on instituting a curfew in terms of we already know that they're shorthanded as it is. ATTY. GILBRIDE : I have had conversations with them on that. They do not feel they have the manpower. They do not feel that they were hired to be babysitters because ultimately as Mr. Smurl said, once you pick up those underage children and take them -- first, under Pennsylvania law, your first obligation is to take them to their parents . If you take them to their home and their parents are not there, you now own it. MR. KING: We used to have a house of detention that doesn't exist anymore. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 ATTY. GILBRIDE : And we don't have a house of detention locally , which what are you detaining them for? That's the other thing. You know, it sounds nice. We can put them in a cell, that's not the way this works with children , you know. And so you have to be careful when we're talking about this in regard to keeping in mind what the children 's rights are as opposed to what we think it should be because once you take them into custody , which -- and we could say it might not be legal custody . But once you physically take them into custody , you are responsible . If something happens to that child while they are in the city's custody , you could expect someone dressed like me to be filing a lawsuit the very next day. I mean, that's going to happen. So you're going to have the issue of -- it's really less about -- legally can you establish curfews , yes, you can. There are cities across the United States where they have entertained it. Some have entertained it and turned it down completely . The ones that have actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 instituted curfews tend to be the bigger cities. I know that Philadelphia looked at it and just instituted one in 2022. Pittsburgh looked at it. I do not believe they put one in place. Cincinnati looked at one. But they're always -- the bigger cities where they have more police officers , they have the hardware ready to take care of these children . So they will have neighbor hood safe houses they call them which the police could take them there. There's adult supervision there until when the parents come and get them. And that is the way it is. But that costs money. So then it becomes how much do the five of you feel our citizens are willing to pay to put those systems into place because if you're going to spend more money, you're going have to raise more money. So it's a lot bigger than the law. The law allows it. It's our -- it's our situation . Do we have the mechanics in place? Do we have wherewithal to sustain the cost of instituting a system like that and for how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 much -- MR. KING: I'm not interested -- I'm not interested in developing a new ordinance that we can't enforcement . I mean, why are we going to do that? MR. SCHUSTER : Back to the other one, I would be in favor of exploration to see what next steps may be needed when it comes to parents being held accountable for children 's activities or minor's activities . ATTY. GILBRIDE : Well, again, you already have it in place. The state law provides you the ability to do that. It's now about enforcement . City law is not going to assist in that or take away from that. That law exists. MR. SCHUSTER : So I guess for my clarification , what I was asking was, what action were we taking just now. That was my question , I guess, to you. What was the action that we were looking to take? Mr. Smurl was looking for our support in that and -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : You'll have to tell me. My understanding was to look into it. I have done already copious amounts of research 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 into it. I think you could tell by my answers . And again, it really comes down to how much would you want to spend on something like this and are the taxpayer s willing to absorb those costs. And is it worth it too? On the other side of this is what is it that we're trying to stop? MR. SMURL: Our final goal is to hold the parents of the juveniles that we're having problems with financially responsible for their child's action. So I want to look into see exactly what we are doing now that we are -- it's not being accomplished right now. So, therefore , I want to see what we can do to make that work. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Well, I could reach out to our police department through the administration and determine what is being done current ly. But again, the law is there already . You have the mechanism to do that. It's really about how are they enforcing it and I will report back to you for our next meeting . MR. SMURL: Great. Okay. Thank you. Frank. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
