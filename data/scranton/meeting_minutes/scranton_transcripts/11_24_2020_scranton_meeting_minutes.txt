Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have -- MR. MCANDREW : I do. Go ahead, Kyle. MR. DONAHUE : I just have two quick ones, just a reminder that garbage pickup this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 week will be a day late after Thursday and next week it will be on schedule . And this is the second to last week for the fall leaf pickup. Just a reminder , there will be no collection s in courts or alleys. All collections will be curbside on streets and avenues , no loose piles, no plastic bags, no household trash. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I would just like to commend our friends , Friends of the Poor did a fantastic job today with their Thanksgiving takeout dinner. I heard it was a huge success . And also just in case -- if you missed that one, tomorrow Family to Family is also going to have tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., at Scranton High School a food basket giveaway. So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few announcements . I'd also like to thank Friends of the Poor for the events that they're running in order to help get food to families this week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 for the holidays . I do want to make sure that everyone is taking precautions with the holidays . I know, you know, it's a big time to spend with family and close ones. But with the increase in cases with COVID-19, I would just plead with everyone to stay on the side of caution and, you know, if you can, stay away from family unless they are immediate members , people that you live with, you know, and try to enjoy maybe a smaller Thanksgiving this year, you know, for your safety and for the safety of others so that we can help get the pandemic under control again. So if everyone can try their best to do their part, you know, I'd hate to see people lose loved ones, you know, just to have a nice big Thanksgiving dinner. But I do wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving . I hope that they enjoy the holiday . The other thing I wanted to bring up for -- was for Nay Aug. So Friday they had their opening night of the lights. The Christmas lights are up. And they look amazing . I think they outdo themselves every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 year. They're always really hard at work to get those up and running . And, you know, just so people are aware and they could go and visit. They have a couple of options , you know, you could drive through the park to see the lights. You could also get a horse-drawn carriage ride through the park. And I think that's for $10 for adults and $5 for children . So that's a nice thing to be able to do. And this year they have an old fashion hayride that's a lit up hayride. And I had the opportunity to go on it. And it was really neat and fun experience . And that's for $5. And I think that's on Sunday, Tuesdays , and Thursdays starting after 5:00. So I definitely encourage people to check out the lights. You know, I think that is really a great thing that we have in our area around this time of year and a nice thing to be able to do and get out of the house and something that's safe to do in this time of year too. And the one last announcement that I had, Scranton Tomorrow is running a campaign 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 called Light Up Downtown . And part of that campaign they're going to have Small Business Saturday coming up this Saturday , November 28th. And I know that this time of year especially with Black Friday, people are often, you know, shopping at some of the bigger retailers or in the case of this year, shopping online. But please don't forget about our small businesses downtown , many of whom I'm sure are struggling and could use your business and probably have, you know, much better products than you'd be able to find in some of those -- some of those other stores and bigger retailers too. You could also get gift cards for people to use later on. So as much as you can, don't forget to support our local businesses . And Saturday will be a great day to get out and take a look at what those places have. And if you go to Scranton Tomorrow 's website too, they do have a list of business es that are participating in that. And some of them are giving, like, discounts or coupons . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? All right. I have two quick ones, City Hall is going to be closed this Thursday and Friday, November 26th and 27th in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday . And next week, Tuesday , December 1st, Council will hold a public hearing at 5:45 p.m. for the purpose of receiving comment s on the City's 2021 operating budget. Anyone wishing to offer comment , please send those entitled 2021 budget to lreed@scrantonpa .gov by 3 p.m., prior to the hearing . You could also send it to 340 North Washington Avenue by mail and just put it to the City Clerk, Lori Reed. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Before we get to Citizens Participation , we do have Melissa Hughes here from PFM to speak to the Tax Anticipation Note legislation that we have in Seventh Order. I believe it's 7-A. So I think, Melissa , the last time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 you were here we were talking about the interest rate and there's a new term sheet. So if you just want to talk about that and then we'll answer any questions . MS. HUGHES: Absolutely . And, thank you, Councilman Gaughan . As I was here two weeks ago and updated everyone , we got a really wonderful proposal from Webster Bank. They had originally quoted a 1.209 percent . And that was an indicative rate. They provided yesterday the locked rate which is 1.201 percent , so slightly lower. It does not translate to a lot in dollars but always happy to see any increased benefit to the City. And that rate is firm now. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Any questions for Melissa on the TAN legislation ? ATTY. HAYES: Councilman Gaughan , if no members of Council have questions , I have a few questions . MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MS. HUGHES: Certainly . ATTY. HAYES: All right. Melissa , Councilman Schuster in particular , requested me -- requested I obtain clarification on some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 of the closing fees that are baked into the proposal which has been submitted to Council . And there's approximately $44,350 worth of closing costs. The biggest item that is included in those closing costs is $20,850 for bond counsel fees. MS. HUGHES: Yes. ATTY. HAYES: My first question to you is, can you explain to Council why bond counsel would be needed in this transaction because I've been a party to TANs and we did not have bond counsel . MS. HUGHES: Certainly . So the role of bond counsel in any financing transaction is their job is to make sure that all of the financing is done in a way that comports with both IRS law and the Local Government Unit Debt Act. So that is bond counsel 's role in the overall transaction . I can't speak to other transactions you may have been involved in, Solicitor Hayes. Perhaps you had one where the bank had a lawyer who prepared the documents and you paid the bank for it. Sometimes that is done. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 there as the City, you are giving up basically your power to the bank. And that's generally not as favorable . You want the -- everything -- your way. In this particular case, we also have the lockbox structure associate d with EIT. So there is additional documentation related to that to make sure everything is set up and all the money flows in such a way that provides the correct legal security both for the eventual bank purchaser and for the City of the role of bond counsel . ATTY. HAYES: So is it your position that Webster Bank demanded that there be bond counsel ? MS. HUGHES: Webster did not demand that there be bond counsel . It is standard practice of the City to have its own bond counsel . ATTY. HAYES: I understand that because they -- so the bond counsel is Stevens and Lee, correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yes. ATTY. HAYES: How was Stevens and Lee selected as bond counsel ? I notice they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 charged the same fee of $20,850 last year when they -- which coincidently is just below the 21,000 bidding threshold when they served as bond counsel in -- for the last year's bond. How was Stevens and Lee selected ? MS. HUGHES: I don't know how Stevens and Lee was selected original ly to be your bond counsel . But Stevens and Lee has been your bond counsel historically . ATTY. HAYES: For how many years? MS. HUGHES: Now, you're asking me a question I don't know the answer to right off the top -- ATTY. HAYES: I mean, so in other words, there was no RFQ or RF -- I mean -- MS. HUGHES: Not that I facilitated . ATTY. HAYES: Okay. How is the fee of $20,850 determined ? Is that essential ly -- would you -- is that essentially they write a letter, an opinion letter? MS. HUGHES: They write an opinion letter, you're right. And then they also draft and handle all the documentation associated with it. It's not just the opinion . ATTY. HAYES: So that's a service 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that, in other words, the bank counsel -- bank doesn't have its own counsel involved ? MS. HUGHES: The bank has its own counsel involved to review documents . ATTY. HAYES: So Stevens and Lee is doing the work of the City in this regard? MS. HUGHES: They're serving as bond counsel in this capacity . ATTY. HAYES: For the City. MS. HUGHES: Yes. ATTY. HAYES: And it's just a flat $20,850 fee. It's not -- in other words, it's not based on the hours expended , correct ? MS. HUGHES: That is typically how those fees are charged . That's also inclusive of expenses associated with it. So I think his fee is 20,850 is an estimate of -- ATTY. HAYES: Is there a specific lawyer who's assigned -- who is serving in this capacity ? MS. HUGHES: Yes, Brian Koscelansky . And he is -- so for the benefit of everyone , in order to be a bond counsel you need to be listed in what's call the Red Book, the Bond Buyer Red Book. And that is a certification 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 that you are competent to practice this particular type of law. It is a very specialist type of law and Brian is in the Red Book. ATTY. HAYES: And just so we all understand , this wasn't a demand -- having bond counsel wasn't a demand or a request on the part of Webster Bank. It was something that was offered up by the City, correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yes. And that has been the historical practice of the City. You know, to be frank, Brian participated in conversation s we had with the bidders to help them understand the security structure to make sure everybody understood how the EIT flows because that was a major part of the security structure for the TAN. Both this year and historically we've been using this structure for a good period of time. ATTY. HAYES: When you say historically , do you mean throughout the course of the Courtright administration ? MS. HUGHES: I don't think it was the -- I don't think we used it the first year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 of the Courtright administration , but the Courtright administration and then Council man Evans. Well, he's Mayor since then but -- ATTY. HAYES: And then the second largest line item is your firm's fee of $10,000. MS. HUGHES: Yep. ATTY. HAYES: And how do you arrive at that number? MS. HUGHES: That's a flat fee that we charge based, you know, basically on the complexity of the deal. That's generally how fees get quoted. And so, you know, what I have done as part of the process and over the last year has been available to the City to help them understand their overall debt portfolio , help go through the negotiation process to identify the banks and answer questions that they had. Yeah. And -- ATTY. HAYES: Okay. Because it's a flat -- because I see -- I saw you charged the same amount last year. So it's just a flat $10,000 fee regardless of how much work is involved . You know, whatever is involved , it's just a flat $10,000 fee charged by your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 company , correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yeah, it's a flat fee. ATTY. HAYES: And that's on top of -- you have an existing contract with the City, correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yes. We do have a existing contract with the City. So for 2020 -- so for -- during the course of 2020, we haven't had any bond transaction s to do. And that's fine. Some years you're not going to have any bond transaction s to do. So, you know, this is -- ATTY. HAYES: This isn't a bond transaction though. This is a TAN, correct ? MS. HUGHES: It's still a debt transaction . ATTY. HAYES: Right. It's a loan, essentially , correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yes. ATTY. HAYES: It's a loan that you have to pay back within the course of the year? MS. HUGHES: Yes. I'm using those terms interchangeable . ATTY. HAYES: Right. And I just -- I mean, we just heard from Mr. Cross of how we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 have to be so diligent -- MS. HUGHES: You're asking good questions . ATTY. HAYES: And so I just need to understand for the Council and the public, how is PFM compensated outside of this through the City? Is it monthly fee or is it an hourly fee? MS. HUGHES: No, we charge a flat fee when we complete a transaction . ATTY. HAYES: Okay. MS. HUGHES: Yeah. ATTY. HAYES: All right. And -- MS. HUGHES: Yeah, I'm not writing you a bill and sending you a bill every month. ATTY. HAYES: No, I understand . It's just a flat -- you guys do a TAN. You charge $10,000 for the TAN, correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yes. ATTY. HAYES: Even if it's largely similar to the one that was done last year, it's still the same fee, correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yes. And I could tell you that it was a tremendous amount of work this year given COVID.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 ATTY. HAYES: Okay. MS. HUGHES: You are getting your money's worth absolutely this year. ATTY. HAYES: Right. I understand . MS. HUGHES: Yep. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. That's I think all the questions I have on the fees. We just needed clarification on that. MS. HUGHES: Absolutely . ATTY. HAYES: I guess I'll check with the law -- I did reach out to the Law Department , but I'll ask them again how this arrangement with bond counsel came about just so -- because the issue was raised by Council . Thank you, Melissa . MS. HUGHES: I just -- I just don't have any -- ATTY. HAYES: I understand . It was a decision of the administration , correct ? MS. HUGHES: Yeah. They've been your historical bond counsel . And they have the institutional knowledge which is frankly when you are doing any type of debt transaction whether it's a TAN or long-term financing , it's very valuable .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 ATTY. HAYES: Let me just ask you, how many agreements are involved exactly in the, you know, we have Exhibit A. How many agreements are involved in -- MS. HUGHES: Like, how many exhibit s will there be to the closing document ? ATTY. HAYES: Yes. MS. HUGHES: Eighteen to 20, like, in total, you know filing with the -- ATTY. HAYES: Right. I've done them for other municipalities . I just want to make sure it's the same situation . MS. HUGHES: Yes, it's the same situation . The City just has a little bit of an expanding one because of lockbox arrange ment. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. MS. HUGHES: There's some additional document -- there's absolutely additional document ation and additional work. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. MS. HUGHES: But it pays off because you get significantly better rates. ATTY. HAYES: Understood . MS. HUGHES: Yeah.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 ATTY. HAYES: That's all for me. I don't know if anyone on Council has followup questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Just to be clear, this is a loan. It's not a bond. MS. HUGHES: It is a loan. Forgive me, I'm using the term bond and loan interchangeably to mean debt instrument . MR. MCANDREW : I have a question . So, okay, so just because this counsel 's been used historically , doesn't make it a necessity to use them for a loan versus a bond. MS. HUGHES: You -- in my professional opinion , you need a bond counsel to get this transaction done and completed . It's at the Council 's discretion always who you want to hire for that service . You know, if you want to look at for 2021, but I do believe it is a professional service that you need. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Any other questions on the TAN? All right. And, Melissa , were you going to speak tonight -- and I know Carl Deeley is on the line, our Business Administrator , just to the options that were present ed by PFM in terms of the financing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 and -- for financing and the budget, the options listed in the budget? MS. HUGHES: Yeah, would you like me to do that now? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that would be very helpful . MS. HUGHES: Okay. Is it okay if I share my screen? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, that would be great. MS. HUGHES: Okay. So hopefully what you're seeing on my screen is a summary of the City's outstanding debt. I'm going to zoom in a little bit here. MR. GAUGHAN : Yep, we can see it. Thank you. That's great. MS. HUGHES: Okay. Great. I'm going to walk through each of the issues for a minute because Councilman Schuster asked about it. So columns two through nine are the City's general obligation debt. Column 11 is an existing lease that the City has with M&T. Normally I don't include this on the debt summary . We would typically focus on columns two through ten. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I included it this year because one of the things we at least analyzed was does it make sense to refund that lease into a general obligation debt instrument . Without getting too much into details, if it could have been originally used to -- if the purpose of the original loan was something that could have been done with a lease or a loan, you can switch from a lease to a loan. So that's why we're analyzing that this year. So I'm going to go across the bottom here. You'll notice the ones in red, columns two and three were the Series A and AA of 2016. The purpose of those was A of 2016 was to finance the judgment . I think, Councilman Gaughan , you were around when we complet ed that transaction . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. HUGHES: You probably remember that. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. MS. HUGHES: And then also simultaneously , we did a refunding of the 2008 bonds for savings and made a small pension 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 deposit associated with the judgment financing . As you might recall, one of the things the City negotiated was that some of the judgment would be paid out and some of it would be deposit ed to the pension fund. The amount that was deposit ed in the pension fund had to be financed on a taxable basis. That's why it was sent out separate ly. You'll notice that 2016 A bond has a (inaudible ) in 2024. We're monitoring your debt portfolio always for refunding opportunities . Right now it doesn't make sense to refinance that one for debt service savings . The AA of 2016 because it was issued on a taxable basis, at the time the market then demanded what's called a make whole call. That means basically you can't refund it for a debt service savings . You could refund it for restructuring purposes but not for debt service savings. So that's probably not a candidate. The next column is your series of 2002 notes. Those notes are issued through the Emmaus General Authority Program . And they are in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 variable rate mode. Because they're in variable rate mode, those notes are refinanceable at any time with 30 days' notice. We've historical ly over the years monitored these notes for refunding potential starting in 2016 and kind of every time we've looked at something. Historically , it hasn't made sense to refinance those loans because the loans in variable rate, they're paying on a short term basis. And even say in 2014 and 2015, the short term rates were very low. The differential between short term and long term rates meant that it made more sense to continue to hold it in variable rate mode. And rates have been very low over time. But even before kind of this question came up about refinancing , that had been a candidate that we had been discussing with the administration that in 2021 assuming things kind of settled out with the Act 511 lawsuit that that would be something we would target for refinancing . So I think irregardless of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 everything else that's up for discussion tonight , you know, we would have been coming to you in the first quarter to discuss a potential refinancing of that particular series because of the delta between short term and long-term rates right now and the City's improved credit quality over time. The next two, five and six are loans through various state programs . In 2012, the DCED gave a no-interest loan or low interest loan for cash flow. That does not make sense as a refinancing candidate . And in 2015, the City borrowed through the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Bank Program . That program is a really wonderful program that ultimately the proceeds need to be used for something fundamentally road related . So you can't just go and do anything in that program . It has to have a specific purpose . Then in 2016, we did the refinancing of the Scranton parking debt and then also a little bit of new money that I understand was used for fire stations ? That sounds right, police or fire stations . It's escaping me exactly which one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. GAUGHAN : Fire stations , I believe . MS. HUGHES: Fire stations , yeah. I'm like it's stations of some kind. And, you know, that was done, you know, to stop the bleeding of the parking system. In 2017, we did a transaction to refund and also paid off a whole bunch of debt that the City incurred in 2003 with proceeds of the sewer sale. Some of it was done with proceeds of the sewer sale. And then also in exchange for refunding this particular series, it saved money but made sense to do so on its own. But also in addition , the bond insurer on those old bonds gave the City a payment that went towards reducing debt and it kind of -- in exchange for doing that. At the same time, those 2017 bonds, they were shortened up. It was part of the overall plan of finance . And then we have the lease from M & T -- oh, I skipped one. We have the lease from M & T. And then in 2018 as you may recall when the City had kind of the remaining funds left that they wanted to deposit into the pension fund, in order to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 credit for the MMO in that fiscal year; we had to do it by the mechanism of a pension note. There is nothing in Act 205 that says if you just put money in the City's pension fund you get credit for it. You have to go through a mechanism of pension note. And the City opted to issue a variable rate loan so we could get the shorter variable rate -- variable rates. And then that -- those funds would be deposited at Webster Bank and held in an account . And the idea is that that money would be there to kind of pay it off as the City made payment s and because it's in variable rate mode, the City could repay it at any time with 30 days' notice. So if there was favorable Act 511 determination that, you know, reduced the City's risk profile that that loan could be collapsed early at any time. I'm giving you a lot of background on the City's debt portfolio because it's helpful as we think about kind of which options to consider . And if it's okay, I'm going to switch what I'm sharing here. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MS. HUGHES: Okay. I'm still going to share. I just want to share a different document . So we looked at kind of four scenarios . First base case, you do nothing . So that's kind of a base case. You literally do nothing . Scenario A, looks at a refinancing of that 2002 Emmaus loan and takes the savings in the 2021 budget year. That's the one that we think makes sense to do in any scenario . You would have done it no matter what. Then you could defease the 2018 POB with the funds on hand at Webster Bank because the original purpose of that was related to 2005 and mitigating the Act 511 lawsuit . You know, that risk has diminished over time. So it might make sense to get rid of that at this point. And then the City would use the Labor and Industry funds towards any shortfall. That's Scenario A. Scenario B, you do the 2002 refunding. We keep a portion of the 2018 POB and refund it into a long-term financing and you keep the L&I money. Scenario C, refund the 2002 Emmaus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 loan, refund that M & T lease; and the reason we would consider that or at least look at as a possibility , it has a one year debt service reserve associate d with it. So you would need refinancing to release back those funds. But the lease does have a prepayment condition which isn't particularly favorable to the City. And then also looked at refunding a portion of the 2021 payment for the 2017 bond, pushing it out later in the debt portfolio and then doing a smaller portion of the taxable refunding of the POB. And you keep all the funds on hand at Labor and Industry . So I think I said a lot of things. Kind of the summary of it I think is what you need to know here. So we want to compare what's the total debt service and then how much funds on hand do we want to have at the end of the day. So these kind correspond to the scenarios I've already outlined . So if you do nothing , your total remaining debt service would be 149.9 million . If you use the Labor and Industry funds and fully defease the 2018 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 POB, that would give you the lowest total debt service because you're going to have the shortest overall debt portfolio. But you'll end up with the smallest amount of cash. So it's balancing those two things out. MR. GAUGHAN : Melissa , I don't want to interrupt you. So the cash from Scenario A would be 16 million 600,000. Is that the line you're looking at -- are we supposed to look at? MS. HUGHES: The other kind of line in yellow. So base case 149.9 versus 23.1, 131.1 versus 2. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. I got it. MS. HUGHES: Yep. That's good. Scenario B is going to have the most debt service but also the most cash on hand. It's also the least complicated of the two debt base scenarios . And there's some beauty to lower complexity . We want to do complex things if they get you somewhere , right? And then Scenario C you can kind of see is in the middle in terms of debt service and in the middle in terms of funds on hand. So I'm kind of in the same camp 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 with Jerry. So I think one other consideration perhaps related to those Labor and Industry plans he talked very articulately earlier about how those funds are really earned funds. The kind of alternative long term purpose of those would be to go into an OPEB trust. And the benefit of having an OPEB trust is it pays you, you know, dividends and goes to reduce overall costs in the long-term. So preserving more rather than less can provide you know, additional flexibility in the long term. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So let me just see if I could get this straight . And I appreciate you explaining all that and going through that for us. So you're suggest ing that the best scenario would be, which one, A or B? MS. HUGHES: B. MR. GAUGHAN : B. Okay. And that would -- and then so -- under that scenario , the City would not -- if everything worked out perfectly , the City would not have to utilize any of those Labor and Industry funds, the excess reserve funds? MS. HUGHES: Yeah, instead what you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 would do is you would refund Emmaus loan, which again we're going to do in any scenario . It just makes sense to do. So refund the Emmaus loan and then refund a portion of the bank loan at Webster into a long-term fixed rate option, probably a 10-year term. Keeping it inside of 10 years is beneficial for a whole host of reasons . You pay less interest if it's inside 10 years. We can potentially do a bank financing , which is a bond financing . Those have lower upfront fees associated with them which I think everyone is appreciative of. And they typically have more flexibility associated with them. And then you also preserve that funding . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And that unlocks almost 11 million dollars in savings . MS. HUGHES: Well, it unlocks 4.4 million of the money at Webster . But it keeps your 400,000 at M & T and keeps your 6 million at L & I. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, when you're referring to the L & I, the L & I is that money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that would go through towards the trust, correct , Melissa ? MS. HUGHES: Yes, correct . Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so that total of 10.8, Mr. Gaughan , is 6 million of that money plus the 4.4 saved with the refinancing . MS. HUGHES: Exactly . Exactly . And then you still keep the money at M & T which, you would, you would just either be release d to pay the final payment on that loan or released when the lease is up. MR. GAUGHAN : And you stated that you would probably be recommending this anyways even outside of a shortfall, correct ? MS. HUGHES: Well, the Emmaus refunding , yes. The Webster refunding, that one is driven more situation ally. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MS. HUGHES: And we wouldn't have to consider them simultaneously . For instance , we could pursue auction s in the market in January for the Emmaus refunding , test the market that way. Come back. Report -- hopefully we'll get something very good there because that one could be done in tax exempt basis. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 The Webster refunding would be done on a taxable basis. They need to be kind of thought of separately anyways. We could do that one, get a sense of the market. And then in May when it sounds like you're going to have a lot better sense of what you really need is 4.4 million , the number; come back and have further discussions about exactly what the refunding restructuring scenario looks like. I don't want to do 4.4 if you need 2.2. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, when we're looking at that Emmaus, how much money does that -- how much does that free up just on that one alone? MS. HUGHES: It's about 175,000. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And then that other refinancing would make up the rest of that 4.4 million ? MS. HUGHES: Um hum. Yeah. Yeah. It just depends on the one is a much bigger loan than the other one. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so, I mean, the Emmaus alone we would do -- we would probably be doing that anyway. But it only frees up about $100,000.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MS. HUGHES: Yeah, it's not hugely material . But it still makes sense to do because it's money in your pocket. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Does anyone else have any questions for Melissa ? And is Carl Deeley still on the line? Carl is a glutton for punishment the last few weeks. He keeps coming back, which we appreciate . MR. DEELEY: Absolutely , Council . It's the highlight of my week. MR. GAUGHAN : I know it is, Carl. So, Carl, after -- and by the way, we appreciate , you know, you both coming in and explaining all of this to us, really -- really helps us make sound decisions . So, Carl, with that information , you know, I know you've provided several options in the budget. But it looks based on what PFM is saying that Scenario B would be -- make the most sense. So is that what the Mayor and you are, you know, is that what you're gearing up towards for 2021? MR. DEELEY: It does. And I refer back to as well the update from PEL. As they said, the key thing is the uncertainty . That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 the big issue here. And I know as Melissa said -- as Melissa said too the -- it's really -- it gives us -- at least gives us options to trigger the action on this, you know, in a timely way so that we can -- we've got various options as Melissa pointed out. So we may not have to trigger any of it. We can trigger some of it. And then it's also flexible in terms of the overall kind of cash that we -- if we need it. So we do like that flexibility . And obviously anything that we do too, obviously would always come through Council . So we could have that dialogue as well, you know, really well ahead of the time when we actually execute on it. And as PEL's kind of mentioned , the key thing here is monitoring very closely the cash flows and not just the revenues . But as Councilman Schuster points out too, it's the cost as well how are we tracking against our expenditures and then really decide what we want to do in a timely fashion . So we think it to be some time around that kind of May/June time where you really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 feel the pinch depending on the results, the revenues coming in. So, you know, as we get into that February /March, you know, we'll be looking at the indicator s. And I think having that dialogue , I think we can with the support of PFM as well in terms of, you know, what's it looking like. And we'll have a threshold when we have to decide to execute . MR. SCHUSTER : Now, like we said like a few seconds earlier , that first 2002 piece is going to free up about $100,000. We're going to do that anyway. That would have been something that would have been put there anyway. When we're looking at refinancing that other piece, say it ends up being that we need 2.7 rather than that 4.4, what are we going to look to do at that point in time? Are we going to refinance that and get that 4.4? And then what are we doing with the remaining funds? MR. DEELEY: Yeah, and I think that's the thing as we move along, right, as we go into next year, again, we believe there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 going be -- we're a little bit more let's say optimistic , right, going into next year and just based on the fact that we got a vaccine . And again, we talked about this on the pension meeting last week as well. And, you know, we asked our advisors then, you know, what their ideas were. And we're continually looking at the outlook for next year. So with a vaccine coming out in December , again, we're hoping that that will take effect obviously in the new year. So, yeah, I think the idea here is we keep our options open. That's the whole point I think of this is a bit of a -- the intention is not to use it. The intention is to minimize the effect on, you know, kind of using that as a cash injection , right, in terms of that one-time cash injection . We'd rather have -- we'd rather use that, you know, for other things. And again, going back to I think PEL's notes on the underlying longer term problems that we've got to solve here is, you know, this is -- whatever we do in this short term to get through the COVID issue is very much just a -- you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 it's delaying things, not stopping things. What we fundamentally have to do is look at the way that we raise revenues and the way that the, you know, our overall economy looks. And that's not a short term deal. So this is about not delaying the restructuring , not delaying the preparations to enable the City to do something different , right, in order to get truly into a recovery , right, rather than, you know, we're just kind of treading water and, you know, surviving yet another year. And, you know, there's never -- obviously next year with the uncertainty , I know it's a bit of a hard pill to swallow and we talk about restructuring , we're putting some positions in. We're trying to retain and maybe attract talent as well. It's a difficult thing to ask. But if we don't do it next year, then again, we're just going to delay it another year. Can we do that? And again, this is obviously -- this has been a really good discussion this evening . I've actually really enjoyed it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 I know the questions that Council asked, these are the things I think we really need to talk about and obviously agree, you know, what is the best strategy , you know, what's the timing on the execution of the changes that we're, you know, that we're actually proposing . MR. SCHUSTER : That's a good point that you raised there, Mr. Deeley. That's why I feel like if we knew -- I mean, right off the bat the easiest thing to do is control expenses . So looking at next year if the revenue s were coming in as they usually do, it might be easier to look at some of those positions . But right now the easiest thing is to control those expenditures . When we're looking to do something like this, like I said, if we don't need the 4.4 that this generates , what are the cons to doing -- I mean, I've gone through some of these deals in the past. But maybe explain it to the public, what are the cons or what are the downsides of refinancing one of these deals? We're pushing off debt service payments -- give us some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 those. MS. HUGHES: Certainly . So I think one key feature that at least as I would envision it, is we wouldn't do something until we knew how much we needed to do to exactly your point. I don't want to do a 4.4 million dollar deal if you don't need a 4.4 million dollar cash infusion. If you need two, we should do two. And that's the whole point I think of waiting until we have a little bit more clarity before executing something . Because you are -- it is fundamen tally a restructuring where you are delaying some principal . I mean, I will tell you for the benefit -- I know you were at the school district . When we originally structured this loan, we structure d it with an incredibly aggressive amortization . It had a five year amortization for a whole bunch of reasons related to the original purpose of the transaction . We're going to be pushing it to something that's more historically normal. But I very much hear you on those pros and cons. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 You know, whenever you delay the repayment of debt service , it does pay more interest over time. Absolutely . MR. DEELEY: And this is the crux of this discussion is, do we just hold on for another year and, you know, just kind of really take every step we can to reduce or hold costs through next year and then hopefully things improve hopefully 2022, 2023 is a better year and we start to look at what do we need to do to really look at restructuring . And obviously I think we already started to do obviously with the tax committee , the Mayor's tax committee , I think that's a great start for us. And certainly the intent is as we go into next year is to leverage that, leverage those finding s and start to put those into play as early as we can, right, and really anticipate in 2022 is when we really make those fundamental shifts to start to move the needle on the City. So the -- you know, the fundamental structure that PEL described , right, I think first of all, I didn't get a chance to take thank them. It's great to have that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 continuity , right, I think through the financials , you know, of the City over the last 20 years. You know, we -- we're on this path. And we've got to get off this path just like every other City in Pennsylvania and other states. So the question is, when do you get off this path because we delay it and absolutely we can -- let's say we don't refinance . Let's say we do need a scenario we do need that additional finance . Let's say we need an extra million dollars . And we refinance and we take that. You know, that when you think about it in terms of the impact it will have on the medium or longer term of the City, it's absolutely minimus , right, it's negligible (inaudible .) So it's really about what, you know, what do we want to do now? What -- do we want to start taking action in 2021 to really look at the way the City needs to be set up and the way our tax structure needs to be set up so we could put those things into place. And I think as, you know, I think we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 talked about previously when we don't think we could get there from here with what we have right now -- the structure that we have and, you know, the bench strength that we have to get out of this. So we could push it down the road and say look for better times or we can start to kind of work on it, you know, in 2021. And that is the whole, you know, the whole premise thinking around this budget is, you know, starting earlier generally better than kicking it down the road. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other questions for Melissa or Carl on the options of the budget? MR. SCHUSTER : I mean, I guess when we're talking about starting it earlier , what are we actually talking about starting early? MR. DEELEY: So too starting as we go into next year, so the reorganization obviously which is a big part of the discussion , right, I think on the expenditures I think has been raised. So building our bench strength , putting an organization in place that can actually drive change in the City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And, you know, I think being able to do the things that we want to do where at, you know, a lot -- you know, in terms of the City, in terms of the day-to-day activities , it's -- a lot of it is just really just keeping up with the basic transaction s and keeping the City running rather than working on the City and actually putting project s together working on the future of the City. And what are the changes that we need to make, right, so that we are, you know, longer term more sustainable , right, as a community . So if we don't do it now when do we start? You know, the problem is not going to get smaller . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a question for, Melissa . Would you be able to provide us with what you had shown us, the debt profile of the City? I'd like to take a closer look at that and then, you know, maybe absorb some more information about it and then ask you -- send you some questions as they come along. MS. HUGHES: Yeah, absolutely . I'll provide it to Carl.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. DEELEY: Yeah, and feel free obviously , Council , feel free to reach out anytime. We don't have to wait for the specific meetings. But if you have any particular question s or clarification , you know, please reach out. MR. GAUGHAN : Carl, one of the things that obviously we talked about earlier is the changes we need to make to the budget to correct the increase in salary with the bargaining agreements . So you are going to provide that to Council at some point over the next few days, correct ? MR. DEELEY: Yeah, so I think as we talked about today in term of the amendments that we were tracking , so even from I think the dialogue that we've been having with Council , we've got a list of things. I think you've raised some very valiant points which need to go into the budget so we can provide that list of the amendments that we got. And obviously as we go forward with I think further dialogue and ultimately also we get kind of a public comment as well, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 we may want to make other amendment too. But absolutely , we could supply that to you this week. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. And in terms of, you know, if you did a refinancing obviously is one of the options . We talked about this during the caucus about using that line item of intergovernmental transfer , is that -- if we did a refinancing , would those funds -- is that where they would go into the intergovernmental transfer line item as revenue or how would that work? MR. DEELEY: I think that is a great question . And that's something that I think I'm going to take to get some advice in terms of where it sits, you know, in this particular budget, you know, where does it sit from a revenue perspective . So I'll definitely need to look into that. That's a good question and something which I probably need to talk to -- I'll send to Treasury about it, maybe get some outside advice as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And then, Carl, in terms of the -- it's on our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 agenda tonight in Sixth Order. One of the things that the administration is doing is incorporating the refuse bill on the real estate tax bill in 2021. Has there been a cash flow analysis on whether or not there will be any -- to look at any sort of impact on our cash flow as how that money now comes in because we're doing it differently than we have in the past. MR. DEELEY: Yeah, so obviously one of the key things is from a City perspective is obviously benefit from the community , but from the City also because it smooth that -- potentially it's going to smooth out the revenue cycle for us. So instead of having the two kind of main influxes of revenue , you know, we're going to spread that out through the year. So that in itself will help things. And, you know, obviously , we talked about the TAN this evening , you know, which is one of key vehicles that we use to maintain the cash flows through the ebb and flow of the natural revenues that we have. And certainly that's -- that's going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 to be a benefit to the City. But it's the first time we would have seen it in terms of the payment s, maybe the first and second payment s because it's an earlier payment . The first payment would be earlier but certainly we made some assumption s on that, yeah. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So there shouldn 't be any negative impact by doing -- by putting a refuse bill in the real estate tax bill in terms of our cash flow. MR. DEELEY: No, not at all. It's beneficial rather than negative . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And I just have two other things too. We're not funding the Scranton -- or the plan that you present ed is not funding the Scranton Plan. And I believe we're not funding Scranton Tomorrow only using the funds that we get in from the University of Scranton . So can you just -- that's kind of a different approach than has been taken in the past. So can you talk about that and explain it? MR. DEELEY: Yeah, I'll have to take that back to the Mayor in terms of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 rational e and kind of the reasoning behind that. We had some difficult conversations the last three or four months in terms of what the -- what we believe the City can fund. But certainly I will take that back to the Mayor. And we'll come back to you with the answer on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you. Any other questions ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, when -- sorry. Go ahead, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : I don't really have a question just -- you know, I took this all in. And I'm going to tell you where I'm at. I like Scenario B, all right, because we continue to see money or the workman's comp money goes into a trust that produces dividends like you said. So that's -- I like that idea. I understand -- I still understand the position of the City and the desire for the proposed new positions and the increases . But my position is still it should be phased in. I don't agree doing it this year. So, you know, I'd look at options of phasing it in being more fair and equitable for everybody else. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 And we keep going back to COVID and the uncertainty . So because of that, that's where I am at with all of this. Thank you for the presentation , Melissa . And, Carl, thank you for always coming back to us and have this open dialog. MR. DEELEY: I appreciate that, Council or and, yeah, and that's what this is all about, right, I think is getting that input and ultimately -- obviously everybody on this call has got the community at heart. And ultimately we're going to do the best thing, you know, for the community going forward . So I appreciate your comments . Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I'd like to thank you too. It's been -- we've been going back and forth for several days. And we're getting a lot of information out there. And we're really talking this over. Going back to the TAN, how do we arrive at the bond counsel that we use? MR. DEELEY: I think as Melissa explained , this was a carryover I think from previous years. And so I think really just precedent has been set in terms of the way that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 the TAN had been prepared in the past and we just followed that process . So there was no -- certainly from the City perspective , there was no predetermined view on, you know, whether we -- whether this particular counsel is the right counsel or not. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And normally that would go through an RFP process ? ATTY. HAYES: RFQ. MR. SCHUSTER : RFQ. MR. DEELEY: Well, I think you can go through an RFQ, yeah. ATTY. HAYES: You did that for labor counsel and when you used Stevens and Lee for appellate counsel I know. No -- I think -- yeah, that's how it was done in the past. MR. SCHUSTER : Is there a bid threshold for professional services ? I don't know that offhand . ATTY. HAYES: 21,000. This is just below that, 21,000 on an annual basis. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. MS. HUGHES: I will offer, Councilman Schuster , usually municipalities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 have their bond counsel for as long as they practice typically because they usually have institutional knowledge that they are building on -- just for your benefit . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. All right. Thank you. MS. HUGHES: Yep. MR. GAUGHAN : All right. Any other questions for Melissa or Carl? All right. Thank you so much, Carl and Melissa , for coming tonight and answering our questions . I think the budget is on -- well, it's on our agenda tonight in Sixth Order. And we'll pass it and we'll table it for further discussion . We have a public hearing next week. So we'll continue to converse back and forth until we have a passed budget in probably in the middle of December . Okay? MR. DEELEY: Appreciate it. Thank you. MS. HUGHES: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Have a nice Thanksgiving too. MS. HUGHES: Yeah, you too. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Now, I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 like at this time if someone would please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individual : Fay Franus. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read Miss Franus's comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. Miss Franus' comments are as follows : Council , Bill Gaughan , last week you answered my first question since March. It was in regards to why did council not fight for the people to get them their 50 million dollars that they were overtaxed for? You said that would be like biting off your nose to spite your face because the city would have to file bankruptcy . I definitely believe filing bankruptcy is the best thing this city can do. You would have a fresh start . People are lead to believe by filing bankruptcy . Their taxes can go way up. Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 is already taxing us out of our homes now. That lawsuit the city just won allows for the city to tax the people as high as they please, with no limits. With bankruptcy you can open up these outrageous union contracts . So NO ---Bill Gaughan you are wrong in my opinion . I heard Mayor Cognetti say at last Thursday 's budget meeting she feels sympathetic to the people who have not paid their garbage fees in decades and might possibly knock off their penalties and interest they owe Really? I have to ask why would the Mayor feel bad for these people? Would it be helpful in her election to get all of their votes? Mayor Cognetti should know by doing so it may leave a really bad taste in the mouths of the 75 % of the people who have paid for all of those who haven't paid their garbage fee for over a decade. Would the Mayor want to lose THEIR votes? I would not think so. The Mayor's priorities are definitely mixed up. If anything Mayor Cognetti should feel sympathetic to all of us who paid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 more than we had to, to cover the cost for those who didn't. Again if your answer to collecting these late garbage fees is to continue to put liens on properties that does not work. If you put this fee in the property taxes that only accounts for going forward . This city needs to aggressively go after the people with late fees for decades . As for Mayor Cognettis wishes to give out raises and create positions when people don't have food or losing their businesses city council should never vote for any of this--NONE. Council mentioned if Mayor Cognetti can justify these new positions and raises then you would consider it. There is no justification for any new jobs or raises period! People are broke already because of all of the cities payroll and benefits . Enough already . Council can't keep giving the Mayor every thing she wants. Scranton is a distressed city with sky rocketing taxes and fees. Stop coming to us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 for all of your senseless needs. If you filed bankruptcy years ago we would not have these problems . The Police and Fire Department contracts are up at end of December 2021 right after election day. Is the Mayor going to give away the store to get all of the union votes too like Bill Courtright did? We the taxpayers must pay for those hefty demands from the unions. Never forget that. ECTV should get $120,00 in this budget . They deserve every penny. They have been working for years with hardly anything barely getting by. It is time they get their fair share of the Comcast Franchise fee. If it were not for ECTV workers we would not have a clue what was going on in the city. They are to be thanked . MS. REED: Submitted by Fay Franus. (This concludes public comment as submitted to Council .) MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? Anyone on the question for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 public comment ? I'd like to thank Miss Franus for her comments . Again, anyone who has comment s on the budget, there's a public hearing on December 1st next Tuesday at 5:45. So those comments on the budget will be read into the record by Mrs. Reed. So if you are interested in reviewing the budget, you could access it by going to www.scrantonpa .gov. It is on our agenda from last week so you could download that and you can take a look at it and give us your comment s and any suggestion s you have. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Schuster , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, can't hear you, Mark. Mark -- can anyone else hear Mark? No? ATTY. HAYES: I could read his lips though. MR. MCANDREW : -- get some answers here. So that -- MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, I'm sorry. We missed what you said from the beginning . It cut out for some reason. MR. MCANDREW : Can you hear me now? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, we can hear you now, yeah. So you might have to start over. MR. MCANDREW : It happens every week. It's that hacker, I'm telling you. All right. So last week during the budget hearing I posed two question s to Mr. Deeley and Mayor Cognetti . I've yet to receive responses . So here they are again, Mrs. Reed, could you please forward these. Last week I asked -- (audio interruption .) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 MR. SCHUSTER : You're muted again. MR. GAUGHAN : I think he's cutting out. MR. MCANDREW : -- I'm not referring to, you know, someone in the bargain ing unit. These are supervising positions . And the second question was, what is going to be total number or the amount for the new positions , increases , including total compensation , benefit , salary and pension contribution . Last week we got a number of 838,000. That's without these -- so I'm still awaiting that total number that's going to be added to the budget. All right. And then I have another question . You know, I saw Sunday's article about the gas card reports and that they're being done, you know, in City Hall. My question is, we have a fleet manager now. I thought he was hired to do that. So I'd like to know if that's part of his job descriptions if we get them finally or a better summary or better descriptions . We got the summaries that were only that. They were summaries of the new position s and some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 the ones that are getting increases . So a job description always with me was a list of duties, whether they're hourly, daily, not just a sentence or two. So I would like a, you know, get better clarification s on the job descriptions . And lastly, the day after tomorrow is Thanksgiving . You know, I want to wish everybody a Happy Thanksgiving . We got to keep it safe. Keep it small. I'm only an instant message or e-mail away if you need any help because I know for a lot of people out there, this is going to be the first time they're preparing a Thanksgiving dinner. And I'm happy to help relieve some of that anxiety . Feel free to reach out to me if you're having problems putting that meal on the table. With that said, that's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No motions or comments , just that I could probably use some of Councilman McAndrew 's help. I could cook 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 somewhat , but I might need some ideas from him, so expect a message . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. It's on Facebook . I have a bunch of tips and recipes so check it out. DR. ROTHCHILD : Perfect . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : Council receive d a complaint last week about the conditions of the 300 block of Forest Court, which is between the parking garage and the Diocesan Center in between Linden and Mulberry . So I did talk to the DPW Director Friday afternoon . So I'm hopeful to have an update for whoever called in that complaint to Council 's office by the meeting next week. And I'll save the rest of my comment s for agenda items. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Solicitor Hayes, do you have an update for us on Miss Schumacher 's request I think from maybe three weeks ago? She asked for a list of outstanding lawsuit s and the names of the attorneys or law firms represent ing the City in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 those cases. ATTY. HAYES: I do not. I did reach out to the Law Department and asked them to supply me with that information . I don't have access to that unless I did a docket search and went through every case to see if it's active or not. But I don't have an update on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Could we ask for another update? And, I mean, I can't imagine that it would, you know, take that long to -- they should have information readily accessible . So if we could ask for that by the end of business this week -- or not this week. This week's Thanksgiving -- maybe next week I think would be, you know, more than doable. We've been waiting now quite a long time. ATTY. HAYES: All right. I'll reach out. MR. GAUGHAN : All right. Thank you. Last week I had mentioned and made a motion to ask the administration about the plan for Nay Aug Park. Again, on our agenda tonight in Third Order we have the minutes from the Scranton Recreation Authority . And in those minutes, there is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 concern that, you know, that the pool at Nay Aug Park will not be ready for next year. And I share those concerns . I mentioned last week that I was up at Nay Aug Park at the pool with the Recreation Authority Board member last year. There was several issues up there. And there was money -- capital expenditure money in the budget in the amount of $250,000 I believe that was earmarked by the previous administration to replace the liner and to fix the inside of the pool. There are several things that had to be done. We didn't get a response yet. I think we need a response as soon as possible . You know, I'll be talking to the Mayor this week. And if -- I think we should look at if there is some way that we can either pass legislation or, you know, if the administration is not willing to release those funds or look at the impact on the budget moving towards the end of the year because it's my understanding that without those funds, the pool will not be ready for next year. So it's a major concern of mine. I don't know what next -- this upcoming summer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 will look like in terms of being able to swim in the pools. But if the news of vaccines and everything else keeps up, I think there may be an opportunity . So if it's not done next year, it will have to be then the year after. So it's something that, you know, it's an asset of the City. We have to continue to invest in it and make sure that it's being kept up properly . At this time, I'd also like to make a motion to request from the Scranton Sewer Authority a full accounting of all escrow account s and also request a timeline from the Authority on the release of those dollars in the escrow accounts to the City. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , the reason I make this motion, I think we should get an update. I'm not too sure exactly what amount of money is left in these escrow accounts . But I do know in reading the recent newspaper article that it looks like the issues there with -- that the different property owners what was holding up the release of those funds to the City that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 coming to an end. So I think that there is a potential that we could look at those dollars as a funding source potentially for next year depending on how much that amount would be. And I think there was a few million dollars in one escrow account . And then I think there was a second one. But I'm not positive off the top of my head. So there's another opportunity I think here that those dollars could potentially go towards covering the shortfall for next year. So that's why I made that motion. If it passes I think we should send that to the Executive Director or the Scranton Sewer Authority and to get that information as soon as possible . Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : And just on the question , it is my understanding that, you know, the majority of the easement issues were cleared. But, you know, there still are the ones from the opt-outs that needs to be settled in one form or the other. So I know if, you know, all the money would be available or if some of the money will be available . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 But I agree in 100 percent of getting an accounting of, you know, what could potentially be available . I would just caution about, you know, saying, you know, funding sources because I think at some point too, you know, we're going to have to talk about how we're going to use that money as a startup funds for some sort of stormwater management system whichever way we go there in the next, you know, two to five years. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it have it so moved. And the last thing, Mrs. Reed, if we could just request a copy -- usually when we get the budget we receive a copy of the workers' compensation reserve analysis and loss forecast. So if we can just request a copy of that at some point before the next Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 meeting. And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT FOR COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT MUNICIPAL CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON WITH PORTNOFF LAW ASSOCIATES , LTD. AND APPROVING COLLECTION PROCEDURES , APPOINTMENT OF SOLICITOR , INTEREST ASSESSMENT , CREDIT CARD AND DEBIT CARD CHARGES , AND FEES AND COSTS TO BE ADDED TO THE AMOUNT COLLECTED AS PART OF UNPAID MUNICIPAL CLAIMS FOR DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'd like to just make a motion that we request Portnoff to come into one of our caucuses just to give us a presentation on, you know, how they, you know, their collection procedures , some of their expectation s and then maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 answer any questions we might have before final passage . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. There's been a motion. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I just -- this is, you know, with contracts of, you know, this significance , I think it's normal practice that they just come in and just give us a presentation . MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. There's been a motion, a second, on the question . All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. On the question , I have a few questions here. I agree with Councilman Donahue that we should ask that Portnoff come in and answer questions . But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 there's a few things that stuck out to me in my initial review of this. Number one, I'd like to see the RFP submissions for all five bidders to this request for proposals . One of the things that I did not see is the time political contribution disclosure form or any disclosure forms that are usually always in the backup or should be in the backup to this legislation . In light of all of the issues that we had with NRS here within the last few years, I think it's extremely important that we make sure that any and all information is disclose d to Council before we would ever make a final decision . In looking at the agreement , it allows for Portnoff to collect all unpaid collections of the Municipal Claims and Tax Lien Act. However , the RFP was limited to the collection of delinquent refuse fees for the years 2002 to 2020. I believe that the contract and the ordinance needs to be amended so that it only covers the service s that were contained in the actual request for proposals. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 I'd also like to request that prior to this being approved if it is approved that the -- there's unpaid fees and costs up to a certain amount that Portnoff is including in their proposal . And I'd like to request that we consider having them first come back to the City and to Council to request prior authorization so that the City is not stuck with a large amount of unpaid fees or costs owed to them and other outside attorneys because they have not collected it or the agreement is terminated at some point. Also, in my review of this RFP, it states that Portnoff has been used by other municipalities , specifically it's indicated that they have seven local contracts . So I'm very interested to determine whether these other municipalities have had a positive experience . So I think we need to contact those seven local municipalities who have contracts with Portnoff . I think we need to really, really take a close look at this before final passage . And as Councilman Donahue said understand the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 business model that would be used. I was also under the impression that this would be kind of a short term thing because we were going to work towards moving in the direction of the county for the county to perform this type of work. I think we need to look at the term that's included in the contract . It says it would be -- I think re-up every year or something to that effect unless either party says that they don't want to do that. So I think we need to take a look at that. Again, these questions are being asked in the spirit of transparency and in order for us to conduct our due diligence in light of the negative experience we had with NRS. I don't think we want to make the same mistake . We want to make sure that all of our I's are dotted and our T's are crossed. And that starts with the disclosure , which quite frankly , I cannot understand or believe that that was not included here. This is at least the second or third time that that documentation has not been included with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 contract or legislation . And we've had to ask for, you know, it to be included . Then we have to put it in Third Order. It just is unacceptable . I could see it maybe happening once, twice but this is like the third or fourth time. And it should not happen. I've made a point in speaking with the Law Department and the administration that political contribution disclosures are important . Attorney Hayes and I pushed for that to be included in all RFPs moving forward . And I think that that's important again, in light of all of the things that have gone on in the past just to be extremely transparent. So that's all I have on that. Any other questions ? Or anybody else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I agree. The disclosure three times in a row and we're always told it was an oversight. So, I mean, three times, shame on us. We have to fix this. Thanks. DR. ROTHCHILD : I was just going to express the same thing that, you know, I agree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 that it's unacceptable . And I really can't understand why these documents wouldn't be included . The disclosure forms are important . And so I feel like they should know at this point we're going to ask for that. And it's making more work on our end and theirs. So if they could just include that from right off the bat, I don't think there would be an issue. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING OF THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA ACTING THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH FINANCING AUTHORITY FOR A LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT GRANT 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 PURSUANT TO THE GAMING FUNDS GRANT PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF $257,925.00 TO INSTALL A HVAC SYSTEM IN EMERGENCY SERVICES CENTER (FORMERLY SERRENTI ARMORY) LOCATED AT 1801 PINE STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, IF SUCCESSFUL , AND EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT GRANT CONTRACT AND COMMITMENT LETTER WITH THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA TO ACCEPT AND UTILIZE THE GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $257,925.00 AWARDED BY THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR SUCH PROJECT . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question . I think in the past there was some questions asked about the total expense that has been put forth at this point in time for this building . Did we ever get any of that information ? MR. GAUGHAN : I believe we did. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 Mrs. Reed, did the -- I think the Business Administrator provided a breakdown of what has been spent. I think in the past we've received a breakdown of all the money that's been allocated for that building , correct ? MS. REED: I believe so, Council man. And I'll check the BA and the Police Department files and pull the information I have and I'll send to Councilman Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I know this is a grant. And it's great to see grant money going towards some of these project s. Maybe looking at this going forward we see what the administration has in mind of upgrade s and work being done and see if we can get maybe an end goal in sight or at least estimate of where they're going to go with this facility . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else? I was originally opposed to the acquisition of this property for a number of different reasons, one of which was because at that time in 2017 with the position that we were in financially , I just didn't feel that adding another asset that the City would have to maintain and take care of would make much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 sense. And at that time it wasn't clear what the cost would be moving forward in terms of maintaining and the upkeep of that building . With that being said, the building was acquired . I did not win that battle. So at this point, you know, you can't put toothpaste back in the tube. The fire department and police department I believe are both starting to use this building in some capacity . This grant does not require a match from the City, which is good thing. And I think it's in the amount of $257,925 to repair the HVAC system. So at this point since we already have acquire d it and there's already been money put into it, it really doesn't make sense to me to sit on it and not try to make it into a useable facility with keeping in mind to use as much grant money as possible so it doesn't affect our overall budget. One of the benefits of this that no one could have foresaw back in 2017 was the potential use for this facility as an overflow location for COVID patients in the event that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 our hospital system is filled to capacity , which we're not there yet. But, I mean, over the next few months, who knows what could happen at the rate that the cases are rising. So inadvertently I think this actually turned out to be not a terrible thing because we do have the building . It's close to the hospital system and, you know, it could benefit the City in the long run. So I'll be voting for this -- to this grant. And again, I think it's important to know that there's no match requirement by the City. So hopefully we get the full amount. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So, I mean, I know like you said you can't put toothpaste back in the tube. But so we used a lot of COVID money so far to put into this building , am I correct in saying that, or some funds went towards that with the thought process that we might need it. But I'm not clear because this is all new too with the COVID money. So if we put COVID money, a lot of COVID money into that building and don't use it for such, is there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 any penalty for that or is that going to come back on us? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't believe -- I don't know off the top of my head. But I don't believe so because the intent when they use the money I think to fix the pluming and to do something else it was -- I think it was in the $60,000 range that they submitted -- the bills that they submitted . I think with the intent being that you would have to make those upgrade to have that facility be oper -- you know, be able to operate for the hospitals , I don't think we would get knocked for that if it ends up not, you know, being the case that we don't have to use it. But I don't know that for sure. So that's a question that I think we should probably ask. It's a good question . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER CITY OFFICIALS TO MAKE A SOLVENCY PAYMENT TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND INDUSTRY BUREAU OF UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Solicitor Hayes, there's a lot of kind of legales in here. Would you be able to provide an explanation maybe in layman's terms of what this legislation is attempt ing to accomplish ? ATTY. HAYES: This is a -- so with regard to the workers ' compensation -- or the unemployment compensation ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. So for employers that are under the Pennsylvania unemployment compensation law governed by them, they have to make contribution s on behalf of their employees . There's two methods to do that. It's either a contributory method or a reimbursable method. The City is a reimbursable method. And they reimburse the unemployment compensation fund on a regular basis. So what is provided -- the department of -- or the Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Fund has now begin processing the relief from charge credits related to COVID-19 claims. And then credits from the automatic relief from charges for eligible claims, they -- you get a credit for -- you get a credit for making those contributions . The amount that's set .00.18 that are gross wages, that rate has been determined by the City. So what they're asking here is very standard just approval to make these contribution s to the Unemployment Compensation Fund which they are require d to do by law. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 there is nothing unique or special about what's being requested . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. That makes sense. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Also, Mr. Hayes, so that is the usual route that would be taken? ATTY. HAYES: Yeah, they are just setting the rate and asking authorization to do this on a regular -- on a regular basis. MR. SCHUSTER : And it always goes through the Department of Labor and Industry ? ATTY. HAYES: Correct . MR. SCHUSTER : Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other questions ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

SCHUSTER : On the question , I move -- I'd like to make a motion to table Item 6-B. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I think we'll -- we're going to do that after the -- after on the question I think after everyone is done talking about the budget or if anyone would like to make comment on the budget. So are there any comment s on the budget before we make a motion to table it? MR. SCHUSTER : I think -- I mean, the concerns and comment s I've made, I've made all along here. I think when we're looking at the, you know, the creeping expenditure growth of 3 percent , you know, coupled with the slower moving revenue of 1 percent , I think, you know, when we're looking at that I do think adding some of these new positions now -- maybe with some of the justification s we're given maybe we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 could, you know, make government and City of Scranton more efficient and maybe some of these positions would be justified in helping with that. But, I mean, just an overall view looking at that, I feel like it's adding a million dollars into the next year's budget. I'd much rather either phase that in or, you know, look at what our revenues look like in the following year to move forward after that period. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, my position hasn't changed either. I'm not happy with adding new positions that, you know, they're going to total a million dollars . We need to do -- and I know we need to restructure . I get it. It's not that I'm against it. I understand it, the necessity of it. But now's not the year. And I know they keep saying, well, what about next year? I'm just not comfortable adding, you know, a million dollars to the budget just for new hires and increases . We already looking at a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 4 million dollar shortfall. So I just think maybe this year, you know, we do more with less. COVID was the biggest obstacle . It's still here. It's not going away. So maybe next year we revisit it. That's still my position . I don't see myself changing it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else? I have a couple comments . So first, last week I did ask about the other salary. And the Business Administrator did send an e-mail to me yesterday regarding my questions . And I just want to go through them very quickly . The increase in the other salary for fire department is predominantly severance pay, a total of 11 fire department members are eligible for retirement in 2021. So that breaks down to acting pay $120,000; education , 77,000; and remaining 313,000 is for severance pay. I also question ed there was other salary that was expended in 2020 even though it wasn't budgeted. Mr. Deeley had told me that the 2020 payment in the LIPS Department was a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 settlement issue in connection with a labor matter filed by four employees . So those funds had to be put in there when a settlement was reached . The $20,000 currently showing in the 2021 budget will be removed as part of amendment s that the administration is putting forward for their budget. I also asked about a $5,000 expenditure in the DPW budget and he was going to look into that. And then, of course, as we heard tonight the administration is going to submit additional information about changes that we will need to make because there was additional expenditure s that weren't included in the budget in terms of raises that we were contractually obligate d to pay out to the DPW. And I believe there was a few clerical employee s that received raises. But according to the administration 's plan, they were not to receive raises. So those things have to be ironed out. And I think we'll receive information on that this week. One of the other things that came up last week and tonight was about the use of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 Labor and Industry funds, the excess reserve funds from the workers ' compensation money, using that and putting that in the intergovernmental transfer line item. And I think Business Administrator Deeley agreed that he would need to find out further information on if that is, in fact, a correct representation -- would be a correct representation in the budget. That's why I asked the question . I'm not really sure because the -- we're going from recognizing that as restricted funds to unrestricted funds. And technically , I believe that those funds are an asset in the City. So should we put it in that line item. That's an outstanding question . Also, there was things that weren't funded that I have questions -- still have questions about, the Scranton Plan, Scranton Tomorrow and I -- the Business Administrator said that we'll hear further information or he'll take it back to the Mayor. One of the things we have to remember with Scranton Tomorrow and I think we should reach out Leslie Collins before we pass 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 this budget in the middle of December , is that a few years ago there was a plan that was developed by the National Resource Network . And it was a multiyear process that created a plan for the downtown which eventually according to the plan would transition downtown into a business improvement district . So Scranton Tomorrow was charged with instituting that plan and carrying out that plan. And I know we have a copy of the plan in Council 's office if anybody would like to take a look at it. There was a lot of thought and a lot of things that went into the creation of that plan. OECD has the entire City to create project s that impact different neighborhoods , low to moderate income areas. And I think maybe one of the things that the administration wants to do is to move the focus away from Scranton Tomorrow and onto OECD. But the way that the NRN plan was set up really put the focus on Scranton Tomorrow with the contribution coming from the City and the University of Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 So I know that the University of Scranton 's portion of that funding would still be in the budget. But it looks like we would be holding back our funding. I realize you sometimes have to make tough decisions , but I think we need to really investigate what the impact of not providing that funding to Scranton Tomorrow would be next year and then weigh that information on whether or not we want to continue down the route with the plan that the administration has proposed. One of the other items in there that may be, you know, is only $30,000 and maybe seems insignificant was the funding for the Everhart Museum. I think we should put that back. $30,000 in the context of a 110 to 15 million dollar really isn't -- it's a drop in the bucket. Every year that I've been on Council the Everhart Museum has used that money. So I think we should contact -- and, Mrs. Reed, if you could contact the representative s or whoever is in charge of the Everhart just to see what they use that funding for. I think that before -- I know that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 the Mayor had stated that the Everhart Museum didn't come to the administration with an ask. But again, I think we need to know what the impact would be if we didn't include that funding . And the Everhart is an important institution here in the City of Scranton . The other, you know, I think I agree with my colleagues on I think we have to weigh each position -- there are new positions in the budget. I think we have to look at each one individually and determine whether or not we feel after getting the information from the administration whether or not those positions would add value, would they add more efficiency . There are some that I think probably would. And we have to weigh those decisions and those positions over the next few weeks. One of the things that came up last week that I could say that I do not agree with and I think needs more investigation is the changes that are occurring in the Parks Department . I took exception with what the Mayor stated last week at our work session , which I stated clearly during that work session which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 is that, you know, if we don't follow the changes in the Parks Department that the Mayor is suggesting that, you know, I think her words were do, you know, "Do you guys want to fix our parks up or do you want to scrap the study?" If you are serious about fixing the parks, you know, or do we want to, you know, take that and take the parks off of the priority list? The parks have always been a priority with me. I live across the street from one that has been rehabbed with grant money over the last few years. I just don't believe that -- and again, we'll look at it over the next few weeks. But I don't believe in this specific instance that adding another management position to that department is going to help the issues that may exist in this department . The issues are there that there are not enough employees . There's only seven employees . McDade Park has 10 employees just for -- the county has 10 employees just for McDade Park. You could probably take all seven of those employes in Parks and Recreation and have them working full time up at Nay Aug Park.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 You are spreading those employees out over the City of Scranton which is 26, I think, square miles and 30-some -- we have a huge park system, cut the grass, weed whack. And on top of that, they do other things as well. So I think before we add a management position , we need to make sure that the structure is in place because who are these people going to manage if they are moving the grounds keepers under the supervision of highways in DPW? I think the intention was maybe noble. But I don't think after what I've seen the last few years it makes a lot of sense. And I think we should change that and maybe look towards adding additional casual employees and making sure that a program is in place next year for college students and high school student s like they used to do in the time past to work with City to cut grass and weed whack and things like that to help the employees that work there. Because we know that adding positions costs money obviously . That's what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 we're discussing . So in a perfect world, we'd have way more than seven employee s in the Parks Department . And if you look at other cities across our state and our country , with our park system, other cities have 20 to 30 employees . And they get -- are able to get things done. I don't think it's a problem with the employees . I know many of them. I see the work that they do at the park across the street from my house. They do great work. It's the fact that they're stretched way too thin. So adding a management position there when there's already a director , it just -- I don't know that there would be enough for them to manage. So I think we need to look at that closely . And I don't agree with what's being proposed there. I've also had discussion s with Mr. Deeley who I have to say -- I said he was a glutton for punishment earlier today. I do appreciate , you know, the Business Administrator and the Mayor continuing to show up, answer the questions , have a dialogue with Council even though we may disagree with some things. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 To me, that is called good government . And I'm glad to see that that is taking place that we can, you know, continue to have those discussions because in the past, it wasn't always that way. So I think, you know, we need to continue to capitalize on this and keep that -- keep those line of communications open. I'm very pleased with the way that that has worked out. One of the things I did talk to the Business Administrator with earlier today is, for example , in the police department , it looks as though there -- what they're proposing is to create a new position , a deputy police chief in the police department which I can understand . I know Chief Graziano had recommended that before he left. However , what they're doing there by taking a patrolman off the street to create that position , I don't know that I agree with that. I think that really has to be investigated further . And then we did talk about that would be a change I think to the Collective Bargaining Agreement . Those things have not been bargained yet. And we're going to do that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 and then I just think we should have an agreement in front of us before we go ahead and make a change like that. If they don't agree to it, I could just foresee issues there. If you want to create the position and you could find funding for it without taking a patrolman off of the -- out of -- off of the street, I guess you could say, I may look at that a little bit differently . One of the small things in there and I talked to the Business Administrator about this earlier today that it's very minute but it just stuck out to me something that we should look at is they're eliminating the water for employees , the water service . I just think that's overboard . Right now there is no water fountain s in City Hall because of the coronavirus . Every place that I've ever worked in my life, your employer provided fresh drinking water for you when you're working there. I don't think the expense is that much that it's something that, you know, you want to cut you're going to save all of this money. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 I think we should put that expense back in, you know, you're asking these people always to do more with less. And then you're going to take away water from them in each department . That does not make any sense to me, especially during a pandemic when there is no water source in City Hall according to the Business Administrator . So overall , I think we're going to take all of the information that we received tonight from PFM and from the Business Administrator . We're going to take that into account , all of the discussion that we've had over the last few days. And we're going to continue to consider this budget and any changes that we might make. We are in a minute, Councilman Schuster , will table this budget. And then we'll take comment s from the public next week which I think is a very important component of this overall process . So hopefully we'll hear from people next week on what their thoughts are on this budget. And then we'll hopefully bring it back either on December 8th or the 15th for final passage .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 And in the meantime , if anyone has any amendments to start thinking about what things you might want to change and we'll have to come to some sort of agreement there and offer up those amendments in the middle of December . And we can talk about that process and the way that we've done it in the past over the next few weeks. But those are my comments on the budget. The last thing I want to say too is, you know, I really want to avoid -- and I was a little bit more relieved tonight after seeing the second scenario that was presented by PFM because we could hopefully avoid using those funds that were earmarked or designated for the Other Post Employment Benefit Trust Fund. As you heard from the Pennsylvania Economy League and I think from PFM, there are major benefits of funding that OPEB Trust Fund. So to blow through that if we had to next year, you're losing that benefit . You don't get -- we're not getting that back. So if there is a way that we could avoid that, I really think that we should. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 There are some other minor things that I continue to look at in the budget. But overall , we'll take -- I'll take everything into consideration and we'll continue to move forward . Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I just had a couple quick comments . First off, I am interest ed in getting some more answers with regards to the Nay Aug pool repair because that is something I think is very important for us to take a look at and to see if that needs to be a part of the budget. You know, I know that that pool is in desperate need and that's utilize d by a lot of people in the community . The other thing I just think the biggest sticking point for Council with this budget is going to be the addition of new jobs, the changes in department s and then, like, the increase s to pay. And I agree that we need to look at each position individually . I do appreciate us receiving the job descriptions I believe last week. So I did have a chance to take a look through those. But I would like to definitely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 discuss that more in-depth with my fellow Council members . And I'm wondering -- I don't know -- I don't believe we have any other work sessions scheduled . Is that something that we would be able to add so that we can really dive deeper into the those changes and into those positions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I think -- I think probably what would make the most sense is, you know, over the next few days if anyone has any additional questions outside of what's already been answered , maybe we can compile those questions or those concerns into some kind of document and then present it to the administration and then we could have a work session targeted towards those additional questions or those additional areas because I think with the second work session we had, we kind of went through the budget as a whole. And now maybe if we can put our questions -- any additional question s or thoughts down, give them to the administration in advance and then be able -- if they are agreeable to that which I -- based on, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25105 know, how open they've been so far, I think they would be to have them maybe come back within the next two or three weeks before final passage . Yeah, I think that's a good idea. DR. ROTHCHILD : I feel like that would be a better way to go rather than us, you know, just throwing amendment s left and -- left and right. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, no, actually with the amendments so the -- what I've always believed too is if we are going to offer up like we did last year, we proposed several amendments to the budget. We would communicate those with the administration . Now, maybe we make some amendments that they don't agree with and that's fine. They will obvious ly tell us that and communicate that to us. But I do think that we should run it by the Business Administrator and the Mayor to say, look, here's what we're thinking and then go from there whether or not we're going to introduce those at some point. But I agree with you. I'm sorry, did you have anything else, Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, that was all I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25106 had. Thank you.

MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : I lost my place there for a second. As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of 7-A. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a second. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , Mr. Hayes, last week I asked about whether this transaction was comparable with other transaction s of this nature. With some of the information that we got tonight , do we still feel that's -- what would your opinion be on that at this point? ATTY. HAYES: Well, Council man, it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25110 certainly comparable with the prior TANs that have been issued by City of Scranton . So, you know, the TANs that I have been involved in did not necessarily have this amount of fees. However , the ones I was involved in were not as large. You know, this is as Council man Deeley -- or as Business Administrator Deeley indicated , this just seemed to be a carryover from past practices from prior administration s. And that's what they did in this instance too. Obviously , Council is not consulted about that process . But I think that's, you know, as good of an explanation as we are going to get is what was provided earlier today. I had reached out to the Law Department earlier last week about that. I did not receive a response . MR. SCHUSTER : Do you think it would be a good idea to table it until we have a complete explanation ? ATTY. HAYES: Well, I think that's up to Council . The explanation that we have I think is that bond counsel has been on standby or they have this bond counsel they've used for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 the last probably four or five years. They use this bond counsel every year. And they pay them the same amount of -- the same fee every year regardless of what work is involved . And they seem to have the same fees every year. I don't know if there is any harm in tabling it to be honest with you in terms of the rate. But if you want further clarification , I could each reach out. Here's the long and short of it. I don't think there is anything we can do at this point in time in terms of I think they made this commitment to this bond counsel to pay him this amount. I don't know how that is memorialize d. I'm sure he's already expended for the, you know, the work in furtherance of that fee. Going forward if there is something that Council wants to change with that process I guess we could address that later. MR. SCHUSTER : Well, I think I'd like to make a motion to table this until we have a complete explanation . MR. MCANDREW : I'll second it. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 and it's been seconded. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , what's been the change in the rate between two weeks ago? Does anyone have that readily available ? MR. GAUGHAN : You mean the interest rate? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, because I know that it was specific towards to when we actually pass this resolution to lock in that rate. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I think it was my understanding as of tonight that the rate had been locked in. ATTY. HAYES: It's at 1.209; is that correct ? MR. GAUGHAN : I think that's right now that's what it is. I don't know if we table it -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, that's -- that was a part of your question the first time -- or the first week, Kevin, was locking it in and how there was a variable rate in our first -- in the first resolution we introduced. ATTY. HAYES: Right.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25113 MR. DONAHUE : And they did that just to give a, you know, just an idea of what the rate would fall under but that the rate would be incumbent on when we -- when we passed our final, you know, resolution . MR. GAUGHAN : I understand the concern here. But I just don't agree with tabling it because we're not going to get any other explanation than what was already given unfortunately -- fortunately or unfortunately . That's just, you know, the explanation was given from Melissa Hughes from PMF and from Carl Deeley the Business Administrator . You know, tabling it is not going to change what again, you can't put toothpaste back in a tube. It's not going to change. We need the TAN. And I would be concerned that, you know, we would lose out on the interest rate. It's lower than what was even proposed last week. So I'm not -- I understand the reason for the motion. But I'm not going to vote to -- I'm not going to vote for the motion. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 about this? So, you know, a lot of toothpaste flying around here, Billy, so just because it was past practice doesn't make it best practice . All right. So obviously , you know, Solicitor Hayes, you said it's probably too late to do anything . But it's not too late to do anything for next time. So let's, you know, let's change that practice next time. Obviously it's too late to do that. But, you know, I'm not always a big fan of past practice . That doesn't always justify best practice . ATTY. HAYES: Right. So what I think, you know, what I could do is try to get a full explanation as to how they arrived at that number of 20,000. MR. MCANDREW : They already told us. I think we just don't table it. I'm okay with that now. I'm just saying moving forward , you know, let's change that practice . All right? MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. MCANDREW : Sorry to interrupt you but -- MR. GAUGHAN : No, it's okay. Anything else on the --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, and if we have the rate locked in and, yeah, it is lower, I did take a look at the e-mail we receive d from Mr. Deeley where it's 1.201, which is originally it was 1.209. So it's a difference of .008. But, you know, they were here to answer our questions , which they did. So I don't have any further questions for them at this time. I mean, I do wish that we had a say in the bond counsel decision . Perhaps if there's legislation that we can consider to change that for in the future, then I think that would be appropriate . But at this time, I'm not in favor of tabling it. MR. GAUGHAN : Anybody else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of the motion to table signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Opposed ? No. MR. DONAHUE : Nay. DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. GAUGHAN : And, I'm sorry, Mark, did you vote? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, to table just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25116 for the support . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So the motion dies 3 to 2. Okay. And we're back on the question . Anyone else on the question for 7-A? Just on the question , I don't know that, Kevin, maybe you could answer this; but I don't know that Council , would we have any say in what gets negotiated in terms of fees or whether an RFQ goes out for bond counsel or that would be a function of the administration . I mean, we can give our opinion on it. But do we have a say on that? ATTY. HAVES: Well, for professional services , the Administrative Code provide s that any professional service s that are anticipate d to be over $21,000 a year have to be put out for bid. So obviously , this was tailored to fall just below that. We can -- our recourse is we could ask, you know, the past practice of this administration at least has been to put out RFPs. You know, they did it for, you know, obviously for labor. They did it for the appeal. But in those situations they were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25117 over $21,000. So and maybe they could provide us with a more detailed explanation as to why there is, you know, some $44,000 worth of closing costs and closings fees that are baked into this deal. But our only recourse is to vote up and down on the TAN really. That's our only resource. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. All right. MR. SCHUSTER : And, I mean, looking at this, I mean, other deals can be done through the bank, correct , Kevin? ATTY. HAYES: Right. Um hum. So the takeaway here is the bank -- the administration for whatever reason had decided to hire their own bond counsel outside of the Law Department to perform services in connection with this transaction . I'm not aware of any requirement for them to do that for the -- it wasn't the bank that demanded it. They wanted to do it. And it's based on from what Carl Deeley said, it's based on past practice to use this law firm, to pay them this fee for no matter how much work is involved on an annual basis.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25118 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, and I guess the other takeaway is that it's not a bond. It's a loan. ATTY. HAYES: It's a note. Right. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS.
