Do any council members have any announcements at this time? I have one just one, an executive session was held this evening regarding a matter of litigation . MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 (The following speakers offered public comment as follows : Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business . Lee Morgan spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . Jay Walsh spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : As was mentioned before on Friday night I had the opportunity of stopping at the opening of the Black Scranton Projects Remembering and Understanding the Heritage of Black Scrantonians exhibit at the Marketplace at Steamtown , and I must say that Glynnis Johns did an absolutely tremendous job putting it all together and I encourage everyone to check it out if you get a chance. The exhibit is on the second floor of the Marketplace until Thursday , February 28. Moving on, over two months ago council approved a ten-year tax abatement on all new construction in order incentivize 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 economic development in the city. The school district approved that same legislation about two weeks after we did so the last piece of the puzzle is for the county to pass the legislation but it has not yet been placed on their agenda and I can't think of any logical reason yet why they haven't put it on there especially since they have approved similar legislation throughout the county. So, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send a letter to the commissioners asking when and/or if they plan on putting LERTA legislation for the City of Scranton on their agenda? Thank you. And, also, last week Governor Wolf announced a major new infrastructure initiative called Restore Pennsylvania which will invest $4.5 billion to be funded by a common sense severance tax on natural gas productions . Pennsylvania is the only major producing -- only major natural gas producing state who does not levy a severance tax. This plan would not only reinvest severance tax proceeds into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 infrastructure for the betterment of all Pennsylvania ns, but certain aspects of this plan can certainly benefit the residents of Scranton . There were a total of five priority infrastructure areas that were outlined in the governor 's proposal. I'm just going to highlight the four of them that could have the biggest impact on the City of Scranton . The first one is storm prepare dness and disaster recovery . That includes critical flood control infrastructure such as stream and bank restoration , which is the responsibility of the city as well as dams, levies and flood walls, helping families rebuild by creating a disaster relief trust fund to assist individuals that don't qualify for compensation by FEMA or other program s, and it also helps with storm water infrastructure . A storm water plan is going to be mandated so it's coming whether we like it or not and, quite frankly , we are going to need all the help we are going to get. Another part of it is demolition , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 revitalization renewal which includes funding for blight demolition and redevelopment , brown field clean up, containment , remediation and green infrastructure , and then the other two that I think could be beneficial to the city is transportation capital projects and also high speed internet access. These are areas that municipalities all across the state are struggling to find realistic ways to finances these projects that must be done and are mandated to be done and it's encouraging that we have a governor who recognizes these challenges and is willing to take the lead to address them. Thank you. That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, briefly . I also attended as was talked about before the Black Scranton Project on First Friday at Steamtown Marketplace . I have to tell you it was very informative and a well done history of black history in Scranton and I would like to recognize and thank Glynnis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Johns for all of the hard work, dedication and vision she has put into this effort. For her, it really is a true labor of love. So, Glynnis , we are all very proud of you for all the hard work you did not only for your community but for all of Scranton . I'd like to comment briefly as well on some comments made last week from a speaker about our change to Monday meetings . I think they needed a little further clarification . First of all, I'd like to thank Councilman Perry relative to Monday meetings and his work schedule . Historically city council meetings have been changed to different days because of city council members schedules so this is nothing new. However , the latest conspiracy theory that it was done just to have less meetings is absurd. So, for the record, in 2017 when city council met on Thursday we had 42 regular council meetings . 2018 when we changed to Mondays there were 38 regular council meetings , plus the scheduled work session and two schedule d idea sessions all the while entertaining 140 different pieces 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 of legislation so it would appear that we had one less public meeting last year than the year before. So, as I have stated in the past and I will repeat it again tonight , I think me may have too many regular city council meetings, and clearly we are the city, the outlier, as compared to other cities throughout Pennsylvania that are our size I'm not saying that we have too many meetings , I'm saying we may have too many regular city council meetings and I'll fully explain that in my comments , but first I'd like to repeat the results of a study that I did earlier in the year on city council meetings for those that did not hear those comments or simply weren't listening . Allentown city council meets twice a month on thee first and third Wednesdays . Altoona city council meets once a month on the second Wednesday . Bethlehem city council meets twice a month on the first and third Tuesdays . Easton city council meets twice a month on the second and four Wednesday s. Erie city council meets twice a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 month on the first Wednesday at 9 a.m., and the third Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Harrisburg city council meets twice a month for a regular city council meeting on the second and fourth Tuesdays , but they also meet on the first and third Tuesdays for a work session . Hazelton city council meets twice a month for nine months and once a month for three months. Lancaster city council meets twice a month on the second and fourth Tuesdays . Reading city council meets twice a month on the second and fourth Mondays . Wilkes-Barre city council meets twice a month for the regular city council meeting on the second and fourth Thursday and then they meet on the second and fourth Tuesday for a work session . Finally , York city council meets twice a month on the first and third Tuesday . So clearly we are the exception as far as our meeting schedule is concerned . Regular city council meetings are twice a month in every city reviewed and only two city council s meet beyond that, Harrisburg and Wilkes-Barre that add two monthly work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 sessions to their schedule of two meetings per month. As I have said repeatedly, I personally feel that two regular city council meeting s along with two work sessions monthly that Wilkes-Barre and Harrisburg currently do is the most efficient meeting schedule . It allows for work session s to be scheduled days or even a week before a regular city council meeting allowing for the council to more fully discuss agenda items prior to introduction as well as to have a more in-depth discussion on pressing city business . It also allows city council to bring a special guest for conversations and valuable debate on a more regular basis. So to me this is a meeting model that promotes more efficient and effective city government . Now, I'm not proposing that right now, because it may take a Home Rule Charter revision to even do that, but I think it's something people to need to know how I feel about this because I think these meetings are valuable , they are absolutely valuable for a lot of different reasons , but, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 know, we have taken it a little too far. And all of our work session s, by the way, if we went that route would be on city council -- or would be on public view, the press would be here, ECTV would be here, we would be sitting right at that table, but the fallacy that our weekly meetings are all that city council members do is another thing that irks me week in and week out. I can tell you over the last four plus years that I have been on city council that this meeting probably accounts for 5 to 15 percent of an average week with the time spent on city business , and I'm sure my colleagues could agree with that as far as their schedules are concerned as well. So, yes, I will repeat, these meetings are absolutely important . They are the mechanism that we use to get the city's business through passing or rejecting legislation as well as providing input and information to citizens and taxpayers. I get it. The question is can we do better? And that's all, I'll just leave it at that. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First of all, I just want to thank Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow , Tim Maloney from Scranton Tomorrow for coming in and giving us a presentation and update on all of the different things that is currently going on with that organization . I was really impressed with the presentation . I do think that that organization is trying to improve the city and I think the city is go ing to be better off for all of the commitments that they he have made and all of the work that they have done and that they will continue to do so I want to thank them for that. The Serrenti Center has come up multiple times and we did receive a response from Mr. Bulzoni , and I know Ms. Hodowanitz was curious about it so I'll read a portion of it. I didn't get a chance to go through all of the numbers , but I will do that next week. The technology component of the overhaul of the building was complete d by city personnel . Mr. Bulzoni said that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 delineation of costs remained since the principal project components have yet to be undertaken . Relative to the poll barn that I asked about last week, the estimated cost is $18,000. The intent of the pole barn is generally to clean up and store items which are either needed on sight or are transient . The cost is included in the police capital budget. Other components of improvements to the police headquarter 's site are sidewalk improvements , resurfacing of the parking lot and the ESCO component or energy upgrades . The ESCO component will be funded by an energy least incorporating the police, public works, and public safety buildings . There is a comprehensive project at the police department headquarters to clean up the property . As I mention ed, it will include sidewalk reconstruction , the pole barn, paving of the lot, savings to the building . At the Serrenti Center, Mr. Bulzoni reports that they have incorporated storage space for training and offices . There is consideration being given to vacate the structure on Ash Street, which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 is the city owns, and moving that to the Serrenti and ultimately getting rid of the Ash Street property all together so they may save money there. And, like I said, he did give me a break down, I just haven't ha da chance to go through it yet, but I would be more than happy to give you a copy of this, so that is the Serrenti Center update. I didn't get a chance to talk with my colleagues in the caucus because we didn't end up having enough time, but I would expect week like to carve out some time to talk about what the appointment process will look like for the Ethics Board. I did have a brief conversation on the way out of the caucus with the city solicitor . We may want to try to do this in tandem with the administration because they get two appointments , the controller gets one and city council gets two, so we will hopefully have more news on that next week. Also, I want to thank Mrs. Reed for putting together a document , also didn't get a chance to talk about this in the caucus, but as I mention ed a few weeks ago we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 trying to embark on an internship program with the University of Scranton and then open that up to any other local colleges and universities , so we did -- Mrs. Reed is working on this and I really appreciate that, so we will have a chance to talk about it hopefully in the caucus next week, and then we will have to set up a meeting with Mrs. Cohen from the University , I already met with her once and they are very excited to have their students involved in city government . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple of brief items, I know Mr. Gaughan mention ed this, I do want to thank Scranton Tomorrow 's representatives for coming in and giving us their quarterly update on many of the activities they have been doing in our downtown . I know I mention ed this a couple of weeks ago, but I everyone who lives in the city to on a Friday night take a walk through our downtown , especially if you haven't in awhile. There really has been tremendous growth and it's been driven by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 almost exclusively by small locally owned businesses that are in our downtown . So anyone who hasn't had an opportunity to take a stroll through the downtown recently please do so. Go to the areas you haven't been on in awhile. I mentioned Penn Avenue a couple of weeks ago and at first my frustration of not being able to find a parking spot became the light when I realized that's a good problem to have at night in a vibrant city, so that's definitely something that is positive and I urge everyone to take that opportunity . I'm very encouraged , also, with Scranton Tomorrow and many of the partner ships that they are creating and trying to leverage many of the items that not only council has done but have been done on the state, local and federal level to encourage downtown development . One of the biggest opportunities is the combination of the LERTA that was passed by city council , and I agree with Councilman Donahue , I would urge the county commissioners to pass that legislation as well. That abatement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 combined with part of the opportunities zone that are through our downtown really are a golden opportunity for developers to come in and invest in our city. There are vacant tracks of land downtown that are parking lots that could be developed and many of these incentives working with different nonprofits , working with the Chamber of Commerce , if they are developed that's really going to be a big hit for our downtown . One last item. I know one of the speakers brought it up, Linda Aebli, our OECD director is going to being retiring , I want to take an opportunity also to thank her for her service to the city. When I was elected to council and up until just last year I was the chairman for OECD so I worked with Linda for many years and we had a great working relationship through two administration s and she really will be missed. She did a great job for the city, so we wish her well in all her future endeavors and her retirement . Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
