I would also like to offer my condolence and deepest sympathy to Lori Reed and her family, very sad news this week. Secondly , I received from Senator Marty Flynn, it's attention all high school seniors in the 22nd district . They could join Senator Marty Flynn's Student Ambassador Program . You represent your school. You learn about state government . It's a fun experience . I know that we have a student ambassador program at our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 schools , develops great leadership skills.

SCHUSTER : I would also like to express my condolences to Lori Reed, her daughter Amy, and the rest of the family. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Next Monday, October 11th is Columbus Day and City Hall will be closed. The DPW is also off on this day. Refuse and red recycling containers will be a day behind next week. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . The first thing I want to mention is that the Albright Memorial Library in conjunction with the American Red Cross is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 going to sponsor a blood drive on Monday, October 18th at the Albright Memorial Library at 500 Vine Street from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Now appointments are required . So if you wish to donate -- and I suggest that if you can, you do. You can make an appointment in one of three ways. You can either log onto Red Cross blood dot org and enter SPL, Scranton Public Library , as the sponsor code. You can call the Red Cross at 1-800 Red Cross. That's 1-800-733-2767 or you could contact Jessica Serrenti at the library . Her e-mail is JSERRENTI , J-S-E-R-R-E-N-T-I, at Albright dot org or call her at 570-348-3000, extension 3023. I called the Red Cross. And apparently you do not have to have a COVID vaccination to donate just as long as you're in good health. And you will receive among other things a Halloween T-shirt while supplies last. You could also check out a book, check out a movie, check out a music CD or anything else you want to do in the library . Please keep in mind that this pandemic has not been kind to the Red Cross and its blood supplies . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 So if possible and you have the time and the desire, consider donating on October 18th. Can you give us an update on the status of the City's audit? MR. GAUGHAN : We're hoping to receive something within the next few weeks. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And I will update you on the labor agreement s for the firefighters on the City's website . There's been no change since last week. So there's still some gaps. I did see in your backup the summary of the investments made into the Serrenti Center. I counted 6,000 and 600 -- $606,000 -- I'm sorry, $606,978 already paid and recovered by grants. There's a $251,000 bid to be put out. So we're looking at something like $857,978 investment in that center. All but about 10 percent has been covered by grants. My question really is, next now that we have an idea how much money we have to invest, do we have a timeline on its completion ? MR. GAUGHAN : We don't have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 timeline yet. But we have invited the Chief of Police in and others from the administration . And I expect that that will happen within the next few weeks to get even more -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Also, do you know if it's the Knowles insurance list for City properties has been updated to reflect that building as we put more and more money into it if that has been insured appropriately ? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know that. But we could have Mr. Voldenberg -- MS. HODOWANITZ : That will be coming up I think in the spring -- the renewal , the contract . Let's see. And I went through to the stormwater study. That's going to take a few reading s because it's a very complicated and detailed document . My only question tonight is, what's the next step? Is the administration trying to address this issue with the county? Are there any talks going on? Do you know what's going on? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, they're trying to initiate conversations between the county and other municipalities in our area.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I wouldn't want to see this get put on the back burner because I think we're already late in the time scheme of getting this thing off the ground. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Thank you very much. Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Last week I asked for an answer in Fifth Order to the memorandum provided by Solicitor Hayes on the Home Rule Charter . And it was not addressed . Today I ask you each to respond . The Home Rule Charter makes it clear that there are two paths. City Council can at any time by ordinance start the process or the citizens by way of petition requiring 5 percent of the gubernatorial vote in the last Scranton election can start it. Council , I ask you, will you support and introduce an ordinance to put the question to the citizens on the ballot? Yes or no? MR. GAUGHAN : I'll start off by answering no. And I could give you a reason why if you'd like now. I like this form of government . I've been a Councilman now as you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 know for eight years. I think the strong Mayor form of government works and the strong Mayor form and Council form of government that we have here. So I would support that. There was a study commissioned in the late 90s, went through that whole process . And I don't -- I would not like to see a Council manager form of Government . I don't like how those work. So I am in favor of what we have now. Does there need to be updates to the Home Rule Charter in terms of language and that, yeah, probably. But in terms of a whole commission , I don't think it's necessary . And I wouldn't support changing the form of government . MR. DONAHUE : No, for the same reasons . MR. SCHUSTER : I'd also say no for the same reasons . MR. MCANDREW : I'll say no for the same reasons . I do agree with Mr. Gaughan as we can tweak it in some format. And I would like to -- also we discuss ed in caucus about reclassification of the City. How would that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 affect it? I'm not sure. So I'm going to wait for that information . DR. ROTHCHILD : At this time I am interested in updating the Home Rule Charter , not necessarily changing the form of government but seeing what changes we need to make. And I thought the best way to do that was through a commission and being able to really look at it in depth. So that's where I stand on it. MR. COYNE: Thank you. Part of impanelling the commission is the putting through an ordinance or forcing the citizen s to do it. It does not necessarily mean that we are throwing out the entire charter . The commission is designed to look, review, edit and give suggestions for the change. But if we do not do this, there is no way to change the Home Rule Charter except for directly looking at it. And it's the citizens ' responsibility and it's the citizens ' right to -- hopefully the ones who have come forward will step forward and request for those changes . There are a number of difficulties inside of the Home Rule Charter that were not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 foreseen back in 1973 and were not foreseen in the 90s. The world has changed drastically . And though it my be a comfortable City charter , there are some blaring difficultie s in it including on how powers and how corruption in this government was left to go on because of the way of the interpretation of that Home Rule Charter . And that needs to be addressed . And it cannot be addressed by pushing it down the road any saying, I'm not comfort able because I'm comfort able the way things are. That's my concern . And that's why I brought that forward is I do believe there should be a review of it. And there has to be a pathway to start it. And I don't see any pathway unless either the citizens or Council in representing a pathway of change actually step forward , take that on and do we need a body to review it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Next speaker is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And tonight I wanted to start off by congratulating Jeff. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 He's not here tonight -- on this great article that he had in the paper about the -- you know, what they're doing the construction on City Hall and the tower. And it was a great article . And it answered a lot of my questions . And it saved me from asking you, Council , what is the status of that. So when I read this. I thought , oh, great. There's a question I have to ask Council . But as I come down Mulberry Street, anyone that comes down Mulberry Street, that's the first thing you see as you're coming down. So it was so good to see that, this article that they're going to start to work on it. But it was like $200,000 I think that's being invested right now to start the work on the far right tower because of the leakage and everything . So as I read the article , there is so much more money that's needed to do the complete work. There are grants that are out there. And I know we have grant writers here for the City of Scranton . So I'm just hoping that the grants are granted and that we do get the money that we need. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 It also talked about the capital budget that there's going to be money in the capital budget as well to try to get this project going so it just doesn't stop with just one tower being fixed. So I'm just hoping that going forward , you know, this is -- the next time I speak about this I could say thank you to everyone that had something to do with getting that tower and getting it to look the best that it could be. As you come into City Hall, yes, you see that wonderful work that they did there. But nobody could see that unless you're coming to City Hall. So it's going to be a wonderful showcase when it is completed . The second thing I wanted to talk about -- and I had spoken about this before was emergency billing , surprise billing to go to the emergency room. And when you go there, you never know what you're going to get, what kind of a bill you're going to get, who you are going to get it from. But it was so good to read in the paper again that that practice of surprise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 billing is going to be nonexistent . Come January , 2022, it has been signed into practice that that will go away. So I did send a note to Kyle Mullins because I wanted his -- I know there's a bill down in Harrisburg . And I'm sure he's going to address it for us as well as Matt Courtright , you know, to let them know that I did see this in the paper. And I just wanted to let others out there know that there should not be more surprise d billing as we go forward . And then my third thing that I have on my list, as a regular attendee at City Council and as the public can see, there is just so few of us here in the Council Chambers . And I just want to give a shoutout to ECTV for recording these sessions each week and for putting them up on YouTube in a timely manner. Because of these recordings , we get a chance to listen to Council members from the comfort of our homes. As I thought about City Council , we elected you City Council to represent us, to represent the City of Scranton to the residents of Scranton . But also, we do have a voice. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 we do -- and I think that our voice needs to be heard. So as I come, everybody is not comfort able or cannot come to City Council and speak. But they can write to you. They could send e-mails. They could call City Council when there's things that they may not agree with. And the only way that we're going to get things changed is to have open dialogue between the public and the City Council . So I appreciate the fact that we voted for you. We stood at the voting polls and we pulled that lever. So now that you're sitting there, you know, the public has to also have a say in what goes on. So I say all that to thank you ECTV for the wonderful job that they do and to thank Council for the jobs that you do but also to give us a voice in what we want to say. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a nice night. Next speaker is Richard Laurito . MR. LAURITO : Richard Laurito , South Webster Avenue, Scranton , Pennsylvania . I have several things I'd like to bring up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 tonight . I did contact the Mayor's office. It's been years and years and years by my residence the situation on Stafford Avenue there close to where that old Sunoco gas station closed down years ago when the highway reconfiguration happened . There's like a 25 to 50-yard stretch of that road that has been in tremendous disrepair for like ages. I did contact the Mayor's office about it. Nothing 's been done yet. And I know things take time. But if there is any way you could get involved in that, I mean, just -- really just that section needs to be sliced out and, you know, 25 to 50 yards of new pavement put in. It is a high traffic area with people going to the post office getting off 81 accessing South Scranton . It's really is a shame to see the road -- you know, sticking 10 pounds of patch in a pothole , it's just making the whole situation worse. Also, I don't know if you can have any effect on this, but I noticed like the -- to the right-hand side of the Radison Hotel -- now, I don't know who owns that property . But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 it's a descending wall that goes over toward -- what would it be, Bill, which avenue would that be there -- Cedar Avenue? MR. GAUGHAN : Cedar Avenue, yes. MR. LAURITO : And it's falling into disrepair . I think that -- I don't know if the Radison is actually the owner of that. I mean, it extends for like a 100 yards maybe. But I see a real opportunity to beautify the City by refacing that wall and maybe even like a Steamtown mural with the Big Boy on it, something to that affect. I think it would really add a lot to the City. Right now it's really becoming an eyesore . It's really deteriorating . And back to the old thing that's been being hashed out in the editorials in the newspaper , everybody is writing for all the different reasons that are popping up, whatever they can try to create a new angle why, you know, we're going to fight this -- the renaming of Biden Street and the Central Scranton Expressway to Joseph R. Biden Expressway . You know, they're telling stories about why we shouldn 't do it. But they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 really are not being honest with us. The bottom line is they are all Donald J. Trump lovers. I wish they would at least state that in their letters because 99 percent of those editorials I feel are just people who are bitter about the fact that they lost the election . Probably a good percentage of them don't even believe that they did lose the election . It's just a fact that the election was won by Joseph Biden. And I just -- I mean, when Donald Trump -- the way I look at it, when Donald Trump stepped into office, he stepped into the best scenario that any president has stepped into office in over a century . When Joe Biden stepped in on inauguration day, he probably stepped into the worst condition s of any president of the last 100 years. And a lot of that was due to the devastation that Donald Trump brought on this country . Thank you very much. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , can you send something to Mr. Preambo to have him look into the repaving of that section of Stafford Avenue? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : And also, if you could check with Senator Flynn's office -- when Senator Blake was in office, I know that he was pushing for the rehabilitation of that side of the Radison there which is in deplorable condition as Mr. Laurito stated. And I think they were going for a grant. I don't know if they got it or what happened there. But if you could check with Senator Flynn's office on that I would appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to them tomorrow . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . I'm here and many other people are opposed to renaming Spruce Street and the Central Scranton Expressway after Biden for a lot of reasons that I'm here to discuss . For one, it isn't representative of what the people want. Biden's approval rating is sitting around 40-some percent . It might be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 what Mr. Gaughan and the four yes men on Council and Paige Cognetti want, but it's not what everyone else wants. Joe Biden is responsibile for the deaths of innocent men, women, and seven children in a drone attack in Afghanistan which he lied about. He is also responsible for the deaths of 13 of our fellow service men and women during his botch ending of the withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan . He has blood on has hands and so does everyone here who supported the renaming of the expressway and Spruce Street, iconic streets after him was done for the people and by the people of the city. Joe Biden isn't fit for office and renaming our two streets is an absurdity . I'm renewing my request for Mr. Gaughan to resign from Council . I believe and most of us do believe that we are now running a liberal social dictatorship here in the City of Scranton . And when question ed, he simply hides behind the Home Rule Charter . Let me explain , the Home Rule Charter is subject to the US Constitution , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 PA Constitution and the Sunshine Act, all three of which Gaughan has publically violated during his tenure here on Council . My previous request for his resignation was ignored and I was denied my rights as a citizen to due process after both the federal and state constitutions and that will be decided by the Courts where we presently are on this matter. However , I'm taking a moment to renew my request for you to resign due to the abuse of the Home Rule Charter and violations of statutes to which the charter is (inaudible ) in hopes that you do the right thing and you do resign. Our -- the way I look at it, Mr. Gaughan , and our four cronies here that are helping, you and Cognetti have taken away the voice of the people. Renaming streets after president so-to-speak Biden should have been a referendum . The average voter isn't versed in the finer points of politics and public meetings and is unable to voice their opinions . Council and the Mayor know this and by hiding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 behind the Home Rule Charter , they silence the people they supposedly represent . It's not here to hear to the voice of the people aside from the -- Biden's bismol approval rating, 77 percent of Americans disapprove the way he handled the withdrawal of our troops from Afghanistan . And further , you could tune into any NFL game this season and hear crowds of 100,000 spectators chanting "F" Joe Biden. Now you have to use your imagination to decipher what the "F" means. But I could tell you, it doesn't mean friend or fabulous or anything positive at all. The people of Scranton don't have to stand for being silenced and having their rights trampled by a corrupt few. I filed an injunction to stop the City from renaming Spruce Street and Central Scranton Expressway and the judge assigned the Honorable Julia Munley granted a hearing on October 29th. I feel it was done on purpose so that the hearing s would fall after measure s were well underway to change street signs. I feel my voice and the voice of the people of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 this great City matter and granting a hearing after these measures are underway is a built-in way to dismiss my challenge . I'm asking the Honorable Judge Munley to resign from the matter for an obvious conflict of interest . The fact of the matter is that this is a disruptive change and it negatively impacts the people in Scranton . So put a sign on your buildings , people, stating that the correct address is Spruce Street. U.S. Postal Office will know Spruce. FedEX will know and so will everyone else including GPS will know where Spruce Street is. Joe Biden is the not a Scrantonian . He is a Delawarian . He spent enough of his formative years in Scranton to learn and master the art of corruption . Your voice, don't let them silence by the Mayor, Mr. Gaughan and his four cronies who blindly agree to whatever he says. There should be a referendum . This is a government for the people and by the people, not a liberal socialist dictator ship. Good evening . MR. GAUGHAN : Would anyone else like to address Council ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. COYNE: (Inaudible .) MR. GAUGHAN : No, you had your time to speak, Mr. Coyne, I'm sorry. MR. COYNE: (Inaudible .) MR. GAUGHAN : No. SOLICITOR HAYES: You had an opportunity to speak during Fourth Order. MR. GAUGHAN : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Okay. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I have two things tonight . Last week I brought up the issue of Bellevue . All this week I got several picture s of tractor -trailer s over the weight limit driving on Railroad Avenue. Mr. Voldenberg , have we had any updates on the Bellevue section of the City? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of today, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Maybe we could reach out and see if there is -- if there is anything being done if there is any updates .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Also, we spoke in caucus I brought up last week the line item for the community centers for Tripp Park Community Center and Keyser Valley. Mr. Voldenberg did we reach out. And I don't think we've received any correspondence , correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we haven't. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. So in caucus we did talk about Council sending a letter. I think everybody here was in agreement . So we'll work on getting that out to the administration . Other than that, I'm finished . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I would like to piggyback on Mr. Schuster regarding the Bellevue situation with the large trucks. I do know now that everybody is aware which is great. Some enforcement is occurring which I'm glad to hear. I also receive d a bunch of picture s. But what I also received today was some correspond ence from Fay Franus. And what she's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 saying is, I want you to look into this, Mr. Voldenberg , is that Officer Guida -- I think I'm pronouncing his name correctly -- is the only certified officer to use the weight scale for trucks and no one else is certified and that the City is aware of this and in order to get someone else certified because there is no one else certified in the ranks, that it's going to take at least a couple months. And Officer Guida is supposedly retiring in three weeks. So can you inquire to see what the plan is for that so they could continue to enforce the ordinance that was written just for Bellevue with regard to these trucks? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And, you know, I have something else. Someone else mentioned to me and I don't know so this is why I'm asking. If there is no one certified in the City to use the weight scales, I don't know if this crosses boundaries because of CBAs, but the Sheriff 's Department because it is the county, I mean, they have maybe that expertise for an interim until someone else gets certified . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 I'm just throwing a couple things out there, you know, just inquire for me. I would be happy with that. Secondly , Solicitor Hayes, a few months -- I don't know if it was August or early September , late August, you reached out to Mr. Pocius regarding an explanation of the St. Ann Street traffic study. ATTY. HAYES: That's correct . MR. MCANDREW : He never responded , right? ATTY. HAYES: He did not respond . MR. MCANDREW : Can you please send that correspondence again? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. MR. MCANDREW : I know we're anticipating having department heads come in. But this was addressed before that so I'd like to get an answer, please. ATTY. HAYES: Will do. MR. MCANDREW : And then thirdly -- so a couple weeks ago I brought up the NRS settlement , divorce , separation . The only information I got was none the first week. The second week I asked again for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the, you know, the amount of payments made to the City to NRS whether any agreement has been entered , if there is no agreement has been entered with NRS or its successor , the anticipate d date that the City will terminate its relationship . So what I did get back the only department that -- because then I double downed the week later and asked for vouchers of payment . So -- and I want to thank the Controller 's Office for their immediate response . No one else respond ed from the Law Department , from administration . But the Controller 's Office did respond and said there was total payments on Elite Revenue Solutions which they changed their name from NRS because of their involvement with the pay to play they changed their name to sound a little better to Elite Revenue . So what I received from the Controller 's Office is in July there was several payments that total $159,675.78. And then prior to that, Elite got $12,368.72. So prior to this we had discussion that, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 we weren't agreeing to paying them because we believe -- well, I believe and I think my colleagues believe that they violated or breached their contract . So we didn't feel they were entitle d to any money. So if they're being paid -- now I finally find out they're being paid. Is there a deal made? It sounds like there is a deal. So could you please double check, you know, please circle around again, ask the prior questions , you know, I inquired about so I could get some clarity on this because are they going to continue to get paid instead of one lump sum like they wanted? Are they going to piecemeal it out like they're doing now? And is there an agreement , yes or no? ATTY. HAYES: I'll follow up. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. ATTY. HAYES: No problem . MR. MCANDREW : And I have one more thing. So with the pickup and drop offs of schools, I know in the past that the police department helped us out with regards to school. I got one complaint from Willard. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 I know it's nightmare because it's in my neighborhood with pickup and drop off and Gerrity 's right next door. So one person inquired that could they set it up like West Intermediate pickup and drop off, utilize it as a one way. All right, so that is for Willard. If you can just inquire about it. I don't know if it's, you know, if it could happen or at least police participation during them times. And then I also got a previous e-mail and I apologize . I saw it maybe on the 9th. I just saw it again. And it didn't really circle on any elementary schools but the same concern was, you know, can the elementary schools have during pickup and drop off more police presence . So there would be a better situation for the elementary school. So if you'll combine them, inquire to the police department and see, you know, what kind of answers we can get from them. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : That is all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. I just had receive d a response this week from the Scranton Police Department that they are looking into alternate names for the Civil Disturbance Unit. So I will keep the public updated on that. And the other thing I wanted to bring up was Birch Street which we've talked about a lot in the past I think over the past two years that they've been working on that street. That was American Water doing that work. And it was suppose d to be fully restored back in the springtime and resident s were still left with some pretty large bumps in the road making it a little difficult to drive down that street. So I've been in contact with American Water to see if we can get that resolved . And last week they were out there taking measurements . They stated that they need to pave and grind down the concrete tops 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 and then manufacture the lid modification s and weld them to the existing frame to cut down on the noise of the, like, the metal grates in that section of the road. And so they did start some of that -- some of that work. So if anyone is driving down and wondering why they're working on it, so that's the reason to help correct the road and fully restore it. That's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Just a few items from last week that residents had asked about, the Controller 's report from August of 2021, there was a question about the nondepartmental expenditure line item totally $367,994.04. The finance manager from the BA's office advised Mr. Voldenberg that this is a debt service -- the debt service amount is comprised of the Amayas{sic} refinance payment and lease payment that is paid each year.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 The fall 2021 paving list just an update on that, the bids are out and the DPW will provide the paving list once the bids are finalize d. I was also question ed about the overtime for the Licensing and Inspections Code Enforcement Office. We -- Council was advised that in 2020, the Licensing and Inspections overtime budget was $2,500. In 2021 it was cut to $500. To date, Licensing and Inspections has spent $1,945.29 in overtime . The staff works Monday through Friday from 8 to 4:30 p.m. If the inspectors are called out for a fire, a gas leak, building collapse outside of those hours, the staff is entitle d to overtime . I think Miss Hodowanitz asked about Rainey and Rainey. So we did inquire with the BA's office as we have previously . And then finance manager respond ed that many municipalities have audit prep firms to assist with the yearly audit process . Paying Rainey and Rainey less than $10,000 for their assistance is more beneficial to the City than hiring another full time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 account ant at a minimum salary of $45,000 a year plus benefit s to focus exclusively on audit preparation . Also, last week someone asked about the signal at Lackawanna and Wyoming Avenue. And so we reached out to the traffic department . And they are looking at that and whether or not there could be better pedestrian walk -- like a walkway green light synchronization . And I believe that was it. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR.
