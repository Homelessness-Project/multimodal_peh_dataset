KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have one. Well, a couple actually , so happy Fourth of July to everyone . I hope they enjoy the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 holiday safely and responsibly . And also this weekend there will be the Jewish Food Festival taking place. It's our annual festival . And that is going to be Sunday the 2nd through Wednesday the 5th and from 12 p.m. until 7 p.m. And we'll have different things there. But a whole lot of food and it's great every year. So if you're able to make it out on one of those days, I definitely encourage you to do so. You could order ahead online as well. I think if you just look up Scranton Jewish Food Festival you'll be able to find the information further on there. And I think there's more information on our city website too. And this past Saturday was the world refugee day that took place at Nay Aug Park as well. And I had the opportunity to go and it was a really great event, very well attended . And I'm just really proud of all the different communities that we have here in Scranton , their diversity of culture s and our refugee groups that live here in the city. And it was a really great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 celebration of them and a nice opportunity to experience those -- those different cultures and learn about them. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Anyone else? I need to announce that our meeting next week will be Wednesday , July 5th at 6:30 with a caucus at 5:45 in these chambers . I would probably be remiss if I didn't wish my wife a happy 26th anniversary today. Thank you for tolerating me for 26 years. And that's it. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . What I gave you is from a City Council meeting on April 11th, 2022, from a Third Order document where you had all of your action items on the law because I've been asking about where is the property tax database that should be put back on the City's website . And you could see it's been in the works since March 4th, 2022. And something needs to be done to get that up and running . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Now the good news is that the refuse fee database has been updated as of May 31st. Apparently they are doing it quarter ly. The bad news is, principal plus interest , plus lawyer fees, plus court costs looks like we're in the hole for 11.7 million dollars . I'm not quite sure how accurate this database is because when you scroll through it you'll see entries for the Scranton Housing Authority , the Jewish Home for three years and one church. So it may or may not be accurate . But something very interesting popped up. And that was -- let's see, 5-D. This is I believe the appointing of Selina Andiappan , to OECD. And the backup include s a memo from Brittani Hamer confidential secretary to Andrew Cutillo referenc ed this lady. And it refers -- she's checked for taxes and refuse fee status and code enforcement violation s and her address . And she says the appoint ee is not listed as the owner of that address . But Tom Coyne did some further checking and found out that this memo was dated May 16th, 2022. And apparently this lady eventually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 married the owner of that address . And then below it says -- apparently Brittani researched the appointee 's name on the city's real estate and refuse fee database . If Brittani had access to this database as of last year, why can't I? Why isn't it on the City's website ? Tell them to get a move on. I want my money's worth out of the city. Okay, let's see. And then another person 5 echo, this Robert Shumaker that is being appointed to the Environmental Advisory Council , I didn't see any vetting on him. I saw his resume. But who vetted him? He's a Council appointee . MR. KING: I'm not sure who vetted him. I know that Mr. Smurl has known him for years. MR. VOLDENBERG : He's been vetted. MS. HODOWANITZ : You have to check his taxes and refuse fees and everything else and his residency . With regard to 7-F, the nontaxable debt issuance of up to 5 million dollars , I never got my answer last week about what is this all about and what's it going to cost the city because the paperwork said there is no financial impact. You need to answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 that. And the walkability study, I went to Lackawanna College -- was it last Wednesday when they presented this study. There were all of 40 people there in the audience . Many of them were city workers or associated with the city. And I didn't think it was very well advertised . None of you mentioned it last week. I just happened to run across it on the City's website accidentally . And I was not -- I understand why you want to do it, you know, reduce accident s. But I wasn't impressed . I asked the man, "Well, if you're going to get rid of the traffic lights and replace them with four stop signs, how am I as a little old lady who lives downtown going to know when it's safe for me to cross the street?" This is what he answered me. "The cars will automatically stop for you." Can you believe that? If you believe that I got a bridge I'm going to sell you all. So anyway, I await your comment s and your answers in Fifth Order, especially on 7-F. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident and homeowner . Fireworks , that ordinance should be voted down tonight . First of all, I saw in the paper last week where patrols are going to be -- there's go be more patrols . It's going to be enforced more. I'll believe that when I see it because I don't think the rules are going to be enforced . And having it legal until 1 in the morning , that's ridiculous . Who wants -- shoot off fireworks at one in the morning when people are trying sleep, kids are trying to sleep, people have to get up for work the next morning . You should table that, rewrite it and make it 10:00 at night, not one in the morning . Okay, Joan already spoke on this, the walkability study. It's the most asinine thing I've ever heard in my life replacing traffic lights with all way stop signs. As she said how are people going to know when to cross the street. It's unbelievable . Who is on this committee , ten years olds? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Oh, I'm sorry that's an insult to ten year olds. They probably could have done a better job. I come to four way stop signs. The cars don't even know who is supposed to go first. So how would the pedestrian s know when to cross? And we have disabled people in wheelchair s and jazzies , what if they are crossing street and somebody decides to go? Blind people, they go by that beeping sound the traffic lights make. Stop signs don't beep. How are blind people going to cross the street? As I said, this is the most asinine thing I've ever seen in my life. I've never seen a downtown anywhere with stop signs. Stop signs are for neighborhood s, not for busy downtown . If this comes before Council , I hope it's voted down. Anybody in their right mind cannot vote for this thing. It's just unbelievable . It blows my mind. It's the most asinine thing I've ever heard of. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Len Srebro.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council . You have to bear with me. My memory isn't as good as it used to be. And I have to jot down notes as they come to me. I'm 70 years old. I live right at the end the North South Road right near there. It's actually the corner of Lafayette Street and Dewey Avenue. And that whole area for a number of blocks is a flood zone. I've have been coming to Council meeting s and taking it up to try to get something done about the flooding in that area for about 10 years now. I was actually coming here constantly for about five years. All of you people are different than when I used to come here. When Covid started and the Council meeting s were over, you know, then I stopped coming about the flooding problem . But right at the corner of my property is a drainage pond and a 36 inch drainage pipe that over the years I suggested cleaning out that pipe, cleaning out the pond because it's like rivers coming down Lafayette Street, Price Street, you know, the numerous blocks there. Anyway, you know, some years ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 they came and they tried flushing that pond -- that drainage pipe. They were -- only had the equipment to go halfway down and they were suppose d to get more equipment to open it up because that runs into Keyser creek. But they never came back. So that was totally useless . I gave up trying to come here. All the Council people would tell you what you want to hear and then nothing would ever be done. Until about two years ago, I believe you got a new supervisor on DPW. And his name I believe was Steve Teaman -- something like that, you know. But he -- he started coming up and there's a drainage ditch that goes to the pond. You know, he listened to -- because I lived there for 10 years, you know, he listened to the story of how it goes. I want to give some recognition to him because he truly was the first guy to listen and discuss the flooding problem there and his crew. So they came. They opened that ditch up. They cleaned it out. They opened up the pond. They did flush the pipe out all the way to Keyser creek about two years ago. And, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 you know, I did my own flood protection . But it certainly didn't solve the problem , but it made it a lot better up there. But I'm here tonight because the recent rains that we had, now the water is coming from a different place right into that pond into the drainage pipe right at the corner of Lafayette and Dewey there's a downgrade right there above that drainage pipe. And now the water comes from the property up top of that and runs down. It's running all its water runoff, debris, the dirt, the sticks, the wood. And now it's going into that pond down the drainage pipe that's going to be blocked again. Here we go. So I'm hoping that somebody could do something about the property owner above that drainage pipe before it really plugs up the pond and the pipe. I've been living there long enough to know the process of all the flooding that we've been through . Other neighbors have left, sold their houses because nothing ever gets done about the flooding there. But, you know, at least if we could keep that pond and that 36 inch drainage pipe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 open that goes to Keyser creek, it's somewhat liveable . Thank you, Mr. Srebro. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. Frank, can you contact DPW and, in fact, maybe directly Steve Teaman and see if he could get back out there and take a look at that situation for Mr. Srebro? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'm sure he'll take care of it tomorrow and they'll get out there. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Can I add to that? Mr. King, last year I asked maintenance about drainage basins, things like that into the Keyser Valley. I know that DPW hasn't got a chance to get out there yet because the drains are clogged if we could get out with the vac truck. So if we could make another request also to maybe to get out with the vac truck and to take the gentleman -- I agree with the gentleman . Last night while I was out when the rain was coming down, the water does seem to be coming in some different directions now. So I had some different problems 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 last year. And the problem s I had last year that I took care of seem to be different problems this year because the water is coming from some different directions . Can we also get the information -- I know there was studies on the Keyser creek and the Lindy creek and robotic studies that occurred I'd say probably about a year, year and a half ago. If we could get the results of those studies and what the timeline is going to be for the Keyser Valley, that would be great. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, hello, Council . Last week in the paper was what I consider an absolute waste of our rescue funds, $240,000 to teach allegedly the hordes of people downtown how to walk, make some bicycle paths, plant some trees. This is such a -- such an absolute waste of funds. It's directly for the develop ers downtown that our Mayor can't seem to overcome her obsession with downtown developers . You know, you almost have to take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 them to court to get them to pay taxes. I don't know why they didn't buy Mr. Speck's book instead of giving him $240,000. In my whole life I've never met somebody that didn't know how to walk from A to B. That's what he seems to want to accomplish and bicycles don't pay for the road taxes. Vehicle do. This is just an absolute -- it's a disgrace to the taxpayers . Here, the library on Green Ridge Street, they're trying to raise $50,000 and it's blowing -- part of -- it's just absolutely thrown away on Mr. Speck's ideas for downtown . Downtown 's a dinosaur . It's residential now. It's not commercial anymore. And I see nothing wrong with that personally . But it's not like we're full of bicycles and people walking like in Sweden and pictures you see, you know, of overseas. These people are working . They're not riding bicycles and walking around. And I'm sure intelligent people that live downtown can find their way. The only time they seem to walk is to walk a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 dog at night that mess up on the sidewalk someplace . I don't know how many of you read mister (inaudible ) little article in the paper. Last week he said if that -- if Shapiro 's tax plan goes through , utilities can go up fourfold. You know, these people that I've told you I talked to, they are just on the brink of not making it last year. And here the school board, they are talking about preschool is more important than families living in homes. There just comes a point where they just -- you just can't keep this up. There's nowhere to go for a lot of people. And I certainly -- I advise everybody to look at their next insurance rate on their houses because there must be something wrong, some information getting out about the reassessment . My insurance has gone up twice last year. Today I opened it up from Liberty Mutual. They said my house was worth 193,000 and with this outrageous insurance rate next to it. They said my garage was worth 16,000. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 None of this has happened until this reassessment nonsense comes up. I phoned them. And I insured it for $100,000. If it burns down, let them sue me or something . I don't know. But the man told me on the phone they're getting information on the values has increased . And I told them on my one block I have two condemned houses and a vacant lot where they tore down one. How can my house be going up in value? My neighborhood looks like a bomb went off in it. Just a couple houses cut the grass and shovel snow. Fortunately , I don't have nothing to do and I go from corner to corner with my little snowblower. Last time I think I only went one time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I want to say people are in for a shock when they get their insurance rates. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Tyler Day. MR. DAY: Good evening , Council , I want to talk briefly about the RFP that was released earlier this week. This is looking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 for a qualified consultant or a team of consultant s to develop a climate action plan. This plan consultant is expected to review Scranton 's greenhouse gas inventory and project greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2050. Looking at what's in the RFP, the key objective of this plan is to be visionary inclusive and integrate measure s that improve quality of life, build prosperity , enhance community resilience and climate justice . I don't know what that means. And looking at what the consultant is expected to do, I think it's interesting there was some -- I think confusion or at least some curiosity about why we are having the Environmental Advisory Council . But this kind of looks like it goes hand in hand because this consultant is expected to meet with stakeholders including the Environmental Advisory Council , which I think one of the selling points on that was it was not going to use city funds. It was going to be no cost. But now it looks like there's going to be a cost associated with it in terms of another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 consultant . And looking at what the long-term what -- I guess the long-term plan is, is that this consultant is suppose d to develop a tool kit for ongoing monitoring , measuring , and evaluation of greenhouse gas. And someone is going to be periodically updating and reviewing greenhouse gas inventories . So that to me sounds like probably one of the recommendations of this consultant is going to be continue to pay me to do this or hire somebody on staff to do this. I don't think that this is a good use of taxpayer dollars or ARPA funds or wherever this money for this consultant is coming from, especially for a city that recently exited distress ed status that has the highest tax burden by far in the county. I think probably the priority should be looking to mitigate the tax burden on working Scranton families and not worrying about greenhouse gas in the year 2050. So that's just my thoughts on that. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Day. Lori O'Hara. MS. O'HARA: Hi. How are you? Lori 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 O'Hara, South Side. First, I'd like to say hello to everybody and enjoy your holiday that's upcoming . And I would like to acknowledge all the work that everybody does. I'm not going to stand here and pretend I know anything that you do. I leave that up to the people that are elected because it's an issue of trust and we trust you. I do admit I probably could have paid more attention in civics class. And I think you all do a really, really great job. So my main question I have some concerns . And I have one question , is Scranton a sanctuary city? I'm just curious . You know, is that an official thing? Are we, are we pending , are we looking , is it not there? It's just a question . MR. KING: I'm not aware that we're listed as a sanctuary city. MS. O'HARA: Okay. That's all. All right. Now, I have the walkability tour sounds like a nice idea but you have to be able to walk safely in the city to begin with. And safety is something that's really not really there anymore. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Growing up in this area I'm watching -- and the reason I'm coming around again here is because just sitting home being out in the environment in the neighborhood community and observing that there is -- there's a lot going on. And it's very unsafe. I politely ask the drug dealers now across the street when they do their deals if they would take that to a different corner because I don't need it in front of my house where there's children and playgrounds. That's where we're at. We have to be on the lookout for the SUVs for abduction . And, you know, I see backpacks walking down over the hill going down near the school. And what was on the scanner channel last night, looking for two guys with backpacks. Oh, isn't that shocking . So my concern now moving on from that is the Sheraton Hotel on Meadow Avenue. A little while ago I looked into it. And it's closed to the public except for the private owner's personal use. Hmm, what can that be? Well, there's things coming out of New York 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 concerning private hotels, private owners. And what they are doing in New York is they are renting them. And they are getting funds from New York City to house migrants. And one such place in Orange County they took it to the Supreme Court. And they ruled that they cannot use a hotel for anything other than a hotel as long as it's owned as a hotel. Just, what can a private owner do? See, the city got ahold of this where they're trying to take them from New York City and put them up into Orange County Crossroads Hotel. And this was on Channel 12 news out of New York. Facebook .com if you want to look it up. And how this goes is, they have a master lease and the landlord would be the hotel and then the master tenants would be the migrant s from New York through dot go which is the CEO is Anthony Capone. And then he funds everything . So they enter into private contracts . And getting the information that he's closed to the public and using this facility for his personal use is very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 concerning . With the crime that I just stated which was just within the last day on the scanner channels because that's where you actually find out what's going on so that you can actually plan how to be safe to navigate through the city. We can't afford more. Where we're at, we can't go any further . We can't go further with bringing more people in. I mean, if he -- can he actually do this? Like, what if somebody came to him -- we're only two and a half hours from New York. Mayor Adams is desperate . And he's trying to go out and around and do all of this stuff in two different counties already . And what they did in Rockland County was Board of Health went in and shut down the hotel because still they have the right to do that. The Supreme Court only ruled -- in New York only ruled in Orange County. And it says that they have the right to inspect . And in five days they have to give up all the information of the people that are there. And with the zoning laws, the hotels can't be used as shelter s. They can only be used as hotels.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 So what I have observed up at Meadow Avenue which is four blocks from my house and I already have enough backpacks going down the hill. I don't need more, nor do the children . And considering today's news, we need to take the children seriously in every decision we make in the city. Cleaning it, number one; walkability , are you kidding me? You can't walk where it's not safe. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss O'Hara. Mr. Voldenberg , I think we had an inquiry about that. Did the code inspectors go over and check on that recently ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did, Mr. King. We were advised last Thursday by the code enforcement manager that they are up-to-date on their permits and they are operating as a regular hotel. MR. KING: They are. MR. VOLDENBERG : However , with the information provided by Ms. O'Hara, we might -- MR. KING: If you could pass that information on and please have them look into it further . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll dig deeper. MR. KING: Thank you very much. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , I remember sending an e-mail back on May 18th or so. Me and you had some correspondence about the property . Did it take until last Thursday to get answers or did we get some kind of answer in between then just to refresh my memory? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did get an answer. And then we received more information so we reached out again for further confirmation when I received the word from the manager. MR. SCHUSTER : And that was the answer we got this Thursday ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Last Thursday , yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And that's the final answer or we put it back out? MR. VOLDENBERG : With the new information provided tonight , we'll reach out again. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. All right. Thank you. MR. KING: We've exhausted the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 sign-in sheet. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Is there any update on the scope of the rental mailing s that went out and the cost involved in them? I'd also like to comment on the health manager report. A copy and paste of the HUD health news letter for $140,000 on a website , I'm not impressed . The papers I just handed forward were from Selina Andiappan 's OECD appointment . The Law Department provided a document from over a year ago. It is noted again that the employee is not listed as the owner. So they would not be on code violation s, real estate, and trash and tax. I guess they didn't notice on the tax document that on 3/23 of 2023 she applied for marriage license which was in the Scranton Times with Kendrick (inaudible ) who is the property owner of that residence she's in. Now if she did marry him and it is her husband , maybe they should check whether or not her husband has also paid all of the required fees for the property she lives in. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Now we're onto Shaquanna Barrett , also known as Koni. My biggest issue is the Planning Commission does not even know how to operate under Roberts Rules. A stylist will not resolve what the Planning Commission is greatly lacking . On 6-F, the sidewalk cafes, you might want to take a look at amending also 309-2, obstructions of public places since it's directly involved in that legislation . File 6-G, the fireworks , I've already talked about the time issues. My only problem at this point after that is as this is going through tonight , it is less than two weeks and to put in a permit that requires two weeks is impossible . So right now you have a conflict where you have to comply with a law that you cannot comply with at least for the two week period. Looking at the documents right now, two extra officers will be assigned . That would include I assume both Friday and Saturday prior and after as that's the period under the law. On a spreadsheet provided it shows the -- I'll skip on that one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 there. But the financial impact is listed like always as N/A in that document . But they'll have two dedicated police officers for fire, safety, and enforce ment. We're looking at the 30th, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th and 8th, 24 hours except for the 4th and that's 24 hours. Seven days times 24 hours plus (inaudible ) equals 169 work hours times two officers equals 338 work hours or the equivalent of 8.4 work weeks, and yet we have no financial impact. The fire department promoted 70 percent of burns from fireworks happen between the two weeks before and after the Fourth of July. Of the 2,600, 1,100 are sparklers or 42.3 percent of the 74 percent are still allowed under code. Moving onto the people living outside of the city and exceptions granted . I'd like to know of these three people who are brought forward here, who are they? I understand Cipriani is one. Kathleen Kennedy now is one; and out of decorum , I withheld Scranton Police Officer John Hallock last week. I suspect that he did not have a waiver on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 file. But he did die according to the paper in his home in Kingston . So if his residence was in Kingston as it was in the paper, he obviously should have had a waiver. The Chair pointed out that the residency waiver for Kathleen Kennedy is because it was new and the employee handbook . How can you ignore the city charter that a waiver is required before hire since 1980? It was excused to be now running forward ignoring the charter required it 43 years ago. As you were made fully aware prior to the vote, you can reconsider and revote on it. If you do intend to violate the Ethics Code and your Oath of Office let it continue by knowingly violate the city charter . It's was noted in the controller -- in the code (inaudible ) from time to time after six months require bona fide proof of residency . How often is that done? Can you provide the dates including when they were done and how they are taken care of? Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. SCHUSTER : So, Mr. Coyne, I was going to report this in Fifth Order. But we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 did get a response on the rental postcards that went out. So 9,620 cards went out at a cost of $4,473.50. They said they used the listing of property owners provided by the county. And the county wouldn't provide an updated 2023 list was the answer we got, Tom. MR. COYNE: Thank you. Maybe we can get a copy of that list from the county because obviously your residence and mine never were rentals , nor was Mr. McAndrew 's. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . And I'd just like to mention mister (inaudible ) I get to wear my (inaudible ) shirt tonight and you have to wear a suit, hahaha. Okay. Let's get started . As you may have guessed , the main subject tonight is walkability of downtown Scranton . Could you imagine tearing down the millions of dollars worth of stop lights only to find out that this plan doesn't work? It's a real fake job. It's just a way of getting over $200,000 out of the pockets of the Scranton taxpayers . And not to pick on Missy Mayor, but the person that brought this person into town 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 wasn't a Democrat . He was a Republican . I could only imagine -- I mean, it's just ungodly. It's a real estate bonanza . Tax exempts , every week I'm talking about tax exempts . And even worse yet, now they want to be involved in politics . Every time a person like Henry Amoroso comes to town with his snake little sales, what do we get? Lackawanna College funded. They donated $100,000 to get him in the town. And then we donate I think a million dollars back to Lackawanna College . I personally feel if you're tax exempt you have no right to play in politics . That includes religion too. I have better things to do than to serve two and a half to 15 years on a chain gang because some southern Baptist yaya can't buy slaves anymore. And that's the way things were down south. There was an article on it today. You got drug in on a bogus crime and you got sentence d to an ungodly long sentence . And, oh, by the way, you were 27 percent likely to be hauled out in a coffin off of that chain gang. It's just ridiculous . How are we ever 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 going to -- you can't get people to behave themselves with stop sign lights. They sit in denial. I don't know, at the top of my hill by the Yeshiva , Alder Street there's -- it's a really vicious hill so there's no stop sign there. Smart plan. The only thing is the people on Stafford Avenue want to burn right through the stop sign. And if they keep going, they're going to have some kind of story. They're going to deny it, have it in court. I had a guy come down an entrance ramp and destroyed about five vertebrae disks in my back. And the first thing out of his mouth was, oh, I was fixing my radio and this is the first time I caused an accident . You know, in other words, how many accident s have you caused in reality . This is the first time that you can't talk your way out of an accident . If these situations evolve, cities and towns -- and they find what works and they install it. And that's the rules and to change it into something else, I'm a little mad about it really. I think we should rename Central 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 City the Wayne Evans Memorial Theme Park because it's a joke. It's joke. Why did you bring this man into town? It's not going to be Mayberry RFD and it will never be Mayberry RFD. And, you know, people getting run over, I've been advocating for all way stops for people to cross streets and things like that. And I think that's a pretty smart idea, all way, no left turn, right turn, nothing . But to do that and spend money on something like that it was obviously before -- before Mayor Paige. And his study isn't very astute. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton city taxpayer . I want to wish everybody a happy Independence Day. It's a major holiday -- major traffic holiday . A lot of people are going to be travelling . And as a result, Independence Day is one of the top three holiday s for automobile accident s and for traffic fatalities . You could predict over 900 traffic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 fatalities next Tuesday . So I advise people who are travelling to instead of driving consider taking the train -- well, not the train because we don't have that. So maybe the bus, except the busses don't run on holiday s. So maybe walk if you are going less than 15 minutes down the street. Bike if you want to risk getting run over by the traffic fatalities . Otherwise , I guess, stay safe and hope that when you get into an accident they don't have to scrape you off the road because we don't have any other choice other than driving right now. This is what the walkability study is all about. It's to help promote our choices , our freedom of choice and freedom of movement to determine how we want to get places and how to get there safely. For those mentioned earlier , you can't walk in places that aren't safe. Now the stop signs in downtown sound like a bad idea right off the bat and pretty universally everyone seemed to come to that conclusion . It doesn't have to be though. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 purpose of the stop signs in these high traffic areas is to not allow motor traffic to impede the flow of foot traffic , which is ideal if this is enough foot traffic . But it also has to be done smart and safe. The current crosswalks that we have now are street grade, which means that they don't impede motorists driving through intersection s whatsoever . But if those were put at sidewalk grade to be propedestrian instead of promotorist , then not only will people have to come to a stop and not be able to blow through the stop signs, but it will also make it easier for anybody with a disability to cross the street. Now looking at -- intersection if anyone is going to be going straight , they have to go over two of these elevated crosswalk s, which means that they cannot go through the intersection quickly without severely damaging their vehicle . And if that's the case then a stop sign or street lights aren't going to make a difference . This works. We know that this works from any city that has elevated crosswalks or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 (inaudible ) such as the Netherlands which has some of the safest pedestrian traffic in the world to the point where motorist are the happiest despite the fact that everything is built for the pedestrian . So drivers are always going to be more pleased with pedestrian first systems despite that seeming pretty contrary because this means, "A", people will -- more people get off the roads so there's less traffic , less hassle. And when pedestrians mess up, it's less convenient for pedestrian . So right now as it stands with the traffic lights, pedestrian s have to stop and wait or risk running across the road against traffic putting everybody at risk. With stop signs and elevated sidewalks , it's now more convenient for the pedestrian to cross whenever they want because the motorist has to stop regardless . And motorist s in the Netherlands report feeling more frustrated driving when pedestrian s don't cross because they find it more convenient to wait for the pedestrian than to get into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 risk of blowing through stop signs, jumping over these crosswalk s, etc. So if we design the walkability downtown the right way and we stay smart about it, the stop signs are going to work. It's going to be better for pedestrian traffic , which increases the wealth of small business es and the growth of small businesses over three times. So all of the small business es that we want see in our downtown s and in our neighborhoods are going to be boosted by better walkability . And these stop signs can help with that. Now the cost of tearing down the streetlights seems -- and putting in stop signs seems a bit steep. I don't see why we can't just push them to blink red for a while and then if that doesn't work, you know, move on from there. From what I understand about our street lights, it's not too difficult to do. You don't have to tear them down and put in stop signs (inaudible ) that way. So that's all I got for you. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Delmar. Is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta . Mrs. Brazil had reported that she has two small children and a dog and she's a little bit concerned on that. I went up today. I took a picture . I measured it. It's almost 4 feet deep by about 3 feet wide. And it's been a year and a half since she's reported it. They put barricades up. So if there is any way we could help her out there. And then last week I was here in regards to the Weston Field. It seemed to get a little bit worse. The gates -- I have some pictures as well. Again, the same thing with the alcoholic beverage s and the vendors and the food. And you'll see there where the grass is and you'll see some water and mud where they have been driving through there from the field from the running court into the basketball court which is clearly marked no vehicle s. Now, today because of last night's rain you'll see the water and pit full of mud. The gates were closed. There was a guy driving a car around the track. And I asked him, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 said, hey, this is for walking and running people. And he said I don't understand . I said, well, I'll call the police. As soon as I said the police, that was it. He understood what I was talking about. And he told me that he was trying to have -- teach somebody how to drive. That's not the place for it. It's clearly marked. There's gates there. I mean, if somebody could lock the gates at dusk like the park says it closes, maybe we could alleviate some of the shooting s, the drug trade that's been going on. We all know that. Last night I was in contact with a retired police sergeant . Friday night, Saturday night up until 3:00 in the morning there was three cars in the basketball area. The lights are on. So it's easy for them to do their thing. There's gates there. If we could just lock the gates and do our part so the police can get one less call that maybe they could go on. And you'll see the alcohol again is a grave concern . And there's a lot of Job Johnnies around the city in a lot of the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 parks. Do we have a list of where those Job Johnnies are and how much the Job Johnnies cost us? And the signs I have -- if I may, another park. I know we're looking to do some more parks. There's -- we're spending all of this money on signs and park equipment . That park you'll see is in disrepair . Maybe with the Job Johnnies and signs -- I talked to the Park and Recreations Director yesterday . He said he's short-staffed . Maybe if we cut back on some of the Job Johnnies and the signs, maybe we could give them another guy or two to maintain the parks. Is anybody paying attention to Rubicon ? I would pay close attention to that. In the next couple week it's going to get interesting . And back to the Weston Field, on the basketball courts you'll see there's a gray shed there. That's a city tool shed. And these guys from Parks and Recreations , they need to get in that 24/7. And you'll see the vehicle s that are parked there for the festival . There's no access to that tool shed. Thank you. Have a nice holiday , guys. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the administration and see if anybody is aware of any permits that were pulled for Weston Park? From one of the pictures , it looks like there's a soccer team. That's a van with a soccer team logo. I don't know if there is any type of leases for weekend soccer leagues or anything like. But if we could have any information on anything that would be occurring in Weston Field that would be great. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. KING: Can you also check on that 1400 South Main Avenue, see what's going on with that. What's the remedy if they have a timeline for getting that remediated . I'd appreciate if you could do that. And we'll also ask our Parks and Rec Director to really take a close look at what's going on over at Weston Field, you know, especially with vehicles driving in there. The alcohol obviously is a concern and some of the issues brought forth by Mr. Argenta and also if we can get a list of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Porta potties that the city rents or leases, what's the number, where are they located , and what's the cost? MR. VOLDENBERG : I made note of it. I'll follow up. MR. KING: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. SCHUSTER : That address , Frank, is 1414. MR. VOLDENBERG : 1414. Thank you. FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, just two. I also was at the walkability study at the old Scranton Central High School. I believe I was at a different meeting from what I've heard tonight . But if you check the statistics comparing stop signs and traffic lights, the number of injuries compared to fatality injuries and stuff, I don't know where all of this other stuff is coming from. But I did read the entire report. And I was there. And I certainly have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 complete different view of it. But I'll go further into that when we have time. The other one is the Novembrino Pool Complex , there was a blocked sewer up there last week. And when they dug it out to repair it, they found there was Terra Cotta piping up there which is that old clay piping. And it goes through now where we want to put our new playground area. So we are going to -- the city is going to dig that all up and replace that before we put the new playground system in. So there is going to be times when that park is going to be closed. I don't have the exacts on it. But that's the last I've heard of it. That's all I have, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have several . I just caught some of what was discussed . I will say I have been to the Netherlands . I have driven in the Netherlands and there's quite a few more bikers in the Netherlands than I see in downtown Scranton . And I did not enjoy driving with the amount of bikes on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 road. First, Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask whether it's the fire department , police department , administration if we can get an update on the Serrenti Center what's going on there. And specifically in our capital budget this year we have $125,000 worth of expenditure s for 2023 if we can get an update on where we are at with those expenditure s and what upgrade s are being done there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Next, can we reach out to Chris Smith and Scott Pietreface to come in for an update on Rubicon ? I know we asked for it a while back we kind of laid back on it but Rubicon -- MR. KING: Mr. Schuster , I spoke to the Mayor today. I believe that they are going to come in the 15th or the 22nd. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, sounds good. So -- MR. KING: For a caucus. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Great. So, I mean, if there's anything that's -- how the process is going, if it's going smoothly , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 if it's more efficient , if we're using less trucks or more trucks. MR. KING: 18th or the 25th, I'm sorry. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. How overtime is looking in the department if we're down on that and if there's cost savings that we've started to see from that system as well as can we get the date that that contract expires ? I don't have that on me. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that. MR. SCHUSTER : I have an address . It's 2225 of rear of Jackson Street. I don't know if DPW is aware that there is a home -- there's an access road along the railroad tracks there. And it seems that garbage at that home hasn't been picked up in quite some time. 1414 South Main, which we've already seen or we already heard from tonight . One thing I wanted to stay on top of is we received the 2021 audit some time ago. There were several finding s in the audit that showed material weaknesses and internal controls with financial reporting as well as significant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 deficiencies identify which federal (inaudible ) in the Department of OECD. Of these findings there was eight correct ive actions that were to occur. Six of those actions had an anticipated completion date of 6/30. So could we get an update from OECD and our business office as to where we are specifically the with six actions that were due to be completed on 6/30 which is coming in a few days and the remainder of -- the other two that are due on 9/1. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : I know a few meetings ago we did get a request of were the potential wage increases for the Scranton Police and the Fire Department include d in the budget. And I don't think we've gotten an answer on that yet if we could ask for an answer with that one. And then I'm going to shoot through a couple request s that I've had and we'll see what your answer is. So I had some past inquiries about nonresident city employees . Did we ever get any answers on that, the nonresident city employees ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of today. I was advised by the HR Director that I will have that information tomorrow . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. The Weston Field bathhouse, a few weeks ago they did a study on the structure of the Weston Field bathhouse. Did we have any official response from the administration about the Weston Field bathhouse? MR. VOLDENBERG : It was inspected and the report was passed onto OECD by the parks director . And I have message out to OECD for a status. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. So they should be sending that over to us so at least we know what's occurring with that structure ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . I'll follow up in the morning . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. I did take a look at the report we did get from licensing and inspections and code enforcement . Some of those addresses again, the 300 -- 305 Putnam, 502-504 West Gibson, 736-738 Prescott , 1608 Hawthorne and 1429 Hawthorne . I know I put them in some time ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 but I haven't seen them on that list. I'm just looking for some followup on those. MR. VOLDENBERG : I could get a more accurate update online tomorrow for you outside of that report. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you, Mr. Voldenberg . That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, first I wanted to address the downtown connectivity study and the presentation that took last week. So I was in attendance of that. And I was also left with some question s that I had regarding the study. But just because the recommendations were made, doesn't mean we need to take them up on all the recommendation s. I guess some of the -- I think he did mention that some of the cities that he had recommended so many stop signs instead of lights at intersections , they didn't necessarily change all those intersection s over to stop signs. So it's not -- it's not set in stone with the recommendations that were provided . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 But he also did speak at length about changes of one way traffic to two way traffic to make it easier to navigate the streets and gave the rational e behind the distance of the lanes and why that would be appropriate and what is typical for the those distances . So I appreciate hearing that part of it. But I did have concerns about the feasibility of it. I know there are grants that would be able to go towards that. But how we're going to do it overtime I think he had said that it's more of a five-year plan, not a ten-year plan, not a two-year plan. But how we plan that out in those five years and what changes we make and how much it costs, I would really like to get into that in the future and also knowing what the implementation process is like. So I didn't get to talk to him enough about it afterward s. But that's, you know, it's something that it's not going to change overnight , one day we're going to wake up and the whole downtown map is going to be changed. But how does that get implemented over time, what does that look like, what have other cities done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 because many cities have made changes like these and what worked, what didn't. And with regards to -- I'm sorry, somebody was talking in the background. So I appreciate if people didn't do that because it makes me lose my train of thought . MR. KING: I'd appreciate when we are speaking up here -- we try not to interrupt you when you're speaking . So if you could please not speak while Council is speaking I'd appreciate that. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : So those were some concern s that I had regarding that study. But I do appreciate the interest in increasing our walkability downtown . And I think the more pedestrian s we could bring downtown and the safer that we could make it for people to walk or to bike or to ride their wheelchair, you know, it's really going to help downtown prosper . And I think that, you know, we can't have a strong city without a strong downtown and that doesn't mean that we have to ignore our other neighborhoods . I know it might feel like that so much of the focus is on downtown 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 and I understand that frustration . But -- and this is one step towards making our city a better place for people to live and to work and to visit. And so I do see a lot of positives with improving our walkability and the amount of people downtown . And I think there is a comment about the potential bike lanes and Councilman Schuster had made that about how in the Netherlands that there is a lot more bikers. Well, there's a lot more bikers because they feel safer biking. So we need to make it safer for people to bike. I wouldn't bike downtown. But if there were lanes, then that is something that -- that I would consider if I was going to feel safe doing that. So I'm sure there are a lot of people out there to do that. And even if you're not a biker or not interested in biking somewhere to get there, it doesn't mean that there aren't plenty of people who will do that. So that's my response regarding the connectivity study. And for -- there's a property that I brought up -- I don't know if I brought it up in the meeting last week or sent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 it over to Mr. Voldenberg . There's one on Sanderson Avenue that had a previous fire. There's another one on Prescott Avenue at 429 Prescott Avenue that a neighbor had complained about in the past and then she caught up with me again to explain that nothing has been done with the property still. And that fire on Prescott Avenue had taken place, I don't know, a year and a half ago at least. So I feel like we need a better system in order to track these properties that have had fires and what gets done with them because they're either condemned and put on the demo list or they're -- or the owner says that they're going to renovate it and fix it up. And then there's like an indefinite -- it feels like there's an indefinite amount time that they're given in order to do that. So how often do we check back in and make sure that those renovation s are occurring or is the property just going to sit there vacant having had a fire there for how many years. So if we can add that property to check on as well and see where the owner is at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 with their plans. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : And I know you also had forwarded me some of the study response s that I was asking about last week. And one of them especially was over on Reeves Street in North Scranton . SPD did get back to us saying that they were increasing patrols in that area and they did recommend that we go ahead and change some of the signs or add additional signage or stop bars to get people to stop at the stop signs and not go through the one way. So I do want to make the request for that street in the intersection of Greenbush over to the DPW to see if that can happen with the change in signage and the other things that would be appropriate for their department . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have the city engineer send something over to them. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And I had someone who works for Colts contact me with a couple of things that they were hoping could get address ed with the city. And they said they had been in talks with someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 else in the city but wasn't sure who it was and they're not here at this point. So some of those probably would apply to DPW. And one of the concerns was that they felt there needed to be an additional bus stop to add on over, like, heading east on Lackawanna -- Lackawanna and Penn. And the reason being that a lot of riders are now visiting Steamtown to go for medical appointment s. And many of those riders have difficulty getting around and accessibility issues that it's difficult for their other stop that they have on Wyoming Avenue. And it's, you know, even being a block and a half away is too much of a distance so they were hoping to add a stop sign on that route. He said it would be a layover stop. It would just be a bus stop. So if the city would consider that and I think they were fine to provide signage in order to get the bus stop placed there. But they would need permission from the city so if we can go ahead and check into that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : And then the second request that they had is that the buses when they are exiting from the transit system onto Lackawanna Avenue, there is a double painted line where there should be a broken line and so if there was, like, an accident it could be our fault for having crossed that double line so there is not really a way for them to make a left out of there without breaking the driving laws. So they wanted to see if they could be changed to a broken line in order to make it easier for them to turn left out of that station . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll give that to DPW roads. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. And I think one more thing was a lot of drivers are travelling pretty quickly over Lackawanna Avenue near the bridge. And so that's another thing that makes it more difficult and unsafe for them to exit from the transit station . And so they were hoping there could be a sign that warns drivers that -- that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 there's going to be exiting buses from there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll include that also. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, thanks much. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . I have a few things. I know Joan had mentioned delinquent real estate tax. We continue to work with the Single Tax Office Solicitor regarding the placement of the delinquent real estate tax information on the city website . They apparent ly have a few concern s about that and they're trying to work through them before they resume putting that back up. Doris had mentioned -- Doris isn't here tonight but the curb cuts at Olive Street and Colfax Avenue, that has been sent down to DPW. And I actually spoke to the Mayor about that today see if we can -- she's been asking for that for a while. It's something that really needs to be addressed. She also mentioned 421 Colfax Avenue. I found out through the Mayor that code enforcement was there. They've condemned that home. It's scheduled for demolition . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 However , there is asbestos testing that needs to occur prior to the demolition . So that's a work in progress . And Doris had also mention ed about a bus stop at Mulberry and Colfax. And I believe that the Mayor recently had a conversation with Tim McGrath from Lackawanna County Transit -- Colts to review possible placement for covering their -- especially for -- there's a lot of patients that come out of Geisinger and have to wait there whether it rain, sun, what have you. It would make life a lot easier for all of them. Zoning Board applicants , our City Council office has received four letters of interest and resumes for two open appointment s by Council to the Zoning Hearing Board. They will be coming forth probably within the next few weeks -- recommendation s. Environmental Advisory Council , our City Council office has received two letters of interest and resumes for two open appointment s by City Council to the Environmental Advisory Council . Also, something that I believe -- this is something that I think Marie Schumacher 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 has mentioned and a lot of people have mentioned , quite frankly , the wall down on Lackawanna Avenue next to the Radison . Reilly and Associate s is working on the design. Apparently we got some funding that it was initially for the county -- was that LST or RACP? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm not sure, but it was around -- MR. KING: Yeah, it was $230,000. So they're working on a design and hopefully going to start remediating that wall before it crumbles , if you will. Rubicon , initially I thought it was going to start on June 14th. However , it actually started yesterday . The Mayor told me we're going to have Rubicon come in here either June 18th or the 25th for a caucus so they could kind of give us an update early on -- excuse me. Did I say June -- July 18 or 25th, I apologize , to come in and explain exactly how things are going early on with that. As far as Nay Aug Park and the gorge, there were concerns about the gorge and so -- there's always concern s about the gorge. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 It's my understanding that Parks and Rec staff have cleared some of the shrubs and trees down near that area, especially some that have overgrown where the cameras are. And the Mayor had indicated to me that cameras are monitored from police headquarters so they can actually see when the people are heading down in there. And they are also increasing patrols, especially on hotter days when we know it's likely people are going to go down in there. We far prefer to chase them out of there, give them a citation rather than have to risk the fire and police department 's lives to go down there and try to fish them out of the bottom of that gorge. So hopefully -- I know it's tempting . Unfortunately we don't have a pool at Nay Aug right now. But we're working on that. And that's something that we've committed ourselves to try to get done. As mentioned earlier , the refuse and trash fees have been updated on the City's website as of May 31st. The street signs, they continue to make the street signs. The Mayor is looking at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 possibly doing an RFP going out to actually help because there is only three individuals working the traffic division . It's very difficult for them to come up with the process for getting them installed . So she's considering putting out an RFP to have somebody install the signs and have our city continue to make the signs. Let me see -- and I think that's all I have at this time. MR.

MR. KING: On the question ? Roll call. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm sorry, on the question , I just had a couple comment s on the legislation . I know we were discuss ing it in caucus. And, you know, I just wanted to mention that this was coming out of the idea that this would be helpful towards economic development of the area. This is in partnership with other communities . And for people who are travelling utilizing electric vehicles , they would make the stop in Scranton or Pittston in order to charge up their vehicle and then provide business to our area by being here for the charge station . So that's one thought behind this grant and project . And so I think that would be something really beneficial to have. MR. KING: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS.
