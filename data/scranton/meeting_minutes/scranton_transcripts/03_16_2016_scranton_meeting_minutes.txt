MR.ROGAN:Yes,justacouple of comments andI'llalsospeakontheagenda itemsastheycomeuptovote.Twoitems briefly ,onethatwasmentioned fromafew ofthespeakers regardingtheSupreme Court awardregarding ourpolice andfire, unfortunately ,wewereleftwithabad situation fromtheprevious mayor.Hechose tofightourpolice andfirefighters instead ofnegotiating andmaking adealandyousaw whathappened .Unfortunately now,wehave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 todealwithMayorDoherty 'slegacy,this tensofmillions ofdollars aswasnoted addeddebttothecity'sbooks.Luckily , onceitispaidoutwewillstoppaying that $100,000amonthininterest .Iknowfor myself I'minterested ,Iknowthisweekwe arehoping togetmoredetails onwhat exactly thesettlement is,butIknowsince dayonethatthepolice andfireunions have givenquiteabitbacktothecity.I believe theinitial awardwas$48million andtheyagreed tocutthatinhalfto$24 million ,andfromthesounds ofitthere werefurther negotiations whichwehaven't beenmadeawareofthatthebodies haveto votesoI'mlooking forward toseeing the finaldeal,andaswasmentioned ,getthis monkey offourback,getitpaidoffand moveforward . Secondly ,inourcaucus Iknowa number ofusoncouncil werecontacted by concerned residents regarding issues of speeders nearschool busstopsandin particular whenthebusstopsthatthedrop offchildren andcarsweregoingaround soa1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 fewyearsagothereweresomeprograms batted around toputcameras onthesebuses. Now,obviously ,thecitydoesn'tcontrol the school buses,that'sdonethrough theschool district ,butoneoftheprograms issimilar toifyouseeredlightcameras onstreets notinScranton ,wedon'thavethem,buta lotoflarger cities didorifsomebody runs through aredlighttheygetaticket inthe mail.I'mnotadvocating forthat,butwhat Iamadvocating forisasimilar program whichhasbeendoneinotherplaces across thecountry toputcameras onthebusesto activate whenthestopsignopensup,andif weresomebody topassthatstopsignthey wouldberecordedandticketed .Ithink thatwouldgoalongwaytohelpresolve thisproblem sopeople areaware,youknow, thatyoucan'tgoaround aschool bus.When youtakeadriver'slicense examthat'sthe firstthingthattheyteachyou,thatyou can'tgoaround aschool bus. So,Mrs.Reed,ifyouwouldcould sendaletter totheschool district asking maybesetupameeting between acouple of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 members ofcouncil andsomebody fromthe boardtolookintoanintergovernmental cooperation onthat.Obviously ,theactual putting thecameras onthebuseswouldhave tobedonebythedistrict buttheticketing endwouldhavetodonethrough thecity.I thinkit'ssomething wedefinitely needto exploreforthesafety ofthechildren within ourcityandIwouldliketothank ourpolice department fortheirquick response .Therewasanincident ataschool busstoplastweekandoneoftheparents wasabletogetthelicense platenumber of theperson whoalmost caused afatality .

I'llbevoting against thislegislation tonight .Iamdisappointed thatMayor Courtright andhisadministration wouldeven consider lowering thestandards todo electrical workinthiscity.Idon't believe thatwecansacrifice thesafety of ourresidents inorderforconvenience or making things easier.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 Inthelegislation ,themayorhas addedanalternate meanstoattain amaster license inthecitybecause somepeople are poortesttakers.Thisisoneofthemost absurd things thatIhaveeverseensinceI havebeenoncitycouncil .Asagentlemen mentioned tonight ,wouldanyone trusta surgeon tooperate onthemiftheyfoundout thattheycouldn'tpasstheirlicensing test butthehospital decided toletsomefriends writeletters ofrecommendation forthem because theywerepoortesttakers?I Wouldn't.Wouldanyone wanttheirchildin aclassroomwithateacher whocouldn'tpass theirlicensing test?Iwouldn't.

Ifeelthecityguidelinesfor licensing inthecityarestillcompetitive andcomprehensive withothercities ofour sizethroughout theCommonwealth . Additionally ,through theuseofa thirdpartyinspection service I'mconfident thatpermitted workinthecitywillbesafe anddoneperfectly orproperly forallof ourresidents .Butwiththatsaid,because ofthedialogue concerning thisordinance I believe thereareseveral issues worth exploring outside ofthisordinance thatmay require further studyordiscussion .I1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 thinkthereshould bediscussion on developing aresidential property only electrical testsincemostoftheproperties inthecityconsist ofolder,residential housing style.

MR.ROGAN:Ihaveanumber of comments andIguessI'mnotgoingtomake anyfriends tonight .Iknowalotofyou outthere,unfortunately ,we'reonthe opposite sideofthisissue.Fromdayone whenIfirstreadthislegislation I believed itwasagoodthingfortheCityof Scranton toopencompetition andtomakeit more--makethecitymorebusiness friendly notonlyforcontractors whoarelooking to doworkinthecitybutmoreimportantly for theresidents intheCityofScranton that oftentimeshaveahardtimegetting contractors thatcandoworkintheCityof Scranton orwhoarewilling todoworkin theCityofScranton . Before Igetintomycomments ,Ido wanttoreadasection thatIbelieve Iread lastweek,thisisrightoutofthe legislation ,nointerpretation addedto this.Thisistherequirement forthe journey men'slicense ."Theapplicant must produce theirW-2formsforfouryearsof1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 employment underamaster contractor .Ina casewhereW-2formscannot beprovided , fieldexperience alongwithletters of recommendation shallsubstitute .Letters of recommendation shallinclude twoletters fromlicensed contractors thattheyworked under,threecustomers thattheyperformed workfor,andaletter ofrecommendation fromacontractor inanother field.All recommendations shallbenotarized."

Acouple ofotheritemsthatwere brought uptonight andsomethatweren't, theissueofpublic safety hasbeenbrought upnumerous timesandthereisn'tanybody on thisboardthattalksaboutpublic safety morethanmyself.Thenewspaper often criticizes meforbeingtooclosetothe public safety unions within thecity,butI support public safety.Throughout this process notonefirefighter intheCityof Scranton hascontacted metoaskmeto oppose thislegislation andI'mfriends with alargenumber ofthem. Also,tonight weheardfromanother electrician whosaidhehasbeendoing electrical workfor14yearsbutcan'tget licensed intheCityofScranton .Now,I wouldletsomebody workonmyhousethathas beenlicensed inanother cityandhasbeen doingworkfor14yearsandourlegislation requires fouryearsofprioremployment underamaster contractor .Forthe resident soutthere,thinkofbeingina position forfouryears,wouldyouconsider1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 yourself newafterfouryearsonthejob? Andnotonlyfouryearsonthejobbut having tocomplete proper examinations or thesubmission ofacertificate ofdiploma fromanaccredited tradeschool inaddition . Inaddition ,thefinalitemwhich hasbeenmentioned isthethirdparty inspections .Allelectrical workthatis permitted anddoneproperly through thecity needstohaveathirdpartyinspection . It'snotmyself oranother --somebody else inthegovernment doingtheinspection ,this isathirdpartyindependent person whois checking thisworktoseeifit'sdone properly .Thatisaverygoodsafeguard and that'ssomething thatIdon'tthinkanyone ontheboardwouldpropose eliminating . Because ofallofthoseitems,I agreewithmycolleague ,Councilmen Evans, andDirector Hinton,thatweneedtoopenup ourlicensing process tomaketheplaying fieldmorefairtoothercontractors .I havehadanumber,through thelastfive yearsIhavebeenoncouncil ,ofpeople who wanttodoworkintheCityofScranton who1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 areworking inothertowns,theywantto comehereandtoworkbutbecause ofthe reputation theCityofScranton hasofnot beingbusiness friendly andhaving sucha biggovernment andbigbureaucracy thatthey can'tgetlicensed ,theycan'tcomeinand dotheworktheywanttodoandalotof timeswhentheydotheygetharassed ,in theiropinion ,bysomeinspectors ,andthe inspectors serveagoodpurpose ,butthe CityofScranton doesnothaveagood reputation inregards tothesematters within thepublic andwithin thecommunity atlarge. Ibelieve thatthislegislation isa goodfirststep.Thereareotheritemsthat canbedone.Councilmen Evansmentioned someofthem,Iwouldliketoseealistof allofthelicensed contractors inthecity putonthecity'swebsite aswellnotonly sothecity--sopeople canchecktoseeif thecontractor theyarecalling islicensed , butalsotogivethelicensed contractors therecognition theydeserve unlike manyof themthataredoingworkonnights and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 weekends unregulated without pulling permits within theCityofScranton ,andanyone that livesinthecityknowsthereisatonof unlicensed workbeingdoneintheCityof Scranton afterhoursandontheweekend s. Thereisnotoneperson thatcandenythat. Because ofallthoseitems,Iwill bevoting "yes"forthislegislation andI dobelieve itwillbeagoodsteptowards making Scranton morebusiness friendly and getting morecompetition fortheresidents whodidneedtheseservices . MR.WECHSLER :Justforsomeofthe reasons thatCouncilman Roganjustmentioned isoneofthereason Iwillbevoting against thislegislation thisevening .When Itookalookattheinitial qualifications fordemonstrating proficiency ,theissueof evaluating W-2'sandreferences andthings likethatjustcametomesomething that's goingtobeverydifficult todemonstrate . I'msurethattherearepeople thatwouldbe abletomeetthatrequirement ,butIthink theremaybemorethatarenot.Toechothe factthatpeople maybepoortesttakersI1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 don'tthinkisanacceptable reason to provide themwiththeability todoworkin thecity. Also,whenIfirstheardaboutthis ordinance Ithought itwouldhavetodomore withcommercial workthanresidential work.
