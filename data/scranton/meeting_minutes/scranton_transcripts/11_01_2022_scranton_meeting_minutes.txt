I also would like to make a note that because of Election Day next Tuesday and City Hall being closed, the Council meeting next week will be on Thursday night with a budget caucus at 5:30 p.m., and the meeting starting at 7 p.m. for next week. Also, for the next two weeks unless your garbage gets picked up on Monday your garbage , your garbage will be a day late next week because of Election Day and because Veterans Day falls on the same week as Election Day instead of it being observe d on Friday for DPW workers , it will be -- they'll observe Veterans Day on Monday. So for the next two weeks the garbage collection will be a day behind throughout the City. And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Evann Xanthis . MS. XANTHIS : Good evening , Council . My name is Evann Xanthis . I live in lower 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Green Ridge. The reason I'm here is last week I heard you were worried about security . My daughter in April called me from Colts downtown at the transit center and said to me that she's scared there's an elderly man that won't leave her alone. I said go to security . She said they don't have security . I said how can they not have security ? It's a terminal . It's Martz and Colts, hundreds of people go through here. This went on for one month. She was hysterical . She had to come home and sit in the ladies room to wait for the next bus. This is uncalled for. So May 7th, a smart gentleman from Martz somehow would see his car parked at Martz. He put a ticket on it. He came in and said I got a ticket. He said, well, give me your license and I'll take a picture of it and we'll call you back. He called the Scranton Police who were phenomenal . They got him within half a block from there. He was just let out of prison. You have to realize , this man has been in jail numerous times. He's on Megan's list most of his life. I can't say more about how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 horrible this situation is. I went down with her I believe it was right before they arrested him and he came and went right next to my daughter . I said, That's my daughter leave her alone." No one. No security , nothing . So May 7th comes. They arrest him. He goes to jail. My daughter goes to a preliminary hearing and has to testify of what said to her. He's in jail. But we have been in jail ourselves. Since this happened we don't sleep upstairs anymore. We have to sleep downstairs because she's afraid. We have all the doors barricaded . We have drapes closed. It's like we're in prison. I'm only upset because they are not showing effort to get security . We went to a meeting with Commissioner Chermak . I could tell you they promised everything . We're going to look into it. Well, they got 2 million dollars in February . Maybe they should spend a little of that money on security for their station . My daughter has to work. She has to transfer different buses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 from the terminal . So now she's still sitting in the ladies room until it's time to take her next bus. This is uncalled for. This City should be putting pressure on the bus terminal . This is a citizen of Scranton . I think this is a horrible thing. I think someone should do something . I called the PUC. They said told me Colts is an authority . I don't know what they mean by that. But I don't know why they can't get security . They had it before. They had a police officer . They never had trouble . They have overdoes down there. She's telling me that she's just scared. But she has to work. She's trying to save for a car because maybe then she could get out of this situation . Please put pressure on -- I know she spoke to Mr. Donahue and he was kind enough to call her back. No one else called her back. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, Miss Xanthis , I know that the police department has increased patrols around the terminal. But unfortunate ly, we as the City, right, we can't provide security for inside the building .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MS. XANTHIS : No, but you could put pressure on them. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Yes. MS. XANTHIS : You have citizens from this City going there. She's petrified. Do you know what it's like in my house at night? Do you have any idea? Closed drapes, we barricade the doors. I have washing a machine in front of one door. I have many doors in my house. I'm scared. She's scared. She thinks he might have family come and get -- she doesn't know. The police were great. They were the only ones that cared. I'm going to tell you right now if it wasn't for the Scranton -- I give them an A-plus. They came -- they still come by our house at night because it's dark and it's scary over there. We're by ourselves. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. XANTHIS : So, I mean, I think if Scranton puts a little effort into giving them a push, they got 2 million dollars in February . What did they do with it? They didn't make any improvement s in Colts. Anyway, another thing, best of luck, Mr. Donahue . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. XANTHIS : I'm sure you'll win. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list Krysten Xanthis . MS. XANTHIS : Good evening , Council . As my mother said, you know, I tried everywhere in the City to get help. I spoke to Chris Chermak , with somebody from the District Attorney 's Office, I got no help. I don't know if you spoke to the Mayor. Maybe he did. Maybe I just don't know, you know, maybe I didn't get a call back. But, I mean, unfortunately , you know, at some point before the whole thing took place of a hearing , went into the paper. If I don't get any help I'm just going to go to a news channel and see if maybe they'll help to put some pressure on the bus company because , I mean, it is in the City. I mean, if nobody is going to help then people aren't going to start taking public transportation . Then what's the point of it? What's the point of a big bus company here if nobody is going to take it? I mean, nobody went through what I did. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 I mean, I understand , you know, you -- you know, everybody is entitle d to their security here too but, like, you know, they need security down there. You go to the mall and there's security . No matter what type of security it is, hired or, like, you know, police, no matter what it is, there's somebody there. You know, you go to the county building , there is somebody there. You go to the courthouse , there is somebody there. You come here, there is somebody there. I'm not saying you guys shouldn 't have security . I'm just saying down at a bus company when there's Martz coming from other places which that didn't make a difference from him because he only targeted city residents . But I was his last target. You know, I don't know if he's going to stay where he is in jail now. But, I mean, somebody in the City has to help some how. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to Colts to see what type of security , you know, they either have down at the bus station or that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 they are anticipating providing in the future? MR. VOLDENBERG : We will, Mr. Donahue . We'll reach out in the morning . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I too am a pedestrian who has to take public transportation . I ride Colts buses maybe two or three times a week. And I find this situation unacceptable . Whenever the terminal is open, there are Colts employees and Martz employees in there. Now, they may not be dedicated security personnel , but they could call the police just as readily as anybody else can. And if a situation is brought to their attention and they fail to do so, I think those people have a cause of action. And if I were them, I'd be calling WILK talk radio. And I would be hoping that there would be an article in the paper and WNEP, they do investigative reports . But that's inexcusable . Colts does have a board. And they have monthly meetings . And they should -- an answer should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 be demanded and because they are taxpayer funded. And I understand that the county cannot control them because they are fire and forget board just like a cruise missile , off you go. But they shouldn 't have to put up with that crap, nor should anybody riding Colts. Okay, Kyle, is tonight going to be your last meeting as a Councilman ? Don't be coy. Are you going to tell us on November 10th what your plans are for the rest of the month? MR. DONAHUE : At the moment -- yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey, I'll be asking again. So what is the status of the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they're still being negotiated . MS. HODOWANITZ : You could serve a couple tours as a State Representative and come back and they'll still be working on them. How about the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : I haven't gotten an update as of yet. I know they were suppose d to meet next week -- last Thursday . But that reminds me to -- Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 out and see what the result of that meeting was? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MS. HODOWANITZ : So we're still going to have on the agenda the draft budget for November 10th? MR. DONAHUE : As long as we receive the draft budget tomorrow , yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I'm just hoping though that the administration can explain the numbers they provide because you have open-ended union contracts . You've got the Payroll Preparation Tax which is still hanging in the rafters . You've got inflation to deal with. Last week you had to budget $110,000 to pay the electric bills. There's a whole lot of uncertainty . And we have no audit. Do we have any idea when City Hall is going to reopen speaking of security ? MR. DONAHUE : Like I said last week, it is my understanding that City Hall is open from what I've been told is that you just have to check in at the desk downstairs . MS. HODOWANITZ : And they will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 answer the phone if you call? I'm going to try that. I'm going to keep a log to -- MR. DONAHUE : I encourage you to do that, yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : I will say I was pleasantly surprised to see three donation s in tonight 's agenda. And I think, you know, citizens who were kind enough to thank the City for services by making donations even if they are anonymous or donation s of the lighting fixture s for the election , that says a lot about the character of some of our citizens . The grant for the Davis Trail, I saw a deadline of October 27th. I assume that we've been to push that back? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : If you look at the backup -- MR. DONAHUE : I believe that was been able to be pushed back but I'll double-check for that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, yeah, because we missed that one. And I just want to say that I think most of the City employees do a very, very good job. So when I keep asking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 about the union contracts , it's not because I don't think that the City employees deserve every penny they make and every benefit they receive . It's just that I feel uneasy because budgeting is something that we have to wrap our arms around. And we paint ourselves into a corner by letting those contracts expire. I'm hoping -- I haven't seen -- and I hope we're going to see a list of all the contract s so that we know when they expire so we could get ahead of that power curve, not just for the unions but for everything . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . I'd like to echo what Joan just said about the donations to the City. I saw that on the agenda. It's very nice that we have people in the City that really care about the City they're willing to donate money or resources . That's a good thing. Okay, next, my weekly question . Is there any update on our corner about getting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 fixed as we were promised a year ago? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. They were suppose d to take a look at it on Friday. MR. SPINDLER : This Friday? MR. DONAHUE : Last Friday. MR. SPINDLER : Oh, last Friday. MR. DONAHUE : That was an e-mail we sent out -- we sent out for another request for an update. And it's one of the managers down at DPW said they would take a look at it on Friday. But we'll follow up and see what they -- MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Well, I work part time. So I don't know if they were there when I was at work or not. But, I mean, I looked at it last year and the supervisor was there. They painted lines on every corner of the intersection . So I don't know what they have to look at again. He even said -- he said, oh, this was done terrible . We'll take care of it. Still waiting . I'm beginning to think that list that I hear I'm on begins with an S. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to see -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . The City engineer is supposed look at that intersection . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. SPINDLER : Lastly, I'm going to repeat what I did last week. Next Tuesday is Election Day. And I urge everybody to get out and vote. And I hope they do what I'm going to do as I said last week just when you see the little oval on top that says straight Democrat , I hope you fill that in because the Republicans want to do away with our rights as was done in many states already . They want to limit people's voting rights. They want to take away a woman's right to do what she wants to do with her body. And they are not for gun control . That's a fact. And all of these things I just stated are facts. So I hope you vote right next Tuesday . And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Just a reminder too, the straight party circle isn't available anymore. So do you have to fill in individual circles . That was a deal that was made between Democrats and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Republicans . But that's a whole other thing. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: You know as always, I appreciate everybody 's opinion . But next Tuesday is Election Day. And I hope that people pay an awful lot of attention and before they vote for anybody they pay attention to what the Democrats have done to our country in the last two years, the cost of food, the cost of fuel, forcing people to take COVID shots, people in the Congress and the Senate talking about pursuing Republicans like Maxine Waters and many others that just led to riots and abuse of the political system over the last two years. And I hope that the voters will hold Democrats responsible for the damage they have done to our country . And it's not a personal thing but pay attention to what happened to our schools . I think all the members of the Scranton School Board are Democrats . I could be wrong. And I also believe the City Council members are Democrats . But I just made a video for ECTV about the closure s in Scranton . And I hope that everybody will go to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 YouTube and watch that. I was involved in the fight against the construction of Scranton School when it was built. And I was opposed to the closure of East Scranton Intermediate and John Adams. And last time John Adams was saved. But East Scranton Intermediate went to a business man. And we suffered enough under in my opinion the pay to play Democratic government that we have in this city. And I just hope that people when they vote on Election Day vote Republican or Independent , anything but Democrat . The other thing I have here is the slide at Nay Aug is gone. So I called the Clerk yesterday and asked a question on who authorized the removal of the slide at Nay Aug Park. And I'm wondering if any Council member has anything they want to say about that. MR. DONAHUE : The administration authorized . MR. MORGAN: Okay, well, how does the administration have authority to go in there and tear that down? That's administered by an authority . So the Mayor doesn't have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 that right. So she broke the law. Now, my other question is, where did the funding come from to remove that? MR. DONAHUE : So it's my understanding it went -- it was a part of the demolition bid for the pump house but a change order was put into that contract to include the slide. MR. MORGAN: And who authorize d it, Council ? MR. DONAHUE : Council did not, no. MR. MORGAN: Okay. So nobody authorize d the expenditure except who, the Mayor? MR. DONAHUE : Council authorized the -- I believe Council authorize d the expenditure to demolish the pump house. But we got nothing in terms of a change order on that. MR. MORGAN: So what's the Council going to do if the Mayor tore the down the slide and didn't have the authorization to do that because only the Authority had the right to make the decision to remove the slide, not the Mayor. So what's happened is a violation of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 law because the City and the administration had no right to do anything in that park. It was being administered by an administration that it doesn't answer to the Mayor. And, you know, that's where I'm getting to when I talk about how corrupt I think our government is. I think it's beyond corrupt . And, you know, my last thing here is what did the slide actually cost to construct when it was constructed ? MR. DONAHUE : So according to an article in the Scranton Times from April 8th, 2003, the cost was approximately $300,000. MR. MORGAN: So we spent $300,000 to build a slide that the tax group used to pay -- to collect donations and pay $5 for kids to slide down that into the pool. So what we have is we've wasted community development money to build a slide. The administration has probably used federal or state funds to tear down the slide that belonged to the resident s. Then if you look at other things that have been done to the resident s of this city over the course of my lifetime with federal and state funds, when you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 take a look at the South Side Sports Complex , the state determined that you could sell that to the University of Scranton . But the federal government and the law says you can't sell that. So if the federal government comes to Scranton and says that cost 10 million dollars and you're going pay us, they're going to take that out of any grant money that comes to this city. The harm being done to the resident s in this city by this Council -- not this particular Council , but its elected government just like the contract s we're going to pass through here and the Mayor. And it just never stops, never. And people keep voting for Democrats that smile at you and tell you everything is okay. Look at our school system. Thank you for your time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I'll actually jump off on that last comment . The slide removal , we understand that it was done as a thief in the night, a thief in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 night. It was a backdoor operation to tear it down without community input. Since it did not go through this body and funds were taken from an allocation that was set aside for the pump house, not for the removal of the slides, has anyone in this body gone forth and put forth to the Ethics Board to find out whether or not that has been -- that was an ethical duty of the Mayor? We have an Ethics Board in this City supposedly for a reason. It's to audit, look at, and to make sure that the duties of office are taken out ethically . Has this body ever filed an ethic's complaint within this last year over any action that has been done in this City whether it be a -- I was going to say whether it be a power cleaning pump that mysteriously was used for personal gain rather than City gain. But I've been informed that for some reason that the union contracts are specifically excluded from the Ethics Board. That information cannot be granted -- gathered by the Ethics Board for any union contracts . That's baked into the union contract s, which I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 find amazingly startling considering part of all of the contracts are a duty to the City and an oath to the City and most employees sign under. I understand the police do it. I understand the Fire Department does it. I understand that the City Council and the Mayor does it. I'm not sure whether or not all of the employees of the City of Scranton swear to be ethical and upstanding . If they do, then I would not see why any contract would bar the Ethics Committee from going in and reviewing it because to bar them from coming in and reviewing it in my opinion is an unethical concept and it goes in violation of the very oath they take when taking that job. Onto tax free organizations , 38 percent of the City is a nonprofit . But I believe in this year so far we're somewhere in the neighborhood of four or five pilot donations . It's amazing that out of such a big city with so many non-profits , almost none of them pay in lieu of taxes. One of the larger by percentage s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that I could pull off the top of my head was the Boy Scouts of America who I believe back in January paid a thousand dollars for their donation which is much greater than the majority of every single pilot in the City, except for the University who makes quite a lot of money. As a matter of fact, the drug treatment centers threw a drop in the bucket. And we know all the drug treatment centers though they are nonprofit charge insurance s an arm and a leg and they certainly do make money. Their employees are not paid nickels and dimes. I've watched the City over the past year trash monitor ing that will save one million dollars . Sure it will save one million dollars if we bake into it that we fire employee , terminate routes and do less services . If I fire 50 percent of City Hall's employees , guess what? I'm going to produce a savings . It doesn't mean I can. But I could guarantee you that I could save City Hall money if I can put on paper that I'm going to fire everyone . The reality of these contract s are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 numbers that are given are fictitious . They are based on a principle to hire a secondary contractor for large amounts of public funds who cannot perform the duties that they come before this body and say that they are. They are given out like candy and they walk away with their pocket enriched while the citizens of this City sit with dirt and dust in their pocket. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I would like to point out to my Republican friends that if you look over in Ukraine , whose fault is that? That's their fault. They voted for a man that pussyfooted with Putin and did whatever he wanted. They blew up one of their own ships and now they are shutting down grain to Ethiopia and Africa and northern Mediterranean . It's just ridiculous . Now, 54 percent of the inflation rate is corporate profits , excess corporate profits. That was an analysis by a Congress lady from California .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 If I agree with two-thirds of what is achieved or attempted to achieve by a politician , that's all I could ask. I can't agree with everything all the time. Mr. Mastriano our Governor , he's already professing that he has illegal plans to mess with the vote. I mean, really? Do we need really need that? Maybe the wrong people are rioting. And by the way on the vote, Social Security , Medicare, Veterans , public schools , you name it they are all up for grabs after this election or past 2024. All they need is a president that agrees with them if they get a majority . In many cases these states are so gerrymandered that it takes 100,000 people to counter the vote of 75 or even worse. 44 percent of the vote in some states guarantees , guarantees a Republican Congress . And if they get anywhere near 50 like Wisconsin , they have it. So my point is you guys can't do nothing about it. I can't do nothing about it. But I could vote for somebody that is going to counter balance it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 And that's what we need to do. We really need to do it. They are photo shopping defund the police onto Democrat 's T-shirts and putting it out in ads. I mean, that's just totally dishonest . Nobody in their right mind wants to even if you're a gun enthusiast and you nail somebody coming in your front door, there's a judicial review that's going to put you in a lot of hurt. So I'm mighty glad with all of these beautiful goldilocks that the police might be keeping that type of element at bay so I don't have to defend myself and then defend myself in court, maybe have my whole life ahead of me spent in bankruptcy . I mean, it's just January 6th. Oh, it was Antifa. I don't think an Antifa person -- I'd be going the other way if I were Antifa. And, you know, it's all types of people like Dr. Fauci. He has to have a bodyguard. The man that actually developed a lot of drugs for HIV and helped to develop the vaccines and you name it. It's just -- it's totally ridiculous . And that debate last week I snuck 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 out on yous. I won't do it this week to hear that debate. I don't know why Fetterman's people agreed to that with News Nation, really? That was silly. But my vote is already in and it certainly isn't for any of the Republicans on the slate. I don't vote for people that come from neighborhood s that display the flag upside down or go Brandon T-shirts or anything else. Enough is enough. We need to just get some results and get the country back together . Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I guess since everybody is taking and using this as a political podium tonight , I may as well stand up for the other half. I am proud to say I will vote for every conservative on the ballot. I question Mr. Fetterman and his beliefs , let me just put it that way. If anybody who could vote for him I would question . Now moving onto City business , I don't -- when the East Mountain Road was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 resurface d, there was a -- because of the curve at Seymour and East Mountain Road, the state mandated when it was -- the road was paved and curbs put in and drains and all that good stuff. They said there had to be a crosswalk on the lower side because of the curb and, of course, now with the way everybody drives up there it's like Indianapolis . And it was taken -- when the road was resurfaced , whoever did the marking did not put the walkway back in. And the -- actually on when you are coming up the hill there is a -- there was a sign saying, you know, at the end of the sidewalk saying because then after that it's woods. They said use the crosswalk . Well, the crosswalk is gone and so is the sign. Somebody helped themselves . First they knocked it down and then it's gone. And I think that needs to be put back in for safety sake. Now, I don't know if you all read the articles that were in the Scranton Times about the particulate plastic in our streams . What have you done so far to check on the concentration of those particulates and the leachate that possibly will be allowed to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 go to what, 200,000 gallons a day. Have you done anything ? MR. DONAHUE : So in our letter that we sent along with officials from Dunmore , we asked for more particulars of the plan as it relates to leachate into Roaring Brook. And we still have not received any particulars of that plan. MS. SCHUMACHER : When do you expect one? MR. DONAHUE : I'm hoping soon. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, maybe we need to follow up on that. The other thing on the union contracts , I don't see anything in our budget now that provides for a raise which I guess we will have to pay for last year and this year. So I mean that gets pretty powerful . MR. DONAHUE : So we do have the contingency line item that was $800,000 last year and that we only spent 110 out of so far this year because of the increase in electricity cost we passed that last week. So that will be brought over. And we've also met both of our -- in the last two years our fund 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 balance policy which calls for I believe it's, what, 8 percent of the entire spend. So we do have a fund balance . And we've had a fund balance for the last two years. MS. SCHUMACHER : Sufficient to cover the percentage s for increases for the two years? MR. DONAHUE : That's the hope, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And would anybody tell me what they -- what you think we were suppose d to gain from the LERTA from 2019? MR. DONAHUE : Excuse me? MS. SCHUMACHER : What did Council expect from the LERTA legislation -- the City when it was passed? MR. DONAHUE : The hope was for increased development . MS. SCHUMACHER : How do you think it's done? MR. DONAHUE : I mean, I think that the COVID pandemic maybe put a little pause on that. But I think we're getting better. I think overall tax reassessment would be helpful in that too. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I'm out of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 time. But I'll start where I want to go from here now next week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton City taxpayer . I think we've seen pretty clearly tonight massive policy failure on the side of local government , county government , and state and federal government in regards to underfunding our public transit systems . There is no reason that any citizen should ever be allowed to feel unsafe on public transit . And the reason this happens is that we do not invest or take seriously public transit in our communities . Now, I asked last week if anyone would be interested in trying to rely on public transit for their life this week. Has anyone done that? I'll take your silence as a no. Would I be correct to assume that it's because it was unreasonable ? MR. DONAHUE : With two kids under two, it is unreasonable , yes. MR. GUZIEWICZ : Exactly . So our public transit is not capable of supporting our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 community . We've seen that tonight for the two women earlier with the danger in the bus station . And you just said so yourself. How long have I been asking for the City of Scranton to invest in public intransit ? I've been asking largely for the train. But there's been nothing regarding public transit whatsoever . How many blocks of parking lot is in Scranton unused to foster the car? How much money are we losing in tax revenue in personal income from not having houses mixed use neighborhood s, businesses , etc., in these parking lots because we want to invest and allow private corporations to invest in automobile transit . And we focus our money away from the public transit away from the public. No one should ever feel unsafe in our cities, on our streets , in places funded by the public, places not funded by the public but especially in places that we personal ly fund through taxes through investment . Why are we not investing in our people? Why are we investing in our automobiles ? The woman attested that she will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 be working to purchase a car so that way she doesn't have to take public transportation so she doesn't have to face the risks associate d with public transportation . We know that automobile s are a massive financial burden, one of the reasons that so many municipalities , so many communities , so many individual s are in poverty . The average car payment in America is $700 a month. An oil change is upwards of $60. Emissions , inspections , gasoline , all of these are major financial drains on our individuals , on our communities . The automobile is the number two expense in every household . After housing , it's the automobile , not food, not childcare , not healthcare . It's the automobile and yet we're allowing our citizens to fall into poverty through our investment in the automobile , through our disinvestment in public transportation and are allowing them to be put in situation s where they are unsafe and situation s in which they feel that they now have to go into debt and lose income and take on massive financial burdens in order to avoid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 those risks because we're not investing in public transit . We could start with the buses. Hopefully we'll expand from there. But so far over the past few months nothing has changed . There's been no increase in investment in the Colts system. There's been discussions walkability , which I praise the City for. Hopefully we'll see that expand. But on every level personal to federal government, we need to look at what we're taking care of in our cities, in our communities , in our individual lives and figure out why we're so willing to put everything we have into our cars and take everything we can from our people. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No comment s tonight . I'll just follow up with some of my requests 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 from the last few weeks with Frank this week as well as Solicitor Gallagher . Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, none this evening . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Just two. So every week when ECTV is live taping this or broadcasting our Council meeting , I get a message but I don't see it until after the meeting . But I keep hearing from more than one person they lose sound during the meeting either for most of it where they're living and watching it or parts of it. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we please check with them? I know they are right behind us in the back room. Did you hear what I said or no? MR. VOLDENBERG : Would you repeat yourself , Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, sure. He can't hear me either. I receive d a couple complaint s and they are always during the meeting. And, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 of course, I don't answer them then. But what I'm hearing is that they're not hearing . During the meeting s there is no sound for parts of our live meeting . I don't know if that's the case when it's viewed later, but during the live session the volume or the sound seems to cut out for the whole meeting for some or for other people watching parts of it. So I don't know what's the -- how that is fixed. But I know they're right behind us if you could get that to them. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, Mr. McAndrew , the contractor Endeavor Incorporated was in this afternoon . And they worked for a few hours and they said it should be fixed. MR. MCANDREW : Oh, so they're aware of it. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yeah, they're aware of it. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, well, I didn't know that. Well, thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : We'll find out after we speak with them after the meeting if it went through clearly . MR. MCANDREW : Great. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 So secondly , we talked about signs, City street signs and the issue that we're still working on or investigating Mr. Schuster brought it up about, you know, do we still have the money to do it or where is the money to do it. But also in addition to that, someone reached out to me about the actual signs themselves . They're saying that, you know, Irving Ave, there's a sign for Irving Ave, but it doesn't say south or north. We know that there is a South and North Irving. This might be confusing to people. They also said that there was in South Side there is a Herz, H-E-R-Z, avenue but the sign says Hertz. So I don't know. These are concern s by a resident . Obviously he's paying attention and watching . So can you look into that for us with regard to proper signage and the spelling of them. And the same resident also brought forth issues in the past on South Irving and Willow Street about the line-of-sight and the dangers it present s. I think we brought this up or this was brought to my attention maybe two months ago. I know it was last year. I know there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 was some issues. I know that Code Enforcement did go out. Could you see if since the last time we inquired about it where we're at with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MR. DONAHUE : I know they took -- sorry to interrupt . MR. MCANDREW : That's okay. MR. DONAHUE : I know they took a look at South Irving and Birch because I think we got an e-mail about that about a month ago, I believe . But was Willow included in that? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, this is a different -- it's not the same gentleman that you got it from. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MR. MCANDREW : All right. This is a different constituent so just follow up on that, see where we're at with that. I know it's in the same neighborhood . Let's take a deeper dive and make sure they could take care of that for us or give us an answer at least. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 there's a Herz Court. I don't know about Herz Street. But I know there's a Herz Court. MR. MCANDREW : Or an alley they said. I'm sorry. I apologize . It's an alley or court. MR. DONAHUE : The only two things I have, I did get a complaint from a resident that lives on the unit block of South Irving Avenue. Apparently in January or February ish of this year, someone drove straight through the dead end and took out the guardrail that's there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to DPW to see if it's the City's responsibility to fix that guardrail or if that would fall on PennDOT because at the end of South Irving Avenue goes to the expressway there. And I don't know where the PennDOT right of way starts/ends and whether that is the City's responsibility . So can we just pass that along to DPW to see what the, you know, how we can get that fixed whether it's the City doing it or PennDOT ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And then also, could we also send a request regarding Miss Schumacher 's comments about a crosswalk at the corner of Seymour and East Mountain Road and also a sign leading up to that would tell pedestrians to use the crosswalk ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And that's all I have this evening . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
