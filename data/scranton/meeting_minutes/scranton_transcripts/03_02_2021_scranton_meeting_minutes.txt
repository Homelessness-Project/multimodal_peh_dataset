And let us also take a moment of silence tonight for all of the people in our community , in our country and around the world who have passed away and are suffering from the coronavirus . The pandemic as we know turned our world upside down. But we must remain hopeful and strong. We continue to pray for the doctors , nurses, and researchers and all the medical professionals who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process , may they have protection and peace. Whether we are home or abroad, surrounded by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together and in place of our anxiety let us have hope and peace.

AGENDA FOR THE CONTINUATION OF THE NON-UNIFORM MUNICIPAL PENSION BOARD MONTHLY MEETING OF FEBRUARY 17, 2021 HELD ON FEBRUARY 26, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. MCANDREW : I got two of them. For the remainder of lent, St. Ann's Basilica Council will be hosting a fish fry up the street here at St. Ann's Basilica for the Knights of Columbus . It's a fundraiser. The fish fry is $8. It includes Alaskan beer battered cod, french fries, tarter sauce and a drink. And it's takeout only. It's going to be March 12th and the 26th from five to eight. You could place your orders on the Knights of Columbus website . And I think you could also call the basilica . And then secondly, our friends , Friend of the Poor, Family to Family and the Weinberg Food Bank will have a popup COVID-19 emergency drive-thru pantry tomorrow from one to three; four member family max. And it's at Scranton High. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : I would just like to wish a happy retirement to Christine and Marie Gallagher and Leslie Izak, Perry Brunori and Jack Liptai from the LIPS Department . Thanks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 for the service to the City. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : And I just want to wish everyone a happy Women's History Month which it started yesterday . And the other thing I know they were in last week, NeighborWorks , but I just want to remind everyone the applications are open for the Beautiful Blocks Program . So you could find out more through NeighborWorks of Northeastern Pennsylvania . And you could get a preapplication if you're considering being part of the program . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just want to take a second -- and Councilman Schuster mentioned the employees who are retiring. I also want to take a second to recognize these employees . There was quite a few of them. So one that kind of slipped by -- I think slipped by us last year was Nelson Ancherani , a juvenile officer for the police department . He was hired October 13th, 1970. He retired in December last year, 50 years of service to the City of Scranton . So I want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 wish Officer Ancherani a good and healthy retirement . It's -- you just don't see that anymore, 50 years of working for -- and 50 years towards public service . So that's just -- it's phenomenal . Christine Gallagher who I know personally hired June 22nd, 1998. I want to thank Christine for her service to the City. She did a wonderful , wonderful job. Same with Marie Gallagher who I also know hired March 11th, 1996. So thank you Marie for all of your dedication and your hard work. I did not know Leslie Izak. But you only hear great things about Leslie. She's been a staple down at the DPW forever . And they're going to miss her. I know that -- hired August 29th, 1998. So thanks for your dedication and your work, Leslie. A friend of mine, Jack Liptai, hired September 25th, 1996. Jack has been an asset to the City, dedicated employee and a friend of mine. So thanks, Jack, for all that you've done. And Perry Brunori was hired March 11th, 1996. Perry has been a friend I think of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 all of us. Well, Kyle and I especially just from being in chambers for the longest and when the pandemic hit, unfortunately we don't see Perry as much as we'd like. But Perry is the maintenance man -- one of the maintenance men down in City Hall. And I got to know Perry pretty well over the last seven years on Council . And you couldn't find a nicer, more dedicated employee in that building than Perry, always greeted you with a smile, conversation big Yankees fan. And he was just a really, really great guy. So I wish him the best retirement because he definitely deserves it. There may be more retirements to come. And I would like to honor these employees who are taking their retirement . Because without these people, the City doesn't run. The building doesn't run. We're losing a lot of good people with a lot of experience . And I think it's going to be very hard to replace these people with all the years that they've put in and the knowledge that they have. But again, I want to thank them for their dedication to the City and all that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 they've given. A lot of these employees are often overlooked in the clerical union and such. But they really, you know, they're often the people that you don't hear about. But they're the people that get the job done. So again, I want to thank them so much and wish them the best of luck. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Deborah Niehuus and Clifford Smith. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comment s into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Deborah Niehuus as follows : Greetings ! Quick questions : 1) Overall does the city make a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 profit, break even or lose money with its recycling . 2) Is anybody enforcing the recycling ordinances and or its fines? MS. REED: The second submission is from Clifford Smith as follows : Hello, my name is Clifford Smith. I am a resident of North Scranton and homeowner . I would like to add a topic for the city council to put into the public. This topic is that of individuals who have relocated here due to the pandemic and have very loud car mufflers and play supper loud music with their windows down. Even if these residents are now permit citizens , we need to address the problem of the noise level in our Neiborhood 's due to these issues? The car mufflers are way to loud, and the music levels are as well when the weather is nice enough for them to roll down windows . The biggest concern is the use of these loud car mufflers ? Can you please advise me on how to proceed with these issues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 with our council . (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just regarding the recycling , I mean, those are good questions . I know we've asked those in the past, I believe . But it would be good to get some updated information on that considering that we're paying for recycling now where we weren't I think when we had asked those in the past. And on the noise, I know there is an ordinance on the books regarding decibel levels. But I believe the issue with that is to properly enforce it, the police department would need some sort of decibel reader. And I don't think they have that equipment or I don't believe they have that equipment . So that's something that I think we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 need to work on in terms of a grant to get that because I know that is a complaint all over the City. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Anyone else on the question ? So we'll get these questions to the appropriate departments in the City. And we'll reach back out to Miss Niehuus . Sorry if I'm mispronouncing your name and Mr. Smith. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. MCANDREW : I do. Back in January I think it was our January 9th meeting , I brought forth some concerns from residents on Rundle Street and Watson Street. And these concerns are related to the Affordable Luxury Auto on 1218 South Main Avenue which are not contain ed to a lot. There's automobiles everywhere . Like we said they were parking everywhere . And then the next block down on 1350 South Main, there's a garage with no name on it that they also operate . So I know that Mrs. Reed sent correspondence on the 21st and copied Chief Namiotka and as a request to follow up by parking enforce ment personnel . So I believe the police went down and maybe ticketed vehicles . But to me -- and I understand that we had a couple snowstorms since then. But I drove by there the other day. And there's still a ridiculous amount of cars on the car lot and in front of this garage, on the side of the garage and in the back of the garage. So between then and now, a resident 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 who initially brought this to me actually messaged me and it's pretty scary. So I'm going read the message she sent me. Hi Mark, I don't know if anything more is being done on our situation . I just want to let you know that the situation is escalating . My brother Jim had another confrontation with them. It almost came to an assault from a guy who had Tennessee plates. The threat of gunfire was thrown in by one of the car lot men. The owner stated they -- stated that they always did this in New York and never had a problem . So this isn't New York, all right. And it's just getting terribly bad. I'm really getting afraid living here now and very afraid that Jim could get hurt and killed. This is her husband . They had cars all over blocking the alley. And this alley is between Rundle and Reynolds and right next to this garage. All right. So -- and it's a busy part of Main Avenue near Walmart . It's where all the lanes change, right around there and Arcaro's Pizza. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 So many times they try to pull up this alley and it's blocked. And the people in the garage say, hey, back up. And, you know, you can't back up into the middle of Main Avenue. You know, someone is going to get hurt. This is a very serious safety issue. What I would like, Mrs. Reed, can you please reach out -- first of all, there has to be something with zoning here. I drive by. It doesn't make any sense. You got -- I can't even explain the amount of cars. Nobody's selling cars down there. No one's working on cars. But they're all over the place. Mrs. Reed, if you could please reach out and get an update on this situation because it's escalating . You know, I don't know all the enforcement policies . I don't know the code. But it doesn't look right. If it doesn't look right, it's probably not right. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could please circle around and contact again the police, the LIPS Department , see what they've done, if anything , and please have them get back to us with regards to this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MS. REED: I will. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I had two things that I wanted to mention that I forgot about earlier . First, I just -- I don't think we've talked about the Scranton Porch Fest that's being planned for later this month. Connor O'Brien from the French Festival , he has put this together as an idea instead of the St. Patrick 's Day Parade that we're unable to have this year because of the pandemic . Instead residents and businesses are being encouraged to decorate their properties with, you know, as if it was like a float in the parade. So I wanted to give a mention to that. I believe it's going to be happening -- I forget the date here -- around March 20th. And I think that the decoration s would stay up until March 28th. So if anyone is interested in being involved even if you're a business , I know there's several business es that have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 already signed up to be a part of it. You could visit Scranton porchfest.com. And the other thing that I wanted to mention , I know with the storms last night -- the storm last night we had a lot of high winds and, you know, a lot of downed trees and branches . And I just wanted to thank the DPW for their quick cleanup. I saw them this morning on my street because a neighbor of ours had a very large branch fall down. And we were wondering , you know, how long it would stay there. And not very long because sure enough, they came by very quickly . So I know they were hard at work around the City to help clean up after the storm. So those are the only things I wanted to mention . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just a couple quick things. First, Miss Reed, we haven't receive d a response on my request from the Licensing and Inspection s Department on 2208 Prospect , correct ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MS. REED: I don't believe so, Councilman Donahue . I'll follow up. MR. DONAHUE : Would we be able to follow up with that and would we also be able to just copy the Mayor's office on that too? MS. REED: Certainly . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Also, we had a meeting regarding the issues on Third Avenue with the truck traffic last week. We're trying to work through some alternatives there. We're going to have a followup meeting this week. I know we've been in touch with State Representative Marty Flynn, Senator Blake's office regarding reaching out to PennDOT to try to see if there is any possibility to either accelerating the construction timeline for the Elm Street bridge, which would alleviate those issues or, you know, we even threw out there if there is any way we could reenforce it to allow some weight, you know, half loads, etc. But we are working on that. I did reach out to American Water regarding Birch Street because in the beginning of December we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 had sat down with them and they gave us a timeline of the end of February for Birch Street to be open to traffic . It still is not open due to the snow in February . That deadline has now been pushed back to March 15th to open up Birch Street. But they still are on target for a full restoration by the end April. And we also had our Biden committee -- street naming committee yesterday . We're just in the factfinding phase right now, I would say. So as we continue to just gain some information on the process and the impact we'll keep everybody updated . That's all I have this week. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you. I just have two things -- actually three things. I received an e-mail from a gentleman on Ferdinand Street at the very top of Ferdinand Street about some pretty dangerous conditions up there. So we forwarded that along to the DPW for them to take action. As I mentioned in the caucus, the 2019 audit is finally complete . It will be on our agenda next week for those in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the public who wanted to take a look at it and review it. And we also have hard copies that will be available to us if anyone on Council is interested . I have asked in the past for an update on the status of several recommendations that were made in our Recovery Plan with our recovery coordinator , the Pennsylvania Economy League. The Business Administrator gave another report that we should receive a complete update on all of those very soon. He had expressed to our City Clerk that he went through each one of those with the Pennsylvania Economy League. So we'll get that soon. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING A “NO PARKING ” ZONE ALONG THE EASTERLY SIDE OF WYOMING AVENUE (S.R.3025) FROM SEGMENT 0000 OFFSET 1292 TO SEGMENT 0020 OFFSET 1417 TO ALLOW FOR SAFE SIGHT DISTANCES FOR A PARKING LOT PROPOSED BY MILLER LOFTS LOCATED AT 620 WYOMING AVENUE.

DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , the only concern I might have with this, is just we approved the same sort of thing on the other side of this street. So I just -- I was -- Miss Reed was able to pull the previous location we approved for me this afternoon . So I just want to be able to compare those just to get an idea of how that affects that 600 block. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Very good. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.

DONAHUE : On the question , I just realized this when -- during our little break. But we're going to have to amend this before final passage to say East Gibbon Street instead of West Gibson Street. That might just be a typo. But West Gibson Street is over in West Side. MR. GAUGHAN : Good catch, Kyle. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I was thinking the same thing. MR. DONAHUE : I caught it when I went to compare the previous one with the one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 that Miss Reed sent this afternoon during our break and realized it. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-D.

ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF LEONARD NAMIOTKA , 1130 PHILO STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18508, TO THE POSITION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 17, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , like I stated in caucus, I'm thrilled that he's being -- mister -- Chief Namiotka is being chosen as the Police Chief. I'm just sad to say that, you know, it took not only 35 days the poor guy had to wait, it's five months. So I know that we're still waiting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 to receive rational e or answers to why it took that long and possibly in the process violating an ordinance . So like I said, I'm thrilled that had he got it. He's doing a great job already . And I look forward to voting for him again next week. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Yeah, I agree with Councilman McAndrew there. We've been asking about his now at least going back to January , I believe , if I'm not mistaken . We did have our Solicitor Attorney Hayes look into whether or not this violated the Administrative Code. The language I think to all of us is pretty clear. It says that the Mayor is obviously allowed to appoint acting department directors for a period not to exceed 35 days. After the 35 days is up, the person must be either approved as permanent or dismissed . This appointment of Mr. Namiotka as interim Police Chief was effective September 12th, 2020. So that's over five months ago. The Administrative Code goes on to say that no acting director can be reappointed to that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 classification for a period of six months. So I think before we put our stamp of approval on this, we have to make sure that the rules are being followed and that by approving this, we're not making a mistake and violating -- continuing to violate the Administrative Code. So, Kevin and Lori, if you could draft something up and we'll sign it and send it over to them as soon as possible so we could get a response before final passage next week. Anyone else have anything to add there? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

FOR COLLECTION OF DELINQUENT MUNICIPAL CLAIMS. MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of 7-B. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 stated it earlier in caucus, I did wish that the administration discussed or at least looked at a period of amnesty . I think it could have been a benefit for the City to get that influx of money before the 15 percent fee was added to it by this -- by Portnoff and Associates . But I am happy to see that Council 's suggestions were added to this agreement . And I think we got a better deal for the City. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I'd like to echo what Councilman Schuster said. I know he made some recommendation s. I'm glad that this was tweaked because look at the last company we had everybody keeps forgetting about it. I don't even know if we severed ties. We're told we have. So I'm glad we were able to, you know, tweak this deal for the betterment of our taxpayers . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Just a few things, I will be voting for this. The agreement that was originally sent down, the terms of the agreement were unacceptable for several 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 different reasons that we've gone over in detail here. And Council performed its role as oversight and to make sure that, you know, the people of the City are getting the best deal, the best bang for their buck. And that's what we did. And I want to thank Solicitor Hayes for the work that he put in and all my fellow Council members for their input on this as well. I agree with Councilman Schuster the idea of a grace period -- I've been talking about that now for quite some time. I'm very disappoint ed. I think we're leaving a lot of money on the table here, a lot of money. And I don't understand it because we are a City that every year is looking at the end of the year at potential deficits . Next year the budget we received we're calling for about a 4 million dollar shortfall potentially , the year after that and the year after that. So for us to leave or for the Mayor and the administration to leave money on the table potentially , I don't think it's a wise decision . That's all I have. Anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 else? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes.
