MR. MCANDREW : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, there will a motion this evening to move Item 5-B to Sixth and Seventh Order for final vote. This ordinance is to extend the local declaration of emergency as a result of the localized flooding that occurred on September 9, 2023 to October 13th of 2023. Anyone who would like to speak on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 this piece of legislation may do so in Fourth Order during citizens participation . DR. ROTHCHILD : I'd like to make a motion to take from the File of the Council No. 87, 2023. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table File of the Council No. 87 of 2023. This ordinance increases the debt proceeds account and court awards account by $3,790,000 to allow for payment of unbudgeted legal settlement payments . It's being taken from the table and being placed in Seventh Order for a final vote. On the question ? Well, on the question , I asked for this to be broken out. All right. One is a court awarded settlement . And one is -- one was a settlement with a company that claims that there was a breach of contract where actually they were a breach of contract where they were involved in an investigation with the former Mayor. So I can't in good conscience award that type of behavior . So since it's still bundled , I'll be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 voting no. MR. SCHUSTER : I will not -- I will also not be voting for this tonight . There may have been a possibility of me voting for it if it was separated . Since it has not been separated I will be a no vote for this piece of legislation . MR. MCANDREW : So signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. They ayes have it and so moved. MR. SMURL: I'd like to make a motion to take from the table Resolution No. 311 of 2023. MR. MCANDREW : There's a motion on the floor and a second -- oh, I'm sorry. Did someone second it -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. There is a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table Resolution No. 311 of 2023. This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 resolution is a contract with Nlyten Corporation to provide the city's fire department with a first responder mental health and wellness mobile application . It is being taken from the table and placed in Seventh Order for a final vote. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm also going to be voting no for this. I don't think there is any substitute for mental health. And I don't think an application on the telephone is that substitute . I would much like to see this money spent elsewhere. MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , I was back and forth with this. I am the Chairman of Public Safety, okay, and do I care about the health and welfare and safety of our brave police and firefighters , I do. I heard from both sides. I heard the rational e from both Chiefs. I've heard -- yes, I did hear from the union members because I asked them. I know Chief Judge was like, well, someone reached out to you. I have no have problem with that. I represent them too. So discussion with both, I'll give 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 this a try because I don't want to say it's only 18,000, but I'll approve a one-year contract . I want to see if it does what it says or what they say it's going to do. And then after that I'll keep my eye on it. But I'm okay with a supplemental piece like this. Maybe we could have talked about it more because we didn't -- it was just brought to us. We had to ask for an explanation . It should have been done beforehand . We should have had a caucus before it was introduced. But I'm still happy that we had the caucus. I'll support this with some reservation . I'll keep my eye on it. And then we'll see next year when there's a renewal. If it pans out and it bears some fruit and it helps our brave firefighters and police officers , it's wonderful and maybe we'll extend it. But if it doesn't then we'll have a second look or take a second thought on it. So all those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : The ayes have it and so moved. Please dispense with the reading of the minutes, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A.

CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE MONTH ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2023. MR. MCANDREW : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: Yes, I have one. On Saturday , October 21st at 12 p.m. at 1141 Capouse Avenue in Scranton , there is going to be an axe throwing fundraiser for Warrior Strong organization . It's $40 per player. That helps the veterans , veteran family members and first responders find community and camaraderie through health and wellness so they overcome the sense of detachment and disconnection and isolation that they often experience in civilian life. So that's this Saturday , 21st at 12 p.m. That's all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 announcement or two. First tomorrow , Wednesday , Boscov's will be holding its annual friends helping friends charity shopping day. That's going to take place from all day from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. And if you donate $5 -- you'll be donating $5 to one of 61 participating local nonprofit s and receive a $25 percent off shopping pass that could be used almost anywhere in the store. And some of the organization s that are participating include The Friends of the Scranton Public Library , Dress For Success Lackawanna and Friends of the Poor. And the second announcement I want to make, this Saturday , the NAACP of Lackawanna County will be hosting their inaugural Freedom Fund Gala. And that's going to be taking place at Fiorelli 's starting at 6 p.m. So you could go online to purchase tickets if you are interested in attending that. That's all. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? MR. KING: Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, sir.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. KING: So first off, I want to thank you all for your support . As you know unfortunately I was unable to attend the meeting last week due to a medical procedure . I'm still recovering from that procedure . I feel fortunate that I'm able to participate remotely this evening . But I want to thank all of you for your well wishes and your support . And the other thing I would like to do is thank all of our local volunteers who helped support the 26th Annual Steamtown Marathon which happened on October 8th -- Sunday, October 8th. It was a great success . We brought runners in from all over the United States, close to 1,000 runners. It was a huge success . We raised funds for St. Joseph's Center. So we're happy to do that. And we're happy to support the local economy here in the city by bringing those runners from all over the country . So that's about it for right now. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And I have one quick announcement . So at the Marketplace at Steamtown , Sunday, October 29, 2023 starting at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 1 p.m. There's a hunt, a Halloween egg hunt and search for several golden tickets , special prizes, money and Art Haus movie tickets . And then there's a parade at 1:30. Trick or treaters will parade throughout the Marketplace . Prizes will be awarded for best costume . First prize $100, two second runners up for $50 and then after that there will be a party. Following the parade there will be a DJ and karaoke at center court, $50 prize for the best singer. And there will be free gift bags for the first 300 kids. Well, it sounds like a really nice time for our community . And so next we'll have -- wait a second. We just have Citizens Participation . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. MCANDREW : So first up we have Mr. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: First thing I have here is, you know, probably the City, the Council , ECTV and the Mayor are probably going to answer my complaint to the federal government to the federal court this week or relatively sooner, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 do a motion to dismiss . But I think we're going to have a really great time. And I just hope that all you guys stick around and enjoy yourselves because I think it's really important for people to understand that they have rights. And I think that government should respect those rights even though the Council and the Mayor don't respect those rights. And we've created a propaganda channel with ECTV. Hopefully in the end we'll get all the answers I asked for here of the Council and we'll remove the Board of Director s of ECTV and the station manager . And maybe we'll lose the Mayor and the Council when this is all done when the people have a good idea what's taking place. And I think that the resident s of Scranton should really consider organizing a group and doing something about all the flooding in the city and suing the city and suing the Council and maybe the Mayor and the Rec Authority for what's happened at Nay Aug Park in removal of the slide because you could talk to this Council until you just lay down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 dead on the ground and nothing will happen for you. And when I see all of these yard signs throughout the city I wonder are there this many policemen or firemen or DPW workers or teachers in this city that could push such flawed candidates on an electorate over decades and decades and cause the destruction of a city and not even look over their shoulder ? And the second thing I have here today is, you know, I don't -- we want a gay pride flag outside for a month. I really think the Israeli flag should be flying over the -- under the American flag. And I just think that the President of the United States is responsible for the war that's taking place in the Middle East because of his patronage of Iran. I mean, considering that now it's in discussion s that John Kerry was sharing classified information with the Iranians to try to get a deal for the climate czar. And you just take a look at all the pain and suffering . And we've named things after Joe Biden in the city that should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 stripped . I mean, we've got a president that's caused so much pain and suffering in his pullout in Afghanistan and just abandoned American s, and now we find that the weapons that they left behind there they're using on Israelis now. And we have to ask ourself as a people because we listen to all the silly stuff that the Democrats have said over my entire lifetime . Don't forget, Joe Biden said if you ain't -- you ain't black if you don't vote for Joe Biden. Look at all the damage he's done to our country . And it just continues . And now I think he's over there trying to tell the Israelis that maybe they shouldn 't go over there and take Gaza. It's a shame when a country so small has to be the leader of the free world because we've advocate d that role just by what our presidents done. He might be the antichrist walking this earth to be honest with you with everything he's done to this country , you know, stop drilling , green technology , exporting jobs, you know, borrowing trillions and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 trillions of dollars , stepping up to the podium and lying about almost everything he says to the American people and the media just doesn't care. Anything you fact check that he says is almost every bit of it is a lie. And look where we are as a country . And then when you look at what's going on with these people in Israel where they were, I don't know, had their stomach ripped out and the baby ripped out of them, shot in the back, had their kids raped in front of them and then shoot the parents , this is all his doing. He's been a terrible ally and a terrible leader. And I think the American people should stand up for once and speak their mind, not just here but everywhere because this stuff happened 75 years ago in Europe. And the American Jews knew they were killing the Jews in Europe. And they were living too good and just ignored it. And listen to what Frank Rosen said when he did the interview when he took his in-laws to the death camps and he told them not to go there. It's just amazing what's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 still going on in this world. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Next up, Mr. Mike Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council . Let's get back to local stuff because it's easier to fix a pothole than it is to fix something nationally , at least most of the time here in Scranton. I have two questions for this body today. Explain to me the Right to Know Act. I filed a right to know request last Wednesday for all documents pertaining to the sale of the Scranton Parking Authority and the Scranton Sewer Authority , the same document s that were received by WNEP and other media outlets . I was told today that I'm going to find out tomorrow . Is it five days or five business days? And then after that, is it 30 days or 30 business days? MR. MCANDREW : So, Mike, what I have here in front of me is a response someone else asked last week. Maybe it was you. The city right to know policy is response within five days with a 30-day extension if additional investigation is needed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. MANCINI : So as of today, they didn't provide me with the necessary information so they're in violation . Next question , did this body send the letter to the Mayor requesting the audit through the State Auditor General 's office for Parking Authority and the Sewer Authority ? MR. MCANDREW : So what I have here in response to your inquiry last week we sent a request -- no, there has been a request sent to the Scranton Sewer Authority for an update -- no, I'm sorry, this is a different one. Let me see -- we received -- oh, the request for the forensic audit for the Scranton Sewer Authority sale on December 31st, 2016 is under review and correspondence will be sent to the PA Auditor General and/or PA Attorney General as warranted . MR. MANCINI : So it's as warranted . So it's up to the Mayor to actually send out that information ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, as of right now the request was sent out to administration . This is the response we have. I can speak to it a little bit. So, you know, after you asked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 last week I do remember that was a request by both the school district and this body I remember . And I remember the response we got was they were busy. They didn't have the manpower to do it. And in addition to that, we couldn't request -- this is how I remember it. I could be wrong. We couldn't request . The Sewer Authority itself would have to request that audit of themselves . MR. MANCINI : So is that actually going to be followed through and sent to the Auditor General 's office or are we just -- MR. MCANDREW : Well, so we got a response . I'll make sure it's followed through . MR. MANCINI : From the Mayor's office. MR. MCANDREW : Correct . The response we got was from city administration . So we'll give them a couple of days. And then we'll follow up and see if it took place. MR. MANCINI : So because here's my question , right, how many attorneys does it take to close the Sewer Authority and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 answer was 50; 3.1 million dollars , okay. As opposed to do a forensic audit, all the Mayor has to do is grab the box for the Scranton Parking Authority , Scranton Sewer Authority and take a look at it and make an informed decision . It doesn't take 50 people to put in a light bulb, all right? And at the end of the day, Limerick Township , Montgomery County sold the same type of water system, water treatment system that we did, 71.1 million dollars , 40 percent of what we sold ours for approximately , two law firms, $200,000. All right, so we're looking at, what, almost 2.5 million dollars possibly that was just thrown at people for no particular reason. All right. When you have a disgraced Mayor who receives funds from a law firm and then funnels two closings to that same law firm and he said it himself at his town hall meeting in a matter of five minutes . All right, transparency , Madam Mayor, at the end of the day we're only as good as we surround ourselves with. And it's up to you to make this decision based upon what you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 see in front of you. Do the right thing because this city is not what I envision it at being when I was a young child, all right? So many things have changed , blight in neighborhood s, all right, people just giving up on themselves, all right, and then having tax bills that are through the roof. The majority of it again, of course, is the Scranton School District 60 percent of the face is the tax bill. All right, at the end of the day it's a matter of what we do. An audit can be done if it's requested properly . Please do the right thing. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you Mr. Mancini. So next up is Mr. Mark Scarinci . MR. SCARINCI : Good evening , Council . Before I get to the city stuff that I would like to talk about, I just want to make a brief comment if I will about the situation in the Middle East. MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, sir, would you please step closer to the microphone . They're having trouble hearing you out here. Thank you very much. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. SCARINCI : So before I get to the city issues, I just want to make a quick comment on the Middle East. And I want to touch on what the Chief said over here earlier today. So the Chief said something about PTSD. And I know a little bit about Post-traumatic Stress Disorder . And the key to that is to be alert beforehand of shocking information . And the shocking information is that this country is going to go to war soon. And we're going to be aligned with Israel. And I just want to say before you and this Scranton -- because they're going to have sons and daughters on the ships and everything like that. We are the most technology advanced country in the world. And we will outsmart the enemy and we will prevail the enemy. And when President Biden, our hometown hero goes to Israel tomorrow and looks Netanyahu in the eye, he's going to say I'm with you. And we are going to change the Middle East together . And we're going to establish dominance there. And we will reign there for 1,000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 years. So just be aware that we are going to outsmart them. We have the technology . We're going to win technologywise . It's going to be about three and a half years. But we're going to come out on top. All right, now, Council , I got to tell you something about this thing. Last week I was over here, okay. And so, Council , please, you got to do something because there's this noise -- now it doesn't work. Oh, yes, it does. Mute. This is the parking garage, not Mulberry Tower parking garage. This is the city parking garage. And it won't stop until that gate comes down, Council . We cannot sleep, Council . We're going nuts over there. MR. MCANDREW : So you brought this to us last week. I don't want to take up your time but I have a response to your inquiry . MR. SCARINCI : Yeah, what was their response ? You said, oh, we can't help you that's Mulberry -- MR. MCANDREW : No, I didn't say that. We didn't say that. MR. SCARINCI : Yes, you did.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. MCANDREW : Okay, maybe we can help you if you give me a chance here. So ABM is reviewing the gate and warning alarm on Mulberry Street exit for sound adjustment . So you were heard along with the alarm. So we'll get back to you. MR. SCARINCI : All right. So, I guess, you know, it's not going to be done in the five days. But I guess they're not going to drag their feet on this for, you know, five months, right? ABM is going to look at this in the next three weeks or three days or -- MR. MCANDREW : No, it didn't give me a timetable . But we got a response from them. MR. SCARINCI : It's a step in the right direction . MR. MCANDREW : Keep an eye on it for us and we'll touch base. MR. SCARINCI : If you could just do something , maybe lower it or something . So I'll check back with you in three weeks because -- MR. MCANDREW : I don't know about three weeks but okay. MR. SCARINCI : So, okay, and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 second thing that I want to talk about is I really want to get five minutes with the Mayor. The only closest I got to the Mayor was through Isiah. And all I want to talk to the Mayor is about these air horns, Council . So, you know, when I was a little boy, I used to watch that Twilight Zone. And I remember one episode the guy is sleeping and the cruise ship is coming through his bedroom window at 2:00 in the morning . And that's what happened with these fire engines that go -- with the firefighters that go crazy at 2:00 in the morning . They go air horn happy on that air horn. And it feels like a cruise ship is coming through my bedroom window. So I want to know is it possible that the Mayor could put these kind of signs within a 100 foot radius of Mulberry Tower, something like this so that there is no air horn? Have some mercy, Council . That's all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. Next up, Mr. Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta . Another Mr. King no show? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. MCANDREW : He's participating by phone right now. MR. ARGENTA : The City of Scranton had a vacant lot for sale 513 Lackawanna Avenue. Two bidders bid on this lot. Bidder number one bid $37,500 with a long range full business plan to enhance the downtown , save and refurbish a long-standing historical Scranton building using all private funding . Bidder number two bid $25,000, has no long-term plan, presented no business plan for the property but is politically connected . You would think it's no-brainer . Bidder number two won the bid. You want to check with the SRA, Scranton Redevelopment Authority . Ask for reasoning in why they accepted the worst possible bid when the meeting agenda had recommended them to vote for bidder number one which was the better deal. It's not just that it's the right thing to do, how are you allowed to take the worst deal for the city and its citizens ? It's not just that it's the right thing to do, how are you allowed to take the worst deal when you have an administration that professes all about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 transparent . Well, I have been in real estate development my entire life. This deal is less than transparent . Highest bidder with the best plan wins in the real world but not in Scranton ? Which brings me to the next issue, city grants. What are the guidelines ? Who gets them? Where are they advertised so the normal Tom, Dick, or Harry could apply for them and get or is it not part of how city funds are released ? How are they publicized when they're disbursed ? And why does it always seem that it's just the people that are politically connected that get the grants? Do these city grants have a timeframe ? Are they interest -bearing accounts ? Are they transferable with the sale of a property ? Are they auditing them? And if so, who is overseeing the auditing process of these city grants? One grantee received $750,000. That's three-quarters of a million dollars . And we are lucky if 10,000 worth of work was done to this whole property . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 So my question is, who keeps track of this? Who's keeping track of his property at the beach? And why aren't any of these grants being used for people who desperate ly need them? There were people in here two weeks ago regarding Keyser Valley flooding . The Mayor had the audacity to tell them that there are loans available at 7 percent interest rate. When today in the newspaper they are bragging about spending $500,000 to help a private business pay off its loans. Imagine what $500,000 could do to help the flood victims , to the people who had lived and supported Scranton their entire life, not people who moved here from New York five years ago that don't know how to run their business and don't live in the City of Scranton . Now in conclusion , please get out and be an educated voter. Vote for people that genuinely care about the city who have lived here their whole life and want to make change for their neighborhoods including those sixth graders they went to school with. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 These sixth graders are here paying taxes and paying your salaries . These same sixth graders all think for themselves . They're no one's puppets . They are Scranton strong. Another issue, Friday night we had another brutal fight at the stadium . Are we ever going to address that? I know it's a school district 's part, but everybody deserves to be safe and work with the police department . It's about time that somebody works together and gets things done here. We have three homeless guys threw a women in the river two weeks ago who was bringing food. Anybody address that? You might want to look into that because you all seem to think that it's okay for the homeless people to be in our town. Where are we at with the fire billing ? Do we have any update on that? MR. MCANDREW : We do not. MR. ARGENTA : And I would like to ask for item number G is an introduction to a resolution that maybe we could table that until we get some clarification on a certain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 individual who's got some issues with licensing . And as of today, the rumor is swirling that there's a bench warrant out for that same individual . So in order to do the right thing, maybe we should just table that until we have our affairs in order. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Mr. Voldenberg , can you, please reach out to the police department and inquire about three homeless people throwing a women in the river who brought them food? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. That's horrific and it needs to be addressed . It needs to be known too. MR. ARGENTA : (Inaudible .) MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next up Miss Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Mr. McAndrew , maybe I wasn't paying attention , but did you start the meeting with roll call? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Did you? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, good. I want to thank you, Council and the Mayor for the letter that was sent requesting a meeting with the County Commissioners and the school district regarding the flooding tax relief for those people that were affected . I know that this is not going to solve all of their problems , but I don't want to see them having to do what my parents had to do, pay taxes on a condemned building for five years. And I think that's a good way to begin and also to get all the taxing authorities talking together . Also, more good news, I saw on the city's website that the delinquent refuse fee database has been updated as of September 30th. The bad news is total amount that's owed is now up to, like, 11.8 million dollars but at least the information is available to the city and the citizens . The firefighters contract that was suppose d to be on the website after 120 days, it's 196 days. And Ufberg was paid 22,900 in September . Are they still dotting I's and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 crossing T's on that document ? MR. MCANDREW : So what I have here in front of me is that, of course, we sent a request to city administration for information from City Labor Counsel on when the CBA may appear on the city website . As of today we received nothing , right, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MS. HODOWANITZ : So it's going to be when? MR. MCANDREW : We don't know. And I'm with you on this, believe me. So, you know, send it again. This is unacceptable . MS. HODOWANITZ : I mean, all the union contract s should on the website because city employees are paid by tax dollars and those should be public documents . MR. MCANDREW : Well, every school district has them on their website . I'm just saying we should do the same. I agree. MS. HODOWANITZ : I understand . I was originally told that they needed 120 days to, you know, tidy up the document s and get it all the -- you know, things into one document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 instead of this piece and that piece. It's been 196 days and no end in sight. And I suspect the same thing is going to happen with the police contract which was signed -- arbitrated in July. Now the DPW contract went on very quickly . So I don't know what's going on. What's the status of the 2022 audit? MR. MCANDREW : So also request was sent to the Scranton Sewer Authority for an update on the 2022 audit and a tentative date for emergency meeting , the SSA Board for approval of the audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : When is the emergency meeting ? MR. MCANDREW : We didn't -- did we get anything back on this too? MR. VOLDENBERG : No date as of yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : You give me the date and I'll go down there and kick ass and take names so-to-speak. MR. MCANDREW : You'll be the first to know when we find out. MS. HODOWANITZ : Item 7-A, the loan with Hi-Fidelity contract , I asked last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 which was the true cost, Borwick 's cited $24,599.84. The Business Administrator says it's $23,389. Do we know? MR. MCANDREW : Do we know that for sure? Did we get that back? MS. HODOWANITZ : You may not want to pass that until you know what you're paying. MR. VOLDENBERG : The difference in the two amounts is due to a 6 percent sales tax. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, so it's actually the higher amount. MR. VOLDENBERG : The higher amount. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : But I'm waiting to see if that disqualifies the bid. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, well, that's up to you if you want to pass it tonight . Item 5-G, the appointment of Selina Andiappan for the Land Bank. Why wasn't her resume included in the backup? MR. MCANDREW : It should have been. MS. HODOWANITZ : You might want to have that added for next week and put it in Third Order.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MS. HODOWANITZ : Item 3-C, the list for the pilots, I think somebody should have really looked hard at that list and scrubbed it. There are a couple duplications like St. Vladimir 's twice, St. Francis of Assisi closed a few years ago. And the emergency declaration I see two dates, 3-E says October 20th and 5-B says October 13th, so which is it? MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MS. HODOWANITZ : Two different issues? So we're going to see new legislation next week to extend the -- MR. MCANDREW : Correct . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Next up we have Mr. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council , how did I get riled up about these despicable jackals from Gaza and the former Americans that are there. They are supporters of these people. And they ought to stay there and rot as far as I'm concerned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 A year or so ago I stood here whining about WNEP's taxes. They were lowered as you remember . Glenmaura, theirs were lowered . I think Glenmaura as from $800,000 to 200 and some thousand . These properties that I spoke, of they were worth over -- they were appraise d at 400 million and you people just allow the tax reductions left and right. Now we got a city full of these developers that may have been kissing their rear end for the last couple years and they have turned on us. They have shown their true colors if you ask me. Downtown does look good. It's a big improvement but these are wealthy businesses . And now after Bulzoni 's grants and loan abatements and loan forgiveness and tax abatement s that he all advocated in the past, they just forget all the good. And you cannot give into these tax reductions . What are they going to do, force us to take the dollar parking garage back? And, you know, I think what we need is another Janet Evans really. She went -- she went out and tried for the people of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 city. There is no one else seems interested . No one goes to the colleges , all of these phoney non-profits . We got a -- we got some no English speaking women dictating terms to the school board about closing schools . I had a teacher tell me at Sheetz one night last year she quit. She said I have children in there, have no intentions of ever learning . They don't speak English at home. She said they wear the same clothes for three, four days because no one will get up. We have to feed them breakfast and lunch. She said it's just -- it was too much for her. What are you people interested in in our government ? I saw in today's paper all the problems going on in this area. They're worried about eight pickleball courts. One of them would be so noisy you'll have nothing but complaints . I saw that on national television a couple weeks ago. It makes a tremendous noise. Are these courts worth someone losing their home, their most precious things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 and there's nobody to help people here. How many people could afford an attorney to try to get their taxes reduced? And I phoned one. He told me 1,500 to 3,000. He doesn't know anything about my finances and so forth. They're going to raise taxes because of the reassessment . And you lose people and others would be stuck like I am. They'll be stuck paying. My taxes right now are three times what they were 25 years ago and that's not enough for the city. You know, the waiver queen downstairs , her administration , she lets them live wherever they want. I'm stuck here like a lot of you people out there, not the ones listening. What can we do? Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next up Mr. Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, Keyser Valley flood zone. I was reading this study on the flooding in Keyser Valley. I had hoped that all of you Council members have read the study too, you know, what's going on there. Included in the study was pictures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 of the flooding . It was copies of the newspaper from November of 1959. And I'm telling you those pictures looked identical to the pictures of what just happened last month in 2023. I mean, people get rescued in boats. The pictures of the flood waters half way up their houses. I can't believe this has been going on so long. And I've been in this for 10 years now. But other residents there have said that, oh, this has been going on 40, 50 years now. Well, when from those newspaper copies in 1959 it's actually 60 years of flooding . Oh, my God, don't you think something should be done by now? You know, what Gary DiBileo , the Keyser Valley Neighborhood Association President has arranged to have a walk around meeting in the neighborhood to take a look at the remaining devastation that's there. I understand that he asked the Council members . Is Mr. King hearing this right now? Okay, well, I want to ask I know that Gary DiBileo is asking Council members to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 come and do this walk around to see devastation . I understand that Mr. McAndrew is coming. I understand that Tom Schuster is coming. How about the rest of you guys? Are you -- do you care enough to spend a little time and come and see the devastation , just give me a yes or no. Mr. Smurl? MR. SCHUSTER : Just so you know, Mr. Srebro, I don't know if Gary DiBileo talked with Mr. Smurl. He did talk with myself though and I agreed to come to the meeting on Thursday . MR. SREBRO: So he's coming. MR. SCHUSTER : I'm coming to the meeting on Thursday . I'm not sure if Mr. DiBileo reached out. MR. SREBRO: Okay. I know you're coming. That's what I was told. MR. MCANDREW : And am I as well. It is an actual meeting ? MR. SREBRO: Come to the neighborhood , walk around just a block or two and see the devastation . MR. MCANDREW : Because we were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 informed that it's a meeting in addition to walking around. If it's a meeting , only two -- we can't have more than two of us present at a meeting if you understand that. MR. SREBRO: I'm not sure it's considered a meeting . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. That could be clarified . That could be clarified . DR. ROTHCHILD : I didn't receive an invite, but if I had I would have responded yes. MR. SREBRO: Thank you for caring. DR. ROTHCHILD : If I'm able to with the Sunshine Act. We'll have to clear that. MR. SREBRO: So, Mr. McAndrew , are you coming? MR. MCANDREW : I'm coming, sure. MR. SREBRO: Okay. Thank you for caring. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I'm coming. MR. SMURL: I need to be told where it's at. That's all. MR. SREBRO: Right there. You can't miss it. MR. SMURL: And when it is.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. SREBRO: Look for the flooded houses. And what about Mr. King then? MR. KING: I'm still in recovery from a medical procedure , so unfortunately , I'm not able to attend at this time. But I'll gladly -- MR. SREBRO: Okay. I understand about the medical procedure . Then I'm hoping somehow you're going to follow up on it, look into it, ask questions , whatever like that. Okay. Thank you. That will be this Thursday at 4:30. Hopefully everybody is done with their work for the day. All right. You know, in reading the study one of the biggest things they recommended was in the proposed improvements that it said the best option is to study that -- in the study is to fix that 24 inch pipe that everybody got a lot of information on. Now, I just learned that they sent a camera down the 36 inch pipe at the corner of Dewy and Lafayette and they found that pipe to be broken now. So maybe check into that. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. Next up is Mrs. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : The clock is going. I haven't started to speak yet. Is that when it starts at the podium? Sorry, I thought it started when I started to speak. Anyway, Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And it's good to be back after travelling . But it's good to be back in the city. And in my travels, I do see every city has its issues whether they're small cities or big cities, they all have their issues. So when you come home and you hear and see a lot of things, that Scranton 's not so bad after all. One of the things that I wanted to talk about tonight -- and I did hear while I was away that there was a grant that was issued I guess for the street signs. And so being that I wasn't here to hear all of that I did go online and to pull the resolution and the grant papers that were online about the grant that was in place for $668,911 for the Scranton Street Signs Project . As I was reading through it, it says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 they will concentrate efforts on signs listed as poor and that it goes onto talk about the different three segments of assessment s and all. So I just got more confused as I was reading this. So then it did go back and to change it from listed the street signs as poor. And they will replaced and slashed install new street signs. So they are replacing as well as installing . And I guess the installing word is that they're missing , you know, because I kept looking for the word missing in this documentation . I did not see it. So as we talked about -- as this information talked about the grant, of course, it -- I have questions how long does it take for a grant. I've been in Scranton now six and a half years. I'm going for seven years and that's when I started to notice just the poor condition of the street signs because I kept getting lost. And so that is the first time that I approached Council about the lack of street signs. So I'm just hoping that this grant that I'm reading about isn't going to take another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 six and a half or seven years before it is put into place. One of the things that the -- that as I was reading this and it was very informative for me anyway, and it said that the city completed an assessment during the first phase of this project . The sign replacement and installation are in the second phase. And we're moving forward to the final phase which was identifying misspelling words -- it says sins -- in the City of Scranton that are listed as poor condition and in need of replacement. It's my understanding when I went down to DPW that there was a database already with over 8,000 entries in it. So I don't understand why they can't use that information to get started and why we have to do another phase. So maybe you could just answer for me just how long does it take or how long will it be before the street signs are done or, you know, in place. I thought I had read that there was an RFQ out on it and that they were going for a vendor to work on the street signs but I wasn't able to find any information on that online and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 maybe I just wasn't putting the right search words in for it. But, you know, one of the things that I think one of the speakers from a few weeks ago spoke about was that there is a way to, you know, cover the street signs with some kind of sticker or something or other. Maybe that would be more economical . I don't know. I'm not in that business and maybe it would be something that they could look into. One of the things that was a great piece of information -- I don't know who did the narrative on it was Exhibit A that was online and it talked about -- and it gave a full explanation of all the paperwork that I did print off about the street signs. So I'm just hoping that moving forward that the final phase really is the final phase and that the final phase is the grant. And I'm just hoping that that's what that is. And also with the city and the condition of our City of Scranton , is the wall there on Lackawanna Avenue. You know, I would just like to know a status of that. It's crumbling day by day, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 week by week, it continues to crumble. And the trash pickup on Lackawanna Avenue, the bins are just overflow ing with trash. And just one other thing real quick if I could just piggyback on what Dr. Rothchild said about the NAACP banquet this weekend , and there will be tickets at the door or (inaudible ) and that is October -- October 21st at 6:00 at Fiorelli 's. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , can you please reach out to DPW and administration about the grant, a timeline for that and then the sign project itself. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That exhausted our list if anybody else would like to speak? MS. KOLOSKI : Hi, Doris Koloski , Hill Section resident . This addresses kind of a blight complaint . I brought this up to Mr. King when he was at the Hebrew Hill Neighborhood Association meeting about the dishes. The satellite dishes all over these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 houses. On my block alone, one house in the middle has seven satellite dishes. It's a house that has four apartments . It has seven satellite dishes on the front of it and the roof and one big one down in the lawn in the front. I thought maybe Council could do something with Direct TV to where if they are going to -- if their customer s are going to put up the dishes that when they disconnect they come and get them because it's all over the Hill. You could see them as you're driving around. They really look disgust ing. So the guys that owns that one house on my block, he had said that he -- he's got it right now he's taking the porches down. He's remodeling . And I asked him to please take down whatever dishes he could take. I think the ones on the roof they're afraid to put a hole in the roof. But the ones in the front he said he would tell -- ask the contractors to take them down. But he informs me that when the person buys from Direct -- when they hook up with Direct TV he thinks that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 they actually buy the dish because Direct TV doesn't want to come back out for them. And so they own the dish so when they move, the dishes are still there. So I don't know. I think maybe the city could do something with Direct TV to kind of change that because it really looks horrible . Okay, so that's the one thing. The other thing I wanted to bring up is about that curb cutting that never happened. When I called DPW about the curb on Olive Street and Colfax and the other one on East Gibson and Colfax, they told me they don't do it that it's whoever the city had hired. So if you could just check on that again and winter is coming now so we probably have to put it off again for another year. But it would be nice to be able to go up and down it instead of going around in the road especially now when it's dark. Also I noticed -- and I'm sorry because I didn't write down the name of the block. I thought I'd remember it. But when you drive over Wheeler Avenue going towards Riccardo 's Market if anybody knows where that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 is, I'm sure Jerry does. There's a stop sign at one of the intersection s that the tree is blocking it. I mean, I know it's there because I go there all the time but other people that's new to the city may not see it until they're on top of it. So if somebody takes a ride down there maybe they could notice it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Which intersection is that? Which intersection ? Is it Wheeler -- MS. KOLOSKI : That's the problem . I can't remember if it's Wheeler Avenue -- DR. ROTHCHILD : East Gibson? MS. KOLOSKI : It's -- I'm trying to think. It's Wheeler Avenue and it's not Ash Street where it goes around where the light is. It might be the -- you know where you go around for Prescott School? I think it's that one. I can't think of the block. There is also one on Ash Street that when you come straight up Ash Street and you're between Taylor maybe and Prescott , there's another one that is real low that sometimes people might miss. But I think the tree is down from there. But I'm not positive because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I just know they're there so I stop. The other day I was almost on top of it and I thought , oh, my God, you know? DR. ROTHCHILD : We'll ask for DPW to get out there and check out the trees. MS. KOLOSKI : And then I just have one other question . I hear people come here saying they can't talk to the Mayor. Now, I know I talked to the Mayor because she was having these lunch things on her lunch hour, some kind of teas or coffee because I went to one. Of course, I don't see them advertised anymore. Are they still doing that where people could just go in and talk to her like a certain day? So if they could maybe find out maybe if you could find out from the Mayor possibly then when somebody else comes in and says we can't talk to her. We can't talk to her. If they're still doing that, find out where it's printed out. I think I had seen it in the newspaper the time I went. I believe that was, like, last year. Time goes so fast it could have been two years, you know? Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , city resident . First, I'd like to thank whoever got the paving done between the end of Mountain Lake Road and Derby Avenue is having it go over that four times a day it's much nicer and it should have been done that way in the very beginning . On 3-A, did any of you compare it with last year, any of those collections ? Are we ahead of last year or are we repeating last year? No? Okay. On 3-C, the pilots, that is so anemic. How did -- how many letters were sent out? We have -- I didn't have time last week to get it -- yesterday and today to get how many. MR. MCANDREW : I don't know. I forget. I counted them last week. I don't have that in front of me. But maybe it was like 77, I believe . Maybe it's more than that, 177, I think. Well, they're here if you count. But only seven actually participated which is unfortunate . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, that's pretty 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 anemic response . Are we going to follow up with the telephone calls? MR. MCANDREW : I'm not aware of what the process is with the city. We can inquire . MS. SCHUMACHER : Can you find out and tell us next week? MR. MCANDREW : Sure. Mr. Voldenberg , take care of that, would you? Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : And I have to go on the street signs. We had -- in my area we had a lot of postings for a missing dog. And on our way coming home from school we saw the missing dog and we called in. And then today we found that they were able to trap the dog and return it to the people who owned it. And my young friend who comes here with me sometimes was being a gentleman and he asked the woman if she would like him to go back and take down all the signs that said there was a missing dog. So we spent about an hour and a half this afternoon taking down the signs. And a lot of street signs are really bad. I can't wait for it to be done again. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Now, in July, the Planning Commission approve d the plans to build a convenience and -- station and gas station at 1130 to 36 Moosic Street. That was a Wawa if that's how you pronounce it. I don't know. I've never been in a W-A-W-A store. But what's happening to it? Does anybody know? Have there been licenses to do any demolition or actually build the thing? MR. MCANDREW : I don't know. We could probably get an update on that for you. I'm not sure to be honest with you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. Oh, yeah, the pilots. What about Serrenti ? Has that just fallen off the list? MR. MCANDREW : We did receive somewhat of an update with regards to where they're at. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. There was not much of an update. So I'll have to follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : The last time the Chief was in I think the money that was in the capital budget it -- don't quote me on it right now but it was around 250,000. It was going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 to -- well, I know it was going to refurbish the classrooms there. But that was the last update we got on that building . MS. SCHUMACHER : We're suppose d to be making revenue from that place too. How much have we collected so far? MR. MCANDREW : I don't think -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Probably zip, yeah. Okay, I guess I'll quit there for tonight . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I saw the request for a discussion following the September flooding . It's nice we're having discussions about flooding to see whether or not we could actually give tax relief to people. You know what would be really inspiring ? If this body could create an ordinance themselves and put forward an ordinance before the election that said for a year or two years, the City of Scranton -- I'm not talking about the school board. I'm not talking about the county. I'm talking about this jurisdiction would say to those people who are impacted on it we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 giving you tax forgiveness for those two years or a year, something . This body has the power to put forth ordinances itself. It doesn't have to wait for the Mayor to propose something . It doesn't have to wait for it to go through the legal department and everything else. This body has its own attorney . And this body can under its own wisdom say this is the right thing to do and say that these people deserve not a bill (inaudible ) for a ten year tax abatement . But a person who was devastated in their home and whether they are evicted from it or suffering great damage from it should not be under the burden of taxes for one or two years. It's an exception . I understand that. But I think the population of Scranton would stand behind that exception and wouldn't challenge it because it's humanitarian and it's the right thing to do. It doesn't stink of greed. It's been 133 days since the Council introduced creating the overtime reports . I've heard that DPW is working -- they're working on a plan with DPW to come into alignment with what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 police department does and the fire department does. But the ordinance that was put here before this body was not just about DPW. It was about the entire city. It was about every city worker here in this body who does overtime needs to record it. That includes the administration . That includes Licensing and Inspection . That includes everyone , not just DPW, not just the fire department and the police department who are in compliance with that, which we already know. Why is it taking $133 for feedback , obviously because no answer is forthcoming . Now, for -- I have a question for Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Sure. MR. COYNE: I've looked forward and you've pointed out that Jesus and what's right and wrong often on the dais. During Covid and now with increase d utility costs, support of the safety net is even more critical . We have given $45,000 to agencies who direct -- do direct food for survival at the same time giving double that to a bar, quadruple that for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 a study on walking , seven times that amount for electric cars and 25 times that for park studies . And what I mean by park studies is park improvement studies that are now racked up just in studies $1,140,129 compare d to $45,000 we've handed out to agencies that keep our population fed and hand out food for Thanksgiving so people could survive . Is there not something that this body can do and you can do to push forward to get more spending out of faith for those who are in need? And second, not a lot of grants have been voted down. But sometime s you have struck down grants. And some people have said your resistance is obstructionary to some of the free money. I'd like you to talk to -- about the -- why once a grant comes up that you have an argument with it why you would obstruct that from going forward . What is your reasoning behind even though it's free money sometimes we shouldn 't be spending it. Thank you and I hope to get your answer in Fifth Order. MR. MCANDREW : Sure. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 MR. LAFRANCE : Good evening , Council , thanks for having me, Pat LaFrance , city resident . I was here last week and I asked about a law that was passed in November of 2022 about ordinances and what a homeowner is, a duplex in the city. Has anybody looked into that or heard anything ? MR. MCANDREW : Did we get a response as of yet? MR. VOLDENBERG : That request was sent out to Licensing and Inspections , specifically Mr. Tom Oleski. We did pull the ordinance . And from a Council standpoint Mr. LaFrance is correct . So we're just waiting on an answer. MR. LAFRANCE : All right. And in the meantime while I'm waiting on an answer, I got 15 days to reply to that denial. And it's going to cost me $300 of my money that I'm not going to get back. That I'm going to go and somebody 's going to say, yeah, that's right. You're right. There's the law right there but because of somebody 's opinion ; and you know what, all right, I'm going to -- I know I should do it but I don't want to; but I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 hoping Council could help me out tonight . I received a letter from the Department of Licensing , Inspections and Permits . I received this letter on October 7th. It was dated Harrisburg , October 5th. It was dated on the letter September 28th. Can I bring this up to you and show you this? MR. MCANDREW : Sure. So the line you're referring is 726 Pleasant Avenue, Peckville sent via US certified and regular mail. MR. LAFRANCE : That's a city document that pertains to me. That's between me and the city. Why is that address even on there? MR. MCANDREW : I do not know. Would you be okay with leaving -- not leaving this but having a copy made -- MR. LAFRANCE : Absolutely . Absolutely . MR. MCANDREW : -- that Kathy can do it later? MR. LAFRANCE : Absolutely , yeah. MR. MCANDREW : I'll let the other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Council persons look at it. We'll take a look at that for you, definitely . DR. ROTHCHILD : Do you have something else you want us to look at? MR. LAFRANCE : No, I don't -- I don't have anything else. I'm going to say it. What's happening to me is a shakedown in this city. What's happening to me right now is something personal from somebody . And I don't like it. And I'm going to have to put $300 of my own money down to fight somebody about something personal that has nothing to do with this city. By the way, Mr. Smurl, I never met you. You have my respect as a Council person. You have my respect as a business person. And you have my utmost respect for where you live. That was my paper route when I was a kid. And I appreciate what you're doing to the neighborhood there. But as a contractor , can I ask you, if I wanted to divert my way around the city license and zoning permits and I wanted to come and get a permit to work on my house from you, how much would you charge me? MR. SMURL: If you wanted me to pull 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 a permit for you? MR. LAFRANCE : Yeah, you're a contractor in the City of Scranton , right? MR. SMURL: Right. MR. LAFRANCE : So if I came up to you and I say, Mr. Smurl, I need a permit for my house, how much would you charge me to go and get me a permit and let me do the work on my house with your name on it for your contracting business . MR. SMURL: I would not. MR. LAFRANCE : You wouldn't do that. I appreciate that answer. It's an honest answer. The city needs to look into what's going on with me. MR. SMURL: I did see that the address on top of there, I did see that on occasion that it came up because they use Lackawanna County base. I've seen that come up on other things with multiple address es on it. I'm not saying that's what that is. But that's the first thing that came to my mind. I've seen other document s that have gone out from licensing and inspections . And they have mailed it out to different because it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 a different owner. But I don't know how long you've owned that house. I don't know where that came from. MR. LAFRANCE : How long I've owned the house? Oh, I've owned the house since 2005. Before I owned the house, I know the guy who lived there and the family. MR. SMURL: That wasn't -- they didn't live in Peckville ? MR. LAFRANCE : No. MR. SMURL: Yeah, that's the only time I've seen that before is the information they use. They use the same database sometimes too to get addresses . MR. LAFRANCE : All right. Well, my time is over but I'll be back next week because I would like to get an answer from Council -- I guess I got the answer tonight that as far as Council is concerned I'm a homeowner, right? Mr. Voldenberg , isn't that what -- MR. MCANDREW : Correct . MR. LAFRANCE : Okay. All right. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Are you going to file the right to know; is that what you're saying? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 You're going to file it now? MR. LAFRANCE : File a right to know? Well, I'm going to file two personal complaint s. I'm going to file -- I filed a right to know today. I'm going to -- I'm going to use my voice and tell everybody -- I'm not going to say any names but I'll tell you my whole story and it's amazing it's going on in the City of Scranton , unreal. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident taxpayer . Once again I'm back on 501 C3s and C4s, tax exempt organization s that seem to feel free to stick their nose into partisan politics . Currently our sale of the sewer plant which the advocate that was hired by some of the colleges and Lackawanna -- Scranton /Lackawanna Chamber of Commerce . And now my water and sewer bill is up about $900 a year. I spent most of the last three years on the porch because I have comorbidities that I can't take a risk on a restaurant . If I go outside it might be the Italian Festival is one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 of our favorites . The races got ruined with the no smoking crowd. They jumped my wife over her vape pipe. And that was it. I can't even get her in to watch a race on television where vaping is required by the way. And if you want to light a cigarette , feel free. It's my damn house. You don't have to go out on the porch either by the way. But I'm not really big on associations . Through the years here, I mean, it's everything from the size of family planning to the city streetscape and you name it. And it costs the average jerk money. It costs them a lot of money. I'm not fond of the streetscape. That I'll get right back to. But I have something to say about some of the comments that were made earlier . There's a hospital bomb when I got home in Gaza. And one side is blaming the other back and forth. It had to be a considerable force. It turned a hospital about the size of CMC or slightly smaller into a crater. There is 300 people dead. And somebody is either trying to sabotage any peace 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 negotiations or whatever . Furthermore , with the Taliban , 80 percent of the troops were withdrawn at the objection of our allies in Afghanistan before Joe Biden took office. The Taliban were negotiating with -- in Camp David by invitation , by invitation . So it's like time that everybody stops using the blame game because I'm sick and tired of people blaming things on other people that they are partially responsible themselves for. It's back in '08 we had a Councilman , wasn't a Councilman . He's standing out front protesting Kanjorski. Well, that basically ruined the taxpayers . We invited the man and we have all of these people out there protesting against the bailout . And it looked really bad for us. And I called and apologized . I was a videographer at the time. And they said we know who was behind it. But that same Council man when he mentioned the recession that it started in 2009, well, why were you protesting out front of City Hall in 2008 if it started after Obama took office? Nobody is all that great. There's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 mistakes on both sides. I'm a little mad at the Democrats over the voting and so forth. But apparently I'll have to handle the rest next week. It's about time we start to remember our history . If you are familiar with history , you're not a fool. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council . I'm Rick Little from Scranton . I was pleased to read the Times-Tribune that the Lackawanna budget was passed with no new taxes. What we need is less spending county down to the city. There is many things that cut into good government . Like, you hear about the lotto, you know, and they say on their state form for the lotto, you know, it helps the elderly and you're watching it and one individual gets billions, billions of dollars . But it really doesn't happen that way. I mean, that's the narrative . The state funds are intercepted by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 many mandates of -- like Scranton Housing Authority who refused to do my PA rent rebate. And that's it. I mean, the Area Agency on Aging, I'm going broke making copies for them. I've been going to them for 10 years, been through four social workers , all of these social workers are being paid. And, you know, it's their duty to protect the elderly. And they're doing the opposite . They found -- they were put in charge by way of Browning the head of Health and Human Services . They put them -- Area Agency on Aging on what was called ERAP funding which was the funding to help people during Covid. And it's part of the trillions of dollars of the American Rescue Act. All of these agencies , they are just moving money around. They farm out their ERAP funding to a company , a private company in Philadelphia just as Scranton Code Enforcement farms out their inspections to NIEC or NEIC, this private company which the lawyers can control and everything . At what cost? I mean, if they can't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 do their job, they should be fired, not farm it out. Let's see. The biggest problem like with Area Agency on Aging, they don't keep any records . I keep going to them. And, oh, we shred them after six months, you know? And I'm giving them stacks of paper just like I do with Lackawanna Pro Bono and Northeast Penn Legal. And they ignore it. They come to court. It's a kangaroo court. And the Court does not have records . They should televise . If they're evicting people, they have an idea. Like, I've been through the family court where, oh, there's no record. You know, they -- it's for the children . We're protecting the children , that's why there is no record. Why is there no videotaping of the Scranton Board of Commissioners meeting s first Monday of every month? Why is there no record of what happens in the magistrate court because hundreds and thousands of people are being evicted and they become homeless and then it becomes another problem . What are we going to do with the homeless and the police? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 We need new leadership locally , city and county. Record keeping must be enforced by law. If we do nothing , we'll lose our city, county, state and country . There has to be accountability , records , because what they're doing they're just -- they can't do their job. And they're farming it out and all of this money is going away. And the people are just watching it on -- you know, watching the news on TV and it's a bad situation . You got to keep records and make records available for people and start the right to know. Start the right to know right here so we know who is working at Scranton Housing Authority , who's working in all of these farmed out situations . My time's up. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Yes, thank you. Okay. Is there anyone one that would like to speak? MR. SHAW: Good evening , Council , Darwin Shaw, Scranton City resident . A couple of questions but my biggest concern right now because the only thing I had to do is watch all the meeting s from -- say for about six months. Miss Hodowanitz has been in this chamber since 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 about 2000 inquiring about a lot in the city and she's dead on, especially down to finances . But my biggest concern as a homeowner , how come this gentleman can't get a permit to put any type of home improvements as long as if he is a landlord in his own house -- not a landlord but a property owner let's say, he should be able to refurbish his windows, put up plywood and things like that without applying for a permit. Honestly , I fully believe if he pays his taxes, he does his dues for the city. He's entitled for that. Number two, I didn't know that Keyser Valley was by Fawnwood . I got family in Fawnwood . There is a 24 inch pipe that's been broke for a long time. The pump house flooded in 2018 and I'm only 33. I remember that because my aunt lives in Fawnwood . And she's been there for about 25 years. And my brother rides quads. There's a beautiful field down there. It always gets flooded . I don't know if it's the Falcon field or anything . But if a walkability study has been done for our city, I'm pretty sure that a study 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 has been done for flood mitigation . Did anybody put forth a plan to not only if you can't refurbish the pump house or even raise the electric al equipment or Fukishima , take a page out of Fukushima . Somebody said that, the gentleman right there -- and let the water flow. Put -- I'm not an engineer , I'm sorry, put a pump system that will force the water up somewhere . I don't know. I can't even speak about that right now. But is there a study done for the pump house at all? Does anybody know? MR. MCANDREW : There was a study. And now after the study now is the planning and then construction stage. MR. SHAW: So that's -- MR. MCANDREW : Some of the points you made have been somewhat address ed or they're looking into. MR. SHAW: Yeah, yeah, and that's coming from the administration . I want to just give my greatest respect to you guys because it's a lot when you have to acquire information from individuals . You know, you guys are doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 the best you possibly can. Number three would be safety. There's a little village by Scranton High of homeless individuals . I'm sorry to say that but they're too close to our children . And I know that you guys can't do anything as Council members . But I didn't hear of an individual getting thrown off a bridge. But I did hear of the lady biting somebody around our kids. And as an individual who does want to stand for the city and I am despite everything , that gentleman deserves to be protected if he's -- he's getting paid from us to protect and serve. You know, but our children deserve to have a safe educational environment to thrive in, you know, without all that homelessness . So if we can, can we try to refurbish some type of building and relocate them individual s there safely so they could be monitor ed because my biggest concern is somebody -- I like to run now -- somebody running on that path and getting snatched up by anybody , women or female. That's not okay. And that's a bad publicity look for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 a city as a whole. And then the tax exempt, can we please due to the Council being the legislative body of holding taxes and the money, can you at least think about six months of giving individuals tax relief from homes getting damaged through the flooding ? Six months to a year is not bad. And if we are going to take a hit financially at least we could see it /beforehand and those individuals don't have to stress about -- you could ease their burden, let's just say, if we can give them some type of tax relief. I fully believe anybody needs help. Everybody needs help and due to pride like the police chief said, a lot of people are scared to ask for it. They don't want to get shunned . They don't want to get turned away. I got to speed up. I got 30 minutes . Did acoustic s get fixed? Are they planning on having new acoustic equipment come here so the individual s could hear in public caucus because I fully believe they deserve to hear. They don't -- even if they don't have to reply, but they at least could hear something to know what's going on, you know? And that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 about it right now, I'm sorry. Great to see you guys. That's it. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. All right. Is there anyone else that would like to speak? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes. Mr. Voldenberg , about six weeks ago we sent code enforcement up to the unit block of South Webster Avenue. I believe they were -- they applied for storage units. I don't know. Work was going on there. But it had seemed to have ceased at that point. But it seems they are back to work again. So if we can send code enforcement back up there to see the blocks of warehouse on the right-hand side, I'm sure they'll know where it's at because they have multiple complaints . But I'd like to see a report on what's really going on there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: And (inaudible ) again, the 2000 block of Lavelle Court, the Court 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 that's not there anymore if we could find out if DPW made it there yet or if they plan on going there just to see if they could do anything with it this year. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SMURL: And my other thing is, Nay Aug Park there is a nonprofit organization . It's One Tree Planted dot org. They donated 20 trees to Nay Aug Park and they also donated lunch today and shovels among other things. They spent about $7,000. It was all donated to the park to plant 20 trees. We had 20 volunteers came up from Keystone Automotive . And they were the ones that set the trees in the ground and stuff. And Sam Kuchawara , Sammy and Bobby Shoemaker had their machine up there and dug the 20 holes. So I would like to thank One Tree Planted dot org and also Keystone Automotive for sending those 20 people up and Sam Kuchawara and Bob Shoemaker for all the work they do at Nay Aug Park. That's all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motion or comment s? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 MR. SCHUSTER : Some of what I'm going to say is a repeat of the last few weeks. Mr. Voldenberg , I know I asked for the last two weeks in a row. We've been getting emergency declaration s and I just request ed a list of the emergency actions that have been taken under those declarations . I know as of yesterday we didn't get any response . Have we receive d a response as of today? MR. VOLDENBERG : We didn't. I expect them by Friday from the administration . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much for inquiring about that. So as was just said, we have been passing emergency declaration s. This will be the third one tonight . And we haven't had a response on any actions that were taken under those declarations . When looking at some of the project s done in Keyser Valley which do need to be done, some of the creek work in there has cost over a million dollars. So they could be rather expensive if we're talking about the flood. And I would like Council to have a chance to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 look at them and see what we're dealing with as these things are being passed in our emergency declaration s. So that is something to think about as I move towards my vote tonight on our emergency declaration tonight . I did ask a couple question s that we got answers last week to. I asked about 7-F. I would say three weeks ago was the 2 million dollar grant with match funding Wyoming Avenue Street Project that was referred to as the Complete Streets Project. In looking into this, lots of cities have developed complete streets program . So my question on that was, are we adopting a complete streets program ? I'm not sure if these things are going to implement one by one as we receive grant funding . But the answer I got was the complete streets program is being evaluated by the administration . I don't know if it's something that we're piecemeal ing together but that was the answer I received as of right now. I asked for a vehicle list several times. I've gotten incomplete lists.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 I didn't need to have any city employees ' address es, anything like that. But I just asked for a list of individuals who have vehicle lists. The only answer I got was that the administration is in receipt of my request . I made an inquiry about the reservoirs above Newton Road as my first week on Council I did take the flood manager for DPW and the Mayor on a tour of Keyser Valley. I did start by going to the turnpike and taking a look at reservoirs above Newton Road as some of those flood pattern s have changed of the 2018 storm. And I asked if the administration -- because I did ask at the time if they would reach out to the Turnpike Commission . The answer was Chief Judge is working with relevant authorities and has reached out to the Turnpike Commission as one of those authorities to coordinate relief efforts and planning . The city is also working with GPI who did the Keyser Valley study to address the situation in a holistic manner. And we will work with all relevant stakeholders , authorities , including the Turnpike Commission 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 to address flooding prevention . So it's something that's been known but I guess on the plan as we move forward . The last thing I had asked for it's been asked several times here in public comment about our rental ordinance . And it was a good idea that came up. It was about the University of Scranton . They have rental properties there and if we're using this rental ordinance on those properties that are being rented up there. And let's see, the answer I got was the administration respect fully request more information from Council as to what fee in mind it is and the justification for that. So if we could just reach out to the administration and ask are we going to use our current rental ordinance and our rental fee on rental properties that are owned by the University of Scranton ? The last one is Lackawanna Avenue trash pickup. If we could just reach out to possibly DPW and see if the trash receptacles downtown are on a regular list for cleanup as one of the resident s tonight said those trash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 cans are full. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : (Inaudible ) maybe get clarification . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Sorry, Tom. MR. SCHUSTER : That's all right. That's all. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few things just to bring forward . I have a couple properties the first we received an e-mail on earlier and it's a neighbor that I've been in communication with. And we previously had, you know, quality of life tickets given to this property . And it had been cleaned up in the past, but it's once again quite overgrown. It's next to -- he has a property and then his mother lives in the property next to it. And then there's an empty lot. And I know there's been issues with animals there as a result. And it's just unpleasant having that next door to their property .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 And it's actually up for sale too but I don't know who would want to buy the property in its condition . But that address is 717 Harrison Avenue. And I don't believe Mr. Voldenberg was include d on this e-mail. So I'm going to go ahead and forward that to you so that we could once again get code enforcement over there. And I took a look at our code enforcement report and the address is on there from over the summer and it did say that citation s were issued. But there wasn't any further update. So I'm wondering if, you know, if there was ever an attempt to bring it forward to the magistrate so I want to check in on that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And an address I brought up last week I still haven't receive d an update on. And I didn't see it on our list was 723 Wheeler Avenue. And there are a number of different complaints from neighbor s there at that property . So I'd like if we could ask for an update again on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. DR. ROTHCHILD : And another property that I want to bring forward that there was a request to see if animal control could come out to this property and that's at 1068 Cottage Avenue. And it's not occupied , I believe abandon ed and condemned . And there have been cats that have made it their home and that's causing issues for the neighbors . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. That's currently on the demolition list. I'll follow up on the animals. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. If there's something they could do to get the cats removed at least in time -- I don't know when the demo is planned for so that's all I have. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. King, do you have any motion or comments ? MR. KING: Just something real briefly . I want to thank DPW for the tremendous job they did in the 1500 block of Cherry Street. There was a serious drainage issue there. They were able to put in some kind of pipe across the street, some kind of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 drain and it really helped resolve a major drainage issue that was occurring in that section of Cherry Street. So I want to thank them for that. And I'm hopeful that I will be able to return to Council in person next week. That's all. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. So sitting as Vice President I get notes, responses to inquires from the week before. Most of them were covered during public participation . So I'll just go through them and then I'll speak to my motions or comments . So, of course, we receive d an emergency declaration on Friday, October 13th, 2023 related to the localize d flooding that occurred on September 9th, 2023. That will extend the emergency powers necessary to October 20th, 2023. This declaration appeared in Third Order at this evening 's meeting and the related legislation will appear at next week's agenda for review and passage . Joan Hodowanitz asked last week a question about the Payroll Preparation Tax. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 the City Finance Director advised that the Payroll Prep tax collection s are on track for this year. Also the Mayor and City Council President sent correspondence on October 11th to the Scranton School District and Lackawanna County for a discussion to explore potential avenues for relief to those resident s negative ly impacted by the September 9th flooding event. Mr. Ellman sent a request to code enforcement to follow up regarding 136 Throop Street and 11 Throop Street. Pennsylvania American Water Company has plans to install a underground water tank on Wells Street near Leggetts Creek to control water flow in this area. For one of Mrs. Schumacher 's questions , we answered a couple of them in fourth. So there's one here. DPW confirmed they will have the roadwork signs removed from East Mountain Road. So you inquired about that. That is all I have. So my stuff, okay, so, Mr. Voldenberg , we had Mr. Raines here a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 weeks ago. He has ongoing issues forever . He's been somewhat pacified by the administration and DPW. And, you know, I made a statement two weeks ago enough's enough. Are they resolving his issue? You reached out. Did you hear anything back? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out again to the Director . MR. MCANDREW : So we did not. MR. VOLDENBERG : They did not. MR. MCANDREW : That's disheartening . Please follow up with that and I know you will. So about two weeks ago South Scranton Little League reached out to me. They have a beautiful organization back there. They do a lot of great things, great kids. And I was there on an October night. And I was covered in mosquitoes . So where they showed me the issue lies is in center field. They were told in '21 or '22 that they're on the list, on the good list with regards to having some stormwater issues resolved because what happened was they always took in water back there but not as much. But after a project at West 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 Mountain , I'm sorry, East Mountain , it created a bigger problem . So the administration sent people there. They're aware of the issue. But they were told two years ago you're on the list. So this year compounded , you know, with the storm of the century , it got worse. I was there. There is standing water. I believe Mr. Teaman was involved in that assessment . And he seems to believe it's an easy fix. But, you know, he needs the direction of the administration . So our understanding is these fine folks talked to the current head of DPW because they talked to Mr. West prior who said, yeah, you're on the list. So I guess the current director said you're not on the list. So a couple weeks ago he sat with administration . They said we have disaster money. We're moving some disaster money. And my understanding and I looked at it and it's a simple fix, they got to dig a trench, put some pipe in. I guess the material s are here within the city and DPW. The expertise is here. To be removed from a list I have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 problem with. So and if it's not that expensive , it doesn't appear to be from what I was told by these folks. But they want to get back on the list. There's no reason to be off the list. So can you reach out to city administration and find out what's going on because we all know what happened to that poor guy who received bacteria from that water. And we all know about standing water and mosquito s. And there's a bunch of kids there. I'm worried -- I'm concerned about them. This is a public safety issue. It needs to be addressed and reach out to Mr. Teaman, see what his thoughts are on this because he's our expert with regards to that and get us an answer and get back to us, have them get back to us by end of the week. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out in the morning , sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. We've got to take care of those kids out there. All right. And then next what else do I have? So Mr. Coyne brought up a great idea and, you know, it's not the first time he brought it up.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 This has been discussed for a couple weeks. We got to give some type of tax relief to the -- because of the burden that was incurred by these poor people affected by the flooding, right? I think even the Mayor agreed to it, Mrs. Cipriani during caucus when they were here, yeah, we could probably do something . But just saying we could probably do something and not taking action because that's three weeks ago and saying, yeah, we could probably do something . So Mr. Coyne is right. So even if the administration did something , it would have to come down to us for a vote. So maybe we do it ourselves and not wait any longer or at least we'll give the Mayor maybe a couple of days to acknowledge they're going to do something . And if not, well, we'll give her the benefit of the doubt. We'll give her, like, three or four days. I think one of us could get ahold of her and get some type of commitment . But if not, Solicitor Gallagher , take a look at creating an ordinance to provide such relief, okay? Thank you. Also, Mr. Coyne 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 brought up that some people consider me an obstruction ist with my no votes. That's fair. But, of course, I'm going to defend myself. I always defend my no votes with rationale and reason why I'm voting no and that they're always based on my own thought process , all right, generated from my own opinion , no one else's on behalf of the resident s what I think is in their best interest . So when I vote no for a grant -- first of all, a grant isn't free. Some people have a misconception it's free money. Grants are taxpayer money whether how they're funded to here, it still comes from taxpayers . And the only time I vote no because for the most part I vote for 95 percent of legislation that's sent down to us -- I do, 95 percent . So the five percent I have a problem with and I don't think it's in the best interest of the resident s, I vote no for. And I own my vote and I explain my no vote with great detail. And I could live with that vote and I go to sleep well with that vote. But and I kind of get why would you vote against a grant. And the only time I vote 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 against a grant -- it's not free money. But I vote against a grant when I don't like the way it's used or there is no way to sustain that. So a grant for something for one year and the person or a hire is going to stay here for three, guess what? It's called unsustain ability . And then guess who has to pick up the next three years, the residents and the taxpayers . Do I like voting against grants, not really. But I'll vote against them if I don't agree with the process or if they can't be sustain ed. And that's when I voted no for grants. I voted no for grants. I'm not going to name them all right now. But every grant I voted no for I had a good reason and not just to be an obstructionist just to vote no to be a bad guy. No, I have rational e and reasoning and I stand by my no votes. And when, you know, when it comes to grants they have to be sustainable , otherwise you guys pick up the tab. And I think that is all I have. It is all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – RATIFYING THE EXTENDED LOCAL DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY ISSUED BY THE OFFICE OF THE MAYOR AND AUTHORIZING THE OFFICE OF THE MAYOR TO EXERCISE AND ENFORCE THE EMERGENCY POWERS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH, WELFARE , AND SAFETY OF THE CITIZENRY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON AS A RESULT OF THE LOCALIZED FLOODING THAT OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2023 THROUGH OCTOBER 13, 2023. MR. MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , bringing up the term obstructionist , I'd like to think that I ask relevant questions in a reasonable amount of time. So this is the third emergency declaration we have passed. And for the last two weeks I have asked for the actions that the administration has taken while using this emergency declaration . I gave the first two -- I allowed it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 to happen; but I have asked for what actions have been taken and I have not receive d an answer yet. And yet again, another emergency ordinance is on my desk for passage . So I'm going to vote no tonight on 5-B. And I'm waiting to hear the answer for those emergency actions. And the reason I vote no sometimes is because I want to make sure that we don't have runaway costs and because we are the oversight body of the city. And one thing I would like everybody to keep in mind is we meet weekly. So if something can't be passed last week, it could be passed this week. It's not a monthly meeting like other boards in this city or the county. That's all I have to say on that. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? I have the same issue as Mr. Schuster . We need an explanation . We ask for an explanation , we should get it. We're Council . We don't have to do right to knows. We ask simple question s that either don't get the answer to or we get a roundabout answer that doesn't make any sense.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 Is it intentional , I hope not. But it appears to be. They want us to approve these emergency declaration s quickly. But they don't want to help with us rational e and how the money is being used. This money does have to get to the poor people that are affected and need the flood. So I'm not going to vote no for introduction . But guess what, I want answers the same as Mr. Schuster by final passage . Okay? Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. So all those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : The ayes have it and so moved. MR. SMURL: I make a motion to suspend the rules to move Item 5-B to Sixth and Seventh Order for a final vote. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm going to be voting no to move this from fifth to sixth and seventh order and final passage tonight in the hopes that we get answers by final passage . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Like I said earlier , I'll move it with -- and we'll see what happens . All right. But we need information forthcoming in how this money is going to be disbursed. All right. So on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH BREAK 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 POINT LAW TO PERFORM PROFESSIONAL REGISTRY SERVICES , INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MANAGING AND MAINTAINING A REGISTRY OF FORECLOSED PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. MCANDREW : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , when it comes to this resolution I know that Solicitor Gallagher had a few questions . I was hoping to get our own Council caucus tonight but that did not happen as we had the police and fire chiefs in. But there was some question s about some of the backup information , affidavits ; and I think we need some clearer answers on some of the costs. One of my question s is, have we had service s such as this in the past? I know Solicitor Gallagher we didn't really get to speak about this in caucus. There might possibly be auto renewal in here? Is there any question s that you had? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 ATTY. GALLAGHER : I just want the affidavit s attached, the insurance certificates attached as the backup so indicates . They seem to be missing . Additionally , it says -- the backup says initially three years renewable on an annual basis. The contract states it's a year with an option to renew after a year up to three years. So I want clarification on that. And the cost indicate s it's $100 for signup fee and then 20 percent of penalties and interest . What are the penalties and interest of -- what, I don't know. Is it penalties and interest for not signing up the property or some other fee or service s that is associated with this? So just those questions probably before you should pass this. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. SCHUSTER : So we'll get a list of questions together for you, Frank. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So at this time I'll entertain a motion that 5-B be introduced into its proper committee .

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 313, 2023 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH PERFORMANCE HI-FIDELITY TO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25110 PERFORM AUDIO VISUAL SERVICES FOR THE MEETING SPACE ENHANCEMENTS FOR CITY HALL. MR. MCANDREW : As Vice Chairman for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , Mr. Voldenberg , did something come up earlier in the meeting about 6 percent tax? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . There was the bid amount and then with the additional 6 percent sales tax it brought it up to the 24,000 plus, which is still under the threshold of 25,000. MR. SCHUSTER : Gotcha. Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : The question was between the two numbers . So it was the bid and then the tax included . ATTY. GALLAGHER : The other proposal was 49,072. So it's just the backup appears the number is incorrect . MR. SCHUSTER : Can you say that one more time? ATTY. GALLAGHER : It appears the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 backup information is incorrect on it. It has the 23,389 when it looks like the estimate is 24,559.84, the difference being the 6 percent tax of 1,170.84. MR. SCHUSTER : Should we make a friendly amendment to include that that price needs to be changed? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Sure. DR. ROTHCHILD : Solicitor Gallagher , shouldn 't we be tax exempt? I mean, I haven't seen that added with the previous contracts . ATTY. GALLAGHER : I've never seen it with the other contracts either. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. So perhaps we can make a motion to table this until we receive that response to make sure we're not paying more than we need to. MR. SCHUSTER : I would be happy to make a motion to table. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'll second that motion. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. There's a motion on the floor and a second to table. All those in favor of tabling signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.

MR. MCANDREW : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25113 DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I would like to make a motion to table Item 7-B until we get the information about what actions have been taken under emergency ordinance since these have been passed since September 9th. MR. MCANDREW : Second. So there's a motion on the table and a second. All those in favor of tabling this to get more information -- DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Oh, I'm sorry, on the question ? Anyone else? Okay, so none heard -- MR. KING: On the question , we need to do a roll call. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. All right then, roll call, please. MR. SMURL: On the question -- MR. MCANDREW : So this is to table until we get further information with regards to the disbursement of the funds for the emergency declaration , how are they used. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 MR. SMURL: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: No. MR. MCANDREW : All right, three noes, motion fails. So let's go back to the resolution . What is recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? On the question , we need information to make -- of course we don't want to hold up any funds. But when we ask week after week after week for information , it's our responsibility as Council people up here to scrutinize . It's our job. I take it seriously . So, you know, tabling this failed. So I'm going to be a no. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 This is just because of procedural and it's the right vote. MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , earlier in the meeting I said I feel I ask relative question s in a timely manner. I felt I asked some relative questions in a timely manner here as we had two weeks to get the information for the passage of this. So I will continue to be a no. MR. MCANDREW : Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. I hereby declare Item 7-B legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-C - PREVIOUSLY TABLED - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 87, 2023 AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 33, 2022 AN ORDINANCE AS AMENDED ENTITLED GENERAL CITY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25116 OPERATING BUDGET 2023 TO INCREASE THE DEBT PROCEEDS ACCOUNT (AS NOTED) BY 3,790,000 AND TO INCREASE THE COURT AWARDS ACCOUNT (AS NOTED) BY 3,700,000 TO ALLOW FOR THE PAYMENT OF UNBUDGETED LEGAL SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS . MR. MCANDREW : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote of Item 7-C. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question . MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this is labeled as unbudgeted legal settlement payments . I kind of feel that that's a misnomer . I will be voting no on this as I spoke to it previously . MR. MCANDREW : All right. So on the question , I wanted to vote for the Court awarded settlement . It's the right thing to do. I asked for -- but it's bundled with a settlement for a company that paid to play with a previous Mayor. I can't in good faith reward this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25117 company even though they say it was a breach of contract . Guess what, when they paid to play and were identified by the FBI as a coconspirator , they -- that was a breach of contract . So I asked -- requested that they break this out, make it two resolutions , didn't get a response from administration . So because of that, I can't in good faith -- I can't feel good about this, no, because we're rewarding criminal behavior bundled . This never should have been bundled . This should not have been bundled . So anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , we did have discussion about the legal options that we had quite some time ago. And I'm also not happy about giving additional money to NRS after what happened . However , this is part of a legal settlement . And that's why I thought -- I'll still -- I still feel the need to vote yes on it. If we were to vote no and it wasn't to pass then what happens to that legal settlement , Solicitor Gallagher ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : That would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25118 probably jeopardize the settlement , I believe . DR. ROTHCHILD : So I'm not willing to do that. ATTY. GALLAGHER : But I would have to check with legal upstairs as I'm not privy to what the settlement was or when we asked for what the settlement negotiations and information was, I believe they did provide it to us but redacted some of the settlement information . I don't know all the ins and outs of the settlements . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. I'm not a lawyer. I wasn't a part of the negotiations in the settlement . Again, I vote yes on this. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. In addition to on the question , there was a discussion . I said let's fight it. I wasn't heard. I didn't agree with the discussion or some type of consensus moving forward . I said we need to fight this. I wasn't heard. So from the get-go I didn't like it. And I don't like it anymore why it's being bundled and shoved through as a vote. Anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25119 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question , I did not agree with the discussion at the time. I didn't agree with our stance that we were talking on it. And I do not know all the ins and outs of it as I wasn't privy to that information . I'll be voting no. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. Three noes, motion fails. MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-D. PREVIOUSLY TABLED - RESOLUTION NO. 311, 2023 - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH NLYTEN CORPORATION D/B/A GUIDE TO PROVIDE THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH A FIRST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25120 RESPONDER MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS MOBILE APPLICATION . MR. MCANDREW : What is the recommendation for the Vice Chairperson on the Committee on Public Safety? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I spoke to this last meeting as well as this meeting . I don't feel that a telephone app would be a good replacement for mental health. I would say I have to agree our unions on this. And I think we could have used the money in a better manner than this application to provide mental health for our police and fire department . MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I did hear from the fire union and their rational e and what they're doing with the peer support program . So I was happy to hear that that is going on and that's an option. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25121 I don't see this as a replacement for services . I see it as an addition to that. And I know, you know, if it was up to me to, you know, have a peer discussion with my colleagues about my own mental health issues, I wouldn't feel as comfortable as I would as using an app. And maybe part of that is my age and the Chief did point out they feel like this would be geared towards maybe their younger firefighter s or police officers who are going to be more apt to use this. And with Covid happening a few years ago, using apps and virtual communication with counsellors , all of that became, you know, much more popular . So I think this is moving in that direction of where some mental health services are at right now in our country . And I know that it's not going to replace any sort of counseling . And it's not a counseling service . But I don't find anything wrong with providing those resources to our firefighters and police officers . And I'm supportive of their mental health and whatever we could do as a city to help them.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25122 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So on the question , as I stated earlier , I'm the Chairman on the Committee on Public Safety. And I care a great deal about our brave police officers and our firefighters , especially their mental health, safety, and welfare . Did I listen to some union members , yeah, and I have every right to even though I might have been chastise d or criticize d a little bit by it. But you know what, I'm here for them too. So I listened to them. I listened to both chiefs tonight . And like I said earlier , I don't want to say that $18,000 is not a lot of money, but I'll vote -- I will give that a shot and see because you know what, there was no appetite to put that towards co-pay. Like Schuster was a great idea. I would agree with that. But you can see what's happened here all night. There's not three votes for much things. So if I could waive a wand and say take that money and utilize it towards the co-pay for face-to-face therapy , I'd do it in a minute. But so, like I said earlier , I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25123 vote yes for this. It's only one year. I'll keep my eye on it. And I'll keep my ear to the members that are either going to use it or not. And then we'll see from there for next year. Okay. So anybody else? MR. KING: On the question , I agree with you, Mr. McAndrew . I'm willing to give this a shot for at least a year and evaluate it and see whether , you know, it's going to be utilize d by the members. And I value the input of the Fire Chief and the Police Chief. It's a tool that will be available to our great firefighter s and police officers . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS.
