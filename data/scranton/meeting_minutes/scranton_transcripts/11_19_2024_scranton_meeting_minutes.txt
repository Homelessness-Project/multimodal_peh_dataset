Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I can't believe you forgot to mention the Santa parade Saturday 9:30, downtown Scranton . MR. MCANDREW : We got you. Thanks. MS. HODOWANITZ : I assume you'll all be there with your kinders. The other thing I would like to mention as I start off is my compliments and appreciation to the Scranton Fire Department for the work they've done on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Montage Mountain . That could have been a very disastrous situation if it wasn't tamped down as quickly as it was and very proud of those men and women. Okay, any hope for a police collective bargaining unit being posted on the website ? MR. SMURL: I don't believe this year, Joan. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Yeah, July 28th, 2023 and counting. I assume that DPW union negotiations are continuing . MR. SMURL: Yeah, the last I was told there was a meeting this week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Good, because Mr. Ufberg got paid $35,000 last month. So obviously something 's happening. And any word on the 2023 audit? MR. SCHUSTER : I had asked last week at Council about that hoping that we would get it before the passing of the budget or before we -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, maybe as a Christmas present . MR. SCHUSTER : Before we thought 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 about passing the budget. And we were told by January it would be over to us. MS. HODOWANITZ : January . And remember when they were throwing the date around of September 30th? I sat back there and said, yeah, in your dreams. MR. SMURL: We actually -- it's very close. It's probably this week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. How many times have you said that? MR. SMURL: Well, we do have it in hand, our people have it so -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. In terms of the legislation tonight , I don't have a problem with this emergency training facility and emergency operation center on Career Technology Center's property kind of thing. But what I still do not understand is, wasn't that the original vision for the Serrenti Center long ago and far away in another galaxy? I never heard an explanation for, you know, why the Serrenti Center is fallen out of favor. Is this going to become like a storage facility or a parking lot for vehicles or something ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. SMURL: I don't know. I know the police department almost fully use that. There's training classes in there now. They use it a lot. MS. HODOWANITZ : But we're going to have another one built. They're going to build a -- MR. SMURL: I believe that -- isn't that mostly for the fire department ? MR. MCANDREW : It's going to be both. MR. SMURL: Yeah, it's going to be both? MR. MCANDREW : It started as fire but I think it's going to be both. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And Wyoming Avenue Streetscape Project , there was a reference to the bike lanes. And I don't have a problem with bicycles per se. Although as a pedestrian living downtown since 1999, it's very unnerving to have a bicycle come up behind you and you can't hear them and they are on the sidewalks . So I don't know what kind of -- whether you are going to need to enact 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 ordinances to control them once we do have these bike lanes. When I was a kid, didn't we have the bicycle bell, you go ding ding, ding ding as you were coming up behind somebody ? They don't do that, you know, they are just -- they're on the sidewalks and they shouldn 't be there. That should be for pedestrians only. Hopefully , you know, when you enact these bike lanes, if you do, there will be some regulation of it and there will be enforcement because some of these bicycle riders are not paying attention . And this assessment rule that came in from Lackawanna County, I don't know, did you do the math on Scranton ? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I was looking at it. The building s, 40 percent nontaxable, 60 percent taxable . Land, 23 percent nontaxable , 77 percent taxable . That is an unsustainable statistic . Something 's got to change. And I'll see you all Saturday morning at 9:30. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Norma Jeffries . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I just wanted to thank I guess Mr. Smurl that you were able to get this copy of the Scranton Lackawanna unsheltered plan. And I was not able to make it last week to speak about this. And I did read it. I was a little bit disappoint ed from the first paragraph because it went on -- it was from -- I'm sorry, 2023. We're in 2024. And this is the latest document that we have from '23. And as I read it, there were just things on there that I just -- it's a lot of words. I'm thinking I know that the committee that put together spent a lot of time to put this together because I know it took me a while to read. And I had to mark it up. You'll see my yellow markings on it because I didn't understand a lot of the information they were putting in this report. And then the main thing that I wanted to see at the back of this report was an action plan. I didn't see an action plan. We're into June of 2024 -- past June of 2024. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And this is the latest. Is there any update? I was hoping that Dr. Rothchild would be here that she could address this because I think she's on the committee . And again, as I said two weeks ago or more than that ago, you know, it's getting cold. And we all have that luxury of going and turning up our heat. And here we have people that are out there still with no plan in place that I see anyway. And I don't have to know everything . But I think we owe it to the citizen s of Scranton to know that there is something in the works to take care of our homeless population . When they called it the unsheltered plan, you know, just say it like it is, homeless plan because that's what these people are. They're homeless . I still look for that young lady that was here the one night. And she was so concern ed about her safety in the streets. And I know that if you go down to the Sheetz at night you see a lot of homeless people down that way. It just breaks my heart because , you know, all they could do is talk about it and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 all. But then I think, yes, there is, Norma. There is something more that you could do than just talk about it. So I'm just offering to whoever put these papers together , I'm home. I'm retired. If there's anything at all that I could do to help move this plan along, you know, I'm willing and I think I'm able to do research and to see exactly where we are. I had spoke about Wilkes-Barre. I spoke about Allentown and all the work that they're doing down there for the homeless and here we are in Scranton and I can't seem to get anything . Also, I wanted to talk about tonight I'm going to be leaving again early because I don't know why the NAACP meetings are calling on Tuesday nights now. But tonight they are talking as well about the homeless population . And they have been in discussion with the Pastor at Bethel AME Church. And I know that years ago -- they tell me. I wasn't here then. But they tell me years ago that Bethel AME Church had a facility . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 It's no longer operational , but I understand that there's some conversation that's going to go on tonight about the homeless population in Scranton . And I'm not sure what -- how Bethel AME Church is going to be involved with it, but I do know that the NAACP is going to be involved . And they are asking the community for help and assistance . Everyone knows that they could reach me on Facebook if you want some more information on that. That would be great. So I thank you for your time and for this document , Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Norma, I believe the mayor -- there were a few mayors meeting yesterday I believe in Wilkes-Barre for this. So I will ask our Mayor what happened at that meeting . MS. JEFFRIES : Yesterday there was a meeting ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I believe it was yesterday . I believe there were three or four mayors that were meeting . So I will ask for an update on that. MS. JEFFRIES : Not only me, but the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 residents of Scranton as well. MR. SMURL: I will. Ronnie Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . There's an old adage that says the sun shines equally upon us all except in Scranton , the home of sour stench of graft corruption and friends in higher places. You know, I got a whole lot on my plate and I'm going to tell you some things and I don't really care who I offend with this further on down here. Last year I had the funeral of my son, my brother , and Rose's brother . My other son got cirrhosis from 20 years living a hell of a good life like a playboy. He's in the hospital for months. And he's finally -- he said he just wanted to go home and die in his apartment . So he's been there for three, four months. He's pretty sick but he gets around. This year, I have complained probably going back last year about Oleski's office relentlessly just nonstop harassing me about everything in the house, the cars. It won't stop with them people. And in August, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 they got one of the protect and serve people on their side. The very day I went to Tunkhannock -- I mean, Nanticoke to see my son, they give me a ticket or whatever it was for an abandoned vehicle . And if -- does that make any sense to anybody ? Then the officer wrote me a letter complaining about it. I stood here and said one block up the street is a piece of junk been on the sidewalk for over a year. Nobody cares about that. Anyway, I got through all that with them. And last Saturday I get a letter from Mr. Ware saying I have to have -- pay a $300 fine or they are going to take my driver's license away in 15 days. I never got any kind of citation or nothing in the mail about anything . This is on the little convert ible that has a classic plate on it for two years. It says the plate's no good, right here in this damn letter. That's the kind of police force that I have to deal with. Other people don't have problems . Two Tuesdays ago, the city towed in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 my car, my Cadillac . A few days before I put an alternator on it and I drove it around the block. There's nothing wrong with it, just because I don't drive it, it's licensed to next year. It's insured. Every month the insurance comes out, you know, I pay monthly . And it's inspect ed to next August and some jerk in this city towed my car in. If that's not harassment, you tell me what it is. I got Oleski driving me nuts for a year. He had Sunday lie in court in Mr. Ware's court about that. And he never came in here when I told him to come confront me about lying in court. MR. MCANDREW : So did you get your car yet? It was towed? Do you know the reason why it was towed? Was it explained to you? Did you get your car -- MR. ELLMAN: They gave me a rubbish fine or something . I don't remember . Real quick, a couple weeks ago the next door neighbor come on my property . My backyard is 50 feet wide. His is 19 feet. He came on my property , vandalize d a tree, threw the branches down so I phoned the cops. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Here comes the cop that doesn't like me. Listen, he looked at everything and I got pictures of it. He said I phoned Mr. Oleski and he's not in. I'll get in touch with him and let you know tomorrow . What in the world does Oleski have to do with what I'm talking about? MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: This is a police matter when -- about the tree and so forth. It's nothing to do with Oleski. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Your time is up. MR. ELLMAN: Let me show you something . Just one second. This is my Cadillac . There's my inspection . Does that say anything when the filed -- 8/25. They towed a perfectly legal -- MR. SMURL: Please don't pound. Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: Well, thank you for letting me talk. MR. SMURL: Sure. All right. Lee Morgan. MR. ELLMAN: Some city this has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 become the last couple years. That's all I got to say. It's a shame what has happened to this city. MR. SCHUSTER : So did you get your car back, Mr. Ellman? MR. MORGAN: Did you get your car back? MR. ELLMAN: No, I don't know where it is. MR. MORGAN: He doesn't know where it is. Good evening , Council . Maybe today, Mr. Smurl, you'll tell the city where all the money from the proceeds of the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority went to. I asked you that last week. Maybe you won't. But, you know, I just think that as you look at this thing spin today, the people got up here and spoke about the city. We've got the situation we have in the city is that we've elected people that can't run the city so they have to hire people and spend millions of dollars in order to keep the city moving. I had an opportunity to go to the Tripp Park meeting on the sewer lines. And I would just like to say that Mr. Weschler when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 he introduced that legislation in the Council , they didn't care about the residents . We're talking about as the people presented their statements to Council today about spending millions and millions of dollars for the sewer. And I just think it's important to realize one thing. All of this money comes from taxpayers across this Commonwealth and across from the federal government . And I really think there needs to be a study done. I think we need to elect a new mayor to be honest with you because we don't have a mayor or a Council capable of running the city. And we need to take a look at all the grant money that's spent. We need to have somebody come in and determine how much these project s were really worth and whether the city basically allowed graft to take hold of this city and pay people, you know, maybe like they did downtown by Buona's, you know, 25 million dollars for a project of a couple building s that are still vacant. And as we watch the city spin out of control and all the millions and millions and millions of dollars they're spending that isn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 even coming from this tax base and then you watch Mr. Casey fighting trying to hold onto a Senate seat that he lost by 17,000 votes and then you watch the democrats say they don't care how corrupt they are. They are going to count votes. And they're going to find some way to save this guy because that's what democrats do. They lie to you. They cheat you out of whatever you have. You watch Mr. Ellman here talked today. You know, the city came and towed a car off my property one time, didn't waste any time, just went to district justice 's office, filled out a couple papers. The Chief of Police wouldn't even talk to me. Went in to talk to the tower, he threw me out of his building . I said, well, I was only trying to be nice. And then the city begged me not to sue them and told me they would never come on my property again. I've got three cases -- two in federal court and one in the Court of Common Pleas. And I'm not going to do anything until after December after Christmas . And then I'm going to start spinning . And I think I'm going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 to sue the city for 10 million dollars . Now, they didn't use city law firms to fight me. They went outside and they're paying, what, $290 an hour, okay, because , you know what, you can laugh at people and you could disrespect people. But all you need to do is know how to hold an ink pen and how to file something . You see this ink pen right here, this is the most powerful weapon you've ever seen in your life. And with this ink pen I could accomplish anything . Anything . And I just think that like Mr. Smurl here, you know, you're not going to answer our questions today about what happened to the sewer authority money because you really think this is all a joke. But don't forget that you have a working relationship with the head of licensing and inspections . You're deep into this stuff that's going on into this city, okay. And the rest of you, I feel sorry for you because you're in way over your head. They talk about spending millions of dollars. You don't have a million dollars in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 your bank account . And you know what, Elon Musk is absolutely right. We've got to get rid of all the graft because that's all this city is spinning on. And you laugh at what happens to people here. It's all a big joke. But you have no power. And the power you do have, you won't use. You won't use your power of subpoena . You won't do anything for the people you won't do anything about licensing and inspection s and all the abuses they've committed . But you know something , I had a problem with them too and I beat them at the district justice . And then district justice asked me for a copy of the law, okay. And it's pretty simple. When I go to court, one judge almost threw me out because of the way I was dressed but I won that case too. And we're going to have a lot of fun here. I hope you stick around for the show. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, do you want me to e-mail you a copy of the information I have on the sewer authority ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. MORGAN: I want you to tell the public because they have the right to know about the sewer rate increases that they are facing and the incompetence of this Council . I want the public to know and that's why I want you to tell the public because you represent the Council as the President what the city has done to them. That's what I want. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's it for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . The city said on the unauthorize d access to records in Dix Court that there was no unauthorized access after the investigation . That seems strange . I guess I was authorized to -- authorized then to access city personnel files if there were no unauthorized accesses . Last time I mentioned the $40,000 not being distribute d to the neighborhood beautification program , Dr. Rothchild said she thinks that she asked prior it was distribute d. I remember that conversation and that question . I think it went through NeighborWorks . This was months ago. I suspect the same answer will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 given tonight . But I ask, how do we trust a budget whose funds have been expended and are never reported as such for review? The line item was zero spent. What other numbers are wrong and unreported in the budget you're reviewing? 5-H, finally it's about time the LSA for the Nay Aug Park pool was put in. I guess someone listened to me saying that we should use the LSA grants for city project s for the people and not just for non-profits like our pools. A million dollars is a good start. But I hope they are still shaving Recovery Act funds or are they planning on dragging their feet out until they don't have the ability to move it as an excuse. 5-N, we have Marywood College LSA Grant for one million dollars to improve Marywood campus. How much have they paid in pilots to the city? I understand that we push grants through for the kickback from the process ing. But is $20,000 for a million dollars a good deal when they don't even supply pilot funds? We have a lot of talk of Jesus talk. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 And I think Christian institutions have forgotten God, not all, but some. Jesus was clear in Paul. Therefore , it is necessary to submit to the authorities not because of the possibilities of punishment but also because there's a conscience . This is also why you pay your taxes for the authorities are God's servants who give their full time in governing . Give everyone what you owe him. If you owe taxes, pay them. Revenue -- if revenue , then revenue . If respect , then respect . If honor, then honor. Nonprofits are suppose d to balance what would be paid in taxes with what is provided to the community in compensation . Even hospital s are suppose d to give free care. The Pope washes the feet of the poor. The local universities wash their hands after counting and storing of the coin box. Regence in the temple, the Board of Collectors . 7-C, the beautification of downtown . They are paying -- we're paying for them to gather volunteers to remove graffiti , trash, and plant flowers . Are we really spending $23,829.03 as the details say to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 one Scranton buy flowers to enhance aesthetics and air quality , really? On another subject , there's been talk of why this Council allowed off topic comments . The Courts have ruled about suppression in Council and even limited public forums. Council by allowing in prior sets up an issue of viewpoint discrimination and shutting down certain speech is an issue and the Sunshine Rule allows subjects that are not on the agenda as long as they are public interest . I understand that's hard to define for this body. It's easier to give five minutes than cause legal rifts and it costs nothing . Last, I'd like the time to take to address Ukraine . I can connect by supplying the 155 millimeter shells or the sudden appearance of a flag when Zelenskyy came. But as I suspect if I look out front on day 1,000 of this war the flag is probably not flying out front. But I'll check after I leave. I watch Russian troops cross the border. But when they dropped incendiaries on ski slopes in Poltava -- ski slopes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 I watched buildings disappear in front of my eyes. We had democrats for and republicans in opposition to spending in Ukraine . But the US military said it would cost us more not to spend in the long run than it would to back out. Why are we in this on day 1,000? I ask you to take a look at a map of Europe. If Ukraine was to fall, Hungary (inaudible ) Hungary being Putin's (inaudible ) and Slovakia is tied to Putin's oil. Allowing them to continue through would put a wedge right in the middle of Europe. So for day 1,000, I ask everyone here to remember the civilians who suffer and we have lost. May they at some time find a modicum of peace in this war. Good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening, Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to talk about crickets . The term crickets is often used when someone asks a question and gets no response . Crickets have come to mean absolute silence , no communication . I could understand why it comes to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 this very reasoning with our 2024 Scranton City Council . Current Council is led by a president who has had a lackluster year. We have a bar that's set very low because our concern s are not address ed. Weekly conversations with the current Mayor remain private as opposed to the good people of Scranton . When you put that gavel down at the end of the year, Mr. Smurl, leave it there. Here's some examples of crickets . They're not in any order. Addressing and sealing the pave cuts by the utility company contractors . Apparently none of you care about the roads or the recurring expenses of the good people of Scranton , crickets . A 1.9 percent increase to the Scranton Sewer Authority bills at $62 a year as opposed to 220. The sale of the sewer authority has an agreement in place for 10 years of that sale. And I mention ed this to each of you to familiarize yourselves of this full agreement , crickets . Why does this administration accepting those bids when it comes to infrastructure and other important bids when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 the lowest meets our needs. The Capouse Avenue Splash Pad will have a rebidding process , crickets . Over 60 hires for critical position s within this administration since she took office, crickets . Only 50 intersection s have new crosswalk s when all are needed, crickets . 6.4 million dollars to settle 59 lawsuits in the last 18 months. Where does that money come from to pay off this stuff, crickets . Lost critical years for this administration to come up with a plan to inspect our roads and pave cuts, $500,000 later to a third party firm in Luzerne County with no questions about how often they will inspect , the numbers of hours as the standard ; instead , crickets . North Main Avenue bridge has a row of lights heading towards North Main Avenue that don't come on at night. This has been brought to your attention several months ago, crickets . Proper signage for trucks near our low bridges in our neighborhood s, crickets . Homeless people sleeping in culverts , crickets . Tom Coyne getting singled out for doing the right thing when finding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 private and privileged information left outside City Hall, several boxes. Instead of thank you, he got served along with crickets . 15 mile an hour signs near each of our schools should already be in place and don't correct me; instead , crickets . Poor water quality in Scranton . Lee Morgan brought an example a couple months ago. It makes me wonder if this water is safe to give to my cat, crickets . Condemned properties knocked down without notifying the property owner, crickets . Hundreds of properties that this administration knew nothing about were made aware by the city -- I'm sorry, by the county they're the responsibility of the city. This administration knew nothing about it, crickets . Well over a thousand properties have been built and received a certification of occupancy and still they only pay taxes on the land. This has never been addressed , crickets . It will take seven years for this administration to address no pools at Nay Aug, no dissatisfaction by any of you. Memories lost from children and families ; instead , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 crickets . This administration took a dying wish and a donation of land for a park and has turned it into a salt shed -- crickets . This administration also takes several years to address issues and would have costs less years ago. Instead , she's doing some in an election year and it promoting it as progress , crickets . This is what happens when you -- when your local officials do not listen to those who elected them. These are just some of the issues that won't be addressed under the watch of this administration and our current Council President . Dr. Rothchild , we need someone who could take the gavel and lead, someone who will get answers . Other women have sat in that very same chair and did very well. I believe that you could lead this body in a very critical year ahead. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Thank you. Your time is over. MR. MANCINI : So is yours. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? Mr. MARQUISE : -- Marquise , you guys 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 know my name. So we talk a lot about the homeless population . But there is two things with the homeless population . For one, a lot of these people -- okay, so how could I say this? For one, there's some people that want help and then on the other hand there is just outlaws , criminals . They don't care. They don't want to get rehab. They don't want to get a job. They don't want to get help, like, they're just outlaws . I'm out there with them every day. I just got physically assaulted by two of them. I told you guys this at the last meeting , you know what I'm saying? So I think that we have to think about that when it comes to helping the homeless . Like, there's only a portion of the homeless that want help. The other portion we need to get them off the streets and lock them up honestly , you know what I'm saying because there's a lot of criminals out there that are just smoking, drinking down there at the pavilion . I told you guys I went down there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 trying to do community service trying to clean it up. And what happened ? I got jumped. I came here. I tried to ask you guys for help about sending the police down there to police the environment . None of that happened . So I'm just wondering like when are we going to do something about this situation because it just makes no sense that none of the children can play down there because we have drugs down there. We have alcohol down there. We have violence down there. And I'm still being threatened to this day every time I go back to the Keystone Mission . So I'll just end it off by saying this, can you please send some police down there to police the pavilion how you guys used to do last year, like, stop giving the homeless people their way because a lot of these people are criminals . And that's all I got to say. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . Number one, Norma sent me a message just to remind the public that the Nay Aug Park Christmas light show will begin on Monday, this coming Monday, November 25th starting at 5 p.m. And that will happen every night leading up through the Christmas season and right up through New Years, I would imagine . So they do a great job up there and we typically have volunteers there with donation jars to help out, so just a reminder about that. Last week I got a little frustrated because I was concerned about the pool at Nay Aug. I scheduled a meeting with the Mayor and the Business Administrator and explained to them where I'm at. I had a guarantee that was going to happen. I had my picture taken up at Nay Aug in front of a big sign we're going to have an eight lane pool. We fought for that eight lane pool, every one of us up here. And all of a sudden I find out the funding 's cut. Well, I was assured , assured by the Mayor and the Business Administrator that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 number one, we are applying for a middle dollars of LSA -- that LSA Grant. Also, that there's 1.5 million dollars of interest gained through ARPA sitting in an account which would account for the eight lane pool. The first phase is the zero entry pool which that portion of it is 4.2 million dollars . And the reason being, it covers all the infrastructure for all the other pieces, the eight lane pool and the splash pad. So I have an assurance from our Mayor and our Business Administrator that that pool is going to happen. And I don't know how much longer I'll be on this Council , but I will continue to remind our Mayor and our Business Administrator that that was a commitment that was made. Every one of us here, all five of us fought for that. We want that pool up there as part of that project . I applaud the administration for all the work that's happening at all the parks expanding , you know, Oakmont Park's done. Robinson Park is almost done. They're starting to work, you know, going to get to work soon on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Capouse Avenue. There's been work done on many of the other parks. There's work already underway down at Weston Field with the skate park and pool down there. Connell Park is getting a new pool and on and on. There's about 17 different park projects spending 18 million dollars on park improvements . So I was a little heated last week. But I was assured by our Mayor and our Business Administrator that that pool is, in fact, going to happen. And that's all I have at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, a few comments . Thank you, Mr. King, for that update on the pool. Mr. King is correct I did meet with the Mayor and the Business Administrator at a point in time when they told me that we were not going to get a pool up at Nay Aug it was just going to be a splash pad. And the resident s of this city couldn't get over Lake Lincoln being done. So Mr. King is correct . We did fight for that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 pool. We did fight to get that eight lane section also up at Nay Aug and can't wait to see it complet ed although it's going to take some time. The homeless question was brought up tonight . Mr. Voldenberg , if we could reach out to the administration to see if there is an update with the homeless task force. I did get a call today about vagrancy along 7th Avenue. We did mention it. It's at least over a month or two ago that the cold weather is coming and we wanted to be proactive and we haven't heard anything since. So if we could get an update from that committee . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : I had some questions from November 12th about the FEMA project s. We did have FEMA projects from dating back to 2018. It's been something I have been talking about since 2018 and staying on top of that. We got some answers back. We do not have a reimbursement timeline . We will be reimbursed 100 percent for those projects . The city does have to spend the money and do the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 work first. And then we have to apply for reimburse ment. Tonight here in caucus Eileen Cipriani said all but one of those project s is completed and that one project is being finished now, happy to see that. Happy to see a little bit more information coming out of the Business Office. When it comes to ARPA money, questions were asked about reallocating some of the unused money to Nay Aug pool. And the answer we got from that last week is that it will be reallocated into stormwater . That's all for tonight , Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, thank you. First, I know Miss Jeffries came tonight and had some additional questions about the unsheltered task force and I know she had to leave early. And I provided updates previously so maybe she wasn't present at those meeting s, but I'll make sure to connect with her after the meeting so she knows where things are at.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 I have been told they do plan on having another meeting before the end of the year, haven't received a date yet and that there weren't really any further updates . They would continue to have the Code Blue shelters like they have in past years. So that will be helpful for when it's a certain temperature that we could provide that shelter for people. But, you know, I'm hoping in the future there will be more information on if we're going to get -- if anyone is going to be building an additional shelter within the city because we do need more shelter space. So that's on that point. And then there was a concern brought up during citizens participation about the pave cut fees and inspection . And we do have a piece of legislation on tonight and I was going to speak on that when it came up. But I'll just mention now that -- I believe it's 5-C that we're going to be changing that ordinance . And I'm hopeful that the changes that we have in there will help us to crack down on the pave cut inspections and make it easier for us to inspect them properly and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 follow the inspection throughout the process rather than what we were doing in the past. So I think that that's going to be a really helpful piece. I'm glad to see that on the agenda tonight . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I sat in the same room with Mr. Schuster with the initial pool discussion before ARPA money was even here. And I clearly remember the Mayor and the business manager saying municipalities aren't in the pool business anymore. Splash pads are trending . So these are initial conversations . So I'm so proud of our resident s and our Council that rose to the occasion and said, no, we want a pool. We're going to get a pool. The only problem I have with this whole process was -- you know, and I remember being told at that same meeting we can't use ARPA funds, can't, can't use any loss revenue to pay for the pool which wasn't true because when ARPA -- the people that Anser company that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 was here -- still here to manage our ARPA funds, I finally asked them in person. I said were we able to use? Absolutely . But it wasn't the direction of administration . That's the answer I got. Horrible , but that's the answer I got, not the answer I wanted. So moving forward -- so we could have paid for the pool. There could be a pool up there right now. I wasn't happy. The only thing I disagree with -- I mean, we're getting a pool and I'm glad to hear that you met with the Mayor and they're committed . We'll have to keep our eye as usual and like always. But I don't want the bells and whistles first, pickleball courts or anything else. I want the pool first. That was the only thing I differed in agreement with -- I didn't want the master plan. But I get, you know, it might have been required . But all of a sudden, we're getting the bells and whistles and the pool's on hold, still not happy. Just saying my peace. All right. So next, I would like to congratulate Deputy Chief Martin Monahan on his retirement .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Deputy Chief Martin Monahan 's career started in 1987 when he held the ranks patrol officer , detective sergeant , fire marshal, commander of the special operations group and most recently , of course, deputy chief. Deputy Chief Monahan , I want to wish you continued success with your retirement and future endeavors . Thank you for your service and dedication to the city and the safety of our residents . So there's been great discussion lately about Engine 10. We have some legislation up on West Mountain and -- I'm sorry, East Mountain . And during that conversation , I was in contact with someone who took the lead. Her name is Mary Ann Warpus -- I'm sorry, Jean Marie Warpus. I apologize . And what she actually did recently and rallied all the residents up there and had a petition signed by 634 resident s up there. That's a message . I'm happy -- and I'm going to read it. I'm happy to announce this. And, Mr. Voldenberg , I would like you to put this in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Third Order next week and make sure administration gets a copy of this. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : If you would, please. Thank you. So the petition was simple and it's right to the point. Once again our Engine 10 was in the news. And it was at this time when they were gathering -- circulating this petition and getting signatures . At this time we have the unanimous support of all City Council members -- and that happened -- who agree to keep the engine on the mountain . This petition containing the signature s of East Mountain residents is in support of Council members and to affirm that this is our wish to have Engine 10 remain on the mountain . So I'm very proud of them and their work and the work that Jean Marie -- so, I'll give you this after the meeting . And I believe that's it. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . My comment is also about Nay Aug pool. I have a different concern about it also. We applied for a RACP grant that would be for use for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 second phase of the Nay Aug Pool Project . And we were denied that, of course. You know that by now. But that would have been a benefit for all of the citizen s in the City of Scranton . Now, although I did see a RACP Grant of 5 million dollars given to Fidelity Bank, this in addition to 4 million dollars that they are in -- received in RACP grants. So to me, that seems to benefit a private entity instead of all of the citizens of Scranton would benefit from a grant. But we did apply for another grant for Nay Aug for the second stage of the pool project . And it is in 5-H this evening . We're going to be voting on it. But the progress at Nay Aug Park right now they are doing the infrastructure for both pools, the pool house and the pump house. And they are also doing the stormwater project . If you go up there, you'll see it. It is dug all up and that is all in progress . So I hope that we will continue that. But I'm confident that we will find the money and get that pool -- the pool in. That is all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I just ask that Solicitor Gilbride take a review to compare this with the recent legislation that we've already passed. And if, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could reach out to the administration and see how they came to the conclusion . There's some things in here that seem to strength this ordinance , but we just passed legislation on the same exact thing within the last few months so how they came to the conclusion s and why they made the changes .

ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I know other Council members brought this up earlier . But I'm fully behind our Nay Aug swim complex . And I'm glad we're submitting this grant application . And I'm hopeful we'll be successful in it and be able to continue on with the project and stay with it until it's completed . And I know we've already reiterated that we all want to see that happen, but mostly because we know that the residents want to see that happen. And it's going to help a lot of people who want to be able to swim during the summer and enjoy that space. And we have a really great vision and plan for it. And we always want to see that come to fruition . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I really haven't had a chance to speak about it in depth since the discussion s that we had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 initially . But this is something that benefits -- could benefit all of the citizens . It could benefit all age groups. It was something I said repeatedly at that point in time that it's all age groups. And I don't want us to forget that like I said before, initially this was going to be a splash pad. Council fought hard to get a pool. And the first concept of that pool was a 2 foot deep pool. DR. ROTHCHILD : Three. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, I'll be accountable there, 3 foot pool. We fought for that size olympic size swimming pool. And it's in the plans at this point in time.
