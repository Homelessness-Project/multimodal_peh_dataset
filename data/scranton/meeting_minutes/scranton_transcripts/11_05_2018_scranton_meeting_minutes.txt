MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, I just have two quick comments and kind of housekeeping from last week, Mrs. Schumacher asked me to send out a question to our police and fire. I want to thank Chief Graziano and Chief Desarno for getting back to us on a timely basis. Chief Desarno said yes, all of the Fire Department is to report anything from a misdemeanor on up to their superior and Carl -- Chief Graziano has sent us an e-mail and in that e-mail it states, "Officer s who are arrested , cited or come under investigation for any criminal offense in this or any other jurisdiction shall report this fact to a supervisor as soon as possible . The supervisor shall report the same via chain of command to the Superintendent of Police." So in both cases it is pretty clear that anything -- arrests from a misdemeanor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 on up on both sides of the spectrum is reported to the supervisor . Secondly , we did hear back from Mr. Fallon on a Port-a-John for Weston Park. His answer was the only -- the only park in the city that gets a wintertime Port-a-John is Nay Aug and that's due to all of the heavy foot traffic with the Christmas lights, but if we would, Mrs. Reed, if we could send something to Director Fallon asking him that I request one put in Weston Park based on foot traffic and usage and if you would like to get back to me on that I would be sure happy to have a conversation with him, and if it's needed, you know, I would like to have one there. If he can convince me otherwise , I would like to have that conversation as well. And that's all I have right now. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I just would like to quickly clarify my position that I stated last week that I'm not sold on a prosed pocket park on the corner of Wyoming Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 and Linden Street. I would just first like to say that I'm absolutely a proponent of downtown green spaces and I'm not and convinced that is possible for that land to be developed anyway. I'm just not sold on this proposal because the city, including the administration and also this council , along with any outside groups, we all need to do a better job at communicating how this project as well as other projects achieve a broader plan and a broader vision for economic development in this city. Exactly how this is achieved is a conversation I plan on having with by colleagues , the administration and a variety of other stakeholders in the coming weeks and a months. And then just quickly , I would also like to remind everyone that tomorrow is Election Day and I urge everyone to get out and vote. In doing so, I ask that you not fall victim to the bigoted , deceitful and divisive rhetoric of our president . I ask that you vote tomorrow for a country we could once again all be proud of. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Thank you. First of all, in light of a sometimes raucous city council meeting last week I'd like to reinforce some comments I made previously about the topic of civil discourse . First of all, I respect the public's right to speak their minds. In fact, I encourage it, but I also have respected and have always tried to follow the basic rules of civil discourse . To be respectful and to not make a personal . And, by the way, it never hurts to actually stick to the issues at hand. In civil discourse , you actually use logic, use persuasion , use your facts and information to make your point and to defend your position and in civil discourse you would not attack someone personally . Of course, you are always entitled to your opinion , but if someone disagrees with that opinion you should then treat that person with that same respect that you would be treated with. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 The reality is if you truly want to convince someone else that your position or your opinion is valid you can achieve that in many cases through civil discourse . You will never, and I mean never, convince someone to side with your position by using derogatory terms, insults and ridicule . It just doesn't happen that way. So it should be noted though that my comments this evening and other times -- and at other times are not on this particular subject -- are just not meant for what happens here in our little slice of heaven that we call city council meetings next week. They are meant for those at every level of government and even for those that are engaged in the community at large and wherever debate on the issues of today are occurring . We all have a responsibility to work towards our -- work our way back and find our way back to a place where we can genuinely listen to each other and respect each other's opinions no matter how diverse those opinions are from our own, and only then can we begin to build a true consensus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 for a better Scranton and maybe a better world. That's all I have on that particular issue. A few thoughts about tomorrow , tomorrow is Election Day. First and foremost, please exercise your right to vote. I would like to leave you with a couple of quotes about the process . "No one, nobody, will ever deprive the American people of the right to vote except the American people themselves , and the only way they could do this is by not voting." Franklin Delano Roosevelt . "For this nation to remain true to its principals we cannot allow any American vote to be denied. The right to vote is the crown jewel of the American liberties , and we will not see it's luster diminished ." Ronald Reagan. And, finally , some inspirational advice from none other than Mahatma Gandhi who said simply and eloquently , "Be the change that you wish to see in the world." So tomorrow all of us could be the change by going to your local polling place 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 and again exercising our right to vote. That's all I have for now. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I just wanted to update everybody on the storm water report from Arcadis . We did get an update from the business administrator . Tony Dill, who came and presented to us I think about a month ago, said that at this point they are on the same schedule as he indicated back on September 11. Within a month of completing the digitizing , they should be ready to report their preliminary rate analysis recommendations and hold a workshop which according to Mr. Dill will be held mid-January 2019, and according to Mr. Dill it's going to take another one to two months to finalize the budget, rate structure and credit policy concepts and memorandum , so that looks like February -March timeframe of 2019 for completing the full report. He also goes onto say that this is will in part depend on interaction with the city and how quickly feedback is provided 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 and decisions can be made. Next week they are going to start preparing some preliminary concepts regarding a credit policy and he will share that feedback prior to preparing the draft memorandum . Also, an update on the tree house, the city solicitor provided the following update: The review, the bid proposals, that has been completed , they were open September 24. Mar Paul was the company that was awarded the contract which is now being circulated for signatures . Work is expected to commence in the coming weeks. The first thing that's going to be addressed , according to the city solicitor , is the concrete supports on the bottom of the tree house and then structural steel, so that's an update on those two issues. Just a reminder that this Wednesday , November 7, we are going to have an idea session with our young people in the community so the purpose of this is to listen to ideas from our young people. We reached out to all of the high schools and the local colleges and universities . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Council is trying to engage them because they are a very important part of our community and that will be broadcast on ECTV. Also, we discussed in the caucus about an update to our Ethics Code which is written in 1978 so I have been working on that over the last few weeks and Solicitor Minora has been reviewing it. We are going to try to get it on the agenda for November 19 so I'm very hopeful that that will happen so that we can get it passed before the end of the year. Also, I'd like to make a motion that Scranton City Council reschedule our meeting for the week of the November 12, 2018, to Tuesday , November 13, 2018. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? We did actually -- first you make the motion. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure, on the question , the reason I make this motion, and I have said this before, but I do think that we are missing too many meetings where every time there is a holiday since this new schedule 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 has been put in place we are canceling meetings every time, and coincidentally , holidays fall mostly on Mondays , so it's my belief that moving forward we really should make an effort, and I have said this before, to reschedule the meetings for another day that week. There is no reason that we can't do that. There is important things on our agenda and I think we should make that a matter of regular practice . MR. ROGAN: On the question , we did discuss this through e-mail and a little bit last week as a group. There was talks about having a special meeting next week specifically for Item 6-A, but there was no way for all five members to coordinate on a day when all five members were available . MR. GAUGHAN : Well, this isn't even for the -- this wouldn't be a special meeting . This actually would just be a regularly scheduled meeting in place of the Monday meeting which we would have off because of Veteran 's Day. I think we should have that regardless. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 question . Those in favor? MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Opposed ? MR. PERRY: No. MR. EVANS: No. MR. ROGAN: No. The nos have it and the motion fails. MR. GAUGHAN : That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Nothing at this time. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION - AN ORDINANCE - AUTHORIZING THE TRANSFER OF A VACANT PARCEL OF PROPERTY OWNED BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE LACKAWANNA COUNTY LAND BANK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL COOPERATION AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN THE LAND BANK, LACKAWANNA COUNTY, CITY OF SCRANTON AND SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT , PROPERTY MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS 2935-2937 PITTSTON AVENUE, SCRANTON , PA 18505. MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ACCEPT AND EXECUTE THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE CLEAN DIESEL GRANT PROGRAM (DERA) GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $128,723.00 TO REPLACE TWO (2) STREET SWEEPERS WITH NEW CLEAN DIESEL STREET SWEEPERS . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I give the administration a lot of credit for going through with this grant program . As was reported months ago, the city only has one street sweeper at this time and when we put the street sweeping schedule out it's almost impossible for one truck to make it through over 23 square miles in the city. Most people think that the street sweeper just buzzes through the neighborhood , but the truck has to go and dump off all of the debris and everything that it picks up so there is a lot that goes into it and then, of course, the street sweeper gets called to other areas if there is more pressing need. So I think getting two new clean diesel vehicles is a great step, but what I would like to see in the future is an investment made, and I think we were on our way with this legislation , to make sure that we have one street sweeper for every section of the city. I think that would be the ideal goal, so hopefully we can do that. I do have a question on this, Mrs. Reed. According to the legislation we have $386,169 match and in the backup it says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 that's going to be made available within the 2018 budget and then reallocated in the 2019 budget as needed, so if we could just get clarification from Mr. Bulzoni on how that is actually going to work. That's all I have on that. Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question , I think one thing that gets lost a lot of times with sweep sweepers, I think people see a street sweeper and they think it's going to take care of their street and it looks clean and whatever the case may be, but the reality is street sweepers are really a vital tool in the ongoing effort to control storm water. I mean, we can't minimize that anymore than that because it's keeping the catch basins clean, it's keeping debris out of the catch basins and that, to me, is the most important thing we can do by adding street sweepers to our community . Is it nice to get our streets cleaned ? Absolutely . But if we don't take care of those critical catch basins that are full of debris every single day then we are just wasting our time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 So certainly I support to effort to get additional street sweepers on the streets , but I agree with the Councilman Gaughan at the minimum we need one for every section of the city. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.

MR. ROGAN: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A, what is your pleasure ? MR. EVANS: Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. PERRY: Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I'm going to be voting for this to move it through regular order, but since we won't be going through regular order I'll be voting against it in Seventh Order. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Any time you go to borrow $23 million and especially in a deal like this as we hard last week in caucus that has so many moving parts, there is so many different things that can happen, I think it's incumbent upon city council to take all three weeks to investigate the deal and do their research , so I certainly need more to evaluate this. I don't think it's acceptable , although , I do understand that they are on a tight timeline , but the timeline of council is three weeks, especially with borrowing $23 and a deal of this magnitude and I don't think that it's acceptable that the administration has known apparently about this deal since June or July, from what I understand I just found out about it last Monday and then we are expected to vote in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 two readings , so I don't find that acceptable . As I mentioned last week, I'm also concerned , I think we should all be concerned about the lawsuit that deals with the Scranton Sewer Authority and what effect that would have if we lost that lawsuit and who would be on the hook for all that money. So, again, I understand the reasoning behind this deal, I understand why the administration is doing it for the savings on the MMO, but I don't think we should rush this through in two council meetings . I think we should take the full three weeks to make sure that everyone has evaluated this deal and I don't think that -- I don't think any piece of legislation should be rushed through , so I'll be voting no for those reasons . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: Yeah, on the question . I think, of course, we have questions , but I've had general conversation about this issue with the Pennsylvania Economy , the business administrator and of course with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the principal that attended our caucus last week so I feel I've done my due diligence . I strongly feel at this time it's the right thing to do. That is putting a savings of approximately $4.5 million into this year and next because of a provision in Act 205 that allows for this type of transaction is in my opinion sound public policy, so one of the take-aways from all of those conversations that I've had is that time is of the essence , and as Councilman Gaughan said, there is a lot of moving parts, it's a very complicated transaction , and that is why time is of the essence . So I feel extending the legislation to next week could possibly put this transaction in jeopardy , so I'm not willing to take that risk at this time and that's while I'll be voting to suspend the rules and approve this legislation . MR. ROGAN: Just a point of order, this initial vote is just on passing the legislation to Seventh Order. Then there will be a motion made, so at this point we are just voting on the legislation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. EVANS: Okay. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? MR. GAUGHAN : No. MR. ROGAN: The ayes have it and so moved. MR. PERRY: I make a motion to suspend the rules to move Item 6-A to Seventh Order for final passage . MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? Yes, on the question . I believe my colleagues kind of summed everything quite nicely. I believe , and we have discussed this for a week now, comprehensively I believe we are all basically on the same page with this plan, but I do understand the concerns procedurally wise that Councilman Gaughan and Donahue have with going from Sixth to Seventh , but as Councilman Evans said, there is a timeline and this is something I feel 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 needs to get done and, again, the bones and structure of this I'm confident with and happy and although we don't like to suspend rules and I feel this is such a case where we can make am amendment to it. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? MR. DONAHUE : No. MR.

I think that's what caused confusion where we are showing a one paragraph -- MS. REED: 6-A was the pension note, 6-B is the 2010 TAN. MR. ROGAN: Right, and for some reason on our iPad it's showing as a smaller item, but as long as it's the same -- as long as we are voting on the same legislation I think we are okay.

ROGAN: I think we are on Seventh Order now. MR. MINORA: 6-B repeated itself in the document , which is Granicus , but it says the same thing twice, so I think we are covered . MR. ROGAN: I knew it sounded like the right legislation but then it was -- MR. MINORA: It was just repeated. MR. ROGAN: But it's not that long. MR. MINORA: It was just repeated in total from what we have in Granicus and what she has in her document , we don't know why, but it's fine as it went. MR. ROGAN: Okay. MS.
