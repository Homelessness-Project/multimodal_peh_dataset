Within thepastweek,alawsuit was concluded thatconcluded thefactthatthere wasacapthatScranton hasnotmaintained atleastforthepasttenyears.Thisis alongthelinesofseveral lawsuits ,onein whichtheSewerAuthority posedaquestion oneinwhichthereisarental registration fee,it'salsocalled intoquestion anda garbage fee.Forthenextyear,ifwetally theselawsuits together thelikelihood that theCityofScranton canbefacing upwards of$100million incoststheymustrecoup or findsomewaytopayoff. Now,myquestion orcomment isin lightofthesethings whatsortofpolicies andstrategy couldpossibly bethecasefor thecitycouncil orthemayor?Ifweare goingtobehonest,ifjustoneofthese things pansoutthecitywouldbeouta functioning budget fortheyear.For instance ,theAct51lawsuit .Partofthe penalty isthattheydonotcollect taxes pastastatecap.Thecurrent yearloan hasn'thadten-yearoverage forthenext1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 yearwewillabletohave$10million and anyone whopaidintothatcapwillhaveto beresponsible forrefunding ofuptothree years.Basedonmycalculation ,weare talkingabout30to50million fromthat lawsuit alone.Currently thecityis appealing it,spending taxdollars to attempt tocontinue totaxthepeople. ItseemsthattheCityofScranton isonlyfocused onfinding morerevenues , andthere'sneveradiscussion ofcutting spending .Iknowtheysaytheydo,butthen Idomyresearch andthereisacitycalled Bethlehem ,Pennsylvania .Theyhavethesame sizeroughly ofScranton 75,000people. WhenIlookintotheirbudget,theysomehow manage tooperate therecityof75,000at $72million ,whileScranton required upwards of$140million .Sothat'sbasically that Scranton requires twoBethlehems inorderto operate itscity. Now,whatarethecostdrivers that aredriving thecity?Whatisaboutthe citythatmakesissoexpensive tolive here?Countlesspeople whoworkdowntown do1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 notliveinthecity.Businesses flockjust toneighboring places justoutside ofthe corridor tothiscitybecause ofthetax structure .Property investors donotwant toinvest inthecitybecause theysayeven though thehouses arecheaptheydon'twant tobehitwiththetaxesortheir improvements because thehouselanguished in valuebecause theyhaven'tbeenkeptup because ofproperty taxes. Myquestion orcomment toyou, gentlemen ,isinallhonestly being forthright andhonest whatareyougoingto donextyear?Howisnotthecity--howis thecitynotgoingtogobankrupt ?Howis thecitygoingtodowithout revenue ?If thesewerdealisreversed that'sa$160 million rightthere,thenyouaddinthe otherlawsuits thereisabsolutely noway thatthecityisnotgoingtointo bankruptcy . Furthermore ,within thefirst quarter thereweretwobondsthatwere passed inthepast15yearsthatcannot be refinanced .That'sanother $25million .If1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 wearegoingtobehonest,gentlemen ,ifwe aregoingtobeforthright ,proper statesmen ,proper public servants ,wehave tobehonest withpeople andtellthemthat thatasthings standthecityisdefinitely goingintobankruptcy ,it'sjustamatter of when.Ifthecityistounlawfully tax people tomakeitthrough fortheyear,if itneedstobringbreaklawsthrough garbage feesorrental registration orshakepeople downtomakeduethenit'sallanindication thatthecity'sbudget isnotsustain able. WhyisBethlehem helpabletorunacity withapopulation sizeofScranton at$72 million whenweneed$140?Whereisthe extra$70million coming from?Whatinthe citythatrequires that?Iwouldloveto know.I'msureyougentlemen owethepeople ofScranton ananswer.

Ilooked atthecomments thatthe mayorhadonNedAbrahamsen 'sfees,hesaid thattheSewerAuthority pay.Thattheydid nothavetogothrough thebidding process .

Fist,Iwouldliketosaythatwas--not that,butwhenyouhadthepresentation honoring somebody atcitycouncil soIhope andlookforward tothemoment whenthe people whenIhavebrought uptosuggestions gethonored hereinthecity,sothatis1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 something thatIseehappening forthe people,butIrecognize andit'scoolthat happens hereinthecity. SotodayI'mnotheretospeakabout myresearch ,I'mheretotalkaboutthe Scranton School District because that'salso apending issueformyself,andasother people hadcameuphereandsaidthatthe cityisfailing thestudents here,andit's honestly verytragic.Inowworkforthe Scranton School District soIgettosee someofthesestudents andhowtheir education isbeingfacilitated ornot facilitated andthefactthattherearemany highschool students thatcan'tdosimple division adding,subtracting orworking with fractions isdevastating tomebecause these students arenotreadytoleavehighschool andgetintotherealworld. Sowiththatbeingsaid,Iwasvery curious aboutwhatsortofresearch thatthe cityhasdonewhenitcomestostudents , demographics ,GPAscores,performance , teacher demographics ,things likethat.So Ilooked ontheScranton School District1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 website ,thereisnotthatmuch.Theonly datathattheyhaveisforPSAA'sandall thestandardized tests.Asweknow,across thecountry standardized testsarenot always thebestwaytogaugestudents economic performance . SoItookituponmyself toreach outtotheschool boardandIspokewitha womanwhoisapolicy advisor ,wehavebeen corresponding withe-mailsbackandforth alldayandIaskedherifthereisanydata thatthecityhasdoneondemographics , education ,GPAretention ,graduation rate, things ofthatsort,andItoldherthaton thewebsite theyonlyhadthestandardized testscores andthosestatistical data available ,butthat'snotwhatI'mlooking forbecause it'sscattered amonggrades and it'snotindicative oftheinside ofthe district thatweareinthatthesepeople arepaying taxesfor. SoshesentbackthesamePDF'sof thedocuments thatIwaslooking at,andso Ijustwanttoknowwhythecityifwesee thatpeople areveryupsetaboutwhatis1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 goingonintheschools whyarewenotgoing outtocommission ourowndatasothatway wecanbetter theseprograms .Whyarewe nottalking totheteachers andthestudents andtheparents attheschool andfinding outwhythosethings arenotworking .Why can'twelookupontheinternetthe Scranton School District andseehowmany students areineachschool,what'sthe demographic breakdownbecause thenwecan really seethedisparities inlearning and education andwhoisgetting thosethings, because IcanseeitandI'maproduct of theschool district .I'maproduct ofmy brothers beingshunned outoftheschool district ,andlikeyousaid,thereisalways ofthesestudents herewholiterally are leaving notknowing howtowriteapaperfor college andthat'sdisgusting .Andwetalk aboutbuilding businesses ,fromwhere?All ofthesestudents areleaving because the cityisnotdoinganything forus. SoIreally wouldliketoseeifthe school boardcanputtogether somesortof dataonthecitysothatwhenwecan1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 allocate fundswheretheyneedtobe,bring better programs .Iknowit'stimetostart reevaluating budgets somaybewecandothat andseewherethestudents arelacking .We arefalling underneath thestate requirements andthestandardized testssoI amgoingtoguessthatititsprobably the sameoutside ofthestandardized tests.Why aren'twetalkingtothestudents andseeing whattheyneed?

Sothatwasmaymainconcerns for todayandbecause ,likeIsaid,weare starting togetnewlocalgovernment , budgets arestarting tobedeveloped ,I thinkwereally needtogetintheseschools andfigure outwhat'sgoingon,figure out1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 howthesestudents cangetabetter education because attheendoftheday that'sallwehave.Thankyou.

ThisweekIdidhaveacouple of residents inWestMountain talktomeandI knowMr.Gaughan talked tothesame individual whoishaving alotofproblem withstormwaterrunoffand,obviously ,that isthebeginning oftheproblem that'sgoing downtoKeyser Valley.Ididdiscuss with Attorney Minora looking intothepossibility ofsometypeofaction against Newton Township ,whichissprawling .Therearea number ofnewhomesupthereandeverynew1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 homesthat'sbuiltiscreating moreandmore wateroffontopofthemountain .Itis coming downWestMountain andintoKeyser Valley,soIthinkthat'ssomething weneed tolookintoifthereisapossibility of actual cooperation withitandputsome retention pondsontopofthemountain .So that'ssomething wewillbecontinuing to workon. And,finally ,Iwanttotalka little bitabouttheschool boardandschool district andit'sfunnythatthetiming is veryoddthatthelastweekIspokeabout shared services between theschool district andthecityandnotknowing thatthe Auditor General wasgoingtobecoming in andissuing thisreport regarding theschool district ,butitreally makesme,youknow, whatIsaidlastweekevenmoreimportant thatitiscritical thatthecityandschool district worktogether andfindwaystosave moneywhenever wecan.LastweekI mentioned garbage which,forinstance ,the citygarbage trucks drivebyeveryschool in thecityandthecityismuchbetter at1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 doinggarbage thantheschool district is. Ontheothersideofthecoin,the school district hasaverylargemaintenance staff,muchlarger thanthecity's.That typeofcooperation canpreventthecity fromhaving toputouttobidcleaning ,for instance ,atdifferent facilities .Thereis anumber ofways,Ibelieve ,thattheschool district andthecitycanworktogether .I knowthisissomething thatbeentalked aboutforalongtimeandhasn'thappened , butIdidbringthisupincaucus andwith mycolleagues agreement Iwouldliketosend aletter totheschool district formally asking tobeginsetting upan intergovernmental committee between thecity andtheschool district .Ididmeetwith theirsolicitor thismorning .Italked to oneoftheschool's--theschool board solicitor andheseemed veryreceptive to theideaandIthinkwehaveto--thisis something thathastoreally beexplored . AsIsaid,it'sbeentalked aboutforalong timeandnumerous reports ,butitisreally something thatIthinkweneedtodoand1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 thisAuditor General 'sreportcoming out thisweekreally showstheneedfortrying toworktogether .AsIsaid,theschool district andthecity,it'sthesame taxpayers .Whether ,youknow,thecity's budget isinmuchbetter shapethanitwasa fewyearsago.Theschool district , unfortunately ,hasmovedfromtheopposite direction .SoI'mhopeful thatwecanget thatletter outtotheschool district , hopefully theschool boardmembers takeus upontheofferandthenwecancomeupwith acommittee ,whether it'sacouple of members ofcouncil ,ourbusiness administrator ,orwhatever wethinkmakes themostsensetogetacommittee goingand trytoworkthrough someoftheseissues to findsomecostsavings tothetaxpayers . Andthatisallfortonight .Thankyou. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Rogan. Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.First,I havealways hadtheforemostrespect for FrankNaughton soIwashonored tonight by citycouncil 'saction tonameouroffice1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 afterMr.Naughton ,hewasavery,verygood man. Also,Iwillconcur withwhat Councilman Rogansaidabouttheschool district .Ithinkit'saverygoodideaand thinkthattherearealotofsynergies that couldbeexploited tothebenefit ofboth governments . Soacouple ofthings.Ihave previously identified atleast15feesthat Ithinkarebeingcharged bythecitythat aregenerating lessthan$10,000peryear eachforatotalrevenue of$61,600.SoI haveaskedLIPSonnumerous occasions for justification forthosefeesaswellasif thereanythatareactually needed through statemandate .Theresponse tothatrequest foroverthelastsixmonths hasbeenno response ,soIthinkit'ssafetosay whether it'sperception orreality ,thatwe havebeensending anegative message toour business community through excessivefees, taxesandredtapeandwehavetofindaway tochange thatnarrative . Also,wearenearing ourbudget our1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 timeandIwanttomakeaninformed decision onwhattodowiththesefees?My inclination isto,likeanything else,get ridofthemall,butIwanttomakesure thatthat'sjustified andIneedthat information fromLIPSASAP.Someofthe feesmayberequired .Therecouldalso duplication ofexisting statefees, licensing andrequirements .So,Ms.Reed, ifyoucansendanother memotoDeputy Director Oleski asking againforthe justification forthefeesandI'llgiveyou alistofthefeesandanything else tomorrow . Iwouldalsoaskanother request againforLIPS,Ineedaspreadsheet ,andI haveaskedforthisbefore,fortheyear 2016andtheyear-to-date2017showing the amount ofquality oflifetickets issued eachandeverymonth.Howmanywereissued byLIPSinspectors andhowmanywereissued bytheScranton Police Department through ourCOM-Dpatrol program .Whatisthe collection rateoftheticketsandhowmany tickets wereturned intocitations ,andalso1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 whatisthesuccess rateatthedistrict justice level? WhenIbrought thisideauptothe cityIfeltitcouldbesuccessful andcould turnthecorner onblight inthe neighbor hoodsthatitcanbeaneffective tooltofightthatfight,butIremain concerned thatthefeesarestilltoohigh andthatthepolicy ofticketing multiple offense atthesametimehascreated a situation thatisdriving property owners to themagistrate forappeal instead ofsimply justpaying theticket andcorrecting the problem . SoIremind somethatLIPSisnot andshould notbeconsidered aprofit center.Thefeesmaybeadjusted downward andsomething tobelooked atin2018but, again,weneedthedatatomakethat decision andmakeaninformed decision . CityCouncil,onadifferent topic, months agoagreed withconcurrence fromthe administration thatmoneyfromthesewer transaction wouldnotbeputintothe pension plansuntilcertain conditions were1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 met.Primarily thehiring ofathirdparty administrator andatrustagreement that spelled outguaranteed pension reformssuch asareduction oftherateofreturn.Well, wefelt,aswestilldo,thattoachieve evenamodest amount ofpension reform that wasaminimum requirement .Iwouldremind theadministration ,theunions,andthe pension boardthattheclockisfull ticking .Inordertobeassured thatthe moneyisputintothepensions in2017, legislation should betocitycouncil with thethirdpartyadministrator aswellasthe trustagreement overthenextfewweeks, mostlikely nolaterthanNovember 16. Also,Iwouldliketoknowthat therehavebeencomments madeoverthelast fewmonths aboutthepositive return that thepensions couldhavereceived ifthe moneywasputinthepension sooner.I can'tdisagree withthat,butIwouldlike tohavethat,allofourconditions metby Junewhichwastheoriginal target date, however ,thatdidnothappen.Soatthis point,wemustcontinue tobewilling to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 foregothatshort-termgainorguarantee of long-termreform,something government needs tobedoingmoreof,thinking long-term. Infact,oneofmyfavorite subject s,whichIdidn'ttalkabouttoomuch lastweek,thereassessment tomorrow . Additional information onthat,fairand equitable assessment toassure thattax burden isproperly spread amongallproperty owners.Theuniformity clause ofthestate constitution stipulates ,"Alltaxesshallbe uniform onthesameclassofsubject s." Sowhathappened whenassessment s arenotdoneregularly ?Inequities tothe taxbasedevelop ,overall taxbase decreases .Decreased taxbasemakesita harderforlocalgovernments toprovide services wedepend onlikepublic works, public safety and,ofcourse,education .So whatarethelocalgovernment consequences ofinaccurate dataassessments ? Municipalities likeeverybody elsetokeep up.Municipalities mightbumpupagainst themillage capthatrenewrevenue generation andresult inservice cuts.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 Municipalities areunable tosecure an accurately occurring growth andvaluethat wouldpreventtaxdecrease .Andwhatisthe impact ofmarket versus county assessed valuechange from1995to2016?Tax increases historically wouldhavebeenless necessary ifincreased values areproperly captured through anup-to-dateassessment . Revenue lossinthepastthrough inaccuracies couldberecouped andwhatis theeconomic impact ofanoutdated assessment ?Oldassessments oftenresult in higher millage thatcanscareoff businesses .Forexample ,Lackawanna County hasa28millrate.Luzerne Countyhasa1 millrate.Relative values ofbothrates beingthesame,theperception ofhigher millage isthedrawbackofattracting new businesses .Outdated assessments also invite appeals .Largehighly valued businesses inparticular typically seek appeals .Reduction ofthevalues canmean increases andinequity fortheother property owners,asignificant lossof revenue tolocalgovernments andease1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 stabilization ofthetaxbase. Business incentive fornew construction andrenovations .New construction andcertain renovations often bearahigher assessment morereflective of market value. Now,alloftheinformation Ijust discussed waspartofthepresentation to theLeague ofWomenVotersbythe Pennsylvania Economy League.Therearesome wouldcallthatinformation biased.Ifound thatinformation tobenotonlyunbiased but extremely factual .SoIhopeitwashelpful asyoumakeyourdecision tovoteyesorno onreassessment inlessthantwoweeks. And,finally ,Iwouldliketomakea briefcomment onthepresentation and request fromGlynis JohnslastThursday evening .Firstofall,Ithankyoufor bringing thistoourattention .It certainly isrecognition thatislong overdue.Aswithanyissuelikethis,the issuealways becomes whoisgoingtotake theleadandwhoisgoingtostepupandbe thenominated localsponsor aswellascover1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 thecostsassociated withtheprocess of getting themarkers placed ifandwhenthe application issuccessful .Whilecity council mustcontinue tobesupport iveof theinitiative ,wedon'thavetheresources totaketheleadonthisand,quite honestly ,I'mnotsurethecitycanshepherd thisinatimely manner without creating another bureaucratic layertotheprocess . But,again,theadministration alsoneedsto besupportive ofthisinitiative andIwould expect thattohappen. AsImentioned lastweekinmy discuss onhistoric preservation inthe downtown ,Iwaspreviously aformer president oftheArchitectural Heritage Association andIamcurrently aboard member ofthatsamegroup.SoIapproached several members oftheboardandthe Architectural Heritage Association has agreed tobethenominator andlocalsponsor andwillcollaborate withGlynis tomovein forward .Andtheyhavealways committed to beresponsible forallcostsassociated with creating andplacing thesemarkers once1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 approved bythePennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission . So,Glynis,yourgraduate thesis has justmovedfromtheconceptual stagetothe it'sgoingtohappen stage.So congratulations .That'sall. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Evans. Mr.Gaughan . MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,thankyou.First ofall,IjustwanttothankMrs.Reedfor putting together theeventwehadtohonor Mr.Naughton ,former cityclerkfor20 years.Notonlywasheawonderful city clerkbuthewasagreathusband ,afather, andhewasagreatfamily man,andIthought standing infrontofhisfamily youcould seethelocktheirfacesintheonlydid theymisstheirfather andMrs.Naughton missesherhusband ,butthiswastheirlife. Mr.Naughton spentalotoftimeincity hallandIthinkthatthatwasawonderful tribute toawonderful man. LastweekIbrought upseveral concerns abouttheGreenridge Senior Housing Apartment offofDickson Avenue,andsinceI1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 havementioned thatIhavehadseveral other people stepforward ,oneperson Ihaven't beenabletogetbackto,Ilefthera messageandshehasn'tcalled mebackyet.

MR.ROGAN:Second. MR.WECHSLER :There'samotion on thefloorandasecond,onthequestion ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,onthequestion . Iwouldlikeustosendthisletter,number one,sothatit'sdocumented ;and,number two,andsomepeople maythink,youknow, whyiscitycouncil getting involved in this,nobody elseisstepping uptothe platetohelpthesepeople.Frommy experience talking withtheseelderly people thereafraid tomakeanykindofmove.They areafraid tospeakoutbecause ofpossible repercussions ,getting kicked outofthe apartments andotherthings.SoIthink thisisagoodfirststeptomaking theArea onAgingawareofitandthentakeitfrom there.

Regarding Mr.Rogan'srecommendation aboutshared services ,Iwouldagreewith that,withtheschool district ,andIam goingtospeakonthattonight ,butIwould alsothink,andIalsobelieve ,thatoneof therecommendations thatshould be immediately followed bytheScranton School School Boardandtheadministrator upthe street isthesamerecommendation thatthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Auditor General madethisweek.I'llbea little bitnicer,buttogettheirheadsout oftheirrearends.Ithinkbefore youcan formanykindofcommittee theyneedtodo thatfirst,andIthinkthat'svery important .Sobefore wetalkaboutworking together Ithinkitistime,asmy grandmother wouldsayandMr.DePasquale ,to gettheirheadsoutoftheirrearends. Therecent auditoftheScranton School District andcomments bytheAuditor General ,oneofwhichisthatit'stheworst auditthathehaseverseen,areextremely concerning foranumber ofdifferent reasons .Theauditdemonstrated thatthere isaculture ofincompetent ,political backroomdealsanddecades ofgeneral disregard forwhatisgoodforthetaxpayers ofScranton thatinmyopinion hasinfected boththeschool boardandinsomewaysthe CityofScranton .Whenwetalkabout political pay-to-play,whenwetalkabout theno-bidbusing contract withthe DeNaples ,whenwetalkabouthealth insurance foraperson whoisnotevenan1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 employee oftheschool district ,andona citylevelwhenwetalkabouthanding out $200,000payments withnocontract ,justa handshake ,goonyourway,seeyoulater, here'sthepayment .

AsItravel around thecity,people aredisgusted andthisismaking themeven moresicktotheirstomach what'sgoingon.

Youarenotallowed tomakeaPlanBbudget. Youareallowed tochange thebudget in2018 byaslight percentage . Inregard toJudgeGibbons ,hehas decided inthiscase,whathehasnotdone ishehasnotgiventhecitizens orthecity aremedy ofwhatweshould doifthesetaxes areoutofline.Wecannot passthebudget thinkingthatmaybewewilloweamillion dollars ortwomillion dollars .Theonly alternative forPlanBistomeetour obligations astheyareestablished isto haveahugeproperty increase ,property tax increase .Thatistheonlyalternative that wehaverightnowwiththisbudget.The budget,thecostofthebudget,the expenses ,theyareset.Youmaybeableto cutalittle bit,butyouarenotgoingto beabletocutenough thatifyoueliminate theAct511taxthereisnoother alternative forthisbudget thantohavea hugeproperty taxincrease .Thereisnoway around it.
