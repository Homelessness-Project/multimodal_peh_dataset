DONAHUE : Are there any comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 on any Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So as Chairman of Public Safety, I just want to offer my condolence s and then sincere thoughts and prayers to the three Baltimore firefighters that were killed and the fourth that still remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition after the horrific fire in the row houses in Baltimore . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one thing. So the City -- they're developing an Economic Development Strategic Plan. And there are several steps in the process . But they are looking for input from the residents . And there is a survey available on the City website that they're asking people to complete . There is also paper copies available at City Hall and the library . And so I appreciate your input. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just another reminder that OECD is currently 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 accepting applications for the 2022 program year in terms of HUD funding . Normally you apply for this funding in the prior year. But OECD decided to try to simplify the process and have applicants apply for the current year. This year's applications are being submitted a little differently . You must submit the application on a neighborhood portal which is on the City's website by Friday, February 4th. If you have any questions or concerns or need assistance with the application process , please contact Liza Caroll at Lcaroll @scrantonpa .gov or Kelly Kraycer at Kkraycer @scrantonpa .gov. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . First, a little public service announcement . I haven't spoken about the public library in a while. But I was watching -- I watch a lot of TV. It's what we idle retirees do. And there are a lot of news stories 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 about requesting COVID-19 at home testing kits and they're free. But apparently the preferred way to make the request is going on the internet onto a government website . There's a phone number but people have been having trouble getting through on the phones. So a lot of the people even in Scranton do not have access to a computer . And do you realize that here in City Hall, the County Government Center, State Office building , even federal offices downtown , not one of them have a public use computer someplace where the public can go if they need to access a computer . So where do you go? You go to the your public library . Okay, even the Library Express we have two computers for that. And it's not just for requesting a COVID test. You know what we're getting into right now, ladies and gentlemen , tax season. You need to get forms. You need to get the instruction booklets . You just try going up to the IRS office. They won't even give you the time of the day let alone give you any more forms. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Those days are gone. They'll tell you go on the internet. So please, the public library exists to serve the needs of the people. Please use it. Also, I'd like to compliment the Times-Tribune on their three-day series on Scranton coming out of distress ed status. I don't know how many of you read the articles in the last three days. They were well-research , well-documented , well-written . I'm keeping them and I recommend everybody read them and pay attention to the lessons learned . So good work, Times. Okay. Today is January 25th, 2022. Do you know where your 2020 audit is? MR. DONAHUE : We have not received the audit yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. And any news on the status of the union contracts ? Are they still in negotiations ? MR. DONAHUE : To our knowledge they are still in negotiations . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. One thing I would like to point out as I go to the library every day, I go on their computers . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 It saves me a lot of money that way. But I noticed in Third Order tonight we have the December Controller 's report. But if you go onto the City's website and you go under financial archives and you look at the financial records , do you know the latest Controller 's report that they posted is September 's report? And I'm wondering , is there an issue with the website or is there a staffing issue? We hired, what is it, Keystone to start, you know, handling some of our requirements . Is anybody kind of monitoring , you know, how well we're doing with that City website because that is the way the majority of citizens get news about what's going on in the City. So we might -- and, you know, it may be something simple like, gee, you forgot to send a copy down to IT to put on the website . You know, it's kind of important . They have -- well, I see there's no audit on the website . That's how I know you don't have the audit yet. I'm assuming that -- I'm just hoping that it's not sitting in somebody 's desk drawer. But other than that, I look forward to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 a year with no distress ed status. And I'm happy that I went to the ceremony this afternoon . I thought it was a good thing. And let's see if we can keep the momentum going. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : And we'll reach out to both IT and the Controller 's office regarding the Controller 's report. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, if you see, you know, there's a list of all the Controller 's reports , the last one they uploaded was for September . MR. DONAHUE : I know -- so I know the Controller 's reports are -- MS. HODOWANITZ : -- published . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, they're distributed on a monthly basis to all department heads and the Council members . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, but nobody's uploaded them. MR. DONAHUE : We'll check with that. Ms. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you very much. Next speaker on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Council , I was speaking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 early this morning with someone much more knowledgeable than me, of course. And they commented on the new administration because they knew some of the people from the business world. They feel it's not much different from the old -- old one. You know, I don't care what anybody says. We're not stable enough to leave Act 47. We lack leadership . We've lacked leadership for years. It seems the only solution anybody ever comes up with is raise taxes. Nothing since Janet Evans has sat there has been done besides raising taxes. It's just gotten where that's all you could fall back on. You know, today's paper Mr. Cross says our taxes can go up another 20 percent between now and I think he said 2026. How much higher can taxes go for people in this City? You know, if we have a reassessment , it's going to cost 15, 20 million dollars . I can't do it in my head, but it's got to be a couple hundred dollars immediately a house in the whole county, doesn't it? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. DONAHUE : So that expense isn't the City's. That's the county's responsibility . MR. ELLMAN: Yeah, it just doesn't stop. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MR. ELLMAN: I can't see a reason in the world why something can't be done about these parasites that are hiding behind the Pure Charity Act. This is going on almost a hundred years not paying the taxes. They -- it's probably a good third of our good taxable properties from what I read in the paper. You know, three, four years ago Mr. Amoroso abscond ed with a 3 billion dollar grant that was for this people in this City. It was meant to fix the fire stations or fire trucks, something . Why can't the City go after that grant that Lackawanna College -- because this -- this should have been investigated from the very beginning . Amoroso wasn't an attorney and he signed papers. You know, the City has a black eye on all kinds of shady situations like that. Why can't somebody go after these -- through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Harrisburg all this taxes, it just got to end. You people haven't talked to anyone like I have. I bet our Mayor hasn't talked to 15 different people that vote in the different parts of the City like I imagine all of you when you collected your names. It's heartbreaking . And I stood here and said it before. But between the reassessment and the higher taxes and all the expenses that Wolf has allowed a carte blanche check for the utilities . There's got to be hundreds and hundreds of people going to lose their homes. There's no way they could keep paying that. And while I'm through , I'd like to say that I do support the restoration going on in this building . And I hope we can afford to keep it up. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, am I correct in reading the news that we have a new Chief of Police coming on? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. COYNE: As far as I've noticed , the Chief of Police -- the former -- almost former Chief of Police evidently has moved over in a different position and obviously is given absolutely no notice to move over to that position . And there's been no job posting or search for a replacement Chief of Police. This body has not been involved in it. And within four days, a new Chief of Police has been put in place by fiat. I don't think that's quite proper. I think it should have been at least brought to and informed as this body is one of the overseers for those departments . But once again, that has been side stepped . And having a Chief of Police just assigned is rather afoul of the rules as it has been for a while now. I was shocked by the Ethics Board meeting recently . We have a new director of the Ethics Board. The Ethics Board Director as one of his first acts asked whether or not the meeting could be changed from Wednesday because it was inconvenient for him. When it was not available to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 changed from Wednesday , they decided that instead of doing that, they would alter and make it a bi -- once every month meeting -- once instead of a monthly meeting once every two months reducing the time for the public by 50 percent without public input. On the plans for the recovery development plan, it was mentioned on the YouTube video that was put out, there was input from more than 45 stakeholders and in the same sentence it was also stated it was for -- attended by more than 60 community stakeholders . Is it 45? Is it 60? Multiple, multiple meetings were held with private commercial meetings , research analysis and community engagement ; but none of that is available to the public. And this was actually released with less than two weeks for the public to provide input, do research for this entire subject which is too fast for this process considering just date and time. And last, I handed in again the proposed amendment for the parking . Media in this town needs a parking space and a change for how the Parking Authority deals with them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 This amendment -- this amendment handles that. This body has quite a number of times had the light brought on subject s that they were unaware of by media in this area. It serves the public. And it needs to be available to do its research in City governments . That's why I proposed two years ago a parking space for press somewhere between the school administration building and the courthouse as those are the buildings of record. You have a library for research . School Board, City Hall, and the Country Courthouse , all places where you -- where media needs to do extensive public reporting which is time sensitive . I had also requested that media with proper -- proper credentials as shown a window placard , a license -- a state issued license and media license plates and/or a rack on the vehicle as you would see on that Newswatch 16, something that identifies the press should be allowed to park free in the pay for parking spaces. As a caveat in this ordinance , I had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 also put in there a limit of that they would not be allowed to use it on multiple days because I did not want this to become an abusive measure but a convenience and an aid to media in doing their jobs to report to the public. I hope that you'll reconsider this and get this pushed forward for this coming year. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : -- wear the mask, get dizzy. I just bought a new bunch of masks N95 and it's like you could hardly see straight . Okay. I'm pleased to hear that we're going out of distressed status. I don't know how much it means towards anything . And as much as the only thing we're ever probably offered from PEL was advice anyway. And they didn't keep some big spenders under control in the first place. That audit was mentioned again. We need all haste to get that straighten ed out. Let's make ourselves a new year's resolution that anybody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 that can't -- can't ante up and get their audit in, I mean, one or two months late; but every year since 2006 or '7, it's been a month later and a month later and a month later. Now it's not even on the same year. And it's time that changed. Oh, boy, once again, property taxes have come up. And last week we were talking about two more blocks basically going to tax exempt status. And it's really time that the State of Pennsylvania starts to kick in. And they don't like it, too bad. It's just ungodly how much -- what is that going to put us at, 40 percent , 38 percent ? I mean, you know, those are all high value houses up there too. I lived up in that neighborhood . You have a park right there. It's like having a humongous backyard . I didn't even bother with the backyard on that place I rented at the time. Okay, I was happy to hear about the TVs and once again, a round up of televisions . Don't throw them on your neighbor 's lawn for a change. But cardboard really needs to be given attention with all of the mail order. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 it's -- sometimes I'm seeing eight, nine, ten, boxes thrown out for trash. So if we can even tell the DPW if they are reasonably clean boxes, just leave them behind. You know, tell -- it's about time they kick in and do what's right. I have nobody to worried about once I'm gone. You're the people with the families . And on the Pennsylvania side, some good news in the paper today. It will probably wind up in the Supreme Court -- Pennsylvania Supreme Court for redistricting because nobody can agree. And it just goes to show you -- I'll be the first to admit, am I partisan ? Yes. You know, I'm willing to cut the other guy a break but when he don't want to cut me a break, that's the way it is. I don't need to like him. And that's all there is to it. On COVID, well, we're up about 870,000 people. Back around Christmas I heard about how some of the people that were guests might think that there's a computer chip install ed with COVID vaccine . Well, here's a little computer chip right here, a cell phone. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 And if this is turned on and I had like a criminal situation or something , I committed a crime, they could confiscate this and find out where in the hell I was. I like the crime channel on Comcast 111. It's all homicides and stuff. And some people will drive 5 or 600 miles in the night, kill their spouse and drive back with their cell phone on. And guess what? Life without parole. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. You too. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Not at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I will -- I'll save my comments for on the question . MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few. First, something that I brought up last week and I just wanted to provide an update on because I did have residents ask me about a property at 609 Prescott Avenue. So we did receive a response that it has been placed on the demolition list. It might not be first on the list, but they will get to that property . So I was glad to hear back about that. I had noticed that some of the Christmas trees were not being taken by DPW and so we had reached out to them and waiting for a response from them to find out about why not all of them have been removed from -- from the curb. And with regards to the City website what I believe Joan had brought up in her comments , I'm -- I'm interested in receiving an update on where we're at. I know that it's something that they're probably continuously working on improving . I believe we should have important documents available and up on our website . I've been a big proponent in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 past of getting more technology for the City. And the website is something that I always found to be very important . And that was always the first place that I would take a look for something . And it was always disappointing with how unorganize d the previous website was. And although I know that this website is I think in many ways much better than it had been, there's still clearly work that needs to be done. And I have some more questions on that. So I'm hopeful that we can reach out to IT, Mr. Voldenberg . And I'll send you some more detailed questions that we can ask them. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And one more thing I did just want to comment on Act 47 because today I think is a big day for the City. And I'm very happy that we've officially exited Act 47. It has been a long time coming, almost most of my lifetime that the City has been under Act 47. And I know several Councils and administrations have worked towards this outcome . And although we need to continue to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 do work in the City and stay up on our finances , I'm glad that we're no longer being labeled as financially distressed and hopefully we are in a better place than we were before. I'm confident that we can continue to work on our City's finances and be stable and there will be plenty more -- plenty more to do. But I just wanted to make a comment about that. And that's everything I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have two. So I received a few calls about, you know, last -- the last snowstorm we had last Monday. Mr. Voldenberg , can you inquire or send some correspondence over to DPW? The concerns were the 400 block of Beech Street. All right. Residents were saying that it wasn't plowed. All right. So if you could please relay that. And then secondly , so I've been here the three times Mr. Coyne has brought forth -- this is his third ask for a media parking proposal . And I know that -- I don't know where it went. But we did talk about it. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 know that BMC said that it can be done. It's doable. And I feel it's a reasonable request . I thought it was the past two times that you brought it forth. So -- and I know that you did supply the President and myself and Solicitor Gallagher with an amended document . So, Mr. Gallagher -- or Solicitor Gallagher , can you just please look into it, take a peek at it? Let's just entertain it. Let's put it in third motion or Third Order and vote it up or down so you get some closure and you don't have to have a fourth ask. All right? And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I'd just like to first say that it feels pretty surreal to say that this is the first Council meeting in over 30 years that the City of Scranton is not considered financially distressed under Act 47. And I'd just like to acknowledge two people who I believe were instrumental in getting the City into the financial position we are in today. And that -- they are former 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Council President , Bob McGoff and also former Business Administrator , Dave Bulzoni . Bob brought integrity , decorum , respect not only into Council meetings , meeting s that could be best described as a circus before he took over but also in a way that Council and the administration interact and work together for the betterment of City residents . Bob knew that the only way that the City could improve its finances was if Council and the administration were willing to work together in a respectful and constructive manner. And Dave Bulzoni brought immense knowledge into -- in financial markets and municipal finance to City government . More importantly he respected Council 's legislative role and was always willing to work along side Council to work through any issues or questions any Council member may have had to make sure that initiatives were being proposed or actually became reality . I just want to acknowledge both of them because I really do believe without their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 leadership I don't know if we would be in the position we're in today. But as we move forward post Act 47, I am confident that this Council 's committed to working with the Mayor and her administration to continue to modernize City government while keeping both legacy and operating costs under control . We're committed to investing in our neighbors and our park system and in our infrastructure to improve quality of life for City residents . And we must continue to explore ways to improve City services without overburdening our taxpayers in order to continue moving Scranton into the 21st century . In terms of Miss Hodowanitz brought up the Controller 's report, since you spoke, I did get a message from Controller Murray. And they are on the website . They're under the City Controller tab. I guess they are not sent to IT. They're posted directly from the Controller 's Office onto the website . And I did look when I had a chance and they are there. So I don't know if you were looking in the wrong spot. But we can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 touch base after the meeting to make sure you're set straight there. And that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 93, 2021, AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2022 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2022 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2022” BY TRANSFERRING PRORATED FUNDS FROM ACCOUNT NO. 4010 01.060.00000.4010 IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,265.00 FROM THE ASSISTANT CITY SOLICITOR POSITION (TAXES) TO ACCOUNT NO. 4010 01.060.00000.4010 FOR THE SOLICITOR OF THE LAW DEPARTMENT FROM MARCH 1, 2022 TO DECEMBER 31, 2022 IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE IV, SECTION 6-13 OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE.

First of all, the budget's done. All right. It was signed. It was voted on. And if you understand what this motion is, is to have Solicitor O'Brien give $3,265 to Solicitor Eskra. So it's a transfer of salary that shouldn 't take place. And I don't agree with it. And one of rational e in the legislation sent to us is that she works hard. And I said in caucus, guess what, we all work hard. Everybody in this room worked hard, worked hard now, worked hard their whole life. And with inflation , with the cost of everything going up I just don't see that we should open the budget for one person and give them a raise after everything was already decided upon -- salaries . If Mr. O'Brien wants to write a check for $3,265 and give it to Solicitor Eskra, I'm okay with it. But I'm not okay with transferring it and opening the budget to do so. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question , so I'll also be voting no for this resolution . The fact is we just approved the budget within the last five or six weeks. And at that point in time was the time to discuss this. At this point in time I feel that the timing of the resolution seems to be an attempt to work around or subvert the budget process and Council . I just don't see the reason for this, and it's not a precedent I want to set. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? I'm also just concerned with the precedent this sets. The budget is the budget. I believe Solicitor Eskra is extremely qualified . And she brings a lot of value to the City. But I just don't like the precedent of going outside the budget. The budget is the budget. And that's where the salaries are determined . So I will also be voting no. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. On the question , I agree with my colleagues . I do appreciate the work that Solicitor Eskra has put in for our City and, you know, additional roles that she has taken on as of late. But, you know, I don't think that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 appropriate even if it is allowable by the code. And we had voted on our budget already . So, you know, I think we could certainly consider an increase for this position again in next year's budget. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? MR. KING: Yes, basically echoing what my other Council men have said. If the intention was to set the salary at $80,000, I believe the appropriate time to do that would have been during budget time and not three weeks into the new year. So I will be voting no as well. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye -- no, I'm sorry. MR. DONAHUE : Opposed ? MR. KING: No. MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. DONAHUE : No. The noes have it and the motion fails. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF JESSICA ESKRA, ESQUIRE , 44 SNOOK STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18505, TO THE POSITION OF CITY SOLICITOR TO REPLACE JOSEPH O’BRIEN, ESQUIRE , EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2021. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , when looking at the resolution itself with the backup documents , Exhibit A contain s a paragraph that states that Attorney O'Brien has requested that $3,265 of his salary be transferred to put your 2022 salary at $80,000. We will request his transfer from Council . Original ly I came in thinking we had to amend this resolution . But it's actually not in the resolution . Attorney Gallagher , do you feel I should make a motion or affirm the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 amendment maybe to remove Exhibit A from the resolution or do you think we're safe to say that with 5-B not passing that it wouldn't be necessary ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Essentially voting down 5-B precluded that Exhibit A, paragraph three. However , if you would prefer that that be removed . That's something you I'm sure you could ask the administration to resend the letter to attach a new exhibit to the resolution . MR. SCHUSTER : With that, would we have to vote on that a second time or would we have to wait for that resolution to come back down before we can vote -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : It's not a new resolution but rather part -- a new exhibit . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, we can have them send a new exhibit . ATTY. GALLAGHER : Essentially you have already voted down Exhibit A, paragraph three. Now I believe you're fine with the resolution now. Just in terms of if it's your preference that you don't want that in there as the exhibit , then you could certainly ask them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 to -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, it would be my preference not to have that in. MR. DONAHUE : I just think we're safe on that one just because , you know, it does say that we would request this transfer and it's not in the actual resolution . So none of the exhibits are actually binding, correct ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : They are incorporat ed into the document . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, so -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : Although it's not in the body of the resolution it's attached , apart and would essentially be incorporated with the document . MR. DONAHUE : All right. MR. MCANDREW : Can't we just do -- I'm sorry. Excuse me. Can't we just do a friendly amendment right now to remove Exhibit A? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Sure. MR. MCANDREW : And just vote it -- we're only voting to move it. It's not final passage . I will make that motion. MR. KING: I'll second it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? All those in favor of motion on the floor signify by saying aye. MR.

And he was just a very respectful , kind, caring young man. And, you know, he was just starting his career as a Scranton firefighter . And it's really a tremendous loss to our City. And I think it's great that his parents are going to give a donation on his behalf to our Fire Department . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS.
