There's no change to collection routes, just to the start times.

Entrance is free and competition entries are free. The close is June 26th. So I thank Mrs. Jeffries and the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority for sponsor ing that great event in our City at Nay Aug. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any other announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : It's been a few weeks since I've been here because I've been busy, busy. But it's interesting to watch the meetings on YouTube . And it's always a different perspective when you are sitting in your home and your living room watching it than here at Council because I could yell at the TV at things I don't like what I'm hearing . But I do want to thank Councilman Donahue for starting the meeting last week with the dos and don'ts of Council . So often things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 are said that should not have been said. They're national things. They shouldn 't be covered here at Council . So it was good to hear that you started the meeting that way. Usually on the back of the Council agenda are the dos and don'ts. And maybe do we have to be so elementary and read them every week or something ? I'm not sure. But I do have to thank Jessica for stepping up for those words that were said. And the reason it struck me so because something that struck me as being offensive to me was not addressed . I always think that if you don't say something then you agree with what's being said. So I was glad that Jessica spoke up about those words that were spoken. And then after the fact other Council members came back and said something . So, you know, we have to always be mindful of the words -- I think I said that before. This microphone , what you say goes out there to the public. And it's very, very -- could be very damaging to those that hear it and be offended as I was the night that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 something was said. I'm just going to go over everything that I've been concerned about over these past four years. And I've been coming to Council -- each one of us that comes to Council has a hot button, something that we just want to see a change. So, of course, mine starts off with the street signs. And as Leslie spoke about the activities going on with the bicycle race and everything that is coming, as you drive around our City we still do not have the appropriate street signs. And it's just so, you know, we get company -- if company is coming in town for the summer and you have to sort of direct them by buildings , not the street sign. Yes, their GPS in their phones telling them to take a right or take a left. But it would be so nice if they could look up and see the green and white signs to direct them to where they are going. Now, my company comes in over the bridge and I'm in the Hill Section so they don't have too far to go. But anyone else that's travelling to the west side of the City and coming into town, really -- there are so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 street signs. I do miss that Mr. Preambo is not there any longer. I called the City. I called DPW. And, you know, they were not even -- they didn't even return my calls. So when I was listening to the Council minutes and Joan was saying about that no one returned her call, I thought , well, don't be offended , Norma, you know, it must happen to lots of people that I left the message for Mr. West and he did not call me back. He didn't have to call me. But someone could call me and say, Norma, we're getting to it, anything . And I have to always go back to my business days, you know, if you didn't return your calls, you know, your boss would be on you that somebody called and you didn't at least say I'm working on it, you know, that's all. You don't have to give me a definite date but just to say I'm working on it. And then the other thing is coming into Harrison Avenue. I know, Dr. Rothchild , you did some preliminary walking through Harrison Avenue. As I go out and I'm in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 different stores, people think that I'm part of Council . I say write a letter to Council . I can imagine what you guys get because I get stopped in stores and things. One of the things that someone asked me was the building that you see as you come into the City, the big white building . They're offering to pay to have that building painted so that when you come across that bridge and -- I said you're kidding me. I said, you're going to pay for that? They said, yes, I would be willing to pay to have that done. I said, well, that's someone 's private property . And I'm sure that we can't do that. And so that is one thing about the City. And then the street parking , of course, that is another one of my hot buttons . And you can't even meet people in town for lunch without thinking where am I going to park, do I have enough money? It is better to see that they are now accepting quarters in the machines now where it used to be just a credit card. So, you know, those are the things that are not good for the City when you have to think, oh, no, let's meet somewhere outside of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the City where we don't have to worry about parking . So one of the things that I listened to was that they were saying that they were going to give a reduction for the parking in garages. I don't know when that's supposed to start. Maybe you could give an update on that. And the City Hall restoration as you are coming down Mulberry Street, you know, I thought for sure when that scaffolding was up that they were going to continue , continue . Like, you know when you paint a house in your room and one room looks good and then you move to the next room because that other room doesn't look so great so you paint that room. So that's what I thought was going to happen. But that's it for me. And, Bill, thank you for the Electric City Flower Show. We are doing so much work. And it's more than just flowers. If you want to learn how to transplant and get your things ready for next season, they're master gardeners . I'm not a master gardener . I'm just a volunteer . But there will be master gardeners here giving different seminars. So thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to reach out to DPW for an update on where they're at with the street signs? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Donahue , wasn't it brought up last week that that building on Harrison was suppose d to be demolished ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe so but I'm not positive off the top of my head. MR. KING: I thought so. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : It is condemned , Mr. King. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . So what is the status of negotiations for the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they are still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, chuga, chuga, chuga. I notice in the Controller 's report for June that Ufberg Associates were paid $68,012.00 giving them a running total of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 $239,614.06 for their work as labor Council . And they're nowhere near the end. But there's good news because if you look at the Controller 's report you will see that the contingency fund which was budgeted for $800,000 has yet to be touched . So we have a way of paying for this bill. And I also noticed that finally we have a resolution for the -- renewing the contract for labor counsel . And it's with Ufberg Associates . They were the only ones who bid. Interesting , if you read closely the Law Department 's summary sheet, you found an amazing typographical error. It's a five-year contract and with the option for one, two, or three year-extension through the end of 2029. And any extension is subject to a mutually agreed increase to the firm's rates for its professionals through the end of 2029 provided that any increase will exceed three and a half percent in any year. I think they meant to say shall not. That's what's in the basic contract . But I'm sure when I grow up I'm going to be a lawyer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 because they make darn good money. With regard to 3-A, Chief Judge's memo, the use of Fire Departments resources outside of the City, I was very surprised to see this statement that the county mutual aid agreement -- this is among various fire departments -- is not written . However , it is assumed that resources will be provided to requesting agencies within the county based on need and availability to assist. I think that is -- I think that is something that should be corrected . I think you should have that in writing , largely because personalities change, leadership s change, policies change. We do have a written agreement with Tobyhanna but not with the county for intercounty support . And I think if I were you, I would strongly recommend to the Mayor that she talk with Mr. Judge about getting that put into writing . That is too important a safety issue to be informal, just my opinion . Has there been any information coming down on the Payroll Preparation Tax, the questions that had come up? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. DONAHUE : We haven't received any yet, no. We just know that -- MS. HODOWANITZ : The clock is also ticking on that. Businesses are calculating and sending in money. And that should be corrected . I was happy to hear the update on the Pocket Park from Scranton Tomorrow . The only piece of information that I didn't hear was when we could expect the project to be complete d because it's been dragging for a long time. And other than that, I wish you all a good night. We only have one more week and then you get to go on vacation . So I'll see you next week. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And I believe the Pocket Park will be finished by the end of the year as long as everything goes on schedule . Next on the list, Joanne Williams . MS. WILLIAMS : Good evening , Council , Joanne Williams , City resident . I'm here this evening with concerns on the expansion of Geisinger . I was born and raised in the 200 block of Colfax Avenue. And I'm grieving at the destruction of not only the 200 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 block of Colfax but concerns for the families who reside on the 200, 400, 500 of Arthur, Wheeler , and Colfax. Let me also include Roselyn , Linden, Vine, Olive Streets . My main concern is changes to the beautiful community with the zoning change from residential to civic to benefit Geisinger . Let's talk about how good of a neighbor Geisinger is -- their administration . I could tell you not good. They haven't reached out to neighbors to discuss their plans and to listen to our concerns . One of my many concerns out of many is the traffic up there. 1800 of Mulberry and Linden as we of Colfax and Arthur are consumed constantly with traffic , jamming up traffic . We have transport vehicles . We have garbage trucks. We have deliveries , pickup and dropoff. And it's really -- it's not good. And my question is, who owns those streets ? Because I live up there and it is hard to get through those streets . We are taxpayer s and we -- and Geisinger doesn't care. And remember too also that Geisinger 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 does not pay taxes. The people pay taxes. And I don't think much of the administrator s vote either. When we vote you into those seats -- and I'm glad you have them -- we want you to support our neighbors and our neighborhood , not these institutions . You and City Council need to keep our neighborhood residential , please. You need to fight for us, the taxpayer s and voters. When you go home to your neighborhoods tonight and to your home, picture Geisinger as your neighbor destroying it. So stand up, Council , I ask you and support our cause with the same intensity you would if it was your neighborhood . I'm asking you that. You know, it's a beautiful neighborhood up there. Geisinger does not like -- does not care about the neighbors . I'm talking administration . I'm not talking doctors , nurses. I'm talking administration . They don't even reach out to us. Someone needs to reach out to us. And we're hoping that maybe you, the Council , can look into this because it's not good. And a beautiful neighborhood is being destroyed . You need to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 come to a compromise . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I will say that Council has advocate d to Geisinger for them to reach out to the neighbor s on multiple occasions , especially over the last six months. Thank you. Next on the list, Doris Koloski {phonetic }. MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council , before I address my concerns , I'd like to thank Mr. Schuster for taking time to look into the pool and how we can make cuts. I totally agree with what he said there. And there's too many bells and whistles of some of the -- like, landscaping can be done by volunteers of the park who do that anyway. Second, the person that mentioned on TV the other day about the curb cutting , I'll just mention that they came through and they cut all of our streets and everything was good. And they just missed, I'm sure, they didn't skip it on purpose , just the even side of Colfax and Olive on both sides. So when I'm walking with my walker down there I have to go down there or walk part way up. And it's just those two that weren't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 cut. Everything else had been cut years ago, a few years ago. Okay, I also want to mention the parking pass -- permit parking there. Like, on my block there is houses so far that didn't sell to Geisinger . We were told to pay for permit parking or we would still run the risk of getting a ticket or our friends getting tickets if they didn't have guest passes. Now we're going back to December and January . And I spoke to Corporal Butler a couple of times and he said he didn't know because it had to get settled with Council because the girl that is ticketing , she isn't ticketing anything because her boss -- Corporal Butler told her not to ticket on the 200, on the 400 and the two of Arthur, I think. I don't know for sure about the two of Arthur. But she told them that because Geisinger was all working there and everything , which they have a big parking lot to park in. So we're getting people parking in front of my house right in front of the sign that says permit and they're eating stuff from the Geisinger food truck sitting there -- you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 going over getting it, sitting there eating it. And people park in front there because it's the closest to the hospital . They don't want to walk from the hospital owned properties down. So if not, reimburse us our money because I think I spent close to $25 for parking passes. And it's too hard to call the police. They're too busy with important things that they're doing in the City to bother them. And by the time they come up anyway, they're gone, you know. So anyway, that's the end. Now I'm here about the Geisinger expansion as always. As hard as everyone has been trying to get Geisinger to speak to the neighbors about their plans, they still don't want to do it. The Mayor had come to a Hill Section meeting and she told us she stands behind the hospital when she supposedly doesn't know the plans as she said. So how do you stand behind something that you don't know the plans for? That is kind of confusing to me. It's unacceptable to me actually . As of now, we don't know if the hospital is bringing more jobs and updated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 healthcare to the 200 and 400. They could just be wanting to combine their campus, make -- consolidate all of their rental offices around town and in the area and bring them over there to make it more -- just moving it to make their on campus to make it easier for them and have one campus just because they want one campus. All big city hospital s, the teaching hospitals because I've been to many, they have them scattered around the city, their building s. Like, when I go to Sloan you go through the breast biopsy in the middle of downtown New York even though the campus is on 68th Street. What they did is, they made more room inside their main campus and put doctors ' offices and different things around the city. And they have jitneys . And Geisinger has at least 20 jitneys going by my house every day. So they have jitneys that take people from the main campus and return them to get their cars and stuff like that. And that is how it is at Thomas Jefferson and all the other ones that I have been to. So I don't know why they can't do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 that. If they need to find out how to do it they could contact I'm sure somebody at Sloan or one of those big hospital s and they could explain how you do it. Now, there was a wonderful letter to the editor a few weeks ago suggest ing that the hospital purchase in the downtown where they could also help build our local economy , like people would be going to restaurant s like they come to the Blackwatch Cafe now at Nay Aug Park. They could shop on their breaks. It would really help the hospital . Maybe they would rent some of those apartments that that wonderful developer is developing all over down there. Okay, most people -- especially middle class people, most of their largest investments are in their homes. So by granting the GCMC the zone of civic in and around our block, you would be ensuring my home and other homes will be unsalable to anyone but the hospital . I know the Mayor said she serves the entire City of Scranton and she wants to have this the healthcare section of the world. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. DONAHUE : Doris, your time is up. You could finish you -- MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, this will be real fast. I have two sentences . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. KOLOSKI : But we are taxpaying citizens . And as the question of what they would do with the properties they bought, I know some people are worried about they already bought properties , what can they do with them now if the zone isn't changed to civic where they could put a 125 foot building is, is they gambled . And if they gambled and couldn't get exactly what they wanted, that's too bad. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Doris. MS. KOLOSKI : If I gambled and bought a couple houses -- I know. You could take me out -- when I bought a couple houses, ripped them down, put them in for dogs and cats then you came and said I -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Doris. Next on the list is John Thomas. MR. THOMAS: Good evening , Council , John Thomas, Scranton . I didn't (inaudible ) terrible speaker . Yesterday I was talking to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 someone about the business and financial aspect of the City. And it reminded me of a person a few years before the pandemic , this person came in front of Council and I think had a great idea. Have the Mayor get in touch with the University of Scranton who in turn would get in touch with a profess or and a student whose major is financial and business course and in turn get in touch with the business and financial of the Mayor and set up a plan where they could meet, the two of them and, you know, look over the books together . I wish I could remember who this person was. It was so long ago. I'm just reiterating what that person said. And I really thought it was a good idea. I don't know if Council would consider that when they meet with the Mayor. Maybe they already thought of it. I don't know. Again, not to -- getting off the City business a little bit. The current Supreme Court is so extreme . I'm sure everybody knows it's just unbelievable . I know they are out for the summer. And I'm not sure, but I think they come back October the 3rd. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 But I know sometime early in October . Goodness . I hate the thoughts of what's going to happen. The one thing that comes to mind is the Affordable Care Act. Now, part of the Congress -- the right side of the Congress they been have trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act since it became law, okay? They have no plan whatsoever . But they are trying to get rid of a good plan with millions of people on this plan and they have no alternative . Now, if that is shot down by the Supreme Court, there's going to an awful lot of people without healthcare . I know one person personally that has the Affordable Care Act, only one person. But there is million s of other ones who had it. And I know this person if they were taken off the Affordable Care Act, they would be an invalid . I mean, you just can't describe millions of millions of people who need healthcare because of the Republicans . The late John McCain a few years back, he put the deciding vote on the Affordable Care Act. It was tied in the Senate. And that was the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 vote he made before he sadly passed away. He voted to keep the Affordable Care Act. And he said the reason why is my party has no plan. My party has no plan. Thank you, John McCain. Another thing, I don't know why I turn on the news. I turn the news on in the morning at 7:00 or so. Usually I shut it off and listen to music or something like that. But this tragedy in Uvalde, there's a lot -- it's all over the country . But it's really amazing when you see the video surveillance camera. I mean, all of these cops standing around looking at each other waiting for -- I'm not going in. You go in. Every one of them are cowards . Now the Mayor of Uvalde -- I hope I'm saying it right up here (inaudible ) the Governor of Texas should step down and resign. For several weeks they tried to cover up this tragedy . And that's a fact. That is not the right ear talking or the left ear talking. That's a fact. Thank you, Council , and have a good summer. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Bob Bolus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. BOLUS: Bob Bolus, Scranton . I was here last time I asked about getting the paving done up on Derby and Birch Street where they missed that one piece. And I would like somebody to inquire into it. They paved the whole East Mountain and they left this one section go. And it's full of holes and everything else. It's right in front of our residence and stuff up there. So I would like to see somebody do something about it. Not to belabor a subject , but I think we should take the flags out front here and I think it's time to rotate them. And what their purpose was and what they signified for the purpose that they were out there, that period has passed. Let's put new flags and new direction that we need here instead of stagnation looking at the same thing. Maybe some people appreciate it, other of us don't. So we would like to see a change around here and not have a stagnation going here that is pretty much self-centered . The Biden signs, I'm going to put this on all of you guys and Jessica . And is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 to -- anybody willing to make a motion to remove the Biden signs off Interstate 81, the Expressway and downtown Scranton . Now, if anybody 's paid attention I travel a lot. I have been all over the country . As soon as I mention I'm from Scranton , I feel like I got a dagger in my back. I become defensive that this guy came from our community . Joe Biden may have made president , but he's making a total ass out of every one of us. He's a physical , mental embarrassment unfortunately . And he's embarrassing each and every one of us. And since we're from Scranton , we get the brunt of it. Let him go to Delaware . Let him play on the beach. Leave us alone. He's not one that we could respect and honor. Our military fellow soldiers died there because of his incompetence . And don't ever forget it. They were our fellow troops. And they didn't come home because of an incompetent fool. And every day he becomes a bigger fool and on and on. The borders , we could spend billions of dollars everywhere else. Would you guys wants to see all of those immigrant s here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 in Scranton , all the illegals come off a bus here and fill up our city? That's where we're heading as long as we have incompetence out there. And everybody 's got to understand one thing. Everybody works for us. We don't work for you. And you're here to take and listen to our voices and you are our voice. Give us our voice back. See who could stand up and be counted . Forget the party or who you -- or what party or whatever and remove the signs. Remove the embarrassment from us. It's all about the people. And if you want to have them, put them on a referendum for the November election . Let us decide what the hell we want here, not five people and a Mayor. It's our right and you're taking it away from us and you can't take our voice away because our voice is going to be very, very loud in the upcoming months. And a lot of people aren't going to be too happy about it. You know, you got Nay Aug Park. We ruined the pool, filled it with dirt. Can you imagine all us senior citizens running under a splash park? Picture that in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 your mind, old gray hair people running around in the splash park because we couldn't take care of the pool. Why didn't you negotiate with Geisinger ? Let them donate the pool to the City. I filed a lawsuit to stop them from doing what they were doing with the parking but nobody joined in. And they're kicking our butts. They're taking over this City and you're letting them do it. Give back to the people what they need here. This is our city. It's not yours. It's not theirs. It's ours. It's a big word. Our city that our people developed here many, many years ago with hard labor and work, immigrant s and everybody else. And you're taking that voice away. It's not the time to play politics anymore. I just hate to see what I see when I travel and I come back here and I drive down 81 and I have to look at that idiot's name on the interstate sign. Just remember how many people are going through here aren't stopping in Scranton but they are commenting on the signs, okay? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Bob. MR. BOLUS: See if you have the courage to represent us. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hi. My name is Rick Little. I live at 420 Adams Avenue, Apartment 210, Scranton , Pennsylvania . I am living under a lease that was approve d by City Council in 1996 for Scranton Housing Authority . And I've been on the fence ever since. I -- when I first moved in I'm dealing with New York State Family Court to try to enforce ordered visitation and all kinds of things with my daughter . I haven't seen my daughter since she was eight. She's 21 now. I started -- I was a founding member of the New York State Father's and Families Civil Liberties Union. I am not a lawyer, but I know I could pass the New York Bar, but Commonwealth law is a brand new thing for me. I have been spending every moment of my time in the last six months trying to stay in my apartment , which I was evicted from I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 believe totally illegally . My lease provides city, county, and state applicable protections . And I assume that means I could call the police when people are robbing me or call the Fire Department and find out what's going on because we have fires going every single week for the first 10 years of my living there and Code Enforcement , especially Code Enforcement . I'm wondering about this agenda where a report from OECD complaints and a couple -- the Fire Chief. Did I miss that or something in a meeting ? I would like direction of how I could see these reports . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Little, you could go on the City's website and under Council meeting s, our agenda is up there. And you could click on these and then they come up or you could request them from our offices . MR. LITTLE: Okay. I just need certified papers because I'm in the Court of Common Pleas by the skin of my teeth and filing notice to appeal. I'm not -- it says on the paper, you know, using Pennsylvania procedure . I don't recognize any of the usual procedures such as certificate of readiness for trial. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 I'm supposedly in trial. Anyway, Lackawanna County is one of two counties in the state that don't go through compass program for what the distribution of ERAP funds, the COVID thing. I've applied for it three times. Supposedly my landlord has applied for it. And I was just slammed in court the other day where they agreed to it and then he said it's off the table. This is the District Attorney of Lackawanna County who is the attorney there. It's very intimidating dealing with him. I'm defending an eviction . And I stated I was withholding rent for very good reasons . I won't go into them all now. And I was accused of failure to recertify . There is many letters that I wrote to the manager in this lease. That's the procedure and then nobody addressed any of my concerns for going on four years now. And I wrote letters to Gary Pecalucci {phonetic ) and Karl Lynott. Crimes have been committed and by these people. And I need the names and -- names of these people. I asked the District Attorney . He 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 won't give me the names of the people. I asked in writing to the executive director . I think it's in the interest of the City of Scranton to find out who is running on the ground Scranton Housing Authority . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Little. Your time is up. MR. LITTLE: Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Okay, Council , relax. I'm not going to rehash last week. I would like to say that Fay Franus's letter accusing me of attacks on women is a manufactured nonsense . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Ellman, please don't -- no personal attacks , please. MR. ELLMAN: Okay. I'll drop the abortion issue. But I'd like to say -- make everybody more comfortable , to me, I could consider all the lives lost in abortions equal to or surpassing what happened in the Nazi Germany death camps. Next, I know everybody probably only seen that commercial Mr. Cartwright promising 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 to give us back 15 or 20 cents on our -- a gallon or gas. He and his party are responsible for this financial mess that's costing everybody in this country hundreds of dollars a week more. I see some ads that say it's costing families over $400 a week more. I would like to publicly say what he could do with that 15 to 20 cents. It won't help nobody. You people remember Sister Adrian having the food giveaway at the high school. It was a mile long of vehicles waiting that day. You know, what Mr. Cartwright was doing? He's giving the eight colleges 10 million dollars of those people that were waiting in line for food their tax money so those eight colleges wouldn't have to dig into their endowment s to pay their own responsibilities and obligations . And to me, if that wasn't bad enough, the Munley Law Firm apparently was poverty stricken or so impoverished that they qualified for a PPP loan 350 to a million dollars . I've talked to some people that could have used $5,000 of that PPP money instead of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 giving it to the super attorneys that I saw last Sunday's paper. This is a shame. This money should be recovered and so should the 10 million dollars given to those parasites. This isn't a college town. I've been to college towns when I was young like in Alabama , Atlanta . Scranton has been eaten up like a big octopus by these colleges and universities . There's a couple hundred prime properties gone forever . There's million s of dollars of taxes on our backs because nobody in this Council , no Mayor since Janet Evans has had enough nerve to try to collect some money from these parasites . It's time somebody did something to protect the taxpayer . How much taxes can you go? They're going to go up because of Debbie and Jerry, reassessment . That's a deliberate lie. I don't care what anybody says. I've been told by real estate people it's like a used car man working a pencil. It's a false positive what the City is worth after this reassessment. It's going to cleanse our City some low income and all. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton City taxpayer . Now, first while I did -- I was born in Scranton . I'm matured in Poland. And I would encourage the City Council and the city entirely to reassess whether or not they truly believe that Nazi Germany is the same or equivalent to a women's right to choose. I will have -- I would happily have a discussion with anyone who seems to actually argue for that. Now, onto what I meant to say when I came in here is, of course, about the Laurel Line, the railway system that Scranton used to have to connect ourselves with Pittston , Wilkes-Barre, Old Forge, Moosic and our other surrounding communities . Now, a few weeks ago on my way into Scranton as I work here, my brake lines gave out. And I ended up having to pull off into Scranton . My brakes were completely shot. I had to take my car into the shop and, of course, an accident like that, hard to prevent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 and can't be done in a day. However , after I got my car into the shop I was now stranded in Scranton . I was unable to get home. I was unable to leave because both the cost of independent transportation is so high and the bus system is not up to par. Now, I work until 6 p.m. No buses leave Scranton after 5:15. I am completely stuck here in Scranton . And what that also means is that everybody outside of the City is unable to come into Scranton . All of that could be alleviated with a train, having a light rail system that allows citizens and people from outlying communities to come in and out of the City would alleviate these transportation issues. Now, the cost of transportation is climbing daily both from fuel costs, car costs, insurance , inspection , etc., etc. And our roads are just not able to hold up to all the cars that we have to use. We do not in this community have the freedom of choice to really use anything other than a car. The bus system is adequate . I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 very happy with Colts, LCTA's new night bus. But it doesn't fit everybody 's needs all the time. It's great for anyone that uses it to get to work during the day. But anyone that works on the weekend s is really left up the creek. And that's it. We have a car, personal vehicle that is too expensive for most people in our communities to really rely on constantly . The average household in Scranton brings in about $20 an hour collectively , which is not very much. It is certainly not enough for people of Scranton to constantly have to rely on their own personal motor vehicles to get in and out of the City to get to work to commute on these roads. And the amount of cars that we have in the city as other people have mentioned already cause huge problems from parking and living just up near the hospital , which I will remind you used to have a train station there in Nay Aug Park. If the Laurel Line which did stop there was reinvigorate d, people would be able to get to and from the hospital without needing to drive and park their personal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 vehicle s. They won't need to park in the City. People who have mentioned before that they have to plan around where they can park, where they can go really cuts out a lot of people's adventures into the Central City of Scranton if they either can't rely on the bus or can't rely on the availability for parking . Being able to take that train trip, a light rail trip into the center of Scranton would do wonders for the community and for the businesses directly in our center city that are accessed by the rail. Anyone coming in on rail would be free to walk around on foot or bike if they choose to take a bike with them and able to visit these businesses , go to their own houses and generally participate in the community without having to worry about the financial strain or the space strain brought about by the amount of people who take cars. Additionally , people who keep complain ing about 81 having a Biden sign won't have to worry about it if instead of taking 81 they are able to take the train. The City of Scranton and outlying communities would greatly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 benefit from having a light rail system brought back to the area. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Several weeks ago I asked Mr. Tom over there to get us the split between the property assessed values between the exempt and nonexempt. Have you done that? MR. SCHUSTER : I have not. MS. SCHUMACHER : Could you do it for next week since you're not going to be around after that? MR. SCHUSTER : Are you going to stick around a little bit after the meeting , I'll speak on it -- MS. SCHUMACHER : What? MR. SCHUSTER : Are you going to stick around for a few minutes after the meeting ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Sure. I can. The other thing that is coming up so we stay on top of it is Meadow Brook II. Who is in charge of that project on the -- MR. DONAHUE : I believe the project 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 manager and Business Administrator . MS. SCHUMACHER : I mean -- no, they are in what department ? MR. DONAHUE : So it's a couple different departments . It's DEP, Finance -- so it would be Community Development , Finance and also DPW. MS. SCHUMACHER : So there is no -- MR. DONAHUE : Not with us, no. MS. SCHUMACHER : No one point on your Council . MR. DONAHUE : Not the way our -- I mean, just our committees are -- we all keep on getting updates as -- MS. SCHUMACHER : How many exempt -- whoever has this aspect of it, would you find out how many properties there need right-of-ways before the project can go through and how many have been up obtained as of today? So I'll leave it up to whoever that belongs to. MR. DONAHUE : Tom, do you want to take that? MS. SCHUMACHER : Mr. Donahue , did you bring me a list of parts that are needed for the acoustics so we can try to run them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 down? MR. DONAHUE : A bid will be going out for the whole project soon. They're working on it. We tried to separate it out, but it kept on coming out over on bid threshold so a bid is going out for the whole project soon. MS. SCHUMACHER : And when you say soon, do you mean like this week? MR. DONAHUE : They came in and they were measuring last week for the specs. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. You know, I listened to the issues on the renaming of Spruce Street. The one thing that bothers me as much as anything is it's a reminder of what you people did that night. And for three weeks you listened to the business people who were coming to this podium and they were telling you what it was going to do to their businesses and you just -- you wanted it. And you forgot that you represent us. And you went down in my estimation because that is not the only one where you have taken your own, in my estimation , position rather than what the people want. And that's very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 sad. I did have also on here that what's -- can we find some way to be informed on the street signs because they are terrible . And it looked as though we were making progress there for a while. And maybe it's because Mr. Preambo is gone. But we need to make sure that we're getting -- we're making progress on that. Maybe it should be contracted out. I mean, the Mayor contracts a lot of things out, almost everything so why can't this body? And then I do have -- I would like from the City or from Scranton Tomorrow or anybody who has the thing, everybody talks about all of this needing to come to downtown -- not at night certainly . I would like to see how many businesses there are and even just what is considered the downtown that does not contain -- their product is not food or beverage s or both. I don't know of a single business that is open at night down here. And it's hard to even find a retail business downtown . So what is the big concern about getting people downtown when there is -- you know, you could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 go to Boscov's. You could go to the mall. But there is not a lot there. Why are we not worrying about that? I'm sorry. I realize my time is up. MR. DONAHUE : That's all right. Thank you very much. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Last week mention was made that City Hall seems to be closed off for the people. And quite often when I'm watching my obsessive news reports , a lot of politicians are getting calls and threats and all kinds of harassment and some really vulgar and threatening type e-mails and stuff. And correct me if I am wrong, but I think the Patriot Act does forbid this. It is actually a violation of federal law to threaten a public official . So I hope -- certainly hope that some of these people that are doing this kind of stuff -- and if that is the reason that City Hall is all clammed up that somebody gets their just deserved some day. It's really not acceptable . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 On 5-E, once again, I have spoke out. I don't think it's possible to have two-way streets without -- in Central City without four-way stop lights precluding anybody from going through the intersection before there is a traffic signal for pedestrians . And I think stop sign and bicycle paths would be a big mistake . I don't see there's room. And I think if that happens , I won't stop coming to City Hall or downtown , but I will get myself a dash cam because every time I was hit, I usually hear this is the first time I'm the cause of the accident . You know, got hit from behind, 20 feet, playing with his radio. And this is the first time. Well, this is first time you couldn't lie your way out of it. So that way somebody could. So I wish we consider that before we just take a jump in possible boiling water. And we have a lot of comments here. I don't like comment ing on national things. But people come in and they state stuff. I mean, it's really -- how big of a failure does their choice have to be before they just face 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 the beat of the drum. It's time to reform the Republican party and get those crazies out of there. There's two hearing s on Thursday night that Trump was sitting in his little office and reveling while those hooligans were tearing the capitol apart. And people have been convicted that actually had firearms on them. They didn't shoot at the police. But if they had gotten to where they wanted to go and seen who they wanted to see, we probably would have had Congress men assassinate d and everything else. That's not acceptable . Please quit supporting that stuff and coming in here and telling me that the sun is the moon because it's not. I don't need it. Who am I going to believe , my lying eyes and ears or you? You know? Omicron is up 46 percent in the last week. Obviously those people are antimask, antivax. Excuse me if I don't want to breath the same air that they do before it's filtered . Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . In looking through some of the documentations for the loans that are coming forward I saw that the Home Rehabilitation Program is listed for the American Acts funding . What startled me about that is the intended applicants for a Home Rehabilitation Program are nonprofit organizations are a group listed there. I'm not sure that this federal money should be directed to non-profits for home rehabilitation . They also talk looking at that I also have -- there is no limit in here on how big the home property , how big these rental properties are that are established for it. Can someone who owns a building with 50 rental properties apply for it separately for all separate 50? Can they take funds for all 50 rental properties if they are nonprofit ? Who is the gatekeeper for that to decide and how much is too much when handing out to a nonprofit who may own multiple properties for digging their hands into this fund that is meant for the entire community . I think it might get rather quickly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 unbalanced towards builder s and contractors who are heavily involved in construction of properties for rental and have put them on the market rather than for the population in the City of Scranton who will be less skilled at putting the grants in in a timely fashion before that funding is exhausted . Also noted in there is the grant is a zero interest but repayment is due and if you sell it within a 10 year -- you sell, convey it or transfer the property , the money has to be returned . Unfortunately the money we're talking about that has to be returned , in fact, also is subject to revision by U.S. Treasurer . So if 10 years down the road the property is sold and the zero interest grant payment has to be repaid, does the City of Scranton then on capturing that money back have to give it back to the Treasury because it never was the City of Scranton or whoever the grant that the City gave to, it was never their money to keep. It also states owners must keep rent levels affordable for a period of time of 10 years. What's affordable ? There is no basis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 in there. There is no percentage . There's no numbers . It's devoid of any content in basis. It says must keep rent levels affordable . That's too vague. It's too indiscriminate and there is no guideline as to what that is. Last, the City of Scranton , this building is a public building . Historically public access to a building that has been historically open is protect ed. This building should not be locked off and blocked from the citizens of this City. It is understand able that offices can be secured and areas in the building are restricted by signs and/or locks from not going into. But the general hallway s and structure s of the building are not suppose d to be blocked off by law. This is not an armed encampment . As far as I know, there has been no plane crashing into the Times Tower building . There has been no advertised credible threat towards this building . All it acts is as a barrier for the public to interact with their official s and a lack of the ability to oversight whether those official s and personnel are actually in the building doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 the business that they were hired to do by the voters. This needs to be stopped . It needs to be removed . It is not an armed encampment . It is the people's building . And it needs to be restored as such. It was originally stated that it was for COVID. Well, the Mayor has since redacted that and said that was never the intent. We know what the intent is, to keep citizens out. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a reminder to, Mr. Voldenberg , once again, I know that if we could communicate with the administration and try to find out where they're at with that letter that was sent by Attorney McGovern and Bill Lazor, CPA to discuss the PPT tax and the issues that were raised if you could actually get a date as to when meeting is going to occur, I would really appreciate that. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : So a couple comments . So I heard again here tonight that the City Hall is clamped up. There's a barrier for interaction or I didn't get a return call. And I would just like to say I agree with some of these comment s. I got several phone calls. I got several e-mails in the past. I put them through to the administration and through our City Clerk and I got answers that City Hall was open. It's apparent as of last meeting that it seems that it's appointment only. So I don't agree with the treatment of citizens this way. And I think at the minimal , City Hall needs to develop a system that does work that is effective and meets the needs of the citizens ' concern s. And, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could send correspondence , I could send something even to you later. If we could get what their process is to address these citizens ' concern s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 or something that is going to be more effective than the system we already have in place. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Number two, we were suppose d to get a pool update on Nay Aug. It was brought up again tonight . I planned on speaking about it anyway. But could we also send correspondence to see when the Mayor and Mrs. Cipriani may return to give us another pool presentation ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Next, Mr. Voldenberg , I have another one for you. Have we gotten an update on the car lots on Main Avenue? There was two different car lots towards the Taylor border. MR. VOLDENBERG : 12 and 1300 block of South Main, no report as yet. MR. SCHUSTER : Can we please send another one to follow up on that to see if we can get a response ? I do have a couple properties and a couple concern s that I'll e-mail over to, Mr. Voldenberg . Another thing I heard tonight was there is another is a section of East Mountain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 that wasn't paved. I don't remember . I wrote it down but I don't recall the section . MR. KING: It's Birch which connect s from East Mountain Road over to Derby Avenue. It's a smaller section . MR. VOLDENBERG : That was sent to DPW. And they're looking at it. MR. SCHUSTER : They're going to look at that one? Can we also send the section of -- I sent a couple e-mails to you about East Elm Street. There's East Elm Street and Moltke Ave. There's a piece from the measurements that I got it's about 26 feet wide and about 150 long if we can see if -- I know we got a response saying that they weren't going to add to the paving list, but if we're taking a look at this other piece if we could take a look at -- yeah, it's right off of Moltke. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. SCHUSTER : East Elm. All right. Thank you very much. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do have a comment . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 I just want to provide an update. Last week I had mentioned that I haven't had the opportunity to speak with anyone to followup or receive followup on Geisinger . And I have since been able to speak with an administrator from there. I'm still hopeful about ongoing conversations and further updates within the near future about their plans. But in the meantime , I'm very interest ed in meeting with local neighbors within the Hill who live around Geisinger to hear them out further . I know we have had some recently attending our meeting. I was also present at the meeting that -- the neighborhood meeting a couple months back that the Mayor had attended as well. But I would still like to continue to listen to the problem s that people are facing. And so I would like to open that up and set something up. And I'll announce that when I do. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have a few. So this has been going back a couple months. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 There's a gas station on the corner of Railroad and Luzerne . And I know it's under new ownership . But it's been a blight issue. I'm still getting complaints about this gas station . And I was told that there was tanks that were leaking. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please see where Code Enforcement is at with this building ? Could you reach out to the City Planner to see if there, you know, a plan's been made? Have they been contact ed to do something with this -- what they're going to do with this building , the new owners and, you know, remediation of some of that -- some of the leakage that is possibly is associate d with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with both departments . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And next, I got a bunch of paving issues. Everyone is excited when they walk out their front door and their street is paved. I get it. Everybody gets it. Sometimes you wait five years. Sometimes you wait 10 years, right? So I've been contact ed over the weekend about a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 paving project s. And they actually happened today. So one of them is on the 1200 block of Blair Avenue. So I went over there. UGI was -- their paving people were there today. And what they were going to pave is just three quarters of the street. So every time -- I'm here three years. Every time I met with either the utilities -- both utility companies that are responsible for paving after their work is completed always says, we pave curb to curb. We hear it all the time, curb to curb. Right, so this isn't happening . So this street is being three quarters paved or it was today. So while I was there I talked to the foreman . I said hey, buddy, help me out here. Help me understand why you're only going three quarters of the street. And he goes that's the orders I received . And, you know, he was the messenger . I was the messenger too. So, he's like, of course, I don't want it to look bad. Of course, I would like to do it curb to curb. But there is some issues, one being like some of it on the one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 side they're paving right to the sidewalk . On the other side, there is like a patch that used to be grass. But that whole block had some type of paving done in the past. So they weren't going to rip it up. They didn't want to pave over it. I can't pave over it because there would be water issues. I said, you have to understand the resident s' concerns because it's not going to look right. If it was in front of my house I would be just as upset. So he did tell me that I'll talk to my boss to see if I could work out something tomorrow . But during that time I contacted Mr. Voldenberg . So that is on this street. I'm going to report out the other street. So this is happening also -- this is all near Weston Field, 700 and 800 block of Foster they paved up the middle of the road, not curb to curb, up the middle of the road. And also the 1000 block of Diamond , they paved. The 1100 block they paved half. The 1200 they paved and the 1300 block. But the 1400 block they only paved half, which I'm trying to wrap my head around this. I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 understand because we're always told curb to curb after any work they do. So, I mean, this reminds me of going and getting half a hair cut. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense to me. So if -- I'm told by the one utility company , well, we could only do this much but the rest -- so if that's the case, the City should pick up the rest. These are two areas that are low income and OECD should probably be able to kick in. I know there is another schedule coming out in October or the fall. But I know, you know, there's three paving entities . One is the City. One is OECD. And one is the utilities that promise to go curb to curb after they do their work. So with that said -- so Mr. Voldenberg kindly reached out to Miss Fowler. And I did get back an e-mail today. So if you have not receive d a call back you (inaudible ) the UGI project manager regarding the paving project on Blair Avenue and Foster. I did not put the -- she was involved in the project and advised the UGI was only obligate d under contract the standard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 procedure to pave from one side of each street as utility work did not cross the center line of either roadway . I will confirm the same with Mr. Hunt when I'm able to speak with him. This is -- this comes from Mrs. Fowler. And this is what she's told. But it doesn't make sense to me. I was always told curb to curb. So I don't think this is acceptable , you know, we should be working with the residents and not working against them. So could you please reach out to all the departments related to this and put a little pressure on? And I pretty much want to know why. I mean, that answer isn't good enough for me. I think it's ridiculous . If we're promised that every time we meet with these utility companies they go curb to curb and all of a sudden they're going up the middle of the street or one side because all this work was done -- I took a ride over there today. The sides that they didn't do, there was evidence that it was dug up for utilities . So I'm having troubling understand ing this. And, you know, off the record he said, well, you know, it's about money. We're trying to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 save some money here. I just think that is unacceptable . So can you please send some correspondence . I just want some better explanation than this and why it's not being curb to curb. And like I said, we should work for the residents not against them. And then next, I received a bunch of complaints about new procedures for our City parks. I'm a little confused . So that is why I have a bunch of questions . I've heard from over the weekend from some neighbor hood organizations , concerned citizens , people that go to the park, people that utilize the park for different events. I'm being told now in the middle of the summer that any event that you want to do with the park requires 60-days notice. Sixty days and summer is going to be over. And I heard like East Mountain movie night, you know, in the past they were allowed to sell food or give food away. Now, they're being told they cannot do that without a food vendor's license . All right. And some other issues related to that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 is so what I got was -- I have stuff all over the place. You also have to fill out a six-page special events form in addition to the 60-day notice to utilize the park. Some of these neighborhoods groups used to have meeting s at the park. Now it's not allowed without permission which requires a lot of paperwork . Also I -- there is some other issues. But for the most part my concern is, they're going to change the rules in the 9th inning of a game and not inform the residents as to why, how, when and just do it in the middle of the summer without informing the resident s, I need to know why this happened. And is it going to continue the rest of the summer? Are they going to post this information on a website ? Like, just to start all these new policies and procedures and never bring them to us, I just think it's a little too much for this summer. And so last week, you know, we talked about when the Mayor was here and the Chief of Police about the entry here, the vestibule and the shield that was put up during 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 COVID, which I didn't have a problem with. And then we were informed that, well, no, it's going to remain because of safety. Whose safety? I don't know. And after that meeting believe it or not, I received a bunch more concerns about it. And it was about an employee that works here. It wasn't about someone coming in to talk to an employee or reach out and to an employee. It was about an employee with some concerns . So this concern was -- we have a lot of people that come into the building with complaint s about garbage , pothole s and whatnot . We're here -- are just as important as the City Hall employees . Here's something else. In the main office, there's not even a door to get out if there is ever a fire or a crazy person with a gun. Yes, they are behind a door. So -- but if there is ever a fire in the foyer, how does one get out of the office? This is a clear violation of safety for the clerical workers in the office. All right. So there is issues within the building of employees that don't want this shield to remain.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 And I share the concerns with the comment s and some of the residents that, you know, this is our building . It's the taxpayer 's building . This is taxpayer 's City Hall. And if there is a safety issue, I think a compromise like what you said, Mr. Coyne, secure the offices so people could still come in here. There's never been an issue before. Why create an issue that didn't exist and say, you know what, it remains because I'm afraid. That's just not good enough for me. So I would like to revisit that. And maybe the concerns of the workers that are here if they're valid and it is an issue with safety, then we have to take another look at it, okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then next, I want to report out -- I know there's a lot of stuff. I'm sorry. I get hit every day because we only have one more meeting . So months ago, you know, when the garbage was a mess and picking up and the schedule , you know, it was kind of blamed on Rubicon . And Rubicon was the software that was purchas ed seven, eight months 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 ago. It's suppose d to save a million dollars a year. I have been asking for Mr. West and DPW to come in and update with us, you know, how much are we saving with this, is it working ? I was told, oh, you know what, we're going to come in in September , so which I believe or not believe at this point. But I knew that was going to happen they'd push it past recess. And also, Mr. Voldenberg , I got another complaint or two about the old school of the deaf. So I know they were cited. I know the owner lives out of town and can't be reached . But I was told that half the building is in Dunmore and half is in Scranton . People in Dunmore are stepping up and taking care of the property and cutting the grass and doing that. But Scranton side of it still remains a blight issue. So can you see where we're at because they were suppose d to follow up. Let's see where we're at with that building , okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : And Mr. Raines who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 was here, the handicap gentleman that comes and speaks very well all the time and brings up valid points about being ADA accessible reached out to me and he said that, you know, last time I was there I was in the bathroom . I used the bathroom . And he said, I don't know if you realize , but the little rinky dink latches that secure the door when you're in the bathroom are a violation -- an ADA compliance violation . So I promised him I would bring it up. And can you please -- he said, you know, it's in the men's room. I don't about the women's room. I said I don't know about the women's room either. You know, I don't go in there. But can you please send this to administration and make sure we get in compliance , especially with the -- he was very concern ed about the parking and I still am. Can you check on that because we inquired about that parking out front and making it assessable to get in the building because that was brought up a couple, maybe a month ago. But something as simple as a lock can be brought into compliance with our inhouse maintenance . So bring it to their attention 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 because it was brought to mine. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. That's all I have. Oh, no, I have one more. I'm sorry. I apology . So I hate -- hey, sometimes I listen to 20 of you, so I only have 20 -- not 20 things tonight . So of course we got the bill that Ufberg's contract is getting renewed . And but we did spend 68 -- were billed 68 grand for the month of June, right, for labor. We all know that. It was brought up earlier . And negotiations we're told are still ongoing. So, I don't know, so month ago I brought up I want a list of actual sitdown meetings and negotiation s and dates and when they occurred. So I would like that updated . I know that all of the $68,000 doesn't go towards the negotiations and other labor issues, but I would like to know if any other negotiations occurred in person like the last update I asked for months ago. I would like to know the difference , all right? I'm not asking what was spent because it will take two months to get another redacted bill. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 just want to know if the negotiations are actually occurring like we're being told. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out tomorrow , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just a couple things, Mr. Voldenberg , I did get a few complaints this week about some quality of life issues. I'll send over those addresses to you. In terms of Rubicon , I was told that they are still in a data collection phase that they have not suggested any new routes or any of the such. So that's why they are going to come in in September so they could further collect some more data. We did get an update from the Tax Collector , Cathy Wechsler in terms of where tax collection s are at. So over 18,000 accounts have been paid in full, which is just over 73 percent . Those that paid at least one installment is up to 8.2 percent and no payment made to date after the face value period was at 19.1 percent . That was sent over by the Tax 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 Collector yesterday . And in terms of some of the public comments , Mr. Voldenberg , can you reach out to Corporal Butler regarding the permit parking on the 400 of Colfax, 400 of Arthur and 200 of Colfax and make sure that is still being enforced ? And also, instead of bringing it up under 5-B, can we look for some clarification in terms of the issue brought up with the labor counsel on page four I believe it is regarding the number that parties can mutually extend the agreement to see where that's at and see if that's worded correctly in our backup? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And that's all I have for this evening . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
