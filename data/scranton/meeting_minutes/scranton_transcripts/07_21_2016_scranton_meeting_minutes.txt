MS.HODOWANITZ :JoanHodowanitz , cityresident andtaxpayer .Innever occurred tomebefore butItem3-D,the checkreceived for$50,000fromtheHousing Authority inpayment inlieuoftaxes,I wonder howtheycomeupwiththefigure of $50,000because doesn'ttheScranton Housing Authority haveacresandacresofhousing withHilltopandValley ViewandMidtown apartments ?Doesanybody anyone haveany ideahowtheycomeupwiththefigure of $50,000?Because ifthatwasallprivately ownedrealestate Ithinkthetaxbillwould beconsiderably higher.It'sjustanaside. The2015cityauditis51dayslate, asyouwellknow.Also,nextmonthwhenyou areonrecess Iexpect thattheState Auditor General willbepresenting his1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 report onhislatest auditofthemunicipal pension fundsandIhopethatthereis another publicpressreleasethatthe citizens canattend andthathopefully some ofyouwillattend toseewhathereports as tothehealth ofpension funds.Hopefully therehasbeenasignificant improvement . Also,rightbehind theAugust recess willbethe2017operating budget cycle,and coming infastandfurious .Now,Ihaveto agreewithrecent comments madebyMarie Schumacher andaneditorial inthe Times-Tribune withregard tolong-term funding ofpayincreases andnewhiresthat wehavebeenrelying inthepastwithgrants whichwouldpayforsomething likethefirst threeyears,thenafterthatitfallsonthe shoulders ofthetaxpayer s,andI'mnot opposed tonewhiresandI'mnotopposed to payincreases wheretheyarewarranted ,but wehavebeenusinggrants asamethod of getting thesethings passed without regard tohowdowemaintain payments intothe future formanyyearstocome,andIthink it'stimetostarting withthe20171 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 operating budget thattheadministration is askedtocomeupwithapolicy forhowwe aregoingtosustain thosepayments ,and thisgoesbackto2014.Ifyourecall,the business administrator wasgivena significant payraisewhichwouldpaidfor byagrant.Ithinkitwassomething over $23,000.Now,thisisthethirdyear,so starting nextyearthatpayraisecomesout oftaxpayer 'spockets . And,again,thosepayincreases and newhirestheymaywellbejustified butwe havenotaddressed theissueofhowweare goingtopaytheminthelongrun. Also,theJunecontroller 'sreport isoutandIwassurprised thatitdidnot reflect the$40million bondforthepolice andfirefighters 'Courtaward.That'snot reflected intheJunereport eventhough I understand itwascompleted inthemonthof theJune,evensomeofthechecks mayhave goneoutinthemonthofJune.Iwould beinglooking closely attheJulyreport to seeifthat'sbeencorrected andthose figures havebeenadjusted ,andinaddition1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 tothewagetaxthatweshould havebeen receiving fromthosefourawardpayments and thepension fundcontributions including thatwhopping $1.6million thatwentoutin July. Oneinteresting thingIsawinthe Junereport,however ,wasRainey &Rainey underprofessional services intheBA's Office,$1,681.25.Thisisthesecond and finalyearthatwehaveacontract from Rainey &Rainey toassist theBA'sOfficein thepreparation oftheannual audit.And, again,itislateagainthisyear,hopefully itwilldonebefore theendofthefiscal year,butI'mwondering howistheBA's OfficegoingtofairnextyearwhenRainey & Rainey isnotintheretoholdtheirhand. Itwillbeinteresting . And,finally ,Iagreewiththe recent editorial intheTimes,ifthecity isnotgoingtosuetheSewerAuthority and Keystone Sanitary Landfill withregard to theleachatelineandtherecent incident ,I agreewiththeTimesthatcouncil should consider holding it'sownhearings .Since1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 youhavesubpoena power,youneedtothen, youknow,continue withthisinvestigation because thepublichasbotharightanda needtoknowwhathappened .Thisisnot justaGreenridge issue,thisisaScranton issueanditaffects everyresident and taxpayer inthecity.Thankyou.
