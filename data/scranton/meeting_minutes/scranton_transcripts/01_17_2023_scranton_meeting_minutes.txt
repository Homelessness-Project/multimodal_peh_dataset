SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORTS 2021-2022 YEAR TO DATE DECEMBER 31, 2022. 3.E. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED JANUARY 12, 2023 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR CITY COUNCIL . 3.F. OPENGOV CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR THE YEAR 2022. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements this evening ? MR. SMURL: I have refuge garbage is a day behind this week because of Martin Luther King holiday . And correspondence we received from Mayor Cognetti that we will have later. We printed some out if anyone doesn't have internet access, they are on the table right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 there next to our Times reporter if you want a copy of it. That's it. MR. SCHUSTER : I have one other announcement . We did get a timeline of the new zoning ordinance from the Law Department last week. And just so everybody is aware -- that the public is fully aware, the Planning Commission on the 26th -- so January 26th at 6 p.m., they're going to be bringing that up. So it will be the community 's first opportunity in the new year to speak to the new zoning ordinance . So if neighbor s or residents have any comment s on that, it would be a good time to air their concerns . MR. KING: During Fifth Order this evening I'll give an overview of the updated timeline for the zoning ordinance . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have two quick ones. So last Friday Chief Carroll presented Detective Michael Schultz , Patrol Officer Jill Foley, which is A-shift, Patrol Office Christopher Gnall, which is C-shift; and Patrol Officer Kevin Sweeney , which is B-shift with awards of outstanding excellence .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 These members were chosen by their peers as the employees of their respected shift/division that best exemplifies the role of the police officer and provides the best representation of the police department . So my applause goes out to them. And then secondly , I would like to congratulate the Lady Invaders of West Scranton . They claimed both 7th and 8th grade championships at Martin Luther King tournament yesterday . So congratulations to them. And that is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? Fourth Order. Citizens Participation . MR. VOLDENBERG : CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: First name on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Item 5-D, read the item, Joan Sunday once again making a $5,000 donation to the fire department in honor of their son Stephen who passed away I believe in 2020 from COVID-19. Now, they've made more than one donation , sizeable donation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 So my recommendation to you, Mr. King, is next time you talk to the Mayor or maybe Chief Judge, I think it would be appropriate in some way to memorial ize their son Stephen and recognize their contribution because this is far beyond what I've ever seen any family do for the City of Scranton . I think it would be very appropriate . It wouldn't cost any money, a proclamation , name a major piece of equipment after him in his memory, something of that, you know, but these are outstanding people. Speaking of the fire department , a week ago several firefighters went down to Allentown to assist on a rescue of a man who was trapped when a trench collapsed . I saw coverage of it on WNEP Channel 16. I didn't see anything in the newspaper , Jeff. At any rate, you hear a lot of times, you know, thank a veteran for their service . Well, I wouldn't mind the people of Scranton -- there are police and firefighters have equally dangerous jobs. And they should also be thanked . A lot of people would never dream of going into those professions because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 of the risk that it entails. But I think that, you know, we should all recognize them and thank them for their service anytime we can. In continuing with the fire department , where do we stand with the labor contract for the firefighter s and the police? MR. KING: I spoke to the Mayor yesterday . And the fire department and the police department are going to be going into arbitration . I believe the first arbitration hearing is going to happen probably within the next two to three weeks. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, just keep in mind now that these people are serving without benefit of a contract . It's been over a year. What is the status of the 2021 audit? MR. SCHUSTER : So the last e-mail that we got it said that the auditors are waiting on two documents . The two remaining items are the Sewer Authority audit and the actuary report for the post retirement benefits . They're saying once they get those documents they could complete the audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : I hope the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 seriously considers imposing that 10 percent fine for a late audit because it was promised on September 30th, if you all recall and which brings to mind in the Sewer Authority , hopefully that entity will go away this year. I understand that they're on a different fiscal year which is one of the reasons why their audit comes in late. But something to think about, when you create an authority or a commission it's like a fire and forget missile , okay? You set it up. You point the members and then they don't answer to you anymore. They don't answer to the voters. So you don't have much power over them. So hopefully if you're going to set up a stormwater authority , this is something to keep in mind. It's the Mayor that nominates these appointments , is it not? Hopefully we'll get adults in on both sides of the fence who will say we're going to do what is right for the City of Scranton and not have any of these territorial contests. And by the way, you can finish the audit without , you know, the Sewer Authority 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 audit. You simply get an adverse opinion and you move on. And I hope you saw in the paper county discovers unclaimed taxpayer money. The Controller 's office uncovers roughly $60,000. Now, it turns out that Reggie Mariani from the Controller 's office, he entered into the State Treasury Department looking for unclaimed property . Over 100 keywords, not just Lackawanna County but general fund, district magistrate , that's how they come up with over $60,000. Quote, cursory searches for the City of Scranton , Dunmore and Jessup boroughs and the Scranton School District showed unclaimed money. We would recommend that if people haven't claimed with the unclaimed property , they do it. This is something else to discuss with the Mayor. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is, you know, I hope that anyone who would run for public office they'd go to Minooka and talk to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the former Mayor Connors who was just an outstanding Mayor and a public servant . And I think that as time has flowed through this city, we just have diminished ourself to the point where I think people forget what they were elected for. But today I want to talk about the pool at Nay Aug. And, Mr. Smurl, you made a comment about the water slide that it was inspected every year and it never had an issue. Those were your statements here from the minutes from the Rec Authority . Now, we're talking about building a pool in the City of Scranton . Thankfully the old pool hasn't been removed yet because there's ways to fix pools. You pump cement underneath them and you block the hole. Now, it stops the pool from losing the water. And I watch it done all the time on the natural gas sites where they bring a truck in and they pump the cement down underneath it and they stop the leak. Now, the Rec Authority questioned where the money was going to come from to build a pool. I never heard of a city building a pool that's 3 foot deep in my life. And the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 bulk of what the Mayor's talking about is building a splash park, which is just the most atrocious silliness that I've ever heard in my entire lifetime . But the big issue here is, we don't have the money. So why are we filling pools in with dirt and pretending like we've got answers to some question because that's not really what's going on here. And what we've had in the city over an extended period of time is a big problem with I feel public graph by the flow of grant money through Council flowing all over the place. Okay, now we got it moving through nonprofit s and we got all kinds of silliness going on. People need to go to the South Side Sports Complex , which the University of Scranton now owns that was built with Section 70 money where the federal government said that project could never be sold, never. And the city sold it. So now if the federal government comes back here and asks for their money back then the resident s have to pony up. We've just played so many games with resident s. And, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 know, the Mayor not coming in here today and sending a memo, well, look it, here's the Mayor's statement , okay? The Mayor, "The goal is to not take the debt for the pool." What debt? You're filing for grants. Okay, now, we took the slide down. Instead of taking the slide down and disassembling it and putting it on the ground and building whatever project we were going to build -- allegedly it was given to the contractor . Now, I mean, I've got that in paperwork . And you just have to question how corrupt can our government be? I mean, Mr. King, that invitation for you on the 26th is still open, okay, for ECTV at 5:30 on the 26th. I think you should come. I think you should bring your Council with you. You know why, because you're not talking to me. You're talking to the residents . And I think they have a right to know what's happened with this project , where the Mayor is, how we proceeded to fill a pool in without money to build a pool. Even the Rec Authority is questioning where is the money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 coming from. Now, there's opposition to a splash park. And all the people that are talking to me -- and there's quite a few, they have no faith in this Council . They think the city is nothing but corrupt from the top to the bottom. And they think that this Council would never show its face out in light of public and have a discussion at a table. And the one thing that's really got them upset is, they don't want a splash park. They want a pool. But you know something , all is not lost because the pool is still there. And I don't -- in these document s I have -- I don't have the study. Where's the study? You know, you talk about the study that was done. I mean, there is just a host of things here that the public should be informed on what has taken place at the Rec Authority . I'm going to ask the new Rec Authority members and the old ones in the future to come and sit on ECTV with me at a table and have a discussion . And, you know, Mr. King, I think you should really second think what you said last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 week. And you, as the President of Council and the rest of the Council , you should present yourself not to me, but the residents of the city because that's the real problem we have, credibility . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening, Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . Just like to reiterate on what Lee just said. The dumbest thing that could ever happen in this city was the destruction of that pool. If anybody has any common sense from engineering , when you have a road settlement or a bridge settlement , they come out and they pump concrete down underneath it to raise it up where it's supposed to be. Those holes could have been plugged . Nobody was interested in saving the pool. It was the stupidity about how much they could gouge us and the City of Scranton out of our money and contractors coming in. They don't want to repair it. They want to fill their damn pockets . Okay, I've been in construction a long, long time. I deal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 with the gas wells and drilling . It was the dumbest thing the city could ever do to the people in this city to tell us senior citizens we're going to run around in a splash park. You ripped the sliding board down. You didn't use any common sense because it's all about dollars who could get it. And that's the worst thing that could happen here. The other part I went against as you're well aware the Recreation Authority for the parking at Nay Aug Park by Geisinger employees . The Recreation Authority settled for peanuts . You pay $2 an hour sitting in front of the hospital for a meter with a $2 limit. They settled for $500,000. We wanted a million minimum out of it. Don't care about lights. PP&L puts them in for free. Yet they turned around and they settled with Geisinger that's spending millions and millions of dollars . Look what they just did off Olive Street, 20-some million dollars . Yet the stupidity there -- and I sued them was before Judge Gibbons . And it's still an active lawsuit . And I'm going to take it right to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the end until we get justification that the board -- the Recreation Authority at Nay Aug gets disbanded and it goes under City Recreation Authority , period. We don't need another authority with the incompetence that's up there. I'm not saying it behind anybody 's back. You are fully aware, sir, I said it right to everybody 's face. And I said it in the courtrooms . So what you're doing to this city to sit on this panel, you don't represent yourselves . You represent the City of Scranton and its residents . And that's what's wrong here. And that's what's got to change. Now if I may, I would like to approach Council . I have something to put out, if I may, Mr. King? MR. KING: Sure. MR. BOLUS: I present ed Council and it's not blindsiding Jessica in any way, shape or form. I have nothing but the highest respect for her and her profession as a physical therapist . I go to them. But keeping in mind if you read it, it says according to the American Physical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Therapy Association , the appropriate designation is DPT. Should identify as a doctor of physical therapy to avoid confusion as people who don't know your background will presume you're an MD or a DO who went to medical school and could diagnose and prescribe medication . I've already spoken to Jessica about it. And I'll address her as Doctor. She's entitled to that. But the people are entitle d to know that Jessica is a physical therapist . Unfortunately she can't prescribe medication or do anything . So it's like to the medical profess ion -- and I have many, many friends and so does she. She gets business from doctors who sign a prescription to go for physical therapy . I've asked Jessica if she would just put behind her name -- and I'll pay for the new name plate to identify her profession which she should be damn well proud to say she is because doctors and everybody else cannot do what she does or physical therapist with aquatic therapy and everything else. I simply ask that out of respect to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 the medical profession , Jessica . And I will address you as Doctor. I have no problem with it. I have a great deal of respect for you. And you know that from a long time ago. And I didn't come here blindside her. I already discussed it if you would take that into consideration . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. ATTY. GALLAGHER : -- Dr. Rothchild , if she has a legal requirement to include , DPT in her name. She's designate d as a Doctor of Physical Therapy . I believe that's why it's up there, okay? MR. KING: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . First off, as a lot of people know last Sunday was a benefit for my daughter in West Side. And I'd like to thank everybody that showed up. Thank you so much for coming. Council Schuster and his wife came, Kathy Carrera came, Marie Schumacher . We had a really good crowd. I thank everybody . There's people that didn't come that made contribution s like Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 McAndrew did. So anybody that came and didn't come, thank you very much for your contribution . It was a big help. We had a really good time. It was a good turnout. And next month and the month after there's going to be two wrestling events that will benefit her also. MR. KING: Mr. Spindler , can you leave an address where a contribution can be made before you leave tonight ? MR. SPINDLER : Sure. Sure. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SPINDLER : So she has a lot of support behind her. She has a long road to recovery . Moving on, last week, Mr. Smurl, you said about all the thousands of gallons we're losing from the big pool. And you said you shut it down. Did you shut it down or did the Rec Authority vote on it? MR. SMURL: There was an emergency (inaudible .) MR. SPINDLER : It wasn't just you. MR. SMURL: I'm sorry? MR. SPINDLER : It wasn't just you. MR. SMURL: No, initially -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. SPINDLER : You said last week to quote you, you said, "I shut the pool down." MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. SPINDLER : That's what you said. So I just wanted it clarified . The Rec Authority had to vote on it, correct ? MR. SMURL: There was an emergency when we found out how many gallons of water it was losing. So we had to call the Mayor's office. I had called the Mayor's office and told him of it. And he said shut it down. And, therefore , I shut the water off to the pool -- to that pool and that was it. MR. SPINDLER : Okay, thank you. MR. SMURL: So I did shut it down. MR. SPINDLER : Lastly, I was really disappointed to see in the paper last week that Boozy B's is closing . I was a big proponent when they opened up. I'd been there a couple times. I loved it. I hate to see any business leave the city, especially a small business like that. You know, they're doing good in Wilkes-Barre I know that. I don't know what happened up here. Every time I went there I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 loved it. I thought it was great. You know, anybody that loves ice cream and nice to have an alcoholic drink once in a while. It was really good. I'm going to miss it, especially in the summer. In the winter I'm not a big ice cream guy. I'll miss it in the summer. I wish them the best of luck and just sad to see that they're leaving . That's all I have. Thank you for your time. And thanks again to everybody that contributed to the benefit for my daughter . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Jessica Osborne . MS. OSBORNE : Good evening . My name is Jessica Osborne . And I live on Sanderson Avenue. And I just want to say that this is my third time here. Different rounds of the presidents this time too for residential parking on my street because of the new brewery that is there. They opened on Thursday . And like I had told you what was going to happen, happened . Everybody parked on the street. I come home from work, there's no where to park. He's planning on having food 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 trucks there. I don't know what you guys want to do with that. Are you going to help me out? You guys keep saying call the cops. I have called in the past. They drive by. They don't help out. I'm not going to be that person that keeps calling them and nagging them and then they don't come. I just don't understand . I mean, you guys keep saying the ordinance . You keep using it against me. But it also says too for between the business hours of Monday through Friday where this guy is on Thursday to Sunday night. I don't know if you guys could do something with that with the ordinance to help me out because if you read that, that's what it says. And thus far you have been holding that ordinance against me when I've asked you for this. I mean -- MR. KING: It's my understanding that we had to wait until that business opened up before the police could go down there and do -- I don't know, what would it be a traffic study to -- MR. VOLDENBERG : Traffic and sight study, yes, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. KING: Yeah, to determine whether it qualifies for -- MS. OSBORNE : I understand . I was trying to do preventative measures . I already knew this was going to happen. I lived there for 25 years at this intersection . I've already come here and I told you about people going through the stop sign, police officers themselves, buses, everybody . You name it. I've seen it. It's going to happen like on Birney Avenue. That place was dangerous . So is this. It's going to happen. I've seen accident s happen like years ago when I lived there when I was younger, like, the amount of people that are going to be there drinking , parking more. It's not like it was with a garage where people left their cars there and they left it there overnight and whatnot . These people are coming and going now. It's different . You have Prep that practices there. They're going to start coming again. It's busy there. There's a bus stop and everything else. I don't have a driveway. MR. KING: Well, unfortunately , it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 was reviewed by I think the prior officer that was in charge of doing those studies before the business opened. Now the business is open which puts it in a position to go back and reevaluate that. MS. OSBORNE : My understanding from Frank it's somebody else too. And I'm just curious . I've asked before what are their qualifications that make them approved to do this because one of his responses was they just read the ordinance . Well, I can read the ordinance too, no offense . MR. KING: I can't sit here and tell you I know exactly what the process is that they utilize . But, you know, I believe that they're qualified to be able to evaluate and do a proper evaluation as to whether , you know, it's appropriate to qualify for -- you're looking for permit parking there, correct ? MS. OSBORNE : The resident s are looking for it, yeah. And I'm also asking truck traffic too. We discussed this back and forth, Frank and I. I just don't understand why they have to use my block of Sanderson when they could use Capouse Avenue which is wider 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 widthwise for their trucks. They could go down Walnut Street, Poplar Street. If the DPW trucks could make those streets , so could they. You guys keep telling me they go down to Albright. There's no reason for them to make that turn on Sanderson and Glenn. I don't know if any of you guys ever travelled or driven that to appreciate any of this. If you go down there and check it out yourself , the width of that whole road from Sanderson is pretty tight. So if you seen the truck traffic it's -- I don't think they should be on that block is what I'm saying. There is no reason why they can't go to Capouse and make those couple turns. MR. KING: We'll have the police check into that. I believe one of the issues is because the reason why those trucks have to come down there is they can't get through the underpass -- MS. OSBORNE : If they go up one more block and they make a couple turns and they go down by like where National Bakery is and go down by Walnut and Poplar where Tops is and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 they go down there and they could by DPW and get onto Albright where they're supposed to be. They could make those turns is what I'm trying to say. There's no reason for them to be on my block from the -- actually from like 1500 to like 1200 on Sanderson . There's no reason for them to be on that block for how small it is widthwise. MR. KING: We'll ask the police to take a look at that. MS. OSBORNE : I don't understand why they can't just go up and make a couple turns. It's dangerous . And now you're going to have people coming in and out and drinking like that on that corner there -- I would just -- like, I live right there when you're making this turn. My car almost gets hit all the time. I'm like, oh, are they going to make it? Let's see. It's like -- MR. KING: Right. Okay. Well, we'll ask the police to take a look at it are there other options for the trucks -- MS. OSBORNE : And do something with the stop signs and lighting there. It's terrible . Thanks for your time. I appreciate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 it. MR. KING: Thank you, Jessica . There are no more names on the sign-in sheet. Would someone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I've been out for a little bit. So I'm not quite up to speed again. But looking in the paper I noticed that from past discussions here, one of the people before Council talked about being punitively or adversely and punitively penalize d by the license inspection officer that they come out and taken picture s of his next door neighbor and then wound up giving fines to the gentleman who was here and probably might speak on it tonight . It was interest ing looking in the newspaper that the City made a settlement in 2001 for targeted enforcement of properties that were for a punitive measure by the License and Inspection Bureau. It's also interesting that it cost the City $285,000 for that settlement . That's an awful big amount of budget money for something that's punitive . Has that been addressed with the employees who go out and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 have taken these actions ? I believe that at $285,000 that's quite a number of years of pay. If I had done that on a company and cost my company $285,000 and say I was making $60,000 a year, I could be sure I'd find the door almost instantly . I wouldn't be an employee there at that point. I would have been let go because costing close to $300,000 because of punitive enforcement and setting up a possible pattern and practice for this to happen again is an issue that needs to be addressed . Recently there's also been a question on right to knows where some people have put in right to knows and come back with there's no information found, no information on file. There's no paperwork . I understand part of that issue because when I talked to Mr. King about the request for whether or not the recycling fees were going into a separate account and he was told that he could not discuss it under -- because it was under litigation . I had asked him how that documentation was handled. And he said he had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 talked to the City Solicitor and the City Solicitor gave him that information back verbally . Unfortunately , you can't do a right to know on a verbal question . You can't do a right to know on a discussion . You can't find someone 's memory on paper documents . Anything that's requested that goes from one department to another in relation to questions from citizens needs to have a followup on paper on e-mail to track the issue because we have a right to be able to go back and verify those conversations . And we can't verify a he said, she said. There is no proof, especially after if Mr. King leaves this board or something should happen, there is no record for the citizens to go back on. And seeing as a number of right to know requests have come back with no documentation found, part of the reason no documentation is found is because it's all done verbally . Nothing is put on paperwork specifically to avoid a paper trail. For zoning the -- well, the pilots last year, let's touch on pilots. We have a very low pilot program last year. I believe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 six or seven people actually donated pilot money for the entire year. That's pretty low. There was private donors who donated to the fire department and everything else in much greater quantities than our non-profits . We need to look into that again because people in the non-profits are not kicking in their fair share. And I would like to thank whoever put these downstairs because as -- for the trash pickups because a number of people here have picked them up today because of yet I received none in the mail. Nothing has gone out and I had to come here to pick up something I should have had before the end of the year. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to speak? MS. KOLOSKI : Hi. Doris Koloski , resident of Scranton . I really came today just to make an announcement . But I do have to say I have to say something in favor of the Rec board up at Nay Aug Park after hearing that blasting of disband ing them and everything . For all the boards I've ever been on or served on and I'm not on that Rec board, this is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 hardest working board that I've ever seen. This is an actual working board that devotes so much time and energy for the betterment of the park, which I could totally attest to since I've been going there for over 59 years -- actually for like 70-some years. I'm really hoping you don't take him seriously because he knows not what he's talking about. And they have open meeting s on the first Thursday of every month to the public. You could hear where the money is going. You could hear what they're voting on. You could hear what they're planning, what they're purchasing . So there is nothing sneaky or undercover about that Rec board. And the improvements that they have made are outstanding . I just can't say enough about every member that's on them. Okay, so that's enough. And I've never been on it. So I'm not singing praises for me. All right. My announcement -- and I hope it's not out of order because of where it's going to be held. I'm with an organization called Moms Demand Action. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 for common sense gun laws. We are not antigun. We are common sense gun laws. And February 1st -- I could never read. That's why I hate when I have to read and not just say it off the top of my head. But from February 1st to February 7th, it's National Gun Violence Survivor 's Week. And it's held then because more people are killed by guns in the United States than killed in our peer countries in an entire year -- calendar year in the month of February . And Mom's Demand Action of Lackawanna and Luzerne County -- that's why I know it's not a city thing it's more of a county thing. But we meet in the city will be sponsoring a blood drive. And it's at Miller Keystone Blood Center in Pittston . And it's because , you know, it's just a blood drive where you could go to give blood. So if you know anybody interested in giving blood, go and sign up at giveapint.org. Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Doris. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. VERCHUK : Hello, I am Eli 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Verchuk once again from 2 Leslie Drive. And I know there have been plans for renovation of the Robinson Park. And I'm just wondering if you could let me know when those plans will commence . MR. KING: I don't believe I have a date right now for Robinson -- MR. SMURL: I have a date. I do have the list of parks that are going to be done this summer. MR. KING: Okay. During Fifth Order, Mr. Smurl will give an update on some of the parks that will be addressed this summer. I'll try to find out a date for the East Mountain Neighborhood Association for you as to when those meetings will begin. MR. VERCHUK : Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I came tonight with my -- the only recycling postcard that I had which was last year's and so I was very happy to see at the sign-in and I took several for some of my neighbors who also have not received theirs yet. So who mailed it out? Did the city mail 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 it out or -- MR. KING: I believe it was contracted out. DR. ROTHCHILD : It was a print shop that was used. And I think the error occurred the print shop. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, the printer did it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Right. So they had made additional copies and they are resending out additional copies. But I have some further questions about it that I'll mention in Fifth Order. MR. KING: Obviously -- and I found out that -- I got one from here and my wife saw it in the back of my car and she's like, oh, we didn't get one of these. I thought we did. So I know that, you know, you brought that to the attention last week. Trust me, it's being addressed . But we did ask to have them available here, especially for people this evening . MR. SCHUSTER : And I did hear that there's a high volume of calls that were coming into the city from the East Mountain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 neighborhood . So that might have been the section that was missed. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. The other thing I would like to talk about is the -- well, first of all, I think we should put it in the code when that should be mailed or by the latest date that it should be in the mail, whoever does it. It doesn't matter. And then it was about -- I don't know if it was last year or it might have even been the year before. There was a young woman who came to this podium and said that she had been talking to a man who -- I might have it backwards but you'll get it. It doesn't matter which way it went. But I believe it was he offered to buy the paint if they would paint the side of that first building when you come across the Duffy Memorial Bridge toward Mulberry Street. It's in bad shape. And whoever was president , I think it was still Bill Gaughan said, oh, no need to worry about that. That's going to be demolished . Well, it still hasn't been. And do we have a stated policy for demolition and how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 many are there? I would like to know how many people or how many properties are on the demolition list and how they're prioritized and if that could be kept up so we could just look for it on the -- MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you send something to the administration , see if we can get a list of the properties that are on the demolition list? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. KING: And find out what the process is. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, we do have a process on that. Sometimes things get held up legally and that might take longer, a property that might be on the demo list and then it's taken off the demo list. I'm not sure that that property has ever been on it. I know there was a condemnation at least for one of the apartments in the building , but not for the whole building itself. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay, well, if we can find out. That's a big difference there, yeah. And drainage , we need to start looking at stormwater and drainage , especially 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 on East Mountain . The whole unit block of Seymour Avenue coming off 307 has been like about that thick of ice. And I called DPW and I'm sure they went out and tried to do something . But it's still -- it's melted down. But it's still in terrible shape. And it's all drainage coming down from Snook Street. So we -- it would be nice to get that done. And then I would just like to say I was very happy to go to Les's daughter 's fundraiser. She's not only a very pretty girl, but she also had a very beautiful sling. I've never seen one like that. But, you know, where did she get it? Starts with an A. Yes, Amazon. But it was very pretty as is she. So thank you. And I'm looking forward to what Scranton is going to look like January of 2024. MR. KING: I'm prepared for Fifth Order. I have my list. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I've been waiting all week. Okay. Thank you. MR. KING: But then I'm going to have to deliver on it during the year. Thank you. Is there anyone else that would like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening, Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Again this week I picked up the paper, Scranton Times and the Ice Box Complex has been sold to a tax exempt hospital conglomerate . That's just wonderful . But what's going to happen with the taxes? We were before we even heard of the Hill Section being bought out at 38 percent tax exempt in this town. Now I understand we might not be able to say no, but what can we say? It's year in and year out. We keep getting a larger tax bill because somebody is buying another tax paying property . And irregardless of our pools and whatever , our educational system, I know that needs to be paid for. However , it can't just keep going to the same people time and time again. My tax bill's larger than the principal on my house. And pretty soon it's going to shadow the interest on top of it. So it's something to think about. Once again, I have these articles from the Times editorials , state utility law to limit rates.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Now when our sewer system was sold, sewage treatment plant, we were suppose d to have the bills spread out amongst many communities . And we're doing that for other people. But the state consumer commission I think it was banned it from us. And I have a little comment for Scranton Times, don't just say certain entities . That's what I remember from the paper pretty clearly, say what entities opposed spreading those rates out. They wanted to give a 4 percent decrease to something like that. And instead , we got a massive increase . That's probably like 20, 30 bucks a month on our bill for two people. So it's really consider able. And I don't need to pay for Riche Rich's sewer plant and his big mansion somewhere . And that's all there is to it. And also regarding sewer once again, DeNaples with their reverse osmosis plan they got to dump trash for 40 years or more than 40 years -- 50 years it was. There's about 43 left or 44. And now they want to reverse osmosis and contaminate the Nay Aug gorge with their garbage water, unregulated , unobserved .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 You'd have to have somebody testing that water every day of the week coming out of there. And once contamination gets loose it's like, oh, we got a $10,000 fine, oh, my God. You know, some of these libertarian s, their idea of freedom is the right to pollute . And that's all there is to it. They want to do whatever they want to do and externalize their responsibility for it. They want -- they don't want to pay. They could raise the rates up there, I don't care. It's out of state trash. Raise the rates. Charge the people for what they're dumping up there from out of state or whatever . But I don't need to pay more for my sewer when they're allowed to (inaudible ) with impunity with their reverse osmosis . The money goes up to the dump and I pay the bill and end up with the pollution . Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. ELLMAN: Yes, hello, Council . Well, where is he tonight , the big mouth from the city? I thought you were going to -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 interest ed enough to try to get him here. I've said it before and I'll tell you again, when you mess with my pocketbook it makes me irritable . You know, I'm going to tell everybody . Foretold is forewarned. Mr. Sunday and Mr. Oleski need to get second jobs to get a good lawyer because I'm taking them to court along with the city. I've had enough. You people aren't coming after me no more because I'm coming after you. You can't imagine what I've gone through this past couple months with a bunch of incompetents allowed to take advantage of their position like Sunday, started to give me one ticket for this and another ticket for this. Then he changes his mind. Is this the caliber of people that make this administration ? Well, we'll see what happens , I guess -- and how any intelligent human being can say a 5 percent increase in our school taxes is a good move. These directors need their head examined . They are so far away from the tune of this city it's unbelievable . You can't imagine -- I've had a dozen people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 complain why couldn't we close three schools . The reason is we got a bunch of no English speaking , no tax paying people dictating to the school board. What good was it electing a school board if your voice doesn't mean nothing ? It's -- I got a whole bunch of stuff I could talk to. I just don't need to get anybody mad at me, I guess. It's a shame what's going on in this city. You don't know until you get involved like I've been with different parts of this administration . I'll tell you, this city needs a good business plan to run it instead of a tourist as our Mayor. Maybe if she interrupted her daily photo ops and talked to some people on the street and just know what people are going through , she might feel a little different . She's just consumed with the developers downtown . They're a bunch of deadbeats you have to take to court to squeeze taxes out of them. And right now while we're sitting here, there's people out there watching that are being frozen out of their houses in a year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 or two. You know it. They know it. I've heard remarks about it. It's just homeowner ship has just gotten impossible for so many people. I've talked to people they got property they can't rent because of all of these developer s getting loans and grants and loan forgiveness and tax abatements , everything they can to help them but nothing to help people that own property and can't rent it no more because of who wants to pay the same amount of rent when you could go to a new place? Then when somebody leaves a good property , you end up with a slumlord like that garbage that owns the house next door to me. Tonight it looked like a used car lot with two cars parked on the lawn. This city is just full of illegal boarding houses. I walked my dog before down Parker Street, 57 -- I know the people. I know who lives there, 57 East Parker is an illegal boarding house. They got cars on the sidewalk , two cars in the yard. Every house around there but that one is the epitome of care. See, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 there's nobody from the city does anything to stop this. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Mr. Voldenberg , if we can have -- contact someone to take a look at that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I made note of it, sir. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Is there anyone else that would like to address Council ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Are there any Council members that have any motions ? Mr. Smurl? MR. SMURL: Yes, this last week I've spent a few hours with Eileen Cipriani discussing ARPA money, the stormwater funding and upcoming park improvements . One thing I want to discuss is the ARPA, the American Rescue Plan Act money. That money also comes along with 437 pages, plus supplement s and guides and documents on where and how the money can be spent. So to get deeper into that, I tried to find out, you know, why we couldn't put it into parks, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 especially Nay Aug Park. But Nay Aug Park, the location of Nay Aug Park makes it so that none of this money can be used in that park at all. I don't know why a public park -- and it's due to its location because of an upper income neighborhood . A park that big I believe serves the entire community , not just that neighborhood . But that's the rules that we have to live by. So 65 million dollars and not a dollar for Nay Aug. Funding for the current park improvement s is already in place. The Connors Park, Novembrino Park, and the North Scranton mini park are in final design and they should start late spring. There's also on the website for the city you could look up and see what improvements there's going to be at those parks. Weston and Connell Parks, the engineer they are doing the design and the environmental reviews now. So those two are moving along. Robinson , Oakmont , and Capouse , the environmental and the survey are underway right now for those parks. The last one, Nay Aug 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Butterfly Park, they have selected an engineer and they are just waiting now I believe is for the contract ing to be put out to start Nay Aug Park at the Butterfly Park. Then the city said they hope to have Weston, Connell , Robinson , Oakmont and Capouse Avenue started this year and most of that depends on the supply chain. Evidently like everything else, you order playground equipment and they say we'll ship it next year. So we have a lot of stuff ordered I believe right now. But everything depends on the supply of all of this other stuff. And that's it. Thank you to Eileen Cipriani for giving me a couple of hours of her time and answering all my question s. And that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Just two things, I was happy to have met with some of the resident s in the Hill Section . Me and -- myself and Mr. Smurl went up last night and we had to have a discussion on some of the -- the zoning ordinance that is coming out, so thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 you to that group there. And just, you know, two people from our area Jason Kavulich and Chris Paris were just nominated by the Governor for state level positions , so congratulations to them. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a number of comment s and requests tonight , the first of which I met with Miss Cipriani recently as well. We have a standing monthly meeting . And in my conversations with her I requested some more information . And I believe she was going to send me or get code enforce ment to send me a list of properties that have had fires in the past because I don't know a lot of these properties and where they are that they've had a fire and it's been some time, maybe a year, two years and nothing 's been done with the property . So then you are left wondering if it's -- if they're going to be using insurance money to renovate the property if it's going to be demolition , what's happening with them. So I requested that list so that I have a better 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 understanding of what properties are out there still that and what their status is of the properties that have had a fire in the past. And I wanted to bring up about garbage . I've noticed lately a lot of garbage being out very far in advance of when garbage is going to be taken. We have had some days of holidays lately where garbage is going to be a day late. So that is understand able. People put it out on the wrong day or early because of that. But this is garbage that is being put out on the weekend when pickup isn't until Wednesday or Thursday . So this can cause litter. Animals can get into the garbage . It just adds to blight in the neighborhood s when you see garbage bags. Usually they're not even in cans, just garbage bags or items laying out for weeks on end. So I just wanted to remind the public that it's 24 hours in advance of garbage pickup when you could put garbage out at the curb. Make sure they are in trash cans that are closed and just be respectful of your neighbor s. And I'm hoping that we could get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 code enforcement out to more of these properties to give them a door tag to remind them of the proper schedule . And then on the topic of garbage and recycling it was brought up with the schedule s. And I had mention ed that we received an update on the issue being with print shop and that they were being reprinted. And we have copies here at the City Hall for resident s who want to come to pick it up here. But they should have been mailed out to properties where it's missed. I heard from Green Ridge also is one of those neighborhoods that didn't seem to receive the recycling schedules . So I would like to know and I asked Mr. Voldenberg earlier to reach out to our recycling coordinator to find out when people around the time that people could expect to receive the schedule s, the ones that have not already . And I'm also wondering if we had to pay anything additionally for these reprints because it's sounds like it's not to the fault of the city but perhaps this print shop. I want to make sure that we're not paying for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 errors that were not our own. And I had a complaint regarding Bloom Avenue because the garbage trucks were having a difficult time getting down the street to pick up garbage with some parking issues, some vehicle s that were parked. And it's a narrow street. And they weren't able to get through . I know that we already sent this forward previously , but I'm asking that we resend it. I want a request for a traffic study to be completed on Bloom Avenue to determine if we need no parking signs so that vehicle s are not blocking the way for the garbage trucks to get through . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that. DR. ROTHCHILD : Great. And lastly, I just want to address something really quickly . I know that this has been addressed in the past. But I am a physical therapist . I've stated multiple times on the record that's my profession . I don't pretend to be an MD or DO. But my credentials PT DPT which is what comes after my name when I'm signing medical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 documents for my patient s or if I'm engaging in professional activities as it relates to physical therapy , there are some documents I believe some things here that we have those credentials on. But it's really not something that's required . Plenty of people do have doctor in front of their name. It's a formal title just like Mr., Mrs., Miss. And that just happens to be my formal title because of the degree that I hold. A doctorate could be in many different things. So I don't find it necessary to put it next to my name. Also the name plate, the size is limited . And also actually Mrs. Reed when she was our clerk still, she said that it didn't seem like there was going to be enough room to put my full name. I thought Jess was too informal to have on there and she was the one who offered to put doctor. I know I don't need to provide that explanation . But if that's what was being looked for, then I'm happy to provide that. And I'm sorry to take up your time with that. That's all that I have for tonight . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few updates . So before the holiday break, we had some issues over at Weston Field with lifeguard s. We were told at that point that interviews were being -- they were having interviews . So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you reach out to Director Duffy and see where we're at with that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then last week I inquired about the pocket park, a couple of people are still asking me over on Washington Avenue. Did we hear anything ? Any update from them? MR. KING: No response from Scranton Tomorrow . I got an update from the Mayor that the contract was signed this week. And I believe that Scranton Tomorrow actually is involved or in charge of that project . And they're hoping to see it get started this spring. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And then also before the holiday I inquired about Pond Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 with a no U-turn onto Main Avenue. Was there a study done? Did anybody take a look at it? MR. VOLDENBERG : (Inaudible ) Mr. McAndrew , last week. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. What else? Oh, also, I agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Hodowanitz . We should memorialize in some way the Sunday family for their generous -- very generous -- their great generosity regarding their son. So could you please, Mr. Voldenberg , send something over to the Chief or if you want us to make a phone call I could reach out to him. But I really think we should do something . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Councilman King, there is one other thing that I left off. Do you mind if I speak to that real quick just because Council man Smurl had actually reminded me of this. So what will be coming -- I don't think it's on the website just yet. I don't have a date for it. But it should be up shortly . They 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 are working on an ARPA fund performance tracker for the city. So anyone will be able to access this through the website . And it's really neat how it's set up. So there will be, you know, different sections and graphs for what's budgeted for ARPA, what money is already obligated or spent and where these projects lie. So that will be a really great way for resident s to be able to track the ARPA spending . So I'm excited about that. Once that's up, you'll be able to see it will be a pretty useful tool. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . I have a lot. So I'm going to try to move this along as quickly as I can. Along with Secretary of Ageing Jason Kavulich , he's a West Scranton graduate , I want to congratulate him, also State Police Commission Chris Paris, a Scranton Prep graduate . I want to congratulate State Rep Mike Carroll who will be the Secretary of transportation . I know he's a Luzerne County guy but it's nice that we have some local people that will be serving in some high 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 position s in Harrisburg . So I think that's a great thing. I know that Mr. Morgan mentioned Nay Aug Pool. And he mentioned about the wading pool why we would think that's a good idea. Well, we don't think it's a good idea. I think we all publically stated that Mr. Smurl was not on the Council that evening . But when that was present ed by the Mayor, she presented three options . And she asked which one we liked the best. And I said quite frankly I don't like any of them. I think we put it on record as saying we don't want a wading pool and necessarily a splash pad. We want a swimming pool at Nay Aug. And I'm not going to speak again on behalf of my colleagues here, but I will tell you that that's what I would like to see at Nay Aug Pool ultimately . So I felt it was important to say that. I also want to thank Mr. Bolus for sponsoring his annual Christmas dinner over the Christmas holiday for those who are less fortunate and really don't have a place to go on Christmas .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 So I have to applaud him for doing that on an annual basis and really helping a lot of people out. A difficult -- it should be a real happy time for most. For a lot of people it's a depressing time. So I want to thank him for his many years of contribution s with that annual Christmas dinner. Mrs. Schumacher had mentioned to me about some goals I'd like to accomplish over this next year. So I put together -- I didn't just want to spout off. I knew I had a lot of things in my head at the time. I wanted to make sure that I covered . I put together a list for you so that -- and as I read these, this isn't just a goal of mine. I'm hoping to accomplish these goals in collaboration with my fellow Council members along with the city administration . Number one is to work with the administration to identify and pave as many city streets as possible this summer. I want to ensure that the East Mountain stormwater study gets complete d. I encourage city administration to apply for as much infrastructure funds that are available to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 help remediate the stormwater issues that are happening on East Mountain . I want to work with the administration , DPW to continue replacing old and faded and missing street signs throughout the city. I want to bring the zoning ordinance to hearing and ultimately a final vote by the spring of 2023. And I'm going to revise that zoning timeline shortly . There are changes from the information we gave last week. I want to make it a priority to work with city administration to update the city website on a weekly or at least biweekly basis because as pointed out by Mrs. Hodowanitz and others, I think that's important . And I expressed that to our Mayor when I met with her yesterday . And they know it's a priority of Council 's. And we all think it's important that that -- in terms of transparency and getting contracts , audits. Everything should be updated and available for the citizens . As Councilman McAndrew mentioned , I want to push the city administration to properly plan for summer swimming at city pools by ensuring that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 enough lifeguards are hired in a timely fashion and by ensuring that all pool and maintenance requirement s are addressed prior to the summer swim season so we're not experiencing pools being down. I know things happen, you know, emergencies occur. But really I think proper planning prevents poor performance . And hopefully things can be address ed prior to the swim season for our citizens . Encourage city administration to expediate and make it a top priority to complete the Nay Aug Park master plan so that we can begin the actual work in 2024. That may be a little ambitious but it's not quick enough for me. I'd really like to see that happen. Encourage city administration to continue upgrades at our city parks throughout the city. And I believe that Councilman Smurl address ed many of those things are about to happen in the spring and summer. Work with ECTV to improve the acoustic issues occurring here in City Council Chambers and also in the Governor 's office, if possible . And we're going to work with them to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 see if there is additional funding or whatever we need to do because , you know, all of you deserve to be able to hear what is happening during these meeting s. And I don't sit out there, but from what I understand it's very difficult to hear from back in the audience area. So hopefully we could get that address ed. It's been a while. Push the administration to get the work started and completed on the pocket park as Mr. McAndrew had just indicated located on the corner of Linden Street and Wyoming Avenue. And I will be making a call to Leslie Collins , the CEO of Scranton Tomorrow to see what needs to be done to get that project rolling . Work with city administration to ensure that the walkability study continues to be a priority and ultimately review the recommendation s to determine what makes the most sense for the future of downtown Scranton in terms of that walkability study. Work with the city administration and the Scranton School District to identify non-profits throughout the city and actively seek additional payment s in lieu of taxes, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 pilots to improve both city and school district contributions . Work with the administration to get the Regional Stormwater Authority up and running . Reorganize our shared services committee and reengage with the Scranton School District to focus on delinquent tax properties , assessment appeals , HUP test -- which by the way, I did not know what HUP test meant. I found out. It actually goes back to Hospital Utilization Project versus the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . And it has to do with determining whether certain nonprofit buildings that were originally identified as non-profits continue to serve their intended use that they initially qualified as tax exempt. So they may have been tax exempt 10 years ago but maybe what's happening in there now is not tax exempt. That's the HUP test and I would really like to see a focus on that. Work with the administration and Council solicitor to review and update the Administrative Code and work with the administration to ensure that the new Rental 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Registration Inspection Program is instituted . I think that's very important . You know, Mr. Dobrzyn mentioned something to me at the end of the meeting last week. And I put a call into our former City Council President , now State Rep Kyle Donahue . If you listen to Mr. Dobrzyn typically every week he mentions 38 percent of our city is nontaxable. They're nonprofit s. And we talked about, you know, typically I knew this as the former Superintendent of the Scranton School District , most urban cities, Scranton , Reading , Wilkes-Barre, Harrisburg , all of your urban centers have typically the highest need, okay, the highest needs and services needed. Yet they have the least ability to raise the taxes because most have an eroding tax base and most have the largest percent age of nontaxable properties . So I talked to State Rep Kyle Donahue about whether we could push some legislation that cities like Scranton , York and Harrisburg and Easton and wherever they have an excessive amount of tax exempt properties if there could be some type of state legislation that the state would somehow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 reimburse those cities for the loss tax revenue . I'm sure it would be very complicate d and there would be all kinds of formula s that would have to be applied . But he told me that there was already some initial legislation on the books that's being worked on. So I thank Mr. Dobrzyn for bringing that to the forefront. And I hope to continue to work with Mr. Donahue and other legislators to try to improve our financial situation here in the city. So that's my list. It's not, you know, it's not the end of it. But those are some of highlights , some of the things we'd like to see happen this year. In terms of the propose d zoning ordinance timeline , so last week I mention ed that we're going to reintroduce the zoning ordinance on January 31st. That's still accurate . We want to have a second reading on February 7th. And that evening we would table it until we have a public hearing on March 21st at 5:45 p.m., here in the Council Chambers . Initially I said we were going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 vote on it that night. That's not correct . We'll vote a week later. Now, could these dates change? The only way it would, like, if the Planning Commission had to make some adjustments in their -- could move it back a week or two. But right now we're looking at January 31st, February 7th. It will be tabled. There will be a public hearing March 21st and then the following week there will be a vote on that zoning. Just to address -- I had some notes from last week. Mrs. Hodowanitz , DPW Collective Bargaining Agreement . We submitted to the IT by Council office and received by IT yet await approval to post on the website for the city HR Department . IT and HR will confirm and IT Director to advise when it will be placed on there. That's the DPW Collective Bargaining Agreement . I mention ed the audit earlier . Well, I'm hoping midFebruary that that will be wrapped up. Mrs. Schumacher requested DPW traffic maintenance for replacement of -- and I believe that was Eli as well about the Leslie Drive sign and a permanent metal pole -- the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 best placement for driver visibility at that intersection of -- would be Leslie Drive and 307 which is very dangerous . DPW to advise as the sign department machine is down temporarily . They're aware of it and it's a priority . I just addressed acoustics . As far as the acoustics , the Chamber 's upgrade will be given priority to the back room -- board room unit prior to speakers due to the age of the board and consequences . Time related issues include the RFP process that followed by supply chain availability . Mark Migliori with ECTV advised that suppliers continue to give priority to larger customer s even as supply chain issues lessen. The RFP process followed by securing equipment , vendors may take approximately -- one -- (inaudible ) and a half years. I'm hoping that that's not necessarily the case. But I'm just reading the notes based on the information that we got on that. I will double check to see that -- hopefully that's not the issue. But being involved in construction I do know that lead times for things like windows , for chillers , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 for rooftop AC units and things, they are up to 30 weeks in many cases. So it is a challenge right now. So we received something from a Davis Street resident Jennie Davis and Mark Powell. Apparently do not enter signs removed at the intersection Davis Street and May Street. It was a one way street that border their property . DPW was asked to replace the signage or advise Council why it was removed and the reason they have not been replaced . The speeding on Davis Street, the Scranton Police Chief was notified with a request of increase d patrols and enforcement on Davis Street. Signage and road marking s on Davis Street (inaudible ) PennDOT is to work with DPW regarding additional signage and road markings to increase safety on Davis Street. And they mention a loose manhole cover and deteriorated casing. Pennsylvania American Water company was notified and visited and advised that this repair is on the work list as this would involve a team of traffic control due to high 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 volume traffic at all times on those roads. So those are some followups . It looks like I have a few more here. Received from a Sanderson Avenue resident Jessica Osborne. So Scranton Police Department traffic officer Corporal Rich Iannuzzo is to conduct a site traffic study for permit parking across at the 1300 block of Sanderson Avenue due to the opening of a brewery business of 1400 of Sanderson Avenue. City engineer s Reilly Associates conduct ed a traffic site study related to heavy truck traffic on Sanderson and Albright avenues near the lace project . Keystone Building Block and other business in the area. The city engineer found the following : We determined that any trucks travelling north to North Main Avenue by way of Green Ridge Street must take Albright Avenue and any truck traffic moving east on Green Ridge Street toward Dunmore must use Sanderson Avenue due to the low height of the Green Ridge Street viaduct . The truck traffic cannot be rerouted. However , Scranton Police can monitor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 and issue violation s for any trucks causing reported damages to curbs or signs. Cathy Wechsler , STO provided update on city SSD real estate tax collections . Was that discussed earlier ? Is that in Third Order? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, that was just received yesterday . MR. KING: Okay. So below is the fourth quarter end year information regarding numbers and percentages of tax payments made for the city and the Scranton School District real estate tax. Paid in full 21,855 accounts . That's 85.51 percent , paid at least one installment but did not pay all four payment s, these accounts will be sent to tax claim, 263 accounts which equals 1.02 percent . No payments made, these account s will be sent to tax claim, 3,630 which equals 14.20 percent . Will continue to send these quarter reports in 2003. Since the Mayor's memorandum concern ing the pool and the Nay Aug slide is in Third Order, I'm not going to sit here and read two and a half pages of that memo. I'll spare all of you. There are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 copies here if you don't have the internet . But I think that we covered quite a bit there tonight . So that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – ACCEPTING A DONATION PRESENTED TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON FIRE DEPARTMENT FROM GREGG L. SUNDAY AND JOAN M.

KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? On the question , I will say that I know Greg Sunday very well. I know his wife Jodi. And I knew Stephen Sunday probably from the time he was in elementary school. He was an outstand ing young man. He was a tremendous baseball player. I believe that he was an EMT for a short period of time before he became a Scranton firefighter . They're a wonderful family. And I agree with that recommendation that was made that somehow he should be recognized . This is at least I'm going to say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 minimally $10,000. But it may have even been more than that that's been donated to the fire department in memory of Stephen . And even though he served a short time in that fire department , he made a massive impact in the short period of time that he was there. So I want to thank the Sunday family for their contributions and hopefully we could do something to memorial ize this. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm also in agreement with memorializing Mr. Sunday in some way. I think that it's incredibly generous the donation s that the Sundays have made to the fire department . And it's truly appreciated . That's all. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I also know the Sunday family (inaudible .) MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.
