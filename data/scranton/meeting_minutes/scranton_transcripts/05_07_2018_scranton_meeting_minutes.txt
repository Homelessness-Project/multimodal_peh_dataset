There will be a motion no suspend council rules to move Item 6-B, extending the 10 percent waste disposal discount period, to Seventh Order for final passage this evening . If anyone would like to speak on this particular piece of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 legislation , they may do so during Fourth, citizens ' participation .

Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly . As a follow-up to Councilman Gaughan 's request from a few weeks ago I had also sent a request for an update on the status of the Crowley Park renovation project that was announced in the fall. And also last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 we received a notification that the city issued an RFQ for special labor counsel sometime last week. Councilman Gaughan and myself will be sending a request for a meeting with the Law Department to, you know, hopefully get this delayed awarding this contract because this is something that's coming up in our shared service s committee meetings as a possible shared service between the school district and the city. Also, in light of the fact that garbage bills have not still gone out, I have requested that Mrs. Reed send the Treasurer 's Office a request to provide a memo detailing any and all issues that have prevented the bills from going out in a timely manner so that hopefully next year we could get this issue addressed . And then lastly, I'm not going to dignify the Majority Commissioner Cummings ignorant and, quite frankly , despicable comments at last week's commissioner 's meeting with a lengthy response , but I must say that in light of the opioid epidemic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that is racing throughout our community , it's disgusting that we have an elected official who is so stubbornly ignorant towards actual facts. That's all I have. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comments tonight ? MR. EVANS: I do, and I will dignify the comments that were made last week. I'm going to talk about medical marijuana so, like I say, I just can't help myself. The comments made at last week's or recently at on the of the county commissioner 's meeting should not be ignored . First of all, it's very clear that one of the commissioners has strong negative feelings toward the burgeoning industry of medical marijuana . So let me be perfectly clear, this city council welcomes the industry to the City of Scranton , even if there are unwanted or is unwanted by other elected official s at the county level. We want your dispensaries , we welcome your growing facilities , we welcome your jobs, we welcome your commerce and we welcome your mission . I was somewhat dumbfounded learning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that a county commissioner who railed against the medical marijuana industry did not know that the state legislature passed into law the use of medical marijuana in 2016. For the record, the Republican controlled House voted 149 to 43 in favor. The Republican lead Senate voted 42 to 7 in favor. In the divided political climate that we live in, that's a landslide . On a more personal level I found many of the comments made by the commissioner almost heartbreaking , and while the level of misinformation was certainty evidence it was a lack of compassion in some of the statements I found most disturbing . If I may I'd like to explain my comment a little further . My mother spent 32 years of the 72 years she had on this earth battling various types of cancer. I cannot even count the times she received chemotherapy treatments during those decades . I only wish at the time that she could have had access to medical marijuana because if it gave her one day of relief from the severe nausea and gave her one day of comfort from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 the constant pain it would have been a gift. The study from the Journal of the American Medical Association stated that states that allow medical marijuana , including Pennsylvania , have seen a 6 percent drop in opioid prescriptions . I only wish that the daughter of one of my best friends could have had the opportunity and access to medical marijuana and that somehow she could have been one of those 6 percent and maybe she would be alive today and my friend would still have his daughter and her daughter would still have her mom. As we all know, words have consequences and millions of people who seek relief and comfort through the use of medical marijuana are not stupid, they just want help. That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, just a few. First, I'd agree with Councilman Donahue on asking the treasurer for an estimation on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 why the garbage bills have taken so long to go out. Quite frankly , there are people in this city who budget for this every year and they are waiting for it so, I mean, the city, you know, goes to people and says that they need this money every year and they don't really act like it, so I do think that an explanation is warranted and, you know, we had this legislation on our agenda and it really should have came as backup with the legislation . If we are going to ask for a deadline, we should have an explanation from the administration as to why it's taking so long to get the garbage bills out. Secondly , I just want to read into the record a letter that Councilman Donahue , Councilman Perry and I are going to send out to Mr. Justin Davis, the CEO of Moses Taylor Hospital regarding the recent strike with the nurses. "Dear Mr. Davis, the Council of the City of Scranton strongly supports the nurses at Moses Taylor Hospital who are exercising their right to stand up for a fair union contract and improve working 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 conditions and increase the quality of the patient care in our region. Our constituents and all patients throughout Northeastern Pennsylvania deserve the highest quality of care. That care is compromised when hospitals are understaffed causing nurses to be pulled from unit to unit and forced to work overtime when they are undeniably exhausted . We are grateful to the Moses Taylor nurses who are standing up for patient care and holding Commonwealth Health accountable for putting profits before patients . As the women and men on the front lines, nurses must have a voice in how care is delivered to their patients . For more than a year, the dedicated nurses at Moses Taylor Hospital have been trying to address critical staffing issues that they believe could compromise patient care. In response , Commonwealth Health has let their contract s expire and engage in unfair labor practices . Commonwealth Health has a responsibility to the community we represent and it is time to agree to union contracts that put patient 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 care before profits . We are proud to stand with Moses Taylor nurses." And we will be sending that out once the three of us sign it. Secondly , I'd like to make a motion that Scranton City Council invite Mayor Courtright and his administration along with the Pennsylvania Economy League to a public caucus in council chambers for the purpose of discussing the Act 47 exit plan for the City of Scranton that was adopted by this council in July of 2017. MR. PERRY: There's a motion on the floor, do I have a second? MR. DONAHUE : I'll second that. MR. PERRY: There's a motion and a second. On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I mentioned this last week but I just wanted to put it into motion form, I think this caucus is extremely important for a number of different reasons . Number one, to get an update a year late on any progress that's been made towards several provisions within the exit plan. Work force cost containment , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 debt management policy recommendations , worker's comp funding recommendations , Pension disability , economic development initiatives , storm water management and general exit plan provisions , revenue and financial management . The design of the exit plan is to ensure the termination of the city's distressed status after three years. This exit plan includes revised baseline financial predictions for the city for the period 2017 to 2020, and I think it is important to hear a year later from the mayor and the Pennsylvania Economy League where we stand as we approach that Act 47 exit deadline . I'd also like to make a recommendation to the mayor and his administration to follow what the governor of Pennsylvania has been doing, Tom Wolf, with something called cabinet in your community . This is a new initiative formed by the governor . Oh, we have to vote on the motion, I'm sorry. MR. PERRY: Bill was just getting ahead of himself . Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 question ? I agree with Mr. Gaughan , there is a lot of moving pieces and there's a lot of enemies to leaving Act 47 so I think council getting an updated by the administration is very much warranted . All in favor. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. What I was saying before I got ahead of myself there, Governor Wolf has been doing something called cabinet in your community and this is a new initiative to provide a platform for engagement between cabinet secretaries and local communities throughout Pennsylvania , and my recommendation to the mayor, to his administration is that I think Scranton should do something similar and we could call it cabinet in your neighborhood and I think this has been done years ago maybe under Mayor Connors where you would bring in the DPW director , the OECD director , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 different members of the cabinet to neighborhood meeting s and a give a presentation on what goes on in their departments and most importantly to take questions . I think it would be a great opportunity to increase the civic engagement and give an understand of city operation s within our neighbor hoods. I'll be attending a neighborhood meeting at the end of May in the Hill section , and I can guarantee you that I'll receive a ton of questions about the DPW, about the police department and about other departments in the city and I think it would a good initiative on the part of the mayor to bring his cabinet people out to the neighborhoods so that people get the opportunity , number one, to meet them and to get to know them and to ask them questions and for the cabinet members to let the public know what's going on in the City of Scranton , so I think that is very important . Councilmen Donahue also mentioned something that I think is extremely important and that is that the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Scranton recently issued an RFQ, a request for qualifications for labor counsel for the City of Scranton , and we recently had a meeting with Directors Cognetti and Gilmartin about shared services between the city and the school district so the first area that I think we are going to take a look at is if we can share labor counsel services between the school district and the city. I believe that it would be a way to save real money and be more efficient so we are looking to streamline the city and school district legal structure to benefit the taxpayers of the City of Scranton . Some of the possible benefits that we are looking at include a higher quality , more consist ent and joined up legal service to government , better sharing of expertise and good practice , building greater special ism in crosscutting areas as well as savings and efficiencies through the sharing of common processes and the more flexible and responsive use of legal resource s. So what are going to ask for a meeting with the city administration and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 law department and we will ask them to hold off on issuing an award for that request for qualifications so that we can explore this possibility , as I said, to save money. We also in our meeting with the school directors discussed possibly sharing legal services between the council and the school board with our solicitors and possibly buildin g that out as well in the future to save money and become more efficient , so we are looking at these options and this will be one of the first things that we do I think with our shared services committee , and that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . The only thing that I want to address tonight that some of my councilmen already addressed and it seems like it was a hot topic locally was the issue of medical marijuana . Now, I have seen the benefits of medical marijuana firsthand in my life, and anyone who knows me knows how opposed to opioids and how involved I am with the abuse of opioids watching a love one die due to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the abuse of opioids . This is just -- it makes so much sense to endorse , be a proponent and encourage the use of medical marijuana for the people who need it. The benefits that I have seen firsthand is with my wife, who is a currently a cancer patient , it relieves her anxiety , it relieves some pain, it helps her sleep and it helps her eat which helps her keep her weight on, all of the things that are first and foremost in anybody who is recovering and battling cancer in their life and she is doing fantastic and I can't -- you know, seeing it firsthand it makes so much sense. So, of course, you know, I like many of us up here, if not all of us, are for medical marijuana and definitely the dispensaries , groweries and having them in our city, but I'll do you one better, you know, I'm in favor of actually decriminalizing it the City of Scranton as well. I think it ties up our police officers . I think it ties up our judicial system and our correctional facilities . There is many other cities out there that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 are looking at this and I think it's a waste of time and waste of money to go after these issues, just like prohibition was back in the day. Now, that opens up the door to the use of the recreational in the State of Pennsylvania . You want to talk about an immediate revenue stream let's talk about recreational marijuana . In a state that is in dire need of a revenue stream, you know, why is this not first and foremost in the front in our communities and in our state. We need to get it there in my opinion . You know, it's a hot topic so there is probably going to be as many people out there that disagree with me that agree with me, and that's okay. So let's get the discussion started , let's keep it going and let's benefit from what it has to give. There is lot of research, there's a lot of data out there so let's dig in and let's bring this up to our local governments and our state reps and our state senators and let's see if this is an avenue that we need to take, but to say that medical marijuana isn't a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 benefit and knowing that the opioid addiction and crisis is out there it just very nicely doesn't make too much intelligent sense, and that's all I'm going to say. I'm going to go further and take the road that Mr. Donahue took and I'll just leave it there. That's all I have. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
