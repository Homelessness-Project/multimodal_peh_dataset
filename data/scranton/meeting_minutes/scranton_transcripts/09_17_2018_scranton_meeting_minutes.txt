(The following speakers offered public comment : Norma Jefferies spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , anything ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. DONAHUE : No, I have nothing at this time. MR. PERRY: Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Thank you. First of all, as we discussed last week and earlier tonight , Arcadis , the company that is doing our storm water study, has accepted our invitation to appear at a work session . They will be sending representatives to a session to be held at 4:30 p.m. October 1 in the Governor 's room. We expect the work session will an informative discussion on not only where they are with the study currently , but also the process so far in developing the study, so I would remind everyone that the public and the press, as always, is invited to attend. A brief follow-up comment on the coffee shop lease, while my position is clear as far as city employees leasing city property for a business it simply is not the right thing to do in my opinion . I did want to say something about the idea in general really. I continue to be in favor of a coffee shop going in that building . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Privatization in these instances is actually the right thing to do and Mr. Hinton should be at some level applaud ed for bringing this idea forth. Thinking outside the box is something that has been in short supply within the confines of this building for many, many years and when someone like Mr. Hinton actually shows an entrepreneurial spirit, something that I've chided this government to embrace since I have been on city council that maybe we should recognize that. Also, during the council meeting of July 30 of this year I requested the administration to create a local buying policy for purchasing and procurement s and after discussing this with B.A. Bulzoni I'm comfort able that this is actually in place and working as intended . Also, at that time, I suggested that we need to continue to look at existing policies with an eye toward enhancing and expanding our local small business community . Again, why is this important ? Well, locally owned businesses will always 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 play a central role in a healthy city. They have been and continue to be engines of opportunity by creating jobs and providing pathways to the middle class for many of our residents . So my next suggestion for a policy shift to help the local and small business community and owners is to create a policy or policies that decrease the amount of red tape for small businesses as well as to somehow engage the small business owner the way they should be. This is, of course, another offshoot from our idea session since the last one that was held. In most cities, and Scranton will fit this category , small business owners face complex city regulations , licensing and permit processes and more. The small business owner is left to navigate a government bureaucracy that is certainly not user friendly with no one to help. I would suggest that the city using existing manpower create a role within the government that might be called a small business navigat or, someone that can help the local and small business owner, the new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 entrepreneur , the small developer and others to navigate the city's rules and regulations related specifically to growing small business ownership and encouraging incremental development . This would save the small business owner and the developer time, expense and energy that would be better devoted to growing their business , but the companion policy to this is the reduction in red tape. I challenge the administration to begin this process by fully reviewing the processes and lack of processes in those departments that have effect our small business community the most and streamline those policies , rules and regulations at every opportunity . So in the coming weeks and months I will revisit this request while continuing to offer other ideas for policy changes for the city to review, but to me it's pretty simple we are either business friendly or we are not. Currently , the answer is emphatically we are not. We can change that but first let's see if anyone answers the call. And that's all I have for tonight . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Thanks. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, I just want to congratulate Mary Ann Kitlas who we gave a proclamation to tonight for 50 years of service working for the City of Scranton . It's unbelievable , I think, for anyone to work that amount of time anywhere so I just want to again congratulate her on 50 years and thank her for her dedication to the city. I attended , along with Councilman Donahue , a neighborhood meeting in west Scranton last week and I do have several issues that I'm going to forward over to Mrs. Reed. One of the things that came out of this meeting , and we talked about this in the caucus with Mr. Bulzoni , was that the city definitely needs a more strategic plan to combat blight and other problems throughout the city. As I sat there and listened to residents in west Scranton and in the issues that they had, there needs to be better communication between the city and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 all neighborhood groups throughout Scranton and all residents throughout Scranton . We need to have a clear and solid plan and I think one of the things that we can do is use technology to make our government more efficient . Mrs. Jefferies mentioned reaching out to the young people in the community , I am attending a meeting this Friday with the University of Scranton government affairs group with their students to listen to what they have to say and hopefully build off of that we will be having idea session with not only the University of Scranton students but hopefully all young people throughout the city to listen to their ideas and what they think -- what issues they think are important . We did send letters last week for a caucus on the recent flooding and several questions about the emergency management situation in the city, we did not hear anything back on that yet, and that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 I only have a couple of things to talk about. The one is an update from last week, we received from Mr. Pocius -- there was a speaker who had a question about a sign and incorrect tonnage labeling a bridge over on Elm and Railroad , I believe . There was a discrepancy with the nine ton sign, it didn't jive with the other one. The nine ton sign is actually for Eynon Street so anybody familiar with that section how is kind of veers off and why it's there. That nine ton is for actually the Eynon Street bridge -- or the Eynon Street -- yeah, going up Eynon Street. Audit update, I know Mr. Evans gave a quick update on the audit, but, yeah, as Mr. Bulzoni explained it us on odd number years there is a requirement for retirees to submit medical invoices , and so it was just a fact of collecting all of those invoices , putting them all together and then putting them on the sheet. As I understand it, and as Mr. Bulzoni understands it, there is a draft ready to go it just hasn't been presented to him yet. So he said he is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 going to keep us up-to-date on that and hopefully we have what we need in the very near future. And, finally , I'll talk a little bit about the street signs since it was brought up a couple of times. There is something on legislation , it's a very important step but it's a beginning step of how we are going to tackle our street sign problem in the city. The company that we'll be voting on is it runs a software program , they are going to basically get in their car and map the city street by street, and not just our street signs but also all our traffic signs and look for anything that needs to be, you know, effected , replaced , missing because there is it some streets that don't have any and then once we get that information in then it will be up to us to formulate an attack plan, so we are not at the attack plan yet we are just right now we think we found a company that is willing to do the work for us and it will be voted on here tonight and funding for that is going to be coming from our liquid fuels, but that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 what I have right now. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT AND, IF SUCCESSFUL , A GRANT AGREEMENT , AND ACCEPT THE FUNDS RELATED THERETO THROUGH THE BJA FY 18 EDWARD BYRNE JUSTICE ASSISTANCE GRANT (“JAG”) PROGRAM -LOCAL SOLICITATION IN THE AMOUNT OF $21,053.00. MR. PERRY: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I just want to say this legislation is just another example of our police department going above and beyond to be what I consider one of the most transparent police departments in the state and possibly in the country . A couple of months ago we voted on funding so that the police department could get body cameras . This legislation they are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 going for grant money so that when a officer has to unholster his or her weapon they are going to have cameras actually on their weapons so that it records because according to the legislation in some situation s the recording with the body cameras may be secured when they go to draw a weapon, so I just want to commend Chief Graziano . On my five years on council they have really gone above and beyond to be transparent and to use technology to be extremely efficient . Thank you. MR. EVANS: I would concur with that. I continue to be impressed by Chief Graziano and his staff and how much they go after these grants, especially grants like this that increase transparency and they are not afraid of it. They are not afraid of technology , they embrace it, and we are all better for it. MR. PERRY: Yeah, I agree. JAG funding since I have been here I have seen this come through many times and it's funding that's out there and I know the City of Scranton puts that to good use for things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 that we need that normally we wouldn't be able to have. You know, there wasn't that long ago that not every officer had a taser while on duty and to me that's just a dangerous situation to have for both the officer and the citizens because it leaves to very other limited things to do that's non-lethal when it comes to a push comes to shove situation so that was one of the first steps that we got and every since then there has just been so many other tools that they have been putting in their tool box to help serve the people and this is just one of the latest. So, again, it's fantastic . All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.

Mrs. Jefferies compiled a list herself and did a great job throughout the Hill Section , but we recognized , and I give the administration a lot of credit because they recognize that we needed to do something different . We have now one full-time person and one part-time employee in our sign department where years ago I believe we had multiple people, it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 a full staff. So they have been doing a great job at trying to keep up with all of the different requests that come in for faded street signs and stop signs and other signs throughout the city. So this is a necessary investment on behalf this council and this administration and our DPW to give them better equipment , to make sure that they are efficient and it's an investment in our city. I think of, you know, when I'm looking at this legislation the broken windows theory. When there is one broken window on the block and one house that's blighted that's spreads , criminals start to come into your neighborhood . Same thing could be said, I think, of faded street signs and stop signs that are hanging over or on the ground. People in the neighbor hoods notice that. So that's one thing. The second thing is from a public safety perspective . You know, as Mrs. Jefferies correctly pointed out multiple times here if you are not from the city and you are trying to navigate sometimes it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 very difficult when you can't see a street sign. Even at night it's difficult sometimes . I find myself stopping and almost getting into an accident trying to find out where I'm going. So I think that this legislation and this program is going to correct that. Basically what this company will do is create a state of the art inventory system for the DPW, so they will go around, if anyone has ever seen the vans that Google Earth employees throughout really the country , this company will send a van with GPS enabled cameras . They will go throughout every mile of the city. We have two 263 center line miles of roadway and they will take photographs , real time photographs of every single street sign or lack thereof and stop sign in the City of Scranton and then they will come back, they will create a report that will go to the DPW and we will have an actual inventory . They are going to provide training for our employees , they are going to provide a database for our employees so that in the future when a sign, a street sign or a stop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 sign or any sign for that matter gets replaced there will be a log of that. So this is going to make our DPW much more efficient and it's going to give our employees the tools that they need to do their job and because they do do an absolutely wonderful job with all of the requests that come in. So, as I just mention ed before when we spoke on the legislation about the police department , this is another example of the city using technology to be more efficient . If you look in the backup legislation at all of the cities that this company works with one example is Camden, New Jersey, I think they have roughly 75 or 76,000 people similar to the City of Scranton , this company has a great track record. Mr. Bulzoni , the business administrator , was in our caucus earlier and he gave us a complete rundown of all of the different people that he spoke to about this including PennDOT . So, again, I want to commend my colleagues for their support for this. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 want to commend Mrs. Jefferies and the public for putting up with this issue for quite a long time. I think that this legislation and this company will solve a problem that we have been facing for quite some time in the city. Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question . You know, many times when things fail in government the cause is systemic , and I talked about this many, many times, not necessarily employee related . So what this is going to do is, this traffic management system is going to create and put in place a system that would allow our employees to be successful and allow street signs to be put up in a relatively quick fashion when they are reported and keep that system in place and monitor it and know exactly what's going on. We don't right now. We get a phone call, they write it down on a piece of paper, they probably put it up on a bulletin board but, you know, they are woefully understaffed , as Councilman Gaughan , said. We have basically one and a half employees in charge of all of the signs in the city, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 so we need to do better so the first thing we can do is put a system in place that will allow them to be successful , so I'm very happy to be moving this from Seventh Order to completion and finally get this process started . MR. PERRY: Yeah, on the question , this is really going to take us into, you know, basically even though we are 18 years late into the new millennium as far as how to take care of street signs and really anything in the city of this size. I compare this a lot to the streetlight project we had a couple of years ago where we had a company come in and just give us a nice overhaul . It took us a little bit of investment , but that investment is going to pay off over long-term, I believe this will, too. Once we get this up and running street signs will be get replaced when it's time almost instantaneously because we will know about it, we'll have it tracked and we'll know the date they went in, how long they were there and we'll get a nice flow to this and it really will have the poor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 understaffed people in DPW to handle this.
