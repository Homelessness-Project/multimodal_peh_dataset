CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS DATED MAY 9, 2024 REGARDING RUBICON USAGE UPDATE. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one. We got 3-I, the correspondence with the Rubicon usage update. When I saw our agenda I had a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 question on it. But we did speak a little bit about it in caucus. Frank, can we ask when the optimized routes will begin being used by the city and if they have a timeline on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I do, President Smurl. There is going to be a free community meal which includes hamburgers, cheeseburgers, macaroni salad, cookies . That will be at the Hickory Street United Presbyterian Church located at 435 Hickory Street in Scranton . That will be Saturday -- this Saturday , May 25th, 11:30 until 1 p.m. or until the food runs out it says. Sit down or takeout. Meal is sponsored by Lori and Natalie in memory of Ed and Linda Hartman. And bags of groceries from the food pantry will also be distributed and all are welcome . So that is this Saturday . Also, I had the opportunity to attend the Deutsch Institute fund-raiser held 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 up at the Waldorf Park on Sunday. They're raising funds to finish the roof at Robinson Park which has a leak to it. Once that roof is fixed -- there was a great turnout by the way. So once that roof is complet ed, they're going to finish the inside renovation of Robinson Park. The Deutsch Institute is fixing that up. And they operate inside that building which has been complete ly renovated . It looks fantastic . And also, Robinson Park I know that we passed last week the contract for Chilewski contractors who did Oakmont Park. They've started Robinson Park. And that's going to look absolutely beautiful . We expect that to be done late August, early September , completely renovated , new playground equipment . There is going to be a 900 foot trailer that goes back into the woods paved, a new basketball court. They are planting from what I understand 300 seedlings in the park. It's going to be mulched and flowered. It's going to be really, really nice, new parking on both sides of the street with handicap accessible sidewalk that goes out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 onto -- I guess it would be a landing for handicap to go out onto Mountain Lake. So we're looking forward to that project occurring this summer. That's all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. I'd like to wish all the DPW workers past and present a Happy Public Works Week. Whether it's 2 degrees or 102 degrees , they are on the streets working for us. So I appreciate it and thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : That's all I have. MR. SMURL: One more announcement , City Hall and DPW will be off Monday for Memorial Day. So both recycling and garbage will be one day behind next week. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Watching TV over the last few days, several of the newscasters locally mentioned that Scranton has now had five homicide s this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 year. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm old enough to remember years in Scranton we didn't have any homicide s. And if we had even one in a five year period, it was shocking . You have got to start looking as you approach the budget process . In DOD what we would do is we would do a threat assessment . And the way we would structure the forces and equipment and programs would be based on what the threat required . You've got to take a hard look at is our police department properly staffed , manned, budgeted ? Do they have the right equipment ? Do they have the right training , because five homicides in less than five months, something is wrong here. And if this trend continues , it's not only putting the public at risk, it's putting our police officers at risk. You can't send them out to face a situation like that with just half the assets they need. So please, I know that budgets are very political ly sensitive and people don't want to see taxes go up and yada, yada, yada. But there's a whole lot of things we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 can live out. We can't live without an effective police department or fire department or DPW. We have to have it. So you're going to have to make some hard decision s. And they may not be popular , but you've got to get the situation under control . You need to talk that way to the administration . This is not going away. Okay, you know I'm always looking for the union contracts , police now overdue by 297 days and the firefighters 412 days. Mr. Ufberg got paid in April $39,000 and he well deserves it. It probably isn't on his side. It's basically the way prior administration s have treated the negotiation and union contract process . Now 3-E, that PFM document , that has a lot of important information . And I recommend that every taxpayer download it and read it. Among other things, it talks (audio interruption ) and this is one of the reasons why I insist on these union contracts and the audits. There's a lot of information about why our taxes are so high and how the money is being spent. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 That PFM document talked about high fixed costs from legacy retirement liabilities . This is your debt, your pensions and your retiree healthcare . In 2022, 36.9 percent of expenditures in the operational budget went to those high fixed costs of debt, pensions , and retiree healthcare . And that number is only going to go up, okay. Right now, we don't have the contract s for police and fire available to the public. The nonuniform Clerical Union is in negotiations . So their contract expired in December . And the DPW contract expires at the end of this year. Single taxpayer office, they are in good shape. Now, there's a thing called other post employment benefits , OPEB. Okay, this is your retiree healthcare and insurance for the police, firefighters and clerical . Guess what, that totals 157.2 million dollars in liabilities . And guess what percent of it is funded? Zero. Okay, this is the kinds of pieces of information the public needs to know. The pensions , okay, of 71.2 million dollars in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 liabilities , 43 million or 60 percent is funded. And that is in much better shape. It's better than when we were severely distress ed and down in the teens, okay. And the PFM document talks about, you know, assumption s that the city has 4.5 percent salary growth every year. That's a bit optimistic and 7.25 percent return on rate of investments . When the general community is basically should be around 6 percent . So these documents are important . And I'm not going to stop asking for them. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Kristen Xanthis . MS. XANTHIS : Good evening , Kristen Xanthis . I have three reasons why I'm here. One, I, you know, I understand everybody is very, you know, staffed , very understaffed sometimes and a lot can't get done. I had called now for over two weeks to the DPW about somebody to clean the street or to patch a couple holes. I called today and the gentleman I spoke to asked me what's on the street that needs to be cleaned. Now, I don't know how to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 explain it. The street needs to be cleaned. Second thing is, you know, I don't know if you guys know Dickson Avenue or Green Ridge very well right now. You have two schools . You have two high rises. And you have a nonprofit now that's for children for food. And I understand that is very well needed now. But you have no lights down there. At night once 8:00 hits, there's a lot of problems , you know. I, you know, I think somebody should look into it. The other night I had somebody ringing my doorbell at 2:30 in the morning and screaming outside . So, I mean, I'm not going to go outside but they're outside screaming ringing doorbells . Third thing is, you know, right now with everything that's there right now with the high rises, the schools, the non-profits , I think somebody should look into making it a one way. It's -- I mean, you can't even fit a car in front of somebody 's house because there is too much traffic . I mean, you know, I know, like, you know, you know, sometimes they say maybe if you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 know somebody you could get something done. But I don't really know anybody in the city to get anything done. So I mean, you know, Mr. Voldenberg , you know, I'm sure he's tired of hearing from me. But, you know, he has been a lot of help but, I mean, like, you know, I can't keep calling people and I'm not going to keep calling the police in the middle of the night. So I don't know. I mean, I asked the Mayor at some little mingle thing they had at City Hall the one day about lights or, you know, more police. And I know she says that Green Ridge really doesn't, you know, need police. But, you know, it's not very good down there. I mean, it's dark as anything . And they put the high rise in there with nothing , no security , nothing . I mean, the one day I went there to ask them something . You walk right in the door of the high rise. There's no lock on the door. There's no, like, you know, thing where you ring it you have or get through another part of the building . You just walk right in. So, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 mean, if nobody can help with police down there I mean -- MR. KING: There's no lights at all on Dickson Avenue? MS. XANTHIS : Where the nonprofit building is, there's nothing . It's as dark as can be. Once 8:15 -- you know, give or take 8:15 now because it's summer, but once 8:15 hits it's, like, you know, pitch black. You can't see what's going on out there. You can't even let your dog off the porch to take him out to go to the bathroom because you can't see out there. So, I mean, you know, I'm tired of calling people because nobody helps anyway. So, I mean, at least I have a neighbor down the street. But other than that, you know, there's nobody around there. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you check into the Dickson Avenue as far as the streetlight situation , see if we could get the street cleaner down there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of both, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : There's some construction down in that area. So it is really dusty. MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe the construction is complete . So they could do a cleaning , the city or the contractor . MR. SMURL: Sean Thomas. MR. THOMAS: Good evening, City Council , John Thomas, Scranton . I won't be here too long. I'm here to concur with what Kristen just said about Dickson Avenue. Somebody from City Council who does a traffic study has got to go down there for themselves and see what's going on with the situation . The top of Electric Street, the 1700 block you go down the hill and you come to the end by the stop sign, just take a walk down there with the traffic study man or person, whoever does it and you'll see the situation . That definitely should be a one-way street. And please, somebody look into it. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I'm sorry, I thought 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 you'd be here for a little bit, Council . Let's see, first off, I see Mr. Casey woke up again just in time for election , bless his heart. Secondly, are there any intelligent beings left out there who could convince me a couple hundred American s storming the White House are worse and belong in jails more than millions of inventory imbeciles allowed -- being allowed people just to totally destroy America by heaps and bounds. If so, you are just too stupid to realize this racist trash supported by the garbage leftist are your future for you and your families . Next, Scranton Housing Authority is advertising apartments , two bedroom , two bedroom up to eight family members . This is -- this is what destroys your neighborhoods , an overabundance of people in two bedrooms . Let's just say there's four or five kids. This is wrong. Besides that, their finances are way up there, 50,000, 65,000 a year. If you make that much money, you ought to be able to rent something somewhere . There ought to be for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Scranton Housing to rent, there ought to be a five year residency for people that lived in Scranton that need something , not some outsider s that Biden has stuck in here real quick. There ought to be an enforcement of all these apartments with occupancy permits , I guess, who's allowed . All of this illegal houses, I got a dozen of them on North Main where I walk the dog out in the back. Dozens of peoples in a couple of these houses, especially the 2400 block. There should be some strict enforcement how many people could live in an illegal boarding house. They park cars on both sides of the street. The sidewalks are useless to pedestrian s and children . Nobody cares. I've said this a dozen times, nothing 's ever done about it about illegal boarding houses up and down the street. Renters , renters destroy everything . They don't have nothing to lose and they don't care because I got them next door to me. And section eight is even worse. I got an abandoned house down the street that was so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 tore up. It's been abandon ed for a year. The house next to it is abandoned . Across the street, they are trying to fix up a house doing all kinds of work on it and the roof is almost falling in, you know, I don't understand why they started . Years ago Gerard Cross said our worth of this city is declining. That's because of nobody cares about the neighborhoods and enforcing codes that are on the books. And real quick, let me say something about these fools. My son and I were in Ferguson , Missouri at the Buick dealer when those riots were going on. And we were at a restaurant sitting at the counter . And the kid next to my son asked about the arch and they started talking . He told my son he's getting $15 a day to come riot, room and board and transportation . My son said, how do you know who's on your side and who's not? He said they got bracelets , plastic bracelets like orange would be a general and green would be a sergeant and so forth. These planned riots have been going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 on that long. America is just being lost. It's just being lost right under our noses. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Roger Leonard . MR. LEONARD : Good evening , Council . My name is Roger Leonard . I'm a 23 year employee of the Scranton Public Works. I'm President of IAMAW Local 2305. I want to say thank you to Councilman McAndrew on behalf of all DPW workers for recognizing National Public Works Week. It's something that kind of goes unsaid. I know the administration didn't say nothing about it, so I want to thank you on behalf of everyone of our guys. MR. MCANDREW : You're welcome . MR. LEONARD : I'm here tonight to inform the residents of Scranton that we did not have the two open blight positions filled. This may be obvious to the residents by the amount of blighted properties that are being neglect ed in our city. It is my hope that the administration will post these bids immediately 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 to stop wasting time, time that can be used working to make our city a cleaner and safer place to live. This week is National Public Works Week, a week to recognize all the hard work it takes to keep our city's infrastructure going. Unfortunately , the administration failed to acknowledge this week leaving DPW union workers to feel they do not respect or appreciate all the hard work they do every day for the cities and its residents while being understaffed and underpaid . I'm hoping this oversight and delaying of the blight bids is not done in retaliation to union officials perform ing their duties. To put it mildly, that type of behavior would be unproductive for the city and its residents . I'm hoping that this is not the case and these bids will be filled within the week allowing the DPW to begin this much needed work for our city. I'm again asking the Council to investigate this matter further to find the reason for the delay. I do want to respond . I know we had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 somebody come up here and mention something about cleaning of the street. I want to tell Council and the administration going back at the end of the Doherty administration we lost a lot of our positions . We used to have two sweeper s and a chauffeur that went out every day. We had more operators , chauffeurs . We lost of ton of positions through attrition and we've never actually recovered those position s. So on a daily basis there's tons of jobs to do everyday . So we'll have five, six, seven different jobs. You know, we'll have the storm basins going out. We have tree crews going out. We do try to put out potholes . They do put them out. We just don't have the guys for the administration and the management to actually put out the amount of pothole crews that need to be out there. We're hoping maybe, you know, this administration will add some positions and we could start doing some more work. I hate to see any of the work being subcontracted out to anybody because that doesn't help the city.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Obviously our guys working on overtime is way less than any kind of for profit company could do the work for. I mean, you see the issue that we have when they sold the Sewer Authority and now we're dealing with the rates they just keep raising and raising and raising . It's never a positive for the resident s ever when anything is subcontracted out. What I'm hoping is I said it before, the overtime for us because we were short-staffed we were doing overtime . It's not overtime for nothing . We'd actually be going out and being able to complete this work on overtime for way less than a subcontract or could do it. Now, it's either put the overtime out, add more people to the DPW to fix these problems , not subcontract or any of this other stuff that's going on. I'm hoping that the administration hears us. I'm hoping these positions are filled. We have to get this work done. We're all kind of sick of seeing the blighted properties . I'm hoping it's just an oversight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 and it isn't what I think it is. And maybe we could get this thing done. I'm also asking Council if you could like I said investigate this matter, see what they said, see what the response is and I'll be back next week. Thank you for your time. MR. MCANDREW : Well, I do have a response . I clarified my inquiry last week as to the rationale for placing them two positions , the blight positions and the clerical union versus DPW's union. The prior week we just got, well, we're just doing it for the most part. So I asked for clarification . So the response I got back this week is, the city placed the two position s in clerical in accordance with Council 's guidance that these conversations never -- well, I was never part of them. So I didn't provide any guidance either way -- and based on the city's own analysis . Please note again, this is part of the ongoing negotiations . MR. LEONARD : So it was Council 's asking for those positions to be moved. MR. MCANDREW : No, no, no. Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 request ed them to put in the budget and everybody agreed to that. What I'm reading and my interpretation is when I asked about the rational e for placing these positions in Clerical union versus the DPW union. The response I got last week was vague. So I asked for clarification . So what -- the clarification I received and in front of me the city is stating that the city placed two positions in clerical in accordance with Council 's guidance . So what they are pretty much saying we told them to put them in Clerical Union and we didn't -- at least I didn't. I was unaware of any of this. They're saying it's based on their own analysis , which I don't know what their analysis is versus what versus why. I wasn't provided analysis or included in that decision they said that took place. I'm just updating you. MR. LEONARD : I appreciate it. Yeah, that doesn't make any sense. MR. MCANDREW : I inquired and, you know, I always read out what's present ed to me. MR. LEONARD : I appreciate it. If 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 any other Council members might know about that? MR. SCHUSTER : And this also comes from an e-mail from 3:58 today. MR. MCANDREW : I received the answer to this -- MR. LEONARD : Just before this? MR. MCANDREW : 4:00 as usual right before the meeting . MR. LEONARD : All right. I'll inquire myself and maybe come back next week and have an answer for what's going on with that. I appreciate that. Thank you, Council . MR. SMURL: Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council , Doris Koloski , Scranton resident . All right. Well, I wasn't even going to bring this up at all tonight because the definition of insanity is asking about the same thing over and over again and expecting a different answer. But I was -- somebody had said about that curb cut on Olive Street that because it's ARPA money or something they couldn't do it. But this is something that the city did many years ago preCovid was cut down all those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 corners and they forgot to cut that one down. So that should just be their responsibility . And that's the last time I'm ever going to mention this again. All I'm doing here tonight is I have some announcements to make. There's a blood drive going on for Moms Demand Action of Lackawanna County. It's been going since May 1st. The last day is May 31st. So you could still go to schedule an appointment to give blood. You could call 1-800 be a donor or give a pint.org. It's in 400 PA 315 Suite E, Pittston , Pennsylvania . And we would appreciate if you do go that you could mention the code 8846. And you could also call to schedule an appointment which is 800-223-6667, extension two. Blood donation is very important even though this is like a gun safety thing for the month. But it's always very important . I was a recipient of tons and tons of blood and platelets so I know how important it is. Okay, the next announcement is on Saturday , June 8th at 9 a.m., will be the Stride For Pride with Queer with NEPA. We partner ed with them and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Action Together . There will be a race, 5-K run slash walk. And it will be the Olive Street entrance of the Heritage Trail. And the first -- you are guarantee d a shirt if you register by -- never mind. That says May 17th. We're passed that. Okay, also the same day June 8th at 1 p.m. at the same area, the Lackawanna Heritage Trail on Olive Street entrance , we're going to have cleanup that follows . This is for the Wear Orange month. This is Wear Orange Month. That was the little girl's favorite color that was killed in one of the mass school shooting s. And we celebrate the survivors for Wear Orange Month. And we're going to try to have a cleanup at Heritage Trail starting at 1 p.m. And it's partner ed with other things like Action Together and NEPA Queer. Okay, this one came off of Facebook . And I don't know how many -- I'm sure you're all aware of the NEPA Youth Shelter . And the NEPA Youth Shelter which is extremely important to this city should be very important , especially in the wake of all this gang violence and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 everything . They are a very important place and they need to find a new location for their center by September 1st, 2024. It's key that their location has to be somewhere near Scranton High School or between Scranton High School and West Scranton High School. They would like to have between 8,000 and 10,000 square feet of space. They are happy to paint and fix things up. And they are looking for hopefully for negotiable rent. If you have something or you want something , you may call -- this is probably Maureen 's number. I'm not sure but 570-892-1414. And I just want to say this youth shelter it's something that we really, really need to keep up with the city and it's basically volunteers . And if there is anyone up here at the Council knows anybody that may be has a house or a building or are if there is something in the city that's not being used or was repossessed or something like that that maybe they could get. It's just so important to reach out and see if we could help them any way we can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 and to spread the word about this. Okay, thank you. MR. SMURL: Doris, there is two intersection s by your house that you were concerned about. There was a project going on on Cedar Avenue. So I inquired if we could add those in, have the engineer go up and look at your two. But we can't do that because that section down there is funded through ARPA money and other money. And it doesn't meet the requirements unfortunately up where you live. It's a different -- MS. KOLOSKI : I got that. MR. SMURL: But what we did was took those two intersection s and moved them to a different funding source. So they are going to do them through a different funding source. I just tried to push it through with the Cedar Avenue one because I thought it would move it faster but we can't because of the rules. MS. KOLOSKI : Well, I'm pretty sure that Norma said that the one on Gibson Street somebody cut down. That one was easier to get around anyway because of the grass up on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 hill that you could just roll over. But the Olive Street one I know as of yesterday when I walked, that wasn't -- MR. SMURL: So they are on the list. They are on a different list though. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. MS. KOLOSKI : Like I said, I'm not going to mention it again anyway. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I want to talk about is crime. Somebody brought up the five murders that were committed in the city recently . And I think it's time to understand that the very fabric of Scranton has changed for the worse over an extended period of time. We've had failed leadership across the spectrum. And most people really don't want to hear that because they don't want to hear the truth. And sooner or later you have to realize in a free society all these people talk -- say they won't talk about sex, politic s, or religion . And if you can't talk about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 fundamental things in this country that mean something , then I don't know what talking about sports and other silliness is going to do for us. But I'm sure it hasn't worked out very well. But the Democrats have run this country since World War II almost exclusive ly. And the damage that's been done to our country has been done by Democrats in general . And I just think people fail to do research and find out where the real problems are. 70 percent of black children grow up in homes without a father and Caucasians are catching up. These are all designed by government . Government's empowered all of these changes and it's been a detriment to our society . And the drugs that are filtering through our country and allowing people to cross our border in numbers is a real problem as Europe is finding out because they let a lot of immigrant s come into their country . And just recently the police were fighting with a gang in one of their major cities where the gang was using rocket propelled grenade s and automatic weapons . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 they don't share the values of the people that invited them in their country . And Europe is under a lot of pressure in a lot of different places following the direction s of NATO. And we're in big trouble in this country . And but what I came here to talk about is Licensing and Inspections because today I receive d a letter from the District Justice Farrell where, you know, pursuant to Rule 457, she allowed the city to withdraw their tickets to me. And this is far from over. This is just the beginning of the beginning . But the Council claims it's lawmakers. And I find that to be almost laughable because are your quality of life tickets legal? Do they meet Constitutional muster? I'm going to ask that question when I get to Federal Court. But the question I have for this Council is, why don't your inspector s timestamp their tickets and date them when they give them to somebody because how do you know when they were given? And other question since you're lawmakers, why doesn't the resident receive a picture of the alleged offense ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Now, I've gone through three district justices . I don't know if I could remove the two that are still sitting by going to the Judicial Discipline Board. But I guess we'll figure that out as we go. But I think that it's extremely corrupt just like I think that you're extremely corrupt because you passed this law. The only thing is you ran into somebody that is willing to go file something . And I'm just starting . And I don't think you have enough lawyers to really carry the burden that's coming. I'm only a truck driver. I don't expect to win. But I don't think your lawyers and your legal teams are going to want to be there. I just receive d a letter from the Federal Court that asked the county why they didn't respond and that they were going to issue a verdict in default if they didn't respond . And now I've got the city's legal team asking me to withdraw that if I would be interest ed in consider ing a withdrawal . And we haven't even started yet. But you know what I find troubling is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 people in the city have been serfs. They're not Americans , okay. They're not. They beg and whine. And they've asked their government to represent them. And you've failed. And it's over an extended period of time. You almost feel entitle d to it. You run around like the tooth fairy handing out grant money as you destroy the city. You pretend that we can't pick up garbage . The sewer deal was just atrocious . The water rates and the sewer bill come back to the Council . Okay, the Scranton Sewer Authority being used as an employment agency for politician s and politics has destroyed this city. There's a lot going on that I've learned here in almost 40 years. I mean, maybe, Mr. Smurl, you could explain to us a couple things in your minutes at the end of the meeting on how you've done all of these crazy things and why these tickets aren't time-stamped , why they aren't dated, okay? MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. MORGAN: I mean, all of these things, maybe answer a couple of questions . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 The suit looks nice, but we'd like to see some thinking . MR. SMURL: I'll give it my best shot. Thank you. That's all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MS. CROCKET : Hello. My name is Tadaya Crocket . And I've lived in Scranton since 2017. And this is my first time at a Council meeting . I am a full-time bicyclist . I don't own a car. And I bike seven days a week, 12 months a year. And I'm just here to say that Scranton is terrible , horrible place to be a full-time bicyclist . But I love bike riding and it's a way of life. So I do it regardless . I met with somebody named Joe Heton{phonetic }, like, several months ago. And he showed me that there was a plan to improve walkability and bike riding in Scranton . But I don't know what the status of that plan is. And I want to say I read the plan. And it was a great plan. And I only hope that something could be done to get some protected bike lanes in Scranton and improve the walkability and the bike riding in Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 because not everybody owns a car or even wants to own a car. And we have nothing but these giant SUVs and Ram pickup trucks. And I've almost been killed a half of dozen times. But I'm a pretty smart bicyclist . When you do it all the time you learn a lot of tricks. I ride to work. I ride to the grocery store and so forth. So does anybody know, like, what the status of that plan is and is anything being done with that? MR. SMURL: The plan that -- MS. CROCKET : It seemed to be like a study that was done. MR. KING: The walkability study I believe she's referring to. We recently got an update at Lackawanna College . And I believe that they are continuing . It's in process . It's not dead. And I believe the engineers are doing further studies to just -- I think that it's going to be phased truly. I don't think it's all going to happen at once. So the engineers are just looking at some of the viability of doing some of these things. Some of it involve s switching 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 streets to one ways, possibly replacing streetlights with stop signs, adjusting some parking . So -- MS. CROCKET : This would be great even if there was one north/south and one east/west protected , like, bike lanes in Scranton because if you have the protected bike lanes, more people will ride bikes and there would be less cars. And the only other thing I want to say is there's so much broken glass all throughout Scranton that several times I have had who I know has a car and have got, you know, a broom and dust pan and so forth and going out and cleaned up as much as I can. But it's just like everywhere . And that makes bike riding really difficult because in Scranton basically all you really have is the gutter because there are no bike lanes. So you have the gutter to ride in. There's parked cars, broken glass. So it just makes it difficult . Anyway, I just came here to speak out for the bicyclist . MR. SCHUSTER : Miss Crocket , I just have one question . Where do you predominantly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 bike ride? MS. CROCKET : Well, I live on Clay Avenue and I work at Marywood. So I go back and forth to work from -- I live in Clay Commons Apartments . And I go from there to Marywood University for work. And I go to Riccardo s and Giant Food for groceries . And I come downtown a lot, come down Olive Street. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I asked that because a lot of the bike lanes in the walkability study are downtown. I know Wyoming Avenue may be the first ones if they get put in. MS. CROCKET : There's no like bike lanes in Scranton now. There's only -- there's the Heritage Trail which is nice but that doesn't get you around throughout here. And there is plenty of places where there could be. I know it costs money. But if there was good bike lanes, there's hundreds of podcasts about bike riding in cities. There's places, like, at the top Amsterdam and unfortunately at the bottom, like, Scranton . So if we could just be lifted up a little bit it would be nice. And we do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 have a really good bike store, bike repair shop in Cedar Bicycle . I don't work there or even know the people there. But that's one of the big things we have. So anyway -- MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , citizen of Scranton and taxpayer . Just a few things, number one, what is going on with Serrenti ? I thought it was going to be sold? When will we see that? MR. SMURL: The Serrenti Center is not up for sale. MS. SCHUMACHER : So what are we going to do with it then? MR. SMURL: It's being used for storage for police equipment . There's offices in there. And it's being used for training of police. MS. SCHUMACHER : What happened to the promise that was made to us when we approved buying that they said we were going to get revenue ? MR. SMURL: Yeah, I don't know that. MS. SCHUMACHER : So just no revenue just -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. SMURL: Not that I know of. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Another one, Meadow Brook, how many rights of way are left? MR. SMURL: Are left, I'm not sure. We could find out, Mr. Voldenberg , check again? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll check with Attorney Hughes tomorrow . MS. SCHUMACHER : And is that going to start this year? MR. SMURL: I hope so. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Here we go. MR. KING: I believe Attorney Boyd Hughes is working on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Is there set appointments when Reilly or some other engineers go down and look at that tilting wall? I just -- recently I left the cemetery in Dunmore and I had a little bit of free time. So I went down there and looked at it. It looks as though it's continuing to go into the neighbor 's properties . MR. SCHUSTER : This was something I was going to bring up in Fifth Order. But Mrs. Schumacher is referring to the wall on Ryerson Avenue. Frank, can we check in to see if -- I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 know Meadow Brook we're going to get the stormwater project done for Meadow Brook. But are they thinking about replacing the wall if we could ask that question . MR. VOLDENBERG : It is part of the project but I'll confirm further . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, the problem is they want to get started before that collapses . That's my -- MR. VOLDENBERG : Correct . I'll check. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Okay. The calendars , I had to look at one this week to see what I had put out. And it just sort of bugs me as to why we went to six month calendars instead of the whole year. It doesn't seem very budget wise -- MR. SMURL: The reason I was told they had the first six months went out, we were told the Recycling Center, we weren't allowed to put paper and cardboard together so it had to be separated . And we were told other municipalities and boroughs were allowed to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 that. So we were waiting for the response from the Recycling Center and we got the response . You can't mix anything anymore. It all has to be separate . So the new cards are going to come back out and be the same way. MR. SCHUSTER : They were looking for cost savings . I think they were negotiating cost savings . And they thought in the second six months of the year they would see those cost savings I guess from what Mr. Smurl is saying was they didn't get any cost savings . So the new calendars will be coming out for the next six months. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then will they be for the whole year? MR. SCHUSTER : I would imagine . That would be the smart thing to do -- MS. SCHUMACHER : You guys have to vote for it. So I think you could tell that. And then the pocket park downtown at Linden and Wyoming , I mean, it's lovely; but there is no place to sit. MR. SMURL: Yeah, I believe they did pick the benches out. We discussed this, Mr. Voldenberg , two weeks ago that the city is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 ordering the benches and other items, garbage cans and different things for down there. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , all the amenities . MS. SCHUMACHER : They are ordering them or they're already in that little hut that's back there in the corner? MR. SMURL: No, there will be a lot more benches and more garbage cans and a bunch of other things that they've ordered already . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Since I can't read my handwriting , I'll quit. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : May I approach with a handout? MR. SMURL: Sure. MR. ARGENTA : Thank you. Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Happy National Public Works Week. Thank you to the Scranton DPW for all your hard work and for all you do for our city. It's greatly appreciate d. Do we have any reports or updates on Mulfehan and the gang study? They have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 working on it for the last two years. Maybe we could receive a discount or a rebate. The last several murders in the city have not been committed by any military veterans . They have been committ ed by street gangs. On Friday, May 17th -- and this is what this handout is all about -- 2024, at 10:30, the City of Scranton held an unhoused task force meeting at City Hall Council Chambers . Was this meeting advertise d to the public? And will there be any minutes made available for the public review? Who steers or is the lead person for this task force meeting ? Will the public be notified of the next meeting , date, time, and location ? And will there be any public participation or public comment permitted during any of these meetings? Can the city also provide resumes and experiences for all the board members on the task force to show how they tie in with unhoused individuals ? Can the city provide a mission statement and what the goal is and what they're looking to accomplish ? Well, we attended this meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Friday and were surprised to see that there was no representation from local Congress man, United States Senate, Pennsylvania Senate, State Reps, Lackawanna County or Scranton School Board officials . Shockingly , no one who is experiencing homeless ness or anyone that has benefit ted in a positive way by any of these nonprofit agencies are on this board. But there were people who represent the many local nonprofit s that make up the board. Can you inquire as Council if there is any data available to how the issue has been address ed and the breakdown of all funding to these agencies on this task force and what and how they spend the funds and how do they try to correct the issues of homelessness ? A city with 70,000 people and that's not including the county and this is what we have available . The beds, I had given you a breakdown of the beds. Women Resource Center should be safe housing for women, 40 beds are available . There's 70,000 people in the City of Scranton not counting the county and there's four beds available to women. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 We all know the problem s with domestic violence nowadays . Community Intervention Center, the CIC safe haven apartments , there is only four beds available . I have a voting list from there. There's 95 people on it. Catholic Social Services , St. Anthony 's shelter , 26 beds available . There's a Bishop's Appeal in the church quite regularly . Women's Resource Center TH Program , one bed available for women. 70,000 people are in the City of Scranton , not including the county. That's pitiful and sickening . St. Joseph's Mother and Infant Program , we all know there's children having children nowadays . Ten beds are available . So this is just an idea of the shortages of beds. And that's not mentioning any of the shelter or no shelter for homeless families . It's about time we start questioning why we have these shortage issues with housing . And where is all of this funding going? We have more than we should probably have in nonprofit s that work under the guise of helping the homeless and unhoused . It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 time we start checking into that. West Scranton skate park located at Jackson and Bromley , is there a log, is there anything that could be provided regarding the last time it was visited or inspected ? The building 's light have been on the outside of this building 24/7 for several , several , several months along with the rotted dangerously unsafe skate park equipment littering the area. Is there any chance of a neighborhood group getting a tour of that building so we could look at the condition of that building ? Regarding the National Testing Network for Scranton Police Officers , NTN, has anyone seen the number of negative reviews? And are you aware that it's not a national accredited testing site for the police? Can anyone explain why a 65 is passing for the testing site but Scranton requires a 70 to pass? Were there more or less applications since the test changed ? Has any of the officer s who advise the Chief or the Chief himself in the changing of this test, had they taken this test? And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 I'm asking publicly would they agree to take the test and have their results made public? Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Sorry, for the speed reading but I'm trying to get it all in in five minutes . MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , speaking of that skate park, some of the condition s of the equipment over there seems very bad. Can we reach out and see if there is any kind of cleanup planned by the Parks Department possibly or if that equipment could be removed from there? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll ask. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Good evening , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I was going to speak but some of my first comment s was going to be of asking about Smurl about who was on the city's -- Mr. Smurl after two months about who was on the city homeless committee and you said you were going to get back with that because you were going to ask someone in the administration . And have you gotten any luck 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 with knowing who is there so you could report it? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do have that list. Do I have that? MR. VOLDENBERG : We have a list I could provide Mr. Coyne with the listing. MR. COYNE: Thank you. And it might be nice to actually have it in next week's session so anyone can actually take a look and understand who is part of this homeless commission rather than just giving me a list. MR. VOLDENBERG : You'll have it tomorrow morning , Tom. MR. COYNE: Thank you. Second, I understand there's a review in process for material s that were deposited outside . I'm not going to go into that and as it will follow whatever course it will. I brought forth the Iron Mountain shred to this body -- Iron Mountain and the shred containers and in looking into them. But for some reason we seem to be wanting to cling to inhouse shredding and transporting of unsecured -- in an unsecured manner by unauthorized staff or those who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 should not be authorized at the liability of everyone involved . I do understand the policy needs to go in place identifying what is recycle , what is private but not sensitive and what is mandated as shred as sensitive . I also think there are outstand ing issues why documents were in the shred that violate the three year retention policy. That's not a cleaning person mistake or leaving a box out somewhere , torn in half papers. It's intentional . But the point of violating the city's three-year retention policy for documents seems to be missed and ignored . Since it was something too burdensome to look in, I decided to take the step for the city itself. Iron Mountain provides , standard , a one month pickup. They supply contain ers. Most cost efficient is a recurring paper shredding , a 65 gallon wheeled container . This contain er, four of them would cost $165 a month or $1,980 a year. The containers are locked. And someone who is authorized gets a key in case 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 something that gets put in them actually needs to be retrieve d that was put in there by mistake . The cost for the city of Chester for the personal file leaks of this type actually helped put the city into receiver ship. To fix it, Iron Mountain ensures with proper training here it does not happen again. For $2,000 a year it is insured . The city has zero liability , gets you a certificate of destruction , how is this even a choice for anyone here to even think about? We understand security issues like leaving a master key in the drawer of an unlocked office allowing an intruder in this building full access to everything . Back in late 2018 I believe I warned the city of issues of a computer infrastructure . A woefully understaff and undertrained IT Department and the risk of cyber attacks including Ransomware. After a number of months of saying we're looking into it and it's a security matter so we can't discuss it, the city was attacked . The cost of that was absorbed by the insurance initially . But the cyber insurance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 of the city in the following contract increased by $174,000 a year continuing . We have to pay that because for some reason our local government is reactive and not proactive . We need to be proactive on this and to not even -- and to even consider not getting this at least for the temporary part to put shredding bins in place for $200 a month that removes the city from all liability is insanity to consider anything else. Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , tax paid. Okay, you know, a week or so ago we got an announcement that they are only getting half of their exorbitant raise for water and services and sewer. Here's an interesting article . It's more like a get ready, a great game changer. We're hearing all about how we need to beef up our grid and make way for electric cars and if somebody wants to move 50 miles out into the damn country , guess what, the average ratepayer pays for the lines and infrastructure built to accommodate them out there. Isn't that fine and dandy. You know, we already have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Chamber of Commerce constant ly building where they could get a tax break. And they build a building and it's up for 11 years and the tax break's over in ten, the company moves out and tears it down. And you wonder why we don't have affordable housing ? You know, I'm starting to get real estate people sending me letters they would like to buy my house as an investment . Well, you could have it after I'm gone, otherwise don't bother coming on my porch. I'll throw you right off. And there's a big hill there. So they might hurt themselves on the way down. Okay, Beverly last week -- Beverly DeBarros request ed a little help with her prison things. And, you know, like I learned this from Mr. King, 3 cents a minute to study a tablet, to read a tablet in the county jail. You know, a lot of those people are in there for a good reason and some of them aren't. We sent a man a few years ago for $2,500 he owed his ex on child support . And that was wonderful but it cost us almost 25,000 because he had to work for the Recycling Center for six months which has been suspended . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 then it took him another six months. I mean, why don't we just give the lady the money and put a lien against the person? I mean, let's save the $25,000 or at least 20. And then, you know, you're throwing an average jerk in with even possible serious criminals . There is probably five people in there for homicide right now. Okay, so try and get him a letter if you could find it within your help. Last week I heard Covid mentioned and that it was kind of pooh-poohed, you know. Well, guess what, there is a million and half people dead from it at least. People weren't even being autopsied or tested from it if they were found dead, just ship them off, another one for the slab. And personally I think that's a big bash to your humanity when you find a million and half people died. And that's just in this country , a million and a half people died from it. I have unique problem s so that's why I have a mask. I explain ed that before. And once again on our 501C3s, we have the Moms For Liberty , a 501C3. Now they are in Philadelphia so it's an issue here. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 down in Florida they emptied out the libraries of books like 1984 George Orwell and such. And we have three educators up here. I don't know if you are an educator . But I don't envision you getting a lady to lift the 3 pound weight. So possibly you're a corporate educator . But anyway, you know, some liberty. You can't even read what you want. You can't grow up the way you should. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , City Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . First, I want to apologize to everybody here for my actions last week as I left the podium. I struck it harder than I expected out of sheer frustration . You know, there's a lot to talk about. There's a lot of frustration going around. But the biggest thing on my mind this evening is my son. Four years ago today he passed away. He was my only child. He was a Marine, an active Marine station ed in San Diego, part of the mass 111 unit. He was responsible for any type of computer equipment , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 for anything that flew. He was a very smart kid. I would have been proud of him for any type that he -- anything that he would have accomplished in life. And believe me I am. But to become a Marine is something very special to a father. Back in October of 2019 when he was station ed at Miramar Air Base in San Diego he was starting to lose his hearing . An EMT at Miramar spoke with him about a procedure where they drill into the back of your ear. It's called a honeycomb . It's about a 45 minute procedure to relieve some of the pressure behind his ear. Attempt ing to do so, they drilled in too far, ruptured his eardrum , four and a half hours later postop, he had a piece of titanium in his ear holding up his eardrum to stabilize it so he could hear. Since then he was having a lot of pain, excruciating pain. While experiencing a problem of my own, I compressed my L1 vertebrae in my back, broke it into 17 pieces. And I was in a lot of pain. So I'm to about 400 pounds because I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 couldn't move. So my conversations with my son were several hours talking to him about his pain. And in April of 2020, he had a stroke, was found unresponsive one Saturday morning . He was late for his unit duties and they found him. They revived him. He was in the ICU. He could have called anybody and he chose to call me. He said, Dad, can you make it out? I said, I'll crawl out there if I have to. During Covid, my first flight was to DC, part of that flight was our Congress man Matt Cartwright and spoken to Matt extensively about issues, you know, that was -- my son was going through . He's proud of our veterans and people who serve as we all should be. So my last conversation with my son extensively was over a meal at Chick-fil-A. You know, we talked for a couple hours. And they were going to send him home through Wounded Warrior Program . One thing they also did was they took him off of his medication . And I had several conversations with him about listening to your doctors . You know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 you only look at yourself in the mirror. Doctors look at several people who look in the mirror, take your medicine as prescribed . At the end of the day he was in so much pain, he trusted a fellow Marine who introduced him to a civilian . Day after his 26th birthday , four years ago today he passed away. And not a day goes by where I don't miss him. April of 2021 -- yeah, April 21st of 2021, NCIS found this guy. On day 90 I found out it was from a fentanyl overdose. He impacted two other people. They were in the hospital two weeks before that. And he stopped dealing four days after my son's passing . This guy remains in jail. I'm going to find out Friday what his sentence is going to be. It's been a long drawn out process . And it hurts me deeply to know that other people experienced the same thing. I just hope that people could make better choices and do things better on a daily basis because this is not the Scranton that he wanted to come home to. This is not the city that he wanted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 to call home. And I just pray for the Scranton Police Department and our first responders who go out to these calls on a daily basis because I know the impact firsthand. And I just pray that we don't have any major crimes so we could take the drugs and the guns off of our streets. And if you give me one more second, Mr. Smurl, one thing I got out of the meeting with Chief Carroll a couple weeks ago when he met with us and we started a West Side Crime Watch was this Ring system. This Ring system is -- helped in so many crimes. If you don't want to be part of a neighborhood watch, at least get a Ring system. You could write it off. And you could actually help solve some of these crimes because, you know, it's getting out of control . And we need to take our city back. And again, to each one of you from one parent to another , God bless our City of Scranton . God bless City Council . Thank you, Scranton Police Department . Good evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Mancini . Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I have a few comments . I forgot to mention during third order, tomorrow in celebration of EMS week sponsor ed by Pennsylvania Ambulance and Transmit Ambulance , they're going to have a Kids Day at McDade Park. That's Wednesday , May 22nd, 4 to 7 p.m. at McDade Park. So maybe I think they're going to have some ambulance equipment up there and some EMS equipment . It might be nice to bring the kids up there tomorrow evening -- or from 4 to 7. This afternoon I had the opportunity to attend a press conference where we distributed $240,000 or at least celebrated $240,000 of ARPA funds that were distribute d to local businesses to raise employee wages for the next two years through grant funding . Those business es that benefit from this program included one 119 Productions better known as Center City Print located on Penn Avenue. They received $50,000; Buona 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Pizza on Lackawanna Avenue received 30,477; Endeavor Auto and Light Services Incorporated on the rear of North Washington Avenue $50,000; McCarthy Management Services , 50,000, Soco Investments , LLC, that is really Sky Auto Sales on Capouse Avenue, 35,000; and Zummo's Cafe on Marion received $24,154 to help increase wages for their employees . So I thought that was really nice. We have representatives there from Congress man Cartwright and Senator Casey's Office along with the local media, thrilled to see finally Meadow Avenue. Anyone that travels Meadow Avenue, it's paved. It's marked. People aren't bottoming out. That was probably one of the worst streets in the city. I can't say it was the worst but it's probably one of the most heavily travelled streets in the city. So that really needed to be done. And on top of that, Hemlock Street was paved. And Oakmont Park was completed . We were up there for the ribbon cutting . And they did a really nice job on that. I found out that as far as pools this summer, Novembrino 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Park, the splash pad will open this weekend . Weston Park pool will open the following weekend . I believe it's June 6th or 7th. Connell Park, that's being evaluated right now by the engineers . They are having some issues up there. Also, I don't know if anyone saw, they had a soft opening at the Roof at Oppenheim downtown . That's Adam and Casey Donahue , two West Scranton High School graduate s. And they're develop ers in our city. They opened up like a bar and restaurant at the roof of the old Oppenheim 's building . And that's going to be open this weekend on Labor Day weekend from, like, I don't know the hours exactly . It might be noon to until 9 or noon until 10. I'm looking forward to going up there and checking that out and kind of get a beautiful view of our downtown . And it's nice to see two West Scranton kids develop a business . And they opened -- they've developed a number of townhouses and apartments in our city. So I wish them well and encourage people to get down there for that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 I want to remind everyone school is getting out soon. As mention ed with the bikes, kids are going to be all over the place in about two or three weeks. I just want everybody just to be cognizant, please slow down and please watch for children as the summer comes out. And the last thing I want to mention , as far as Code Enforcement is concerned , I would like to check into that time-stamping and dating and if they're taking photos when Code Enforcement goes out. One thing I'd also like to look into, I know we get a lot of complaints about Code Enforcement . But I would like to see if we could send something to the administration and find out as a result of the 10 Code Enforcement officer s that we hired how are we doing with that in terms of the number of citations issued, the number of citations paid. From what I understand , you know, that's a double-edged sword. Some people, you know, ended up getting -- they end up getting code violations . And maybe it was a mistake or maybe, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 it got cleaned up. But I'd like to know how effective that program is running because it's my understanding that we have been able to identify a lot of absentee landlords and properties that were not previously identified and maybe they said they only had one apartment in there. And we found out they had four. And then a lot of blighted properties are being addressed as a result of that code enforcement . So I know a lot of people complain about Code Enforcement . But I would really like to just try to get some feedback , some statistics from the administration as to how effective our Code Enforcement is. Maybe they could develop a list of number of citations issued, number of maybe apartment s that have been identified that now are ending up having to pay PPT and things like that if we could do that, Mr. Voldenberg . That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 To join in with some of my colleague s, I would like to wish DPW and the workers for DPW of Scranton a great Public Works Week. I know last week some properties on Merrifield Avenue were -- it was bought up here in public comment about lawn grass and they were issued code enforcement citation s. I do feel -- I took a ride down the next day and it appeared that DPW had cut the grass on those properties , thank you very much. I know those families are very appreciative with the hardships they are going through with losing the home. I would like to thank Mr. Mancini for his comments made tonight . Hopefully that will help someone out there watching stay away from drugs. I got a property 736-738 North Sumner Avenue, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could send that to Code Enforcement . I got some complaint s about that property . We did get a few answers from last week. Some questions were asked about the National Testing Network and this one is a rather long answer. So has the number of applicant s increase d with the changeover from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 LEAB former vending for the testing to NTN? The name of the test has no impact on the number of applicant s. However , SPD has seen its greatest interest since before Covid. And there are multiple factors that may account for the increase , including but not limited to the updated radio residency requirement . The next question was, what was the reason for the changeover to NTN in 2023. And the answer was the applicant s get to schedule the test when it's most convenient for them. No travel is required , no missed work or missed family obligation s to attend the test in a brick and mortar setting. Recruiting is the toughest it's ever been. And we need new and inventive ways to contact and process potential applicants . NTN fit that mold and are the second LE agency to utilize NTN in Pennsylvania . Or we are the second law enforcement agency to utilize NTN in Pennsylvania . Was the contract placed out to bid, no. It was below the bid threshold . Is there an accounting of the pass failed candidates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 available , not at this time moment in time. We are currently in open testing period and we can provide more specific detail upon the conclusion . SPD has hired ten officers using this online platform from the 2023 testing period. Is the city better with NTN than with the prior vendor LEAB. Yes, we found greater flexibility on the testing , more online exposure to our targeted audience , streamline application process and increase transparency in the testing process . And then the last one is what is the timeframe between scheduled tests should a candidate miss or fail upon testing. I know we did get an e-mail about this as well as some of the public comment s. Applicant s can only test when SPD has an open testing period. Testing periods are scheduled based on SPD staffing levels and expected vacancies . If an applicant fails the test they could retake the test in the next testing period as long as there are 90 days in between the test dates. SPD reached 95 percent of its recruiting goal. So it's undetermine d if we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 need more or one testing period this year. And I know we did get an e-mail, I think Council as a whole, about if someone has failed the test. It seemed that the window wasn't large enough for the applicant that may have failed the test to retake the test. So if we could ask, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could extend that a little bit so if someone failed on their initial test they could possibly retake? That's all for that question . I had asked about Keyser Valley. Some money had been switched from Keyser Valley flood funding into City Hall repairs . I asked for a little clarification last week and the answer I got back was the city has sent correspondence explaining the movement of the funding which is just that budget transfer . The city is reallocating funds to accommodate renovations at the City Clerk and Controller 's offices . But they do state that the Keyser Valley Flood Project is fully funded through other line items, so glad to hear that. That's all for tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do, yes. First, I'd also like to start off by thanking our DPW for the National Public Works week. Apparently it's also the EMS week. So I'd also like to thank EMS workers for all that they do, especially our DPW. We truly do appreciate what you do to keep our city clean, you know, anything ranging from picking up garbage to sweeping the streets to working on the gutters . We do appreciate that. And I just wanted to make a comment from something that Councilman King had brought up about Code Enforcement . So we used to receive a report. I think it might have been a quarterly report and it had numbers for quality of life tickets issued broken down into, like, which neighborhood s were receiving the door tags, quality of life tickets . And it's been quite some time since we receive d that. So I think that might have been something that Eileen Cipriani was putting together when she was Director of Community Development and that was really helpful. It was like an OpenGov PowerPoint report that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 should be together . So perhaps we could request that we start receiving that again at least on a quarterly basis so we can see how Code Enforcement is doing in terms of the quality of life tickets . And last week I met with Steve Oscellinski from Pennsylvania American Water because there are several project s that I wanted to discuss with him and check in on. And he informed me that the projects for the spring were basically completed . Now they just have to go through the paving restoration , which is going to take place during June. And he anticipate d that that should be completed throughout the city on their -- with their projects within that month, the only one being Monroe Avenue which was added on. The work is going to begin on Monroe Avenue. But the paving won't be complet ed in June like the other projects . That will come a little bit later. And he also assured me that the compaction testing is being completed on those pave cuts. And the work is being done properly . So that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 done on every job where they test the level of compaction to avoid any, you know, potholes or issues occurring after the paving is completed . I wanted to discuss the unsheltered task force meeting which I was present at. I had requested to be a part of that task force. And I believe there's -- they said there were 22 members but not all members were able to attend. It looks like the majority of the people that were there were representing those nonprofit organization s that serve the unsheltered or the homeless population . So, you know, I think it's certainly appropriate that those are the people that are a part of it since they are the ones serving those communities and can help us in identifying the gaps in services which is something that we had discuss ed. We talked about -- or I spoke about this in caucus some more in detail. But we will request minutes from that meeting . I could just give a brief overview , but we were given a point in time update which is a survey that's completed and funded through HUD. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 that is completed January 31st of each year to assess how many people are homeless . And that was one of the things that we were provided numbers on. We also discussed what is needed with the shelter . So there are consideration s to add another shelter in the city. And so it's found that, you know, we're really lacking in services for families and shelter for families . And so that's something that the city is exploring I think still in the very early stages but looking at, you know, what would that space look like, who would run it, what funding is needed for that, how many beds are needed. All of those things are being discussed and also talked about potential for a code red shelter just like we have a code blue shelter in the wintertime when it becomes too cold during the summertime on those very hot nights having a code red shelter so what would be, you know, what degree would it have to hit in order to have that. Would that be at, you know, Weston Field like it is during code blue. So those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 were the basics of our discussion for the task force. And the meetings are quarterly . But I don't have a date on when the next one will occur. Oh, and to my knowledge , it wasn't a public meeting. I don't know that the future ones are suppose d to be public meeting s or just with task force members , but I'm happy to continue to provide updates . I had an update on South Washington Avenue which I previously had a complaint on. And that was the vehicles and trucks are still parking along South Washington Avenue and really blocking line-of-sight for those exiting the Wright Center or their businesses are on South Washington . So if we could request again that the SPD be ticketing on South Washington Avenue or have those vehicles removed because , you know, I don't want to see accidents occurring because of that. And it sounds like people are still not being compliant . I don't know -- I didn't receive an update as to whether or not they have been out, if they did ticket. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please ask SPD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 about that specific area. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And something I sent to Code Enforcement , behind the Jack Williams along East Gibson and Wyoming , it's pretty overgrown, the grass on the Jack Williams side. But then across the street on the other side in previous years we've received complaint s about that being overgrown and taking over the sidewalk so people can't even walk on the sidewalk and I think it's behind Cooper's. I know at one point we had gotten it cleaned up and figured out who owns that part of the property and walkway . But if we could contact them again to -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll take care of it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Great. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : A few comments , yeah, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 during caucus the homeless task force meeting came up. And I asked for is there minutes and for us, for not just Council but for all of you and especially if it's not going to be open to the public so we know what's going on. We need to know what's going on. It's a huge problem in the area where we all sympathize and want some answers or want to know the plan or awaiting a plan. That's obvious . So I look forward to the meeting minutes and updates . Also was brought to my attention Knox Road off of Lake Scranton Road, the road is terrible , almost unpassable I'm told by some residents . It's not on the paving list unfortunately . I hope it gets put on next year's. I know sometimes for whatever reasons a road will come off that list maybe if it's done by a utility or another road gets put on. But let's ask the administration for that consideration if it's available . But until then maybe let's see if administration can do something with the road and not wait another year for these residents . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Also, you know, there's always -- there's been some great discussion about pave cuts about pave cut inspector s, about the lack of or how many we have. So, also, someone brought it to my attention that, you know, these pave cuts are being -- hopefully they're being inspect ed. But the utility companies that make these cuts have to get permits. This is revenue to the city. So I'm not sure if that is occurring or how it used to occur, maybe. So what I would like to ask administration , request administration that a copy of the checks, the revenue from these utility companies and the permits that, you know, that produce this revenue over the last six months, okay? And I would also like to know how much revenue came into this account because I'm told there's a certain account for this. How much revenue came into this account over the past five years so I could compare to maybe, you know, the past six months or the past year because I know, like I said, nobody knows what's going on with pave cuts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 We have a body. We have a half body. We have one and a half bodies. We don't have anybody . So if we are missing out on revenue we need to know that because I do know that Mr. Hazzouri used to handle all that. He would go on scene. He'd check out these pave cuts. You know, he had a relation ship with these utility companies . I think we don't have that anymore . So we might be losing revenue . So and I know he handled the process . But I think he did a great job but I think he left his position about four years ago. So I want to know what happened from then until now and see if we lost revenue or how we're going to plan on fixing -- MR. VOLDENBERG : We did receive some extensive reports last week. I have to review them with Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : I have copy of a lot of the receivable s. I asked for the last four years. You might be asking for something a little bit different . But I have to go through it. There was quite a stack of document s that I have to go through . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 MR. MCANDREW : All right. Well, share them -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask about the last six months, however . MR. MCANDREW : All right. That's a start. Thank you. So I'd also -- in closing , I'd like to wish everybody here a happy and safe Memorial Day weekend with your family and friends . Let's not forget to honor, remember , the brave men and women of our military that gave their lives so we have the freedom to, you know, honor them and hang out with our friends and family on a beautiful long weekend and enjoy these freedoms because of them. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . DR. ROTHCHILD : Councilman Smurl, I'm sorry, do you mind if I add something to the pave cut issue because I've been looking into it and I've been meaning to provide some further details on the ordinance that we currently have. And I have just some questions to add on for Mr. Voldenberg to ask the administration on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 So according to the ordinance that we already have in place, we have a five-year warranty period for the utility company . So if there is an issue with their pave job, then we can have them fix it based on the warranty that we have. And if they refuse, then we could potentially send the bill to the company with a 20 percent upcharge. And if they don't pay it, then according to our ordinance that we already have in place, then we could fine them $1,000 daily for not paying. So we have an ordinance that I don't believe is actually being enforced . And if we did enforce it, maybe we would have less of an issue with our pave cuts with utility companies . So, Mr. Voldenberg , my question is if any of this has been enforced if we ever collected fines from the utility companies or if we've used the warranty to have them go back and correct their pave cuts. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll research that and I'll also ask them how they're going to go approach it with Reilly Associates as the new pave cut inspectors . DR. ROTHCHILD : Excellent . Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 you. MR. SCHUSTER : I know we discussed that in caucus. But officially right now we do not have a pave cut inspect or and it's being done by the city engineer is the answer we got. MR. VOLDENBERG : Correct . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : How about adding on what's that going to cost us compare d to an employee ? Please. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SMURL: Thank you. The following ones are the complaints and request s I have receive d and forwarded , 339 Patterson Avenue for a storm drain cleaning and street cleaning on the entire block. 129 South Webster , on the side street, Hemlock Street was just paved and the person that lives there said her driveway now has an uneven access into it. So we sent that in to find out if that could be correct . 321 Prospect Avenue in the rear, the Court is filled with garbage . There's cartons and chairs and there's just a bunch of stuff out there. And also at the end 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 of that block at Donnelly Court and River Street, that was forwarded in. 328 Pittston Avenue, quality of life issues, trash and garbage , unregistered van. That was also sent to the Code Enforcement . It was issued a door tag. The followup will be on May 30th. 200 block of Hamm Court for pothole patching on the entire block. Also this week Councilman McAndrew and myself we attended Kevin's Worldwide and joined their celebration of 40 years of business . They're located at 710 Capouse Avenue and they provide all kinds of promotional items. They're a fifth generation family-owned business that's been in Scranton since the beginning . So congratulations to Kevin and thank you for being a part of the City of Scranton . I also joined Councilman King and Mayor Cognetti at the ribbon cutting on the newly build Oakmont Park. This playground is another great addition to the city and hopefully this summer we'll have a lot more. On Friday, Mr. Voldenberg and I met with Commissioners on Gaughan and McGloin and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 the Mayor and represent atives from the Borough of Dunmore . We spoke about project s that we are going to join together and work on, street pavings and other things where they have half a block, and anyway, as that progresses I will keep you updated on that. Thursday , I attended the Armed Forces luncheon. And on Saturday I walked in the Armed Forces Parade. These events were really great to see all our veterans back out. A lot of them from the Gino Merli Center came over. It was great to meet all of these gentlemen and thank them for their service . My final comment is that -- it's about the Governor Shapiro 's visit on Monday to propose 18 million dollars to increase his 2024-2025 to boost of the Commonwealth 's tourism industry . Well, I'm all in support for the tourism industry . I'm also very concerned about the five homicides in our city, increasing gang violence and other problem s that we're facing in the city. I was hoping the Governor while he was here would spare a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 few minutes and stop by and speak with us, but that didn't happen. So hopefully while he's out doing his Pennsylvania -- covering Pennsylvania in his motor home or whatever you call that thing, if he gets a chance maybe on your way back here stop and speak with us about all of the crime in the City of Scranton . The citizen s are here. We're not worried about funding right now as far as tourism . We have Steamtown Railroad and stuff but five homicide s in five months and the gang activity , I think that is a bit more concerning at this point. That is all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR.
