GAUGHAN : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Here. We are going to do a proclamation so if our guests want to come up front with us. WHEREAS , in 2018, the American Cancer Society estimates that 55,400 people in the United States will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest cancers , and 44,330 people will die from the disease ; and. WHEREAS , that's more than 152 people, our mothers , daughters , fathers , sons, wives, husbands , sisters , brothers , colleagues and friends who will hear the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 dreaded news EVERY SINGLE DAY; and WHEREAS , the average lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer for men is about 1 in 63, and for women, the lifetime risk is about 1 in 65; and WHEREAS , pancreatic cancer takes 91% of its victims within five years and kills more people than breast cancer in the United States; and WHEREAS , the disease is the third leading cause of cancer-related death and it is projected to become the second leading cause by 2020; and WHEREAS , the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is the national organization serving the pancreatic cancer community in Scranton and nationwide through a comprehensive approach that includes public policy, research funding , patient services , and public awareness and education related to developing effective treatments and a cure for pancreatic cancer; and WHEREAS , the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and its affiliates support those patients currently battling pancreatic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 cancer, as well as to those who have lost their lives to this disease , and are committed to nothing less than a cure; and WHEREAS , to double survival by 2020, we must advocate for increases in federal funding for cancer research to enable pancreatic cancer patients to receive better treatments and outcomes ; and WHEREAS , the good health and well-being of the residents of the City of Scranton are enhanced as a direct result of increased awareness about pancreatic cancer and research into early detection , causes, and effective treatments . NOW, THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED , that Scranton City Council wishes to designate Monday, November 19, 20187 as "WORLD PANCREATIC CANCER DAY" in the City of Scranton BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED , that this Proclamation be made a permanent part of the Minutes of this Council . Would anyone like to say anything ? MS. CONNORS : I just want to say thank you for the Proclamation and, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 unfortunately , as Mr. Rogan said, pancreatic cancer is now going to be the second leading of cancer deaths in this country . My sister-in-law, former mayor Jim Connors ' sister passed away in 1994. There have not been many strides made since that time. I think Tim Perry, your grandfather, if I'm not mistaken , also died from pancreatic cancer so, unfortunately , what we need is more research to find early detection tools and I want to thank all of you again for recognizing this dreaded disease and hopefully when we come back next year we will have made some strides in finding not only earlier detection but a cure because , as you said, there is only 9 percent survive after two years, so it is one of the deadliest cancers that is out there. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Would anyone else like to say a few words? Mayor? MR. CONNORS : No, she is doing well. MR. ROGAN: Thank you everyone . Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MS. REED: THIRD ORDER. 3-A.

The annual holiday shopping tradition that gives communities everywhere out in support of their favorite small business that make our -- business es that make our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 community vibrant and unique. We celebrate small business Saturday , a shopping holiday that's meant to boost awareness and support of businesses both local and small because when they thrive we all thrive and local money stays local. Spending $100 at a local business results in $68 that stays in the community compared to $43 for national and franchise businesses so please consider support ing small businesses this Saturday and all throughout the holiday season. This Sunday, November 25, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. the Buy Local Holiday Marketplace will be held at the Scranton Cultural Center where you will find some of the areas artisans , crafters and local business es. The marketplace features approximately 120 vendors and offers five floors of shopping . Admission is $2 and the first 1,000 shoppers receive a free reusable shopping bag courtesy of FNCB Bank. Food and drinks will be available for purchase that day. So please take some time and visit the local shops and small businesses . It's very, very important that we all do our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 part. That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? I have a few. This Thursday , November 22, is Thanksgiving . We would like to wish everyone a happy holiday . City hall will be closed Thursday and Friday in observance of the holiday . DPW will only be off on Thursday . Refuse and blue recycling will be just one day behind for the remainder of the week. Next Monday, November 26, we will hold a public hearing in council chambers at 5:15 for the operating budget, and the week of December 10 to the 14 DPW will be collecting leaves and not newspaper this week. The city is encouraging everyone to bag their leaves. Please do not rake them to the curb. As I mention ed at a few meeting s, free leaf bags are available at any fire station in the city and also at the DPW headquarters at 1010 Poplar Street. Again, the leaves will be collected the week of December 10. And, finally , the owner of Buona's, Giovanni Piccolino , asked me to announce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 that he will once again this year be hosting a free Thanksgiving luncheon . All are welcome between 12 and 2 p.m. at Buona's downtown on Lackawanna Avenue and we would like to thank Mr. Piccolino for his continued generosity in our city. MR. GAUGHAN : I have one as well. The Lackawanna County Commissioners agreed to participate in the Phillip Morris U.S.A. initiative that is providing 10,000 free litter stands to collect cigarette butts in communities nationwide. Interested municipalities may participate through the county for an opportunity to obtain a stand at no cost to place at your municipality 's heaviest smoking area, then it goes through the requirements . So, Mrs. Reed, if we could forward this to the mayor's office and the DPW director to see if they will sign up for this. I think it's a great idea, a great program and then we'll have to -- or the administration will have to figure out where our heaviest smoking areas are maybe downtown . That's all. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment : Lee Morgan spoke on matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on city business . Norma Jefferies spoke on city business . Marie Schumacher spoke on agenda items and city business .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, just quickly , just a follow-up with Mrs. Jefferies and her issue. Mrs. Reed, if we could send something out to Chief Graziano to take a special patrol and special interest into the Hill Section , particularly Clay, Olive, Vine, Quincy areas for anybody parked in an area that is just not going to let anybody see past the "No Parking" sign, and then maybe we can do a follow-up to DPW to see about any kind of "No Parking" markers on the street itself. I know that we have other people that take care of it, but the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 city street is the city's responsibilities so let's see if there is a need there for maybe some repainting as well just to make sure it's clear, and I'm sure there is the proper signage is up already , but it wouldn't hurt. Other than that, the only other thing I have to talk about is Thanksgiving is coming up so everybody have a safe and happy one. Enjoy your friends , enjoy your family, that's what this time of year is all about, and as Councilman Evans brought up, this Saturday is shop small Saturday . We want to stay local, keep everything in the area, keep things, you know, as he mentioned , when you go to a big box store you might get a little bit better price, you might get a little more variety , but you are never going to get that service that we are you used to getting when you go to your neighborhood store. It's just night and day so, again, support our local business , support our local economy , you spend here the money stays here, and that's what generates -- that's what community is all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 about. So, again, guys, Happy Thanksgiving and be happy, stay safe. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. First off, I'm in the process of reviewing the budget so I'll have more on that in the upcoming weeks. Mrs. Reed, we sent that letter to the County Director of Assessments back in September and we still haven't gotten a response and I was just reminded that when I looked -- was looking at the Tax Assessor 's report for the hearing date that theirs wasn't changed , that they still haven't responded to that so would you be able to send another letter, please? And that's all I have for this week. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yeah, briefly . First of all, Happy Thanksgiving to everyone . I hope you have a great holiday . Today marks the three year anniversary of the passing of Bob 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 McGoff, former city council president , so I hope Bob's memory can continue to serve as a reminder for all of us to always strive for a little more civility , to always strive to be a better human being, and to always strive to do the very best we all can for the citizens of Scranton . Three years ago on this very night, in fact, during our council meeting that evening we learned that our friend and colleague , Bob McGoff, had lost his battle to cancer. I have had the honor each year on the solemn anniversary to take a brief moment from the evening 's business and read Bob's own words of wisdom on the topic of cancer that he spoke during a city council meeting . Bob said, "Just one thing I would like to mention , I would like to just say that I know all of us have been effected in some way by this insidious disease , and I would encourage anyone that knows someone who is fighting this or dealing with treatment involved with cancer to be a friend. One of the things that happens to cancer patients and those under treatment , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 depression is a very significant aspect of it, and I believe it or not simply sitting down and talking with people, watching a television show with them, bringing dinner and having something to eat with them goes a long way to helping people deal with that. And I would encourage that if you know someone , please be a friend and be part of the helping process ." Bob McGoff is someone who understood the importance of even the smallest gesture . Someone we will always have great respect and his words are worth mention ing once again in his honor and his memory, and that is all I have for now. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First of all, I just want to echo what Mr. Rogan said at the beginning of the meeting about Director Gallagher 's mother who had passed away. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family. Also, Judge Conaboy who was a respected judge in the community and a respected human being in the community and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 great person also passed away in the last two weeks so I want to send my thoughts and prayers out to his family as well. And as Councilman Evans mentioned , today is the three-year anniversary of our colleague and our friend's passing , Bob McGoff, and I think every time we step into the City Clerk's Office we think about him and all he meant to the city and to this council so our thoughts are with him and his family tonight as well. I received a frantic message from a resident on East Mountain , Froud Avenue, Mrs. Reed, I think I did give it to Mrs. Reed already , they are having runoff issues on Froud Avenue, and Mrs. Schumacher is laughing because she knows this isn't a new problem , and I think we have said this before, but when it rains and there is runoff, especially when it gets cold and it's icy, they literally are trapped . They cannot leave their homes. So, Mrs. Reed, I don't know if you sent it already , but if we could just draft a letter to the DPW director and the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 administration and make them aware of this again and hopefully they can go out and they can do something to alleviate this problem . Also, council received a letter about a tree that is about to fall on a home at 2622 Lafayette Street, the rear of Byron Lane in-between Lafayette and Brigg Street. So, Mrs. Reed, I do have a copy of that letter if we could forward that to the appropriate department and copy Mr. Santoli on that I would appreciate it. Also, last thing I want to mention tonight I think two or three years ago worked along with my colleagues with the American Lung Association to institute a program called the Young Lungs Program and we got free signage that we put up throughout the parks trying to prevent people from smoking in our city parks, from leaving cigarette butts all over the place and it ended up being I think so far a huge success . So I recently met again with the American Lung Association . I'm sure some of you have seen the recent articles in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 news about vaping, which has become a major epidemic . Just reading an article earlier today, this is from Saturday , November 17, the new numbers on vaping are staggering . Vaping has increased nearly 80 percent among high schoolers and 50 percent among middle schoolers since last year. There is health experts that say behavior changes are key to look for as more and more children and young adults become addicted to nicotine causing psychological changes to their brain so it's a huge epidemic not only in the country but I think in the City of Scranton . Also, when I met with the American Lung Association one of the things they had presented to me, and I believe there is a young person that came up months and months ago and presented this to council , there is something called the Tobacco Resistance Unit youth, and these are local high school students who actually completed 81 separated tobacco retail assessments in the City of Scranton . The Tobacco Resistance Unit Youth is a movement throughout Pennsylvania to help youth ages 12 to 18 stay tobacco and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 nicotine free and their goal is to prevent and stop youth tobacco use through education and they came up with this program , this point of sale program that collect different data from establishments throughout the City of Scranton , so in reviewing the report there was some really shocking statistics , and I won't go through all of them but I'll just highlight some of the major ones. Only 14 percent of tobacco retailers in the city displayed a graphic health warning sign. 12 percent of tobacco retailers displayed quit line signage in their establishments . 71 percent of retailers in the City of Scranton advertise cigarillos or little cigars for less than $1. There is a frequency of tobacco products within 12 inches of toys, candy, gum, slushy machines or ice cream so they are trying to obviously target -- tobacco companies are trying to target are young people. They have spent $9.1 billion , according to this report, on marketing in 2016. The report also says that low income 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 neighbor hoods have lower tobacco prices and higher retail densities and youth are 60 percent more likely to have tried smoking and 30 percent more likely to be susceptible to future smoking if they have been more frequently exposed to tobacco promotion . So, again, I won't go through all of the details in this report, but it was very interesting to see what goes on at tobacco retail establishments in the City of Scranton . So the reason I bring this up is because in meeting with the American Lung Association there is actually something that council and the administration can do to combat this issue. One of those things is that -- one of the issues that was pointed out in the report is that about 30 retail establishments are located within 1,000 feet of schools . So one of the things that I would like council to consider in the next couple of the weeks and into the new year is changing our language in our zoning laws so one of the things that I have here is restricting retailers within 1,000 feet of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 schools so all tobacco retail establishments , a place of business where tobacco or e-cigarette or vaporizer are available for sale to the general public, tobacco retail establishments shall include , but are not limited to, convenient stores, grocery stores, gas stations , tobacco shops, vape shops. No such business shall be permitted within 1,000 feet of a public or private school established for academic education of children or minors under the age to buy tobacco products . So I would like my colleagues to consider this over the next few weeks and into the new year because if you read this report it's pretty clear, and the U.S. Surgeon General concluded that tobacco advertising and promotions directly cause both the initiation and progression of tobacco use among youth, and the other really concerning thing to me is the lack of signage in these establishments , and I think that that is something that the city can directly influence , so we can use a comprehensive definition of tobacco product 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 in our licensing laws to ensure that point of sale policies apply to emerging products so new products , and we can enact policies that restrict where, when and how tobacco can be advertised , content neutral signage limits the total amount of storefront signage regardless of content . So there is a few other things in here that I would like my colleagues to consider . I think it's something that the city needs to do because I think this issue is only going to get worse, so something to consider over the next few weeks. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple of comments , I do have comments on a number of agenda items, we have a very lengthy agenda tonight and many positive items that we are going to be voting on, but I do want to take a minute just to mention when I came into the meeting tonight I received this folder right here from the VFW and it says, "Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States presented to Friends of the Doughboy ." And it was presented to me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 for help with the Doughboy statute , and I have say it's truly an honor to receive this, but I do want to thank former council president Joe Wechsler , who really got the ball rolling on this project and, of course, the proclamation was dated for Veteran 's Day on the 11th, and the doughboy statute for those who don't know was put to honor veterans in casualty of the World War I. It was first dedicated back in 1940. The original doughboy statute is actually made out of zinc, which is not a very durable metal. The new statute is made out of bronze, so hopefully that new statute will be there to honor our great veterans from World War I for hundreds and hundreds of years. I'd just like to echo my colleagues . I'd like to wish everyone a happy and very safe Thanksgiving holiday . As I mention ed, I will have a lot to say on agenda items as they come up. That's all. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION - AN ORDINANCE - APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2019 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2019. MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I have done an initial review of the 2019 budget and do have several concerns . I am going to put all of my concerns and questions into writing to Mr. Bulzoni , and I would like to go through some of the things that, you know, are concerning to me after looking at the budget. So some areas are revenues , health insurance expense , salaries and wages, supplies and expenses and the pension expense. So in taking a look at some of the line items, the first one that I have a question on is the proceeds 2019 bond 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 issuance . The budget narrative included with the document indicates that the $1,000 that's in the line item is a placeholder for prospective 2019 refunding and capital improvement debt initiative . So as we know the city has produced a 2019 balanced budget. There are a number of budget capital expenditures in most departments so I would like to the administration to please explain if the city is planning to finance additional capital improvements through public financing . The second has to do with the non-resident wage tax. The budget indicates that the city did not collect any non-resident wage taxes for the nine months ending September 30, 2018. This seems like an error to me and I'm asking whether it's combined with the wage tax so I would like to if the administration would please provide the amount of the non-resident wage tax collect ed for the nine months ending September 30, 2018, and where it was recorded , and I'd like the administration to produce the city's budget worksheet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 calculations . Also, I did have an initial concern , we talked about it in the caucus, with the real estate transfer tax. The budget anticipates an increase in property sales where we budgeted in 2018 $3,375,000. We have only collected $2,224,686 so I don't know if we are going to hit that mark but it does seem kind of low as of September 30. Also, the current wage tax, wage tax collection s should be consistent with each month except for those months that have three payrolls. Looking back at the 2016 audit, the wage taxes were $26 million that we collected . I'd like the administration to please provide an explanation of why 2018 wage tax collection s for the nine months ending September 30, 2018, are lagging behind historical trends. We budgeted $27,387,219. We have only collected $18,499,053 as of September 30. In the 2019 budget, it's increasing to $28,587,533 so I have questions about that and I'd like the administration to provide the city's budget worksheet calculations . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 I'd also like the administration to provide an explanation on why the 2018 local service tax collection s for the nine months ending September 30, 2018, are lagging behind historical trends. Please produce the city's budget worksheet calculations on this. We budgeted $4,910,000, we've only collected $2,495,117 so I have questions on that. The amusement tax, 2018 budget $385,000 we have not collect ed anything . I think I remember from last year that this does come in late but I'd like an explanation on that. We have also budgeted the same amount in 2019. Also, in looking at the revenues , something I asked about it last year, under pave cuts for UGI, the city budget would $195,000, we have not collected anything as of September 30, 2018. The 2019 budget we are budgeting $90,000. Now, I believe that the city is involved in a lawsuit with UGI over the recent changes to the pave cut ordinance but I just want wonder why we continue to budget for this when we are not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 getting anything . Also, it seems to me in looking at the pave cut line items that we are not collecting as much maybe as we should be, so I am going to have additional questions about that. I'm also concerned about the health insurance . I could be wrong on this, but it looks like we are, you know, it looks like we are understating the cost of health insurance . I have here we may be understating it by $1,308,232 so we have a reduction in police health care, and by the way this is good thing, but I'm just questioning where they are coming up with these figures from, $157,610.77. Fire, the health care budgeted for 2019 is reduced by $1,049,710.05, and DPW is $755,726.91, so that totals almost $2 million in budgeted expenses for health care from 2018 to 2019. So, again, it seems like an understatement so I would like additional clarification on how they came up with those numbers . Also, if we are looking at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 addition of positions in this budget, first one is in Licensing and Inspections so we are hiring a confidential secretary for zoning and planning for $30,000 so I would like the administration to please provide the name of the department personnel who performed secretarial services in 2018. In reviewing the budget, the Department of Human Resources does not have a confidential secretary and I'm asking why Licensing and Inspections needs one. Also, traffic sign maintenance position in the DPW budget, so I would like to know the number of 2017 and 2018 traffic sign maintenance projects , just an explanation of why this new position is necessary for the efficient department operation s. It's unclear , also, in looking at the budget what the new salary is going to be for this position , I believe the person is now part-time and then moving into full-time so an explanation on that. Also, if we are talking about new positions , the Department of Public Works Parks and Recreation assistant for $30,000. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I'd like the administration to please provide why this new position is necessary for the efficient department operation . I don't know, just my initial review I think that's a waste of money. Also, in looking at the professional services account in the Department of Business Administration , the city continues to rely on outside consultants . The city budgeted $250,000 for 2018, however , for the nine months ending in September we have incurred $418,906 in professional services so we are way over budget so I'd like the administration to explain why the city is over budget for 2018, then we are increasing our professional services for the 2019 budget to $500,000 so what is the reasoning for that? Also, in the Department of Licensing , Inspections and Permits, under building demolition , apparently the city is expecting to accelerate the demolition of properties in 2019. 2018 we budgeted $65,000, we have only spent $10,252 as of September 30 and we are bumping that up to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 $150,000 in the 2019 budget so I'd like to understand the rational e behind that because it's my understanding that we have a lot of money in the OECD budget left over for demolition so I would like to know what the rationale there is. For discussion purposes , the electrical costs were annualized and then projected and I believe they are understate d by $128,081. Now, I do know that there have been energy improvements in city hall. I would like to know what they are specifically and what other actions the city is going to take to reduce the electrical costs from historical levels. In the Law Department , one of my concerns the city budget would a significant increase in professional services again. We budgeted $195,000 in 2018, we are budgeting $255,000 in 2019. So please explain the basis for the increase in the city's use of outside legal counsel because we are hiring -- we hired an assistant city solicitor last year, I believe . We are hiring another assistant city solicitor this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 year for $35,000, we are hiring a tax office solicitor for $25,000, and a project manager for $35,000 to assist in drafting RFPs to assist with project monitoring and development , yet professional services are increasing 24 percent so I'd like an explanation on that. Because it would -- you know, I would assume that you if you are hiring more people in the Law Department your professional service s budget should go down and I can tell you already I don't agree with the project manager for $35,000 in assisting and drafting RFPs. That should be the job of the city solicitor . Also, what is the basis for and how did the city determine the 2019 budget amount for flood protection systems maintenance . We went from $5,000 in 2018, we only spent $25,216 as of September 30 of this year. 2019, $1,973,900. Now, there is a mention of the Keyser Valley pumping station so if that is it and that's why we are spending all of this money how did they arrive at this figure so I would like the administration to produce the city's budget 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 worksheet calculations on that. Also, gas, oil, and lube for the DPW they budgeted $325,000, we are at $323,309 so I have questions on that. Please explain why action the city will take to reduce vehicle costs from historical levels. As everybody knows, the Attorney General 's Office opened an audit of the school district 's vehicles cost so I would like to know what action, if any, has the city taken to assure issues identified by the AG and the school district are not present in the city's purchasing of gas, oil, lubricants and tires. Non-departmental expenditures under Court awards, we go from $350,000 in 2018 up to $725,000 in 2019 so I would like the administration to explain what city department is expected to be responsible for the anticipated Court awards. The city is proposing to use the proceeds from a private placement for a lump sump deposit into the pension plans, which was voted on two weeks ago. The private placements will be secured by funds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 distributed by the Scranton Sewer authority . The budget narrative does not address the private placement borrowing in 2018 or 2019 unless I missed it. My question is has the net interest costs associated with the private placement been included in the 2019 budget? I'd also like to know will the city have sufficient cash on hand to make the 2018 MMO payment , and if the city is somehow unsuccessful in obtaining a loan to fund the pension plan will it create a 2019 deficit and if so that what would the projected deficit be. Also, several other things here, the Pennsylvania Economy League has sent us a letter that I actually just received today. Some of the things I'm concerned about the total expenditures propose d by the city in 2019 are $98,758,137. The exit plans projections are $91,859,095 for a difference of roughly $7 million or 7 1/2 percent so that's concerning . They mentioned notable variations from the exit plan, capital expenditures are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 up 106.7 percent . Departmental expenditures are up almost 30 percent . Non-departmental expenditures are up 40.3 percent , and debt service is up to 20.8 percent . PEL mention s that the city has reviewed these variance s with the coordinator and has satisfactorily explained the necessity for the increases in these 2019 budget items. I would like an explanation as to why they are so high above the exit plan. Also, with some of the salary increases , there are a number of employees who are receiving salary increases , $12,500 increase for the fire chief, which I believe is excessive . I do see that the fire chief will be taking on an additional role with the emergency management coordinator so I would like a job description for that, what additional responsibilities that will be. Also, we no longer have the SAFER Grant I believe for the fire department so I would like to know what the effect on the budget -- what effect that will have on the budget and how we are absorbing those costs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 I'd like to also know from the administration how many outstanding bills do we think we are going to have at the end of the year how many might roll over into next year. I'd like to get a statement of the cash flows. I do believe , and Ms. Schumacher has asked for this, this should be on a monthly basis, a monthly financial statement . It will give us an idea of what the demands are for cash and see what the liabilities are on a monthly basis. So overall I have concerns that we may be overstating revenues . We are spending a lot in non-departmental expenditures so hopefully when Mr. Bulzoni comes, and I will provide this to him in writing so he can respond , I would like a response in writing so we can have a discussion when he comes in in two weeks. Also, not that I was expecting it for various reasons , but there is no mention of any of the lawsuits in the budget. We have talked about Plan B for a number of months, but if any one of these lawsuits we were to lose such as Act 511 or refuse, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 which we are relying on these funds, what is the -- is there an alternative , what is the alternative ? What does a budget without those revenues look like and what would be our plan because it's my understanding at least for the Act 511 that that ruling could be coming down soon. And I think that's all I have for this agenda item. Oh, the other thing I have, too, I'm sorry, excuse me, one more thing, I'm also concerned about overtime . So the total overtime for 2018 was budgeted at $1,058,701.30. As of September , the end of September of this year, we have accrued $1,345,853.86 so we are over budget by almost $300,000. 2019 we see an increase of overtime that we are budgeting $1,402,750, that's a 32 percent increase from 2018 so why is that? Now, I understand that some of this overtime gets reimbursed , but I would actually like to see that sectioned out so we know what's being reimbursed and we are actually responsible for. Police overtime we are over budget right now as of end of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 the September by $176,064.77. That's 44 percent over budget and fire overtime we are over budget by $156,057, 56 percent . So we are seeing in the police overtime a 62 1/2 percent increase in what we are budgeting between 2018 and 2019, and a 27 percent increase from 2018-2019 in overtime costs. There is also a small item, and I may have asked about this a few months ago, there is a line item, "Personnel cost adjustment ." 2018 we did not budget anything for this, and I don't know what this is, year-to-date we have spent $2456.63. 2019 we budgeted $7,500 so I'd like to ask what this line item is for. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Very briefly on the budget, the budget is obviously for those who don't have a copy at home it's 135 page document so I'm certainly not going to go through it all, but I want to hit on a couple of big points and every year around budget time when we run into people at the supermarket or in the community they always wonder how it affects them. That's most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 important . Obviously , just like your budget at home every year some items get more expensive , hopefully some items go down in cost, for instance , now we go to the gas station and gas is finally going down which I know is a nice break when that happens , but just like your budget at home things fluctuate through the course of the year. But some of the key points, and I'm not going to read the whole budget message from Mr. Bulzoni , but there is one paragraph that I want to read and comment about. It says, "In effect, the 2019 budget continues to pivot from crises to recovery . The ability to sustain positive momentum will be critical . Broad economic development initiatives such as LERTA expansion and Opportunity Zone funding initiatives would have a measured impact on the city's continued improvement ." And this paragraph I think is the most important part in this whole budget message that for the first time, as long as I have been on council , the city has transitioned from being reactive to all of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 the number of different problems that have happened through the years, to finally being proactive. Trying to grow our tax base, trying to put initiatives into place that are going to bring people into the City of Scranton . That really is the key takeaway for this budget and not only just the budget but we are going to be voting on some other economic development legislation tonight that's key to the city's recovery . But the bottom line for taxpayers is this is the third year in a row with no tax increase . Three years ago when it was mention ed there was no tax increase some that like to criticize said, "Well, it's only because it's two years before an election , people want to get reelected ." The next year was an election year, some said, "Well, it's an election year that's why the taxes didn't go up. Wait until next year they are going to go up double." Well, there is no election this year and this is the third year with no tax increase and no fee increase in our budget. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Not to mention your taxes and fees not going up, but your services also aren't being cut so there is two part to the equation here. There are some new positions . There are some raises that are being given out that are long overdue . My position on raises has always been if the city is in a financial shape where we are raising taxes on residents there shouldn 't be pay increases for city employees . When we are in a position where our budget is much more stable like it has been the last three years I certainly think the employees that work for the city that contribute to our success need to be rewarded as well in a reasonable manner. Again, the continued services are a huge component of trying to drive this economic development and bring the residents into the city that we have continued to talk about. It cannot be done on one side of a ledger and it hasn't happened overnight . The last few years have been much more stable for the city but this couldn't have been done without a number of initiatives 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 that were taken on by some members of this council , members of the previous council that have not always been political popular . It's not always popular to take on some of these issues, but this budget is a result of all of these items that we have taken. Again, it's not one little thing or one piece of legislation that changes the direction of the city, but little by little we have crawled out of the hole and we are in much better shape. It's a 135-page document , are there going to be things in there council members disagree with? Of course. Just on my review, and I haven't finished reviewing the whole document yet, there are things that if I was the mayor I would not have put in the budget, but on the whole bottom line for the resident is your costs aren't going up, your services aren't going down, and we are going to continue to invest in infrastructure within the city. So at first glance I think it's a great budget, and as Mr. Bulzoni mention ed in his budget statement that it really is a year of pivoting from being reactive to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 being proactive, so I'm looking forward to our public hearing next week, hearing from the residents and especially looking forward from hearing from Mr. Bulzoni . I know I have a number of questions as well that I will discuss with him, but at first glance it looks like a great budget to do the city's recovery . Is there anyone else on the question ? MR. EVANS: On the question , I'm going to come back to we talked about this in the caucus, the real estate transfer tax, it appears that it's not performing to the level we thought it was, but that's not actually true, the numbers that we are looking year-to-date it says September , but I talked to the BA and it more likely end of August numbers . So if you take the numbers that we have it is actually right on target to meet our projection or even exceed our projection for the second year in a row, so it's sort of proof of concept where you can actually lower a tax and get the same amount of revenue or more. I know it's something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 foreign to a lot of people, because we have never done it before, we lowered the tax and achieved positive results . So we really have to look at that again, and I'm going to take a hard look at License and Permits because they are exceeding expectation s with revenue and what that tells me is yeah, the economy is doing better, you have more building permits , but it's also telling me that we have fees in there that are way, way too high and we have certain things that we are doing that we don't even need to do anymore , so I'm going to take a good hard look at that as well because I think it's time to roll back some of those fees and fines that are within that department , but I am confident the real estate transfer tax will again out perform as it did last year, in fact, you know, I would like the roll is back a little bit more this year, I'm not sure if we will go there or not, but I would have no problem with reducing that again. MR. GAUGHAN : Just one additional comment , sorry, I think it would be helpful since we received the budget in November 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 that when we -- and maybe there is a reason for this, but it would make more sense to me that when we receive the budget we receive the year-to-date figures in November , or if not November then at least the end of October . That would make a lot more sense, maybe a month makes a difference , but we are receiving the figures at the end of the September , and as Mr. Evans said, maybe they have changed so I would like to see that since it is November , so I know I requested that last year and we did not receive that but, again, I would like to request this year, I think that would make much more sense and maybe there is a reason that they can't do that, but I would like to request that. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Yeah, I agree, Mr. Gaughan , about the update. It's always best to judge any kind of -- especially a profit and loss statement on the most accurate and up-to-date information . I think the issue is it's just third quarter results and that's kind of why the cut off was September . I would like to get the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 first half for the first period of quarter four, but it just seems like the quarter -- the third quarter is the cut off. Yeah, there are a couple of issues that I have and basically it's just with further explanation on bullet points within here, I won't rattle them all off, but there is just some things that are line items without explanation s to them and I'm sure once we ask the questions and we can vet Mr. Bulzoni on what those line items mean, what it pertains to and where the city's expectation is going with that that would clear it up. And, Mr. Evans, you kind of talked about what I want to talk about as well. I know you championed the idea of that License and Permit Department and cleaning that up, page 19 of our backup is dedicated to just pretty much just fees that, I mean, don't really move the needle for the city and I think it would streamline the office. I mean, we have a pinball license listed on our budget that made zero dollars . Now, come on, do we need that? Absolute ly not. MR. EVANS: No, we are still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 carrying I think it was 17 different fees that make less than $10,000. MR. PERRY: So, yeah, there is just -- again, that just needs to be cleaned up. I think the department I think would thank us for it as well if we can get time with them and maybe whether it was Director Hinton or someone else in that office maybe we could just get, you know, half of these eliminated or just lump them together in one easy accessible one, but, I mean, there is just too much going on here, but those are the only comments I have right now on the introduction of the budget. MR. ROGAN: Anything else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.

MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? I'd just like to echo what Councilman Evans mention ed, this is a perfect case study of reducing a tax rate but generating the same or more amount of revenue . I would certainly be in agreement if we wanted to look at taking that down another tenth or two-tenths of a percent since the economy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 continues to grow in our city and I definitely think it's something we should take a look at. MR. PERRY: Yeah, on the question , again, that was one of our very first things that we did as a council as far as reducing taxes was we kind of put our toe in the water of could we actually reduce this rate and still get the same amount of line item, and as Mr. Evans said we actually got more, so, you know, it's a good format to use for other things in the city. I would like a good hard discussion on lowering the wage tax by 10 percent , too, you know, just to get the ball moving because there is value in it and this is a system that works and, you know, I don't want to be a city that's going backwards or I don't want to be a city that's stagnant . We are in good financial footing right now and I think we need to open our doors and show people that we are a changed city and that we are actually moving forward with this, and if this is any indication of lowering taxes can produce more revenue then I think we need to take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 this philosophy and use it on other parts which I would like to be the wage tax. MR. EVANS: I couldn't agree more and I think if we can get, as Councilman Gaughan mentioned , some of the updated information as far as year-to-date between now and the time we meet with Mr. Bulzoni I think that will go a long way to solidifying our position as far as what the revenue truly is and how much we can, you know, move forward on some of these ideas.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE - AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 21, 2016 AN ORDINANCE ENTITLED “DEFINING AND AUTHORIZING TAX EXEMPTIONS FROM REAL PROPERTY TAX IN ORDER TO IMPROVE DETERIORATING REAL PROPERTY IN CERTAIN AREAS IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , ESTABLISHING AN EXEMPTION SCHEDULE AND PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING EXEMPTIONS , AND PROVIDING FOR NON-PERMISSIBLE EXEMPTIONS AND LIMITING AMENDMENT THERETO ” TO EXPAND THE ELIGIBLE AREAS, INCREASE THE DURATION OF EACH EXEMPTION , AND TO LIFT THE CAP ON EACH EXEMPTION . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-M be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. EVANS: On the question , I'm going to jump right into this, over two years ago we amended and drafted legislation to create a three-year tax abatement for new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 construction . We thought then it had the potential to create growth and spur development , it did not. It simply wasn't enough. So hopefully we will begin the process tonight of moving this legislation forward . Legislation that I would call, at least for the City of Scranton , old and dramatic . Legislation that is intended to change the way we do business . We want developers looking to build. We want investors looking for sound long-term investments . We want home builders and we want young families looking to build new homes and we want young professional s and empty nesters searching for condos and townhouses. We want everyone to fully understand because of this legislation that we are open for business . This legislation that will provide for a full ten-year tax abatement citywide, an abatement that we hope will provide incentives for growth in every corner of our city, in each and every neighborhood and, of course, in the downtown , and this is a tax abatement that is not watered down like many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 others with a graduated reduction in years six through ten, it is a full ten-year tax abatement on all taxable improvements . In addition , like the previous legislation , there is an abatement for new condos and townhouses a well as apartment to condominium conversion s and I that sector could explode because of this legislation . I think the opportunity for rapid and sustained growth is both real and ready to happen. In Bethlehem , a short distant down the turnpike, a similar LERTA created over 4,000 full-time jobs and is bringing in over $9 million in new tax revenue . In Philadelphia , because of their program , the tax base grew by 11 percent and the city is realizing an additional $48.1 million in annual real estate tax revenues from expired abatements . By 2026, they should be realizing another $169.4 million in annual real estate revenue , and because of their abatement home building in Philly has increase d by 367 percent . Our policy in the past as it relates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 to LERTA has always been to pick winners and losers based on individual projects . It's time for the entire city that they all get a chance at being winners. Finally , there is one thing that we all know to well, our assessed real estate valuations are flat or declining . That means there is no growth. Zero. Certainly the lack of reassessment impacts that, but we can't continue to wait for others to act or for lawsuit s to play out. We have to change those numbers . We have to be able and willing to invest in our future. We have to write a new ending to our story and hopefully maybe that just begins tonight . So that's all I have on this piece of legislation for now. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , there is no question that the city has financial problems and other problems over the last few years so in looking at this legislation , you know, I look at it one of two ways, you know, we can vote this down and then there is still no development or little development and we remain stuck it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 neutral with all of the issues that have been talked about here over the last five years or we can vote for this and expand our tax base hopefully and give the city a shot in the arm. I think that, you know, there has been a few people that have carried the city over the last few decades , our elderly , working class, and they have carried the burden by paying property taxes so by giving people a chance with this legislation I think that we can expand the tax base and we can pull everybody up hopefully , so I'll be voting for it. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Yeah, on the question , 2016 we did a similar LERTA for three years which really didn't move the needle for us and this 10-year letter what I think is -- other than extending it out for a ten-year period we are going to have, you know, in consortship with the chamber we are going to have the full support of the Scranton Chamber of Commerce helping us advertise and promote in. This is something that we didn't have last time with the three-year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 LERTA. As Mr. Evans said in caucus, this is something that kind of didn't leave the halls of city hall. If you didn't come here looking for it you really had a hard time finding it. That won't be the case this time. While I think we could have some success with this in the residential section , I'm really hoping for more of a commercial influx with this and I think that ten years is the way to go. It's not going to cost the city one penny and it's something that, you know, I can't wait to keep track of and watch and watch new development happen in the city. I'm really excited . MR. ROGAN: I would agree with the comments of my colleagues wholeheartedly . There are a couple more comments to add, obviously the focus on a LERTA is new development , business es, building new homes, but it also can be used by the average homeowner who already owns a home that maybe wanted to put an addition on or maybe wants to put a garage. Currently , if you put an addition on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 your home or a garage your tax bill will go up. Under the LERTA, your taxes will remain the same assessment for ten years before that additional mark hits so it's not only for strictly for new construction but it also does have an impact for those who have lived in the city for a long time. A lot of times people asks, "Well, how does it help everyone ?" And there is a number of reasons why it does, and my colleagues hit on this, we need growth in the City of Scranton . We finally have gotten past a number of financial hurdles and we are finally in a position where investors are beginning to look at the city once again. I want to thank the Scranton Chamber of commerce for coming in and giving this presentation to us. It's really opened our eyes that, you know, there is a great opportunity here in the City of Scranton . The idea of having a ten-year tax abatement complied with opportunities zones that were part of the Trump tax cuts really gives Scranton an unique opportunity to attract 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 businesses into our city. The opportunity zones are in the city but they are also outside of the city, I believe they go all the way up to Archbald , where the LERTA is Scranton specific and when you combine the two of them together that really is a great economic development tool for developers . I do want to issue a plea to the school board and to our county commissioners , although city council is going to support this legislation , the city cannot do it alone. We do need cooperation from the school board and from the county. When the three-year version of this passed I believe all three passing bodies passed it unanimously , we are hoping for the same, but without our school board and our county commissioners coming on board it really waters down what is a great tool, so in our caucus we can discuss sending a letter to the school board, and I know Councilman Donahue and Councilman Gaughan are going to have their shared services committee meeting where it will be discussed as well, so I do want to thank a sincere thank you to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 Chamber of Commerce , you know, getting that to us and something we wanted to act on quickly because this really will have huge results for the city.

EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I asked in the caucus if we can invite the HR, Human Resources Director , Daniel Kennedy , and labor counsel for the city, Ned Abrahamsen , into a caucus next week hopefully to discuss this legislation and 5-P as well, the Single Tax Office memorandum of understanding . I have several questions on 5-0. The first one is how was the panel of physicians arrived at. The second question I have is in the legislation number three, Part B, I want to pull that up really quickly , I'd like to know what the cost is to the city. Just give me one minute here. "The city and the pension board shall split the costs of the disability pension application process including , but not limited to, the fees of the examining physicians and the third party administrator at this time being Voc Rehab." So do we have an idea of how much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 this is going to cost the city on average ? Also, there is it a section in here that I don't understand , and I'll need clarification on, "Number five, sick time reimbursement . The city will restore to all employees who donate leave to Caroline Jansack all hours donated whether used or not. In addition , the donation of such leave, whether used or not, will not be held against employees for sick day bonus eligibility . In addition , Jansack will have her sick leave bank credited for all time used. The above is not intended to establish a precedent or practice between the parties ." So I'd like to be given a little background on what that is, why that was included , is this a violation of the workforce cost containment provisions located in our recover y plan. Also, and how much will this cost the city, if anything . Like, in other words, if an individual within the fire department who donated their leave was now at the end when they retire to cash that out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Number six, EMT/EMR paramedic nurse certification . I would like a copy of Section 8 of the second extension agreement that's noted in this documentation . It says, "Section 8 of the second extension agreement will be modified to provide that EMT/EMR paramedic nurse certification money shall be calculated and made part of the hourly wage effective January 1, 2019. For those who are already in the certification cycle, such payments will be paid under the current system but prorated as soon as it is practicable the city and the union shall meet to discuss revision of Section 8 of the second extension agreement ." So, again, I'd like clarification and background and why this was included , what the implications are for the 2019 budget, are they already baked in because they are going to be -- the certification monies are going to be made part of the hourly wage effective January 1, 2019.

ROGAN: On the question ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , Mr. Pocius, our city engineer , came to one of our caucuses months ago to discuss this legislation and at this time would have been upcoming that we would vote on. So the total project cost to replace the bridge over West Lackawanna Avenue that goes over the railroad , Elm Street bridge over the Lackawanna River, North Main Avenue bridge over Leggett 's Creek, and the Parker Street bridge over the Lackawanna River is going to cost $23,400. The state is going to pay 95 percent of the total cost so this is actually a really good deal for the city because , obviously , we would not be able to afford taking care of all of these deteriorating bridges . The city is required to provide the remaining 5 percent as a cost of $1,170,000. So the city is going to have the state assume all responsibility for the design and construction of this project . What I would like to know, and Mr. Pocius may have mentioned this months ago but I can't remember exactly what he said at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 time, I'd like to know when they think this might start. I think he said it was going to be -- we are a few years away from this even being a reality but I would like maybe there's an update on that. So, Mrs. Reed, if we can ask Mr. Pocius that question , and I'd also like to ask the business administrator and the administration if we are going to put up $1,170,000 are we starting to prepare for that. In other words, I think I read in the budget that there may be a fund balance next year or a surplus and I think I read also in the recovery plan that one of the recommendations was if we have a surplus to have a fund balance policy, which I don't think we have yet, so maybe we should start, you know, squirreling away this money now in preparation to pay this because it is very important . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 MR.
