MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Rogan. Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.Likeallof myfellowcouncilmen ,Iremainedfairly busy during ourAugust recess.Imetand corresponded morethanadozentimeswith various department headsondifferent issues thatcameupduring themonthaswellasour weekly PELmeetings heldincityhall. Iattended aScranton Parking Authority meeting andletmydissatisfaction beknownabouttheproposed rateincreases fortheparking garages ,forpreferred parking aswellastheincrease within the downtown merchants voucher program .Ioffer1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 suggestions toreduce wasteandincrease occupancy aswellasdiscussed opportunities formoreadditional onstreet parking inthe downtown ,amongotherthings.Ianticipate talksandonesthatwillcontinue withABM andNDC,butIfeelatthispointtheyare simply notunderstanding themessage myself andothers aretrying togetacross tothem. Ialsoattended aLackawanna County Commissioner 'smeeting toexpress my opposition inperson totheballot question onreassessment .Ireinforced myopinion againthattheideaofaballot question beingagainst thatIfeelisstillthe responsibility ofthecommissioners tomake thatdecision andI'magainst thequestion itself because itclearly worded insucha wayastopromote a"no"voteagainst reassessment .Ialsoofferedthesuggestion thattheypostpone theballot question until theSpring of2018intheprimary election toallowmoretimetoappropriately educate thepublic onwhatreassessment meansto them.Ofcourse,thatwasrejected aswell. WhileI'mdiscussing thetopicof1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 assessment ,I'mgoingtoveerslightly from myAugust recess report.Iwas communicating withtheBABulzoni today aboutthelatest assessment numbers forthe CityofScranton .Forthe2016budgets year,landassessment was$91,095,820. Improvements was$300,609,636.Forthe2017 budget,thevaluations are$90,609,077, improvements $300,027,585.Ourassessed valuations continue totrenddownwardevery year.Infact,thisyearit'sover$1 million inassessed valuethatwehavelost. Thiscertainty isanother indicator ofa needforreassessment aswellasan indicator ofanextraordinary amount ofthe property assessment appeals andacourse of environment thatsimply doesnotfoster growth.

Welcome back.Ihavealotstosaytonight sobuckleup.Ifirstjustwanttostart offbythanking Mr.Miller,asMr.Council President Wechsler didatthebeginning of themeeting ,whoserved 38yearswiththe Department ofPublicWorksandrecently passed away.Thirty-eightyearsinanyjob issignificant andIthinkit'snoteworthy, andthefactthatMr.Miller,whowasliked bymanypeople andwell-known,spent thirty-eightyearsofservice attheDPW speaks volumes somyprayers goouttohim1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 andhisfamily atthisdifficult time. Second thingthatIhavetomention isCouncil President Wechsler mentioned in thebeginning ofthemeeting FranDrake. FranDrakepassed awayrecently ,suddenly , sheworked incityhall,Iworked withFran forquitesometimeanditwasamajorloss notonlytoherfamily,allofherfriends andeverybody thatknewher.WhenIworked withFranintheOfficeoftheEconomic and Community Development shewasoneofthe firstpeople thatgreeted mewhenIstarted toworkforthatoffice.Shewasa genuinely niceperson,shehadagreatsense ofhumoranditwasashocktohearthat newsandshewilldefinitely bemissed and myprayers gotouttoFranandherfamily at thistime. Ialsowanttoextend myprayers ,as Ididinthebeginning ofthemeeting tonight ,tothosewhoareeffected by Hurricane Harvey andHurricane Irma.AsI mentioned inthebeginning ofthemeeting , themayorofArchbald isorganizing a Hurricane Harvey relief drivesoI'mgoing1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 tomakeaneffort tomakesurethattheCity ofScranton getsinvolved withthatand takessortoftheleadwithArchbald on that.Sohopefully wewillhavemore information nextweek. Ireadaninteresting article this morning thatAmazon,whoisthegiantonline retailer,theyemploy nearly 350,000people intheUnited States andtheylaunched a search forasecond headquarters inNorth America ,sotheywanttobuildasecond headquarters .Theirfirstheadquarters is outinSeattle ,Washington ,andtheyplanon employing upto50,000people withthe average salary beingaround $100,000.

ThereisanRFP.IreadtheRFPtoday,and Ireally dobelieve thattheCityof Scranton should betheleader onthisand should submit aproposal andshould submit a pitchtoAmazon.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Amazon isgoingtoputnearly a$5 billion investment intothecommunity which theychosetobuildthisheadquarters .Now, itmaybeapipedream,I'mnotsure,but theworstthingthattheycouldsayisno andIthinkthesecond effect thatitwill haveifwetaketheleadonthiswiththe Chamber ofCommerce ,thecounty,other individuals ,isthatitwillgivetheCity ofScranton goodpress,thatwearegoingto gooutandtellourstoryandwearegoing totrytogetamajorcorporation tocomein hereintoourcommunity andtoinvest inus ifweinvest inthem. WhenIreadthearticle Ithought whynottheCityofScranton ?Whynotus? WhenIlookacrosstheUnited States Isee thatmostofthejobsnowareinthe technology sector,soIthinkthisisa greatopportunity .Wehaveagreatlabor force,ourlocation isideal,twohoursfrom NewYorkCity,twohoursfromPhiladelphia , fourhoursfromBoston andWashington ,DC, soIthinkthatweneedtoaggressively pursue thisandIplanonmaking apitchto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 thepresident oftheChamber ofCommerce tomorrow andIwillupdate everybody next weekandhopefully theygetonboardwith thisbecause Ithinkweneedtopromote ourselves moretotheoutside world. Second point,andit'sanitem that'sonouragenda tonight istheLace Worksproject .Onouragenda,wearesimply correcting atypographical error,butitis relevant because during theAugust recess I haveheardfromnumerous residents inthe areaoftheLaceWorksbuilding whoare seriously concerned abouttheproperty ,the maintenance oftheproperty ,thegrass, broken windows inthebuilding ,andoneof thebiggest concerns isaccess tothe building .Thebuildings arepretty much wideopen. And,coincidentally ,inthe newspaper thismorning therewasanarticle aboutthreeteenage rsthatwerecaught in oneofthebuildings oftheScranton Lace factory withgasoline andotherthings and itlooked liketheyweregoingtocommit arson,soIthinktheneighbors havea1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 serious issuehereandalegitimate one.I wanttothankthePoliceDepartment because whenwebrought thistoChiefGraziano 's attention ,Mrs.ReedandI,theywerevery quicktouppatrols inthatareaandthey didstarttocatchvandalsandotherissues. Myconcern isthatthedevelopers andtheowners oftheproperty really should beproviding security atthatproperty , whether itbemorefencing around the perimeter orIthink24/7security because wearewasting ourresources continually goinginthereandcatching people andthe neighbors arecontinuously concerned ,sowe diddiscuss itincaucus.Wearegoingto askthedevelopers toprovide ,number one, anupdate onwherewearesincewedidgive ataxabatement afewmonths ago,andnumber two,wearegoingtoinquire aboutwhatthey planondoingwithsecurity andmaintenance oftheproperty ,andI'mgoingtomakethe suggestion thattheyeither hiresecurity or dosomething because something hastobe done. TheCivilWarMuseum inthebasement1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 ofcityhall,wediscussed thatincaucus,I brought inupnumerous time.Iamconcerned thattheCivilWarMuseum isgoingtobe askedtoleavethebasement ofthecityhall because apparently themayorislooking for morestorage space.Ihaveaspoken to several member ofthemuseum,whichis located inthebasement ,asImentioned , theirleaseisupthisNovember andIwould liketoseeifwecouldrenewthatlease, whether itbefiveyearsortenyears.It wasaten-yearleasestarting backin2007 forthesimple factthatIthinkit'sunique thatwehaveaCivilWarMuseum withthose typeofartifacts inourbuilding andI thinkweshould domorenopromote that. Wealsodiscussed NayAugPark, received afewcomplaints aboutparking concerns .Someoftheparking lotsare beingusedbyemployees ofthehospital so weweregoingtotakealookatthatissue, sowewillfollow-uponthatnextweek. Councilman Wechsler informed us,and Ihavebeenasking aboutthisforquitesome time,thatwehaveapublic caucus withNDC1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 andABMsoCouncilman Wechsler informed us thatheisworking onsetting thatmeeting up.Obviously therearequestions andthere areconcerns andIthinkthatwedoneedan update onnotonlyanyprogress thathas beenmade,butwherewearegoinginthe future,especially in2018. Ireceived afewcomplaints about signage issues onParker Streetsoforwarded themtotheLicensing andInspection Department andtheChiefofPolice.There wasamajorissuewithablocked stormdrain inthecorner ofthe600blockofMcDonough AvenueintheMinooka section .Thestorm drainisfilling withwaterbecause it blocked andthewateriscausing deterioration totheneighbor 'sproperty ,so wearewaiting forananswer andsomeaction onthatandwe'llfollow-upnextweek. Asforthewhatwasinthepaper whenwewereonrecess aboutthepossible -- themayorwantstodoapossible studyon replacing thestreet signsthroughout the city.Itendtodisagree onthispointwith themayor.Idonotthinkthatweneeda1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 studytodetermine howtobestreplacethe fadedstreets signsandstopsigns throughout thecity.Wemaylookfora grantormoneytodothat,butIdon'tthink weneedastudytoknowhowtodoit.We currently haveIthinkit'soneemployee who knowshowtomakethesignsanddoallof thatkindofstuff.Iknowthatthesign department andDPWhasbeendecimated over theyears,butIdoreally believe ifwe makeitapriority ,ifwemaybeputsome casual employees onthattaskwiththe gentlemen thatisinthatdepartment Ithink thatwecangoneighborhood byneighborhood starting withwherethesignsarefadedthe worstandthenworkourwayup,soIdon't thinkthatweneedtowaitforastudy,that willtaketoolongandthewoman,sheisnot heretonight ,theresident whoisfromthe HillSection ,obviously thatisoneofthe worstareasforeither nostreet signsor fadedstreet signs. Well,afteraboutsixorseven months wearestilltalking aboutthesale oftheScranton SewerAuthority ,andIhave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 tobehonest,itisalmost unimaginable at thispointthatI'msitting upheretonight andwearestilltalking aboutit,itis stillbeingbrought up.Ithinkthatthere isstillablackcloud,thereisstill unanswered questions thatarehanging over thisdeal,andafterreading someofthe newsdevelopments inthenewspaper whilewe areonrecess overthepastmonthit's pretty cleartomethatthesaleofthe SewerAuthority itseemed likeonebigparty except wewerenotinvited toit.The ratepayers andthetaxpayers weren't invited . Wereceived information today,andI didnothaveachance toreview it, Councilman EvansandIhavebeenasking for months nowforinformation related tomoney thatwasspentduring thetimeofthesale andMr.Shrive didsendusaletter andI justwanttoreadwhathewrotehere briefly . "Inresponse toyourrequest for information withregard tothecapital spending oftheScranton SewerAuthority1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 priortothecloseoftheassetsale transaction andit'srelation tomandated projects undertheconsent decree andbylaw theNutrient Reduction projects ,Iprovide theenclosed analysis .Thisanalysis was complied baseduponreview ofalargeamount ofdataregarding thelong-termcontrol plan projects andtheScranton SewerAuthority spending associated withthesame.Iwas assisted withthereview ofthisdataand preparation ofthisanalysis byHJ Strategies ,whichisHenryAmoroso ." Soit'squiteafewpagesit'sa largedocument IwanttothankAttorney Shrive forgetting this,finally getting thisinformation aftermanymonths andIdo planonreviewing that.Oneofthethings thatisconcerning istheamount ofthetime thatittooktogetthisinformation .We werestonewalled forquitesometimeand thatisveryconcerning . Iwouldlikeanupdate inwriting , aswasmentioned heretonight fromoneof thespeakers ,fromtheAttorney General 's Officeonthestatus oftheirpotential1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 review oftheScranton SewerAuthority deal. Thelastthatcouncil heard,asCouncilman Wechsler mentioned ,wasthattheyforwarded ourrequest totheBureau ofConsumer Protection .Now,asthenewspaper reported recently ,theDeputyAttorney General in charge oftheBureau ofConsumer Protection intheScranton Office isThomas P. Cummings ,III,whoisthesonofTom Cummings ,theDunmore solicitor ,who apparently ,according toScranton Times' article sslaved overtheScranton Sewer Authority dealeverydaybutChristmas .I really couldn'tmakethisthingupifI tried.Icouldn'tevendreamitupifI tried. TomCummings ,theDunmore solicitor , saidrecently inaTimesarticle thathewas looking through hiscalendar andthesingle dayin2016thathewasnotactively involved inreading documents viae-mailand responding tosituations related tothe Scranton SewerAuthority dealwasliterally Christmas Day.Thosearehisactual words. Iwouldliketorequest acopyofthat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 calendar andIbelieve weareentitled to thatinformation because thetaxpayers and ratepayers ofScranton picked up80percent ofMr.Cummings $200,000inlegalbills. Mr.Cummings wouldalsonotcomment aboutwhether hewouldproduce itemized bills.Whatasurprise .WhenImentioned thisinformation andspeakers bringitupI oftenthinkisanywonder whypeople inthis region,whypeople inthiscityorso apathetic towards theirgovernment . Iwouldalsolikeanupdate, Mrs.Reed,ifwecould,ontheScranton SewerAuthority 'sinsurance policy andmy basicquestion isdotheyhaveone?Ina July31letter theSewerAuthority 'sinsurer pulled it'scoverage because thesale appears toviolate thePennsylvania Municipal Authorities Actwhichapparently forbids suchatransaction ,amongmanyother things,soIhaveafewquestions forMayor Courtright andAttorney Shrive. Number one,whywastherealackof clearly communicated underwriting information onthepartoftheAuthority1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 whichresulted inconfusion astowhatwas soldandwhatwasretained pertaining tothe stormwaterlines. Number two,I'dlikeanupdate on thestatus oftheeasements .IntheJuly31 letter theinsurer wasapparently unaware of easement issues.Mysecond question ishow couldthatbe. And,finally ,theinsurer wasnot paidinsevenmonths sincethepolicy was issued,whywasthis?Andfinally ,asI mentioned ,doestheAuthority haveinsurance andifitdoesn'thaveinsurance whateffect doesthathaveontheSewerAuthority ? Isentaletter inJulytothemayor withspecific questions astowhythe Authority wasneverdissolved .Noanswer, nosurprise .If,infact,therewasa violation oftheMunicipal Authorities Act, whichisnowplaying outapparently inthe courtroom ,whathappens ifwehavetopay thatmoneyback?Idon'tknow,that'swhy I'masking.Ihavealsoaskedforanupdate onthetrustfortheSewerAuthority money thatisitsupposed tobeputintothe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 pensions .Thatseemstobedragging ,Iknow it'sbecause ofthe--apparently because of thethirdpartyadministrator ,butIwould likeanupdate inwriting . I'malsostillawaiting aresponse fromthecitycontrol leronwhether ornot thecityviolated theAdministrative Codeby arbitrarily hiring NedAbrahamsen without a contractfor$200,000asspecial council to theSewerAuthority dealand$200,000for theParking Authority deal.So,Mrs.Reed, Iwouldlikeustosendanother update. Mrs.Novembrino wasquotedinthepaperI believe itwasinJulysaying thatshewas goingtolookintothat,shewasn'tsure,so Iwouldlikeananswer onthat. I'dliketosendanother letter urging theScranton SewerAuthority boardto reconsider theirstance ondenying allowing theAuditor General theability tocomein andexaminetheScranton SewerAuthority deal.Nomatter whereIgopeople talk aboutthisdealandwhytheAuditor General wasnotallowed tocomeinbythisboard, theScranton SewerAuthority board,soI1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 thinkitisincumbent uponthemtobring thatupagainandputthistobedonceand forall. Finally ,whatreally astonishes me and,again,Isaythis,Icouldn'tmakethis upifItried,istheresponse orlack thereof fromthemayorofthiscity,Bill Courtright .MayorCourtright wasactually quoted inthenewspaper recently assaying, "Ihavetotrustthelawyers .Ihaveto trustthelawyers ." Well,ifthatwerethecase,if that'sthecase,thenthatisthemost horrifying statement Ihaveheardinalong timecoming fromanelected official inthis city.Ifthat'sthecasethatwehaveto trustthelawyers thenIthinkweareina lotoftrouble .Whoisrunning thiscityis myquestion ?Ihavebeenasking thisfora longtime.Isitthemayororisithis armyofpolitically connected lawyers ?I thinkitremains tobeseen.Thankyou. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr. Gaughan .Really justtosummarize whatwas justsaid,wehavebeenasking these1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 questions allalongandIagreethatthe errorwasmadewhentheSewerAuthority did notrequest thattheAuditor General come in.You'veseenthatmadeourrequest ,the Attorney General hasforwarded ittothe Consumer Protection Board,I'mnotsurewhat really isgoingtocomeoutofthat,butI alsorecommend thattheSewerAuthority reconsider their"no"voteandletthe Auditor General comein.Thatistrulythe onlywaythatwearegoingtogetintothis because ,aswasstated,wearegetting questions andanswers andanswers ,but--we aregetting answers butnowhereisthis beingallputtogether tocometoany resolution .Rightnow,I'mnotsurewhat recourse isgoingtobeavailable touswhen theseanswers comein.I'mnotseeing a recourse anywhere togetapositive conclusion tothissale.Theonlything thatIcansaypositive fromthesaleisthe amount ofthelong-termdebtthatwe retired .Thereisnoargument withthat, thathasbeendone.InJanuary ,whenthe newbudget goesintoplaceit'sgoingto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 considerably impacted inapositive wayby theamount ofdebtthathasbeenreduced ,so thereisnodenying that.Wehavealotof questions aboutwhathappened andwhat didn'thappen,thereisnodenying atthis pointtheSewerAuthority salehada positive impossibility onthecity'sbudget. Thediscrepancy between the$140 million thatwaspartoftheconsent decree andtheSewerAuthority andthewater company tookitoverisitdownto$105 million ?Onceagain,that'supfor conjecture .Itdoesnotrelieve thefact thatthat$140million original billwas goingtohavetobepaidbytheratepayers . Thereisno--Ican'tdenyit.Thereisno question aboutthatsosomewhere alongthe linethatbillisgoingtohavetobepaid. Iknowformyself,I'mleaving council comeJanuary andIwouldrecommend thatwegettoapointwheretrytogetall oftheseanswers doneandputthisportion ofthishistory ofthecitybehind us.

Thereisno--wearelooking atandhearing wecan'traisetaxesanymore ,wecan't really cutservices muchanymore ,theonly waythatwecouldsurvive wastousethe moneythatwehadtopayofflong-termdebt andreducethatpartofourbudget item. Thequestion regarding theconsent decree amount aretherateincreases that areguaranteed ,nowthat'sthequestion , rateincreases thathavebeenguaranteed , that'sgoingtoimpact that,thatwasn'tas goodasdealasitwasdescribed tousas. Onlytimewilltellwiththat,butlogically Ican'tseehowthesaleoftheSewer Authority canbelooked atassomething that should nothavehappened.Should ithave happened inadifferent way?Maybe.But theproblem forcitycouncil iswearehere everyThursday answering questions .The mayorisnotexposed tothesequestions ,the SewerAuthority isnotexposed tothese questions ,citycouncil isexposedtothese questions andwehavebeentrying togetthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 answers forthis,andwegetthemlittle by little bylittle,buthopefully atsome pointwecangetanswers andwrapthisup, butIdon'tseehowthereisgoingtobea resolution thatthepeople ofthecityare goingtobehappywith.Thereisnomoney, Idon'tseeanymoneybeingreturned bythe lawyers ,Idon'tseeanymoneybeing returned tothecitybythewatercompany .
