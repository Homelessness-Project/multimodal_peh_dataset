CORRESPONDENCE SENT TO SOLICITOR TO THE LACKAWANNA COUNTY SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY DATED JULY 17, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I want to make an announcement -- or a comment on a Third Order item. When I was taking a look at the non-uniform pension meeting as well as the Composite Pension Board, there were several employees who no longer work for the City. I know when we first discussed the furlough s that was in the -- I'd say mid to early April. And we had a review on the 21st of April for 43 employees . But some of those employees there -- one was dated 5/20 and another one was dated July 1st. Are they additional furloughs ? Do we know? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know because Council doesn't, you know, really get into the, you know, into employee matters . But that's something that we can inquire from the administration if you'd like. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd like to send some correspondence there regarding those employees . And also, there was a question that came up at the Composite Pension Board meeting by Mr. Kennedy. And what it stated was they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 were going to project out to 2021. And they were looking from the HR Department whether there were going to be additional furloughs , layoffs , or staffing adjustment s. I'm not sure if we received that information . But can we inquire about those additional position s that I stated beforehand and possibly that information if it's been sent to him? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I think a week or two ago I inquired with the administration . And we sent something about an updated list of which employees had gone back and which employees were still furloughed . I believe most of them have been called back. But there are still a handful of employees that have been furloughed . But we did not receive that list yet. But we could have Mrs. Reed follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : And I did ask Mrs. Reed for -- to pass along and, you know, to request an update on that I believe last Wednesday too so, you know, we had asked. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 thing was, we also requested some information on the Act 47, including a list of services , update on the LST. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, that would be in Fifth Order. We're still in Third Order. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : You're welcome . Anybody else on the Third Order items? Okay. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. Wednesday , July 29th, 2020, 2:30 to 5:30 at Scranton High, 63 Munchak Way, the Friends of the Poor, Family to Family and Weinberg Food Bank will be having another COVID-19 Emergency Drive Through Food Giveaway. All attendees must remain in their vehicle . Food will be placed directly in the vehicle . Of course, it's open to the public. Zip code and number of children , adults, elderly in household is required . On top of this, I just want to say I have been announcing these almost every week. And it's amazing that these three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 organizations what they've done through , you know, through the pandemic , not only in our city but surrounding boroughs . I just think it's fantastic . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Anyone else have any announcement s? MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to remind people once again to -- if they haven't done so already to fill out your census questionnaires . You know, by not doing that, that puts a lot of federal money at risk. So not only should you do it, you know, spread the word to all your friends and family that they also need to fill out their census as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Anybody else have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'd just like to add -- I just want to offer my condolences to the Caviston family who lost Lexi Caviston Ashmore last week. I believe she was 23 years old and passed away of glioblastoma multiforme which is brain cancer. And she had courageously fought the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 disease for I think almost three years. She had five surgeries . In that time she graduated nursing school I think cum laude. And then she also recently got married to Joshua Ashmore . So her father, Mr. Caviston , he was a former police officer too for Scranton . They're a well-known Scranton family. They've held a lot of fundraisers for her over the years. So I just wanted to make the announcement of her passing . And I believe there are still fundraisers set up to pay off medical bills as well as to just be able to donate to research and funding for glioblastoma . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much, Dr. Rothchild . Any other announcements ? I have three. Mary Mother of God Parish at Holy Rosary Church in North Scranton will be having a drive through block party Friday, July 31st and Saturday , August 1st from four to eight p.m., both nights.

DONAHUE : On the question , I will answer what questions I can in Fifth Order. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Anyone else on the question ? The question s that we have been getting I've been going through all of them as I know everyone else has. And I have sent those into the administration . Many of the questions have been answered and have been communicated to those individuals who have asked them. I know that the Mayor has a -- and her Chief of Staff had a running list of the question s and answers and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the back and forth.

MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (Public Comment , the following are letters or e-mails submitted for public comment .) (Beth Holman) City Council ; Does East Mountain still belong to the city of Scranton ????????????? Our taxes are sky high yet we get almost nothing in return. Since the start of blasting fireworks our area has been under a cloud that finally lifted up on 6 July. July 4th we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 because of asthma could not leave our homes - the cloud of smoke was terrible . The racket from the blasts was even worse. Yet we never saw a police car. You have to watch traveling East Mountain road. The brush on one side is scratching cars, the other side has cars parked at all angles and cars speeding up and down the road not always in the correct lane is frightful . Add to the ignoring of stop signs especially the ones by the firehouse where you also have to avoid people not using the sidewalk for walking . Then travel past an over grown mountain lake road to the other side People walking , cars speeding - sides of mountain lake road crumbling , holes on the road. And guess what here it is the middle of July and no street cleaner has ever come our way. No police supervision on the mountain against the ATV riders - last night at 11 Pm they were racing. Who cares? Just collect our taxes and ignore us. I am so disgusted . My family and I need to make choices 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 before next spring - we may just have to move. Paying what we pay is not not what we want. Beth Holman (Joseph Healey) Good evening Council , I hope you are all doing as well as you can during these trying times. As a devout Catholic , it pains me to have to say this, but I feel that the health of our citizens is more important . If the Church Herself was not wise, or considered enough to cancel the St. Ann's Novena this year, why did the city not intervene or at least apply pressure for them to do so??? At the very least...an opportunity for residents of the west side to make their concerns that would directly affect their health and safety should have been considered . If it wasn't shocking enough to learn that a Basilica that has ALL of the infrastructure already in place to have their services safely broadcast on television like they have for years was not going to utilize 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 those resources , it was even more mind blowing to learn that an event that is famous for being held outdoors would now be moved INDOORS as an attempt at precaution even though it is widely accepted in the global scientific community that the virus is spread more rapidly indoors through air conditioning and fans than outdoors !!! This is a plague we are in the middle of. If our public officials do not take it seriously , then entire communities will be doomed by their inaction . It is my understanding that for whatever nonsensical , and certainly non scientific reasons that religious services are somehow exempt from the guidelines , but for anyone who lives here knows...the Novena isn't just a "religious service " it is a 10 day event drawing crowds from morning till night and should have been treated as such. There are still pleanty of people attending outdoors in groups as well as indoors and my fear is that in two weeks after the Novena has ended, we will be the next hot spot as a result of such foolish inaction to put a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 stop to it. I am both mortified at my own religion and disappointed in my own government who together were unwilling to make any sacrifices , or take any stands for the safety of all our citizens . My family and I will not be missing the Novena this year because for Good St. Ann to hear our prayers during these exceptional times, we need nothing more than a Novena card, and a willing heart, and for this years intention I will beg St. Ann to prove me wrong. Thank you for your consideration , and please stay safe and well, Joe Healey St. Ann's St. West Scranton (Marie Schumacher ) INPUT FOR FOURTH ORDER OF 21 JULY 2010 SCRANTON CITY COUNCIL MEETING O I hope each of you has read the article in yesterday 's Times-Tribune entitled 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 "Police contracts can affect accountability ." In case you missed it I will forward a copy to Lori for distribution to each of you as the public safety labor contracts will be negotiated in the coming months. We need transparency and we do not need public policy issues included in labor contracts . Another unanswered question I believe to be important is a study of the Fire Department since the Harrison Avenue Bridge has been replaced allowing Fire Trucks usage. We should know this before the contract is negotiated . While on this subject , what is the current status of our (former?) Firefighter with the three DUIs and a serious traffic accident with a police report showing he did not live in Scranton ? O What is the Status of the 2019 Audit of the City and when will it be delivered . Speaking of delivery dates, I hope we have learned the importance of specifying delivery dates with the HRG contract which was based on the date of a Meeting with the City the date of which you have neglected to provide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to this taxpayer . O Has a Policy Statement been approved on the utilization of City Gas Cards and, if so, could you put it in Third Order next week? O Why has the lists of City roads both those paid for with Federal HUD dollars and those paid with Liquid Fuels and other City operating funds not been made available ? When will this information be made public? O Trying to put in the commingled trash incident in perspective one needs to know the tonnage we have delivered to the Recycling Center in recent years passed. Please share this information with the tax and fee payers. O Again, something I have brought up in the recent past which is open positions in the City. While the Main City Website contains everything but the kitchen sink and open positions which are currently placed on the HR site. Also, how many times have the paid positions been advertised ? Last time the Fire Chief position was open there were at least four quarter -page ads for a Fire Department 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Supervisor and now nothing . The HR page also includes quite a number of presumably unpaid internships which apparently go unfulfilled . O Now, on to Agenda items: 5C There is a letter of interest in the backup but not resume. I do not know the man but it would be nice to know why he believes he is qualified as he didn't even state his busines which may or may not be relevent to the appointment he seeks. Also, it might be nice if positions available for appointment were made available for everyone to see. 5E Why did the $25,438 improvements to the Serrenti Building not come before Council ? Is it not over the threshold ? Also, why are you not providing the grant revenue and expenses for the Serrenti Building ? 5F A Municipal Department of Health? Really? Please provide the number of restaurants that have been inspected by the City's health inspector (s) since the restaurants were allowed to open for business other than take out and the number inspected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 during the take-out-only phase of the restaurant 's business . That, my friends , is where the rubber meets the road as I am guessing little has been done. And, while I'm venting a tad, please tell us which positions previously furloughed will not be filled. Also, where has the Quality of Life person been these last few months? Never, have I seen so many unkempt yards with knee/thigh high grass or filled with Queen Anne's Lace or other weeds. Ditto for vehicles parked right up to the corner (think Gibson and Harrison , for one) and other infractions . How much revenue has the Police Department brought in this year-to-date in compliance with the agreement made in 2015? Back to 5F I do believe this Body has sufficient challenges to deal with before looking for more intrusions into constituents lives. Geisinger as a directed program for the area. PLEASE do your job of balancing the City's budget without increased exodus from the CIty.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Think how many side groups this body has set up that meet once and nothing comes of it. When was the last time we heard from the Shared Service Committee for instance . 5F is not needed. (Fay Franus) Council , Well to be quite honest with you--I saw Marie's questions and comments to you and I personally and I am sure many other people in this city would love to know the answers to all of her questions and comments from all of you about everything she said versus replying to her via e-mail. May i ask when will city hall be open so people can come in and question you in person. I can't come unfortunately for me--not you, but I sure would love to see Marie stand there and ask her questions . I say this because her questions are very important . God knows you can't say you didn't think about some of these thongs because she has been very clear on addressing many issues.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I as you know go at some of her questions in a different manner--for instance why do you hire people who are suppose to do an audit on time and then we wait forever -- guess what these people should never have that job again. They get paid a lot to have this audit ON TIME> How many times has the question been asked by Marie and Joan H. --Is the Audit ready? They need to do their job-- and have it done on time. PERIOD! Now you have a chance to do the right proper correct thing in dealing with the police contract -- meaning the city- you surely have a say -- NO UNION CONTRACT SHOULD SHIELD POLICE MISCONDUCT . They are NOT above the law--if I did something wrong DUI etc-- my name would be in the paper -- a policeman 's/woman's name should also be in the paper along with any misconduct --Whatever applies to a public citizen should ALSO apply to a police officer --maybe more so since we trust them to defend us. Also their pay-- come on you know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the unions in this city have caused major tax increases -- ENOUGH! We all suffer but God knows police and fire are well taken care of--why? You know why-- so all you politicians can get their votes and their families votes-- that is a huge voting block. Why do you think Courtright gave them everything they wanted and more. You must do something to lower our taxes-- we need a break -- come on now-- what about those raises I mentioned last week that Mayor Evans gave out-- unnecessarily --why do those people still have those raises. Couldn't Jessica -the lawyer for the city live nicely on the pay she made before her $12,00 raise to help another department out during her 8 hour work day/ Pure greed. The people in this city need to SEE you taking steps for them!! Them--not friends THEM. Salaries ned to be CHOPPED now! Now I'll go but first Mr. McAndrew you want to put teeth in the ATV resolution -- what a joke and you went on to say how ATVs should be fair for everyone and go after the bad drivers -- hold on here. ATVs should NEVER 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 EVER EVER EVER EVER be allowed to be licensed and insured to ride on the streets of this city. This is what you implied . Only the state can do that so why do you even throw that out there-- and before you say "I never said that" yes you did-- watch last weeks meeting . No one in this city wants ATVs on their streets roaring back and forth causing tremendous danger and extreme sounds. Yes I know the drivers of ATVs want them on the road. I am speaking of 99% of this city who have had to deal with these crazies . Also what is to stop a person from filling up many cans of gas for their ATVs once they get home--the police need to seriously stop these drivers . That is how you put teeth in this --get laws enforced . If I were speeding down a street I'm pretty sure a police officer would come after me-- so why not an ATV. Have them radio ahead and head them off. I was simply shocked when you said they should be licenses and insured - all of the kids in town would have block parties in your name every week!1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 One more thing-- still no yellow tape at Gas Station on Railroad and Luzerne -- so much for owner saying he would do it on Monday today 8 more cars there-- I certainly appreciate Mayor Cognetti 's attention on this matter. If only Tom Oleski felt the same way. Is he on vacation ? Hmmmmm Oh and his phone must be broken --check that too. Fay Franus (Joseph Healey) Greetings members of City Council I will start off on the offensive tone.. How dare you bunch of complete and utter bastards ... Now to reason, As a kid I lived fireworks , we all as a collective group complained at how the adults restricted the use and ruined festive events making small neighborhood displays illegal . They still happened and we enjoyed what we had. From that child who always wanted to see fireworks and have them available , to an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 adult who respects what I felt as a kid, I have to say.. this is exactly opposite of what I would have ever asked for. There were businesses that also made rules and picked on kids, those businesses later failed and faded away as the kids do grow up and they remembered how offensive they were. Children are our future and you are choosing to take more away from them, choosing to make yet another reason they want to leave the area, because you are trying to restrict what little fun this area now presents . For restrictions , I do believe some are in order and some should be exceptions . First I would exclude non-sound producing and carve out the new category of low sound fireworks now produced . They are good for kids who have issues with loud noises and pets. Second I would agree a time restriction should be put in place bu instead of copy paste the states guidelines it should be not until 9pm, but should end mo later then 1 or 1.5 hours after sunset. Third I would allow exceptions for events with notice. And I am not talking about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 the massive commercial insurance and absurd fees, but the allowance approved exceptions based on requests . Weddings , maybe funerals if someone requested it, birthdays , as long as a procedure for use was submitted prior. And as for holidays , I believe that a carveout of for specific dates should be made, not just to allow them but up until specific hours without asking for an exception . 4th of July weekend no later than 11 PM. New Years no later then 12:30 AM on the 1st of the year. Fireworks should be allowed at all times and should be under the exceptions are.. Permitted : Sparklers , toy pistols , or other devices in which paper caps are used which contain .25 grains or less of explosive compound , and are constructed so the hand cannot come into contact with the cap when in place for the explosion . Also permitted are toy cannons which operate on the principle of mixing calcium carbide , weighting less that 1/10th ounce and water in the reservoir of the cannon, and in which ignition results upon the creation of a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 spark. Any Smoke producing Item and the category of fireworks listed as Silent fireworks /noiseless fireworks . I also believe that firecrackers should be allowed with parental permission or someone over 21 supervising . Though they do produce reduced noise they are effective for small groups and use with music accompaniment . For large displays they are not practical . Cities have adopted them due to pets, PTSD, and younger kids who are trying to sleep. So Again I dislike the legislation on face value but the 365 a year use of them can be annoying , I understand that and would have as a kid. I believe the 9pm when in summer the Sun sets later makes the cutoff unreasonable so based on how long after sunset controls the time in summer and winter. Last we have had a recent death due to fireworks , and I do not have details on that, but the injury rate for fireworks in 2018 is 2.8 per 100,000 individuals in the United States. In 2028 all 5 non occupational 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 fatalities were a result of reloadable Ariel devices and all died from direct impact. (Per the Consumer Product Safety Comission ). Though a death is sad, we can't make rules based on the exception and should balance them with reasonable research . (End of Public Comment ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : So, yeah, I was going to make a motion. On two separate dates I asked for some information regarding costs associated with the emergency declaration . The answers I was given at that point in time was that nothing had been spent or there had been no costs at that time. But this morning in the newspaper in light of that article , it seems that some money has been spent. I'd like to make a motion to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 request that possibly the business administration send us the costs the City has spent associated with our response to the COVID emergency and future costs that have been identified . Also, there was some IT purchases made. I know it was discussed at a Shared Services Committee that some of those purchases could have been made in conjunction with the Scranton School District maybe for some cost savings . So if that could be answered if that was discussed or purchased together . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. There's a -- Councilman Schuster made a motion. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm going to vote for the motion. The only thing I would say though is that I think in the backup to 5-E -- I'm looking at it right now where the City is going to ask for money from the county, I think they listed everything that's been purchased so far in terms of for the pandemic . And I think they listed future 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 costs. Now maybe there is -- are things that were not listed on here. But I do think that -- seems to me that mostly everything is itemized here on that list in the backup. MR. DONAHUE : I guess we could just add if there is anything that maybe didn't qualify for reimbursement that was spent, you know, that wouldn't be included in this list if there was any additional information . MR. GAUGHAN : Um hum. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of Councilman Schuster 's motion signify by saying. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Do you have anything else, Councilman Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : I just made an inquiry to Solicitor Hayes and to Lori about the Department of Health item that we had on the agenda tonight , any history of Department of Health we had in the past, maybe possible expected budgets of that department . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 I think that's something that once this goes through it will be found in the exploration of that department . That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comment at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. So between last meeting and this week, a concerned -- a concern from a citizen was first brought to me in May which I actually presented at a meeting . It's the rear garage of 324 Crown Avenue which was operating illegally as an auto repair garage. So in between first initial complaint until last week or I know that in May a certified letter was sent May 12th to the owner of the garage to immediately stop work. The letter also stated that this will be the only letter you'll receive . Your next communication from us will be inform -- the formal enforcement action. Okay. So that was May. The concerned citizen brought this to me last week. It wasn't necessarily a public comment sent to all us, but it was just sent to me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 individually . But it's a public comment . So but, you know, and I reached out to Mrs. Reed. And this is her second complaint . I do know that Mrs. Reed did send correspondence to the LIPS Department because they wanted to clarify the address . So that occurred between last week and this week. So this is the third auto -- I'd like an update, please, for this for myself and this concerned citizen , Mrs. Reed, if we can just follow up with that, please. Thank you. But it's weird this is the third auto chop shop type of activity that has been brought to my attention personally and in the past -- I don't know, maybe three months. And it's not just in one part of the City. I mean, it's at least three different parts of the City this is occurring . And it seems like when the coast is clear, I know that the police have gone and investigated it. And ironically enough, one of them which is over here near me has all these ATVs flying out of it too. So but I realized -- what I'm realizing is they go. They investigate . And when the coast is clear, this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 brazen activity picks up again. So these are three garages that I'm sure have leases or some type of agreement . But this is continu ing. I know some are up in North Scranton . There was one in West Side and this one on Crown. So I don't know. I'm just throwing it out there. I'd like some followup or feedback with regards to this. Thank you. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I have a bunch so bear with me. I just want to thank Scranton Tomorrow for coming into our caucus. I appreciate d the updates that they provided us with and the work that they've done over the past few months. And I look forward to seeing the progression of the Pocket Park and the completion of that. And I'd also like to thank Mr. Deeley for coming into our caucus. And he explained as to what they're doing to address blight within the City and the different processes that they have in LIPS now to help 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 address those issues. And I know that LIPS recently received some of their staff back. And they're getting up and running again. And so some of our concerns that we brought previously to them have been getting address ed. But I think there are some too that have fallen on the backburner. So I asked Lori Reed this week to present additional correspondence s and reminders to them about a couple of issues and there's some other things that I just wanted to update people on just so that they're aware that it's something we are working on and continuing to ask about. So I did have a gentleman ask me about the railroad tracks on Washington Avenue that are crossing over in South Side. Those have been in disrepair for quite a long time now. And so it's difficult to drive over that section . And that's something that we sent over to DPW a couple times that we're waiting response on to see if that will be taken care of and when. I also sent something to DPW regarding Lackawanna Avenue which is a little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 complicated because part of it is City owned and another section of it is state owned. And there's an issue with there aren't, like, lines separating lanes. So it needs some line painting . And also some of the traffic stops it's difficult to tell the different directions of the lanes. So there needs to be some lane marking and line painting coming up related to Lackawanna Avenue just to make it safer for drivers . And along the lines of Lackawanna Avenue, the U.S. Post Office has an office there. And I received a complaint from one of the workers of the USPS who was having issue with their parking . They have, like, a spot designated for the postal workers because they have the truck come in certain times of the day. I think it was at least four times during the day to pick up the mail. And they often find that other vehicles are parked in that spot. And they have to double park. And it's just been difficult for them to do their jobs as a result of that. So that was something that was first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 forwarded to the Scranton Police Department . And then from there it was brought to the Law Department . And so Joe O'Brien was working on it. But we haven't seen -- there's suppose d to be an ordinance coming to us for it. But we haven't received that yet. So now because we only have one more meeting before our break, I'm hoping we can get that on the agenda for our first meeting in September in order to get that issue resolved . And then something else that I sent over to the Licensing and Inspections Department . I had mentioned a few weeks back a complaint I received about a complaint on the 700 block on Harrison Avenue. There is just an overgrown area that's going onto the sidewalk. It's an empty vacant lot. And it's become problematic and a safety issue because pedestrians -- it's so blocked that instead of using the sidewalk , they're are crossing the street outside the pedestrian crosswalks . And so it's become a hazard in that way. So that's something that I reminded them of. And there are actually -- there's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 lot of issues on Harrison Avenue. That's in my neighborhood . That's a street that I drive up and down several times a day. So I have often taken note of the problems there. So I actually sent them a long list of the few things that I'm hoping their inspectors could go and take a look at and then take the appropriate actions . And then there were a couple properties on the 1300 block of Sanderson Avenue that I inquired about a few months ago. I went over and I spoke with the family of one of the properties there. And there were numerous issues, especially with one property in particular that is really a detriment to the neighbors ' quality of life and to their home. And so I have asked them about it. We've sent them three correspondence s by now regarding those properties . I'm still waiting on some responses on the issues there. And that is something that they've been dealing with for years. I would like to get that resolved as soon as possible . And I think that's -- that's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Dr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comment s at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to touch on one thing that Dr. Rothchild brought up with the railroad crossing s, that's actually the Northeast Regional Railroad Authority is responsible for the upkeep of those. We've sent -- I believe , Miss Reed, we sent correspondence to them about a year ago inquiring about upkeep of some of the railroad crossings . So would we be able to resend that just seeing if they have, you know, any plans to make any upgrade to the railroad crossing ? MS. REED: Yes, I will. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And just one of the questions we got from Mrs. Schumacher was asking about the tonnage delivered to the Recycling Center -- the tonnage and commingled recycling delivered to the Recycling Center in recent years. I know that last year it was -- the total number was just about 1300 tons. But I am going to get numbers going back a little further . And I'll have those for next week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Just on some really City personnel updates , I know I sent along an update -- or a request for an update on the furloughs , which positions were called back and which positions was the administration planning on not calling back. We still haven't receive d a response from that. I'd also like to send along -- and this is on -- one of Mrs. Schumacher 's comments too on -- regarding the firefighter referred to in Mrs. Schumacher 's comment . I know we had asked for a status update at some point last year. So would we be able to send that along too? And then also just another personnel matter, I know that the previous pave cut inspector retired last week. So I just want to know when will that position be posted. And also, the position , you know, currently is responsible for a significant amount of City revenue . So who is currently assuming the responsibility of the pave cut inspector until that position is filled? I'd also like to just make a motion to send correspondence to Kohanski and Company 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 to provide an update on the status of the 2019 audit. You know, the 2019 audit is paid for out of Council funds. So I think we have the prerogative to ask for that update. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion that has been made. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just regarding , you know, everything going on with COVID, just to really just request this to see where we are if we're on that same midSeptember timeline that I know we've talked about them about the beginning -- talked with them about it at the beginning of the year. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of Councilman Donahue 's motion, please signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : And, Miss Reed, a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 couple weeks ago I believe Councilman Gaughan asked for an update on what's an -- an update on what's going on with -- on the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue with the Meadow Brook Creek, the Young and Kennedy property . I don't think we've gotten anything back, have we? MS. REED: I don't believe so, Council man. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Would we be able to follow up with another request for an update on the status of what's going on over there? MS. REED: Of course. MR. DONAHUE : And then I know Mrs. Schumacher also brought up the paving list. I know we got -- I believe we received a copy of the paving list for the roads to be put out for federal money. But I was going -- I thought it was in our agenda. I was going through it and I couldn't find it. Could you just check with OECD to make sure that that's something that we can put into our Third Order? MS. REED: Certainly . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. And then, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 know, I also sent a request last week regarding legislation rewarding the engineer ing contract for the 2020 paving program . And I haven't received a response . And we don't have legislation . So we're not -- I mean, based off our recess unless they want to call us back for a special meeting , we won't be approving engineering contract for a paving program until at least September at this point because it's past the deadline before our summer recess. I also forwarded along questions to the administration regarding 6-A and 6-B. And it was just really what, you know, for both, what strategies will be employed to effectively enforce each ordinance . And then also, is there any downside to increasing the fine specifically for the fireworks ordinance ? And I haven't receive d a response to that. And I'm hoping we receive a response to that by the end of -- or by the meeting next week where we pass that legislation . And also, I have a couple of LIPS questions I'd like to forward onto the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 administration , specifically for the time period between March 15th and July 15th, I'd just like to know how many construction permits were issued, how many construction inspections were performed , how many occupancy permits were issued and how many health inspections were performed . And that's all I have. I'll have some more comments for agenda items. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have a few items I'd like to discuss . The first one is just to ask Solicitor Hayes if we received any responses from the Solid Waste Management Authority regarding the letter that we sent last week or the week prior. ATTY. HAYES: I haven't received any response from the Authority . I don't know if Mrs. Reed did. MS. REED: I have not. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. So it was reported to us that by the majority solicitor that we should receive a response last Friday as he was meeting with him in executive session . I reached out to the solicitor earlier today just to report that I have not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 received a response to our July 8th correspondence which we originally directed to the County Commissioners . And then the county's solicitor indicated that it's something that should go directly to the Authority . But in any event, I reminded the solicit or to the Authority today that we had not received a response . And I have not received one as of -- as of now. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. You know, since in this case with this whole issue, time is of the essence here. And I think we're all trying to understand how we got to this point. You know, I read in the newspaper that the Solid Waste Management Authority amended the agreement that they had with the Recycling Center operator . And apparently they determined that the agreement was not breached . My question has -- is tonight and has been, why would they rush to amend an agreement that was not breached ? Why would they rush to amend an agreement when it really wasn't necessary ? And by all accounts , it benefits the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 operator . And it's to the detriment of Scranton taxpayers and really to every other borough throughout Lackawanna County. So I know Mr. Cummings , the Executive Director and Solicitor of the Authority had said he was going to respond to our questions by this Friday. But that did not happen. So I'd like to make a motion that Council prepare and submit a Right To Know request to the Solid Waste Management Authority seeking the following : Minutes from the Authority 's meeting s from July 1st, 2019 through the present ; A listing of current members along the date of their appointment ; The date of the Authority Solicitor 's appointment ; All amendments to the professional service operating agreement ; Copies of the excel spreadsheets which are referenced in the July 6th, 2020 correspondence from the Lackawanna County Recycling Center, Inc., to the Authority ; Copies of the current and prior 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 waste management plan for municipal waste, which the Authority is required to adopt pursuant to the Municipal Waste Planning Recycling Waste Reduction Act; And the Authority 's financial statements for years 2015 through 2019. Do I have a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , you know, it's sort of ridiculous that we have to put in a Right To Know request . I think this information should be readily available to anyone in authority at that Authority . MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I agree. It's ridiculous that we have go to this, a Right To Know. And, you know, one week -- one week the agreement is null and void. Now a week later it's breached or it's not breached but it's being amended . It doesn't make any sense to me. So that's it. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Just a few things, I had asked this week for an update on the Street Sign Program . About a year or two ago Council passed legislation entering into a contract with a company who is really going to revamp our Street Sign Program and give us some tools in order to streamline the whole process . So I did ask just for an update on what's been done and what the plan is moving forward . I know that there has been several signs replaced throughout the City. And I think it would be incumbent upon Council just to find out exactly where they've been and what's been done because it is a really good program . Also, several citizens issues I just want to touch on really quickly we sent into DPW and the Licensing and Inspections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Department . On East Mountain , the 1300 and 1400 blocks of Brook Street, water runoff issues. I continue to get complaint s about East Mountain Road and the brush overgrowth that makes it difficult for drivers , the same issue on Mountain Lake Road. That road is crumbling , needs to be patched and put on a future paving list, if possible . Also part of Wintermantle Avenue is in really bad shape. Wintermantle and Birch, the ditch is dangerous , plus there's a lot of overgrowth there. I receive d a complaint about the 400 block of Phelps Street and some quality of life issues, 3103 McCarthy Avenue in Minooka , there's high grass. And the house was involved in a fire a few years ago, the 1500 block of Price Street and the corner of Bromley Avenue, same thing. There was a house that burned about five years ago. And it's still sitting there and furniture in an alley in West Scranton on Rachael Place. So we did send all of those complaint s to the proper -- proper departments . I was pleased that we had Mr. Deeley 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 in, our Business Administrator to talk about blight in the City. In listening to him speak, it does seem like we are moving in the right direction in terms of coming up with a strategy and a comprehensive plan to deal with blight throughout the City. And that's all I have. Thank you. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – PROHIBITING THE USE OF COMMERCIAL VEHICLE BRAKE RETARDERS ON THIRD AVENUE IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON BETWEEN ELM STREET AND BROADWAY STREET. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to say -- I want to say thank you to the Mayor and members of the administration , DPW, City Engineer , Police Chief Carl Graziano , the Mayor's Chief of Staff for taking the time -- and the City Law Department as well for taking the time to put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 this ordinance together . I won't go through all the issues that have occurred on Third Avenue because of truck traffic really because of the Elm Street bridge. But I think in speaking to the neighbors that this legislation will hopefully lessen some of the issues there and will hopefully increase their quality of life. This is an ordinance . Since next week is our last meeting , I will ask in the interest of the neighbors and their quality of life if we can suspend the rules and move this to final passage next week. That's all I have. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF MICAH S. WOODARD , 920 MOOSIC STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18505, AS A MEMBER OF THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 SCRANTON PARKING AUTHORITY EFFECTIVE JULY 9, 2020.

GAUGHAN : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I'd like to add that I know Mr. Woodard . And I know that he's a business owner in Scranton . And I think it's important to have downtown business owners a part of the Parking Authority since I think they have firsthand knowledge of how the Parking Authority is affecting their businesses and their customers . So I think this is a good appointment and I look forward to voting on it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I did request a resume for Mr. Woodard. And we did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 receive that. So it will be in Third Order next week for final passage . Anyone else on the question ?

MS. REED: 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE ACCEPTANCE BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON BY KEYSTONE SANITARY LANDFILL OF A JOHN DEERE 410 L BACKHOE LOADER SN:1T0410LXVLF382297 PER COSTARS DGS CONTRACT #4400011444 FROM FIVE STAR EQUIPMENT . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion to introduce Item 5-D into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question -- MR. DONAHUE : On the question , sorry. Attorney Hayes, if we were to ask for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 an itemized list of what has been provided under this agreement year by year going back to 2000, would that be a question for the administration or for the landfill ? ATTY. HAYES: Well, I guess either. The easier route would be to go to the administration because pursuant to the -- I think it was October of 2000, there was an agreement with the operator that the operator will provide $100,000 worth of equipment on an annual basis. What they're doing here in this resolution is just memorializing the donation of a particular piece of equipment . And I think the Mayor wanted this done in a more formalize d manner which I tend to agree with. So the answer to your question , Mr. Donahue , I would start with the administration to see if they have an accounting of all the different materials and equipment that have been donated since 2000 to the present and see if they have that information . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Yeah, because this is the first I've heard of this stipulation in that contract . And I would just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 be interested to see, you know, what sort of equipment the City has gotten, you know, going back 20 years. So I'll ask Mrs. Reed to send that over to the -- that request over to the administration . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? I agree with Councilman Donahue . I think it's -- I would be interested to see if the City has been keeping an account of what we receive . I'm sure they have been. But I think it would be good for us to request that to see the equipment and other things that have been provided . MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , when taking a look at this, was this -- I mean, I read it several times. But was this a donation of actual equipment or was it a donation of money and then we used the COSTARS system to purchase the equipment with that money? MR. GAUGHAN : Solicitor Hayes, would you know the answer to that question ? I think it was that the money was provided and then the City went out and entered in a contract . Am I correct or -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 ATTY. HAYES: That's correct , Council President Gaughan . That's my understanding that only the City would be able to participate in the COSTARS program . So that's how I think it would have to work. But as you know, the amendment -- the revisions that I proposed and circulated amongst Council members was to get additional supporting documentation to explain this transaction just so we have it and that would be hopefully included in the supporting documentation that we would have to pass once this resolution was finalized . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, thank you, Mr. Hayes. Yeah, when reading it, that's what it appeared to be that it was a monetary donation and then we went through COSTARS system. But I guess the wording of the resolution appears that the tractor is being donated . ATTY. HAYES: Correct . Yes, but I think as Council President Gaughan explained that was the arrangement we'll be reimbursed for the purchase . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so we got an amendment and a gift in the same night. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-E.

FOR INTRODUCTION – 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING OF THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF AN APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF HEALTH REQUESTING A CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL PURSUANT TO 16 P.S. § 12005(a)CONFIRMING THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S ABILITY TO ESTABLISH A MUNICIPAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Solicitor Hayes, could you -- I think you reviewed this resolution . Is this something that municipalities can do, create a Department of Health in your review? ATTY. HAYES: So this is an issue that I'll have to review with the Law Department . And in their defense I have not raised it yet with them. But the statute that they cited in this resolution is the Local Health Administrative Law which essentially empowers county government s to establish 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Departments of Health, not municipalities . Municipalities are permitted to have their own Department of Health if one existed at the time that this Local Health Administrative Law was adopted in 1951. Upon Councilman Schuster 's request , Mrs. Carrera and Mrs. Reed both did research on this issue. And it appears that in 1916, the Department of Public Health was created for the City of Scranton by an act of Council . We -- and obviously it's apparent that that Department of Health no longer exists. We don't know when it was discontinued . That would take some additional digging . I could tell you that the Department of Health is not listed as a department in the Administrative Code, which was adopted in 1984. So what we'll have to get clarification from the administration before final passage is this, is there another provision -- a statutory provision -- state statute that is permitting them to pursue this creation of a Department of Health because I don't read this Local Health Administrative Law to allow for the creation of such a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Department of Health for a city -- a Class 2A City. And secondly is, it may not be necessary in the Department of Public Health -- or Department of Health that exists on the books for the City of Scranton . Although , it does appear that it is expired . It no longer exists. It certainly hasn't been budgeted for in a number of -- in as far -- in any budget that we can see in recent memory. So we're going to have to get some clarification on this issue before final passage . But I think it was important that Councilman Schuster raised this issue this week which permitted us to start digging the history of the Department of Health for the City of Scranton . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I want to add I believe this is something that other cities and municipalities have been looking into just like in light of COVID to help them better handle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 these situations . So I know it seems to just -- the purpose of this legislation would be to start an exploratory committee , you know, nothing -- at no cost just to see if this is something that's feasible or possible in the City. But I agree. I'm interested in seeing if it's legally possible . That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question , I think it's important to point out that this is just the first step in the process that would cost the City zero dollars . And it sort of allows you to get into an exploratory phase. I would like -- I'm interested to see what Mr. Hayes, Mrs. Reed, and Mrs. Carrera come up with with regards to, you know, some of the history behind it. But I think from a realistic perspective , I think, you know, a county health department would be more realistic . Even when you look at, you know, I think Philadelphia is the only City. But it's also a county I guess in the State of Pennsylvania that has its own health department . Even Pittsburgh uses Allegheny 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 County for their health department . But I just think it's important to point out that this would cost -- this is a phase that could cost the City zero dollars, you know, to start exploring . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? ATTY. HAYES: Council President Gaughan , if I may? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. ATTY. HAYES: I know that there is the Scranton Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority which is a county authority . I don't know if that's the entity which was created pursuant to this local health administrative law. And then if that's the case, Scranton may very well fall under the jurisdiction of that authority . But certainly we have some more research to do on this issue. And I do understand that other municipalities may have this Department of Health or have a -- I have to assume that that was because it existed at the time this statute was adopted. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. GAUGHAN : So, Kevin, are you -- let me just try and clarify it. Are you saying that there's a potential that Council doesn't actually have to pass or, you know, approve any legislation for the City to go forward -- simply go forward with an explorat ory committee ? ATTY. HAYES: Right. MR. GAUGHAN : In other words, they may be able to do that without Council approval if they are just exploring the option. ATTY. HAYES: Yeah, that's right. I just think that the citation to -- with the Local Health Administrative Law is not correct . Yeah, there is nothing that would preclude Council and the City from forming a committee to determine whether it needs a -- it's own department . It may not be subject to this statute to handle public health issues. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?

C.S.A. §11701.249, THE MUNICIPALITIES FINANCIAL RECOVERY ACT. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'm going to vote for this resolution just basically just for one reason and that's Payroll Prep Tax. I think we need to get that done as soon as possible . That was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 City of Scranton last year. And I think we need to get it done before the end of this year. You know, the last few weeks I think we've made some progress towards actually having that adopted starting January 1st. But in terms of Act 47 and really state government overall , both are just completely ineffective . If you were to ask in the 28 years that we've been designated distress ed under Act 47, has it been a net positive or a net negative ? I would absolutely say it's been a net negative . The scorn of having that distressed status has been greater than the benefits we received . I don't think we received a lot of benefits . I know PEL does some budget work for us. But realistically I think that's something that we should be doing in the Business Administration Office in the first place. It would just be good practice . And then in terms of the state and the state legislator , they really are useless . We're operating under taxing legislation and the ability to -- the legislation that gives us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 the ability to tax. That was adopted in the late 60s. Most Pennsylvania highways were what they were then. That's -- it's a time when wealth was concent rated in cities. And Pennsylvania was basically cities and barns. We didn't have the extreme suburbs we have now. And we didn't have, you know, distressed cities that really don't have the taxing authority to properly fund their operations . But I am voting for this strictly for the ability to institute a Payroll Prep Tax instead of the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax which is extremely outdated in its own right. And as soon as we get that passed, I'm going to push that we exit Act 47 as quickly as possible . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I would say with that being said, I think the conversation needs to start immediately with the Scranton School District if we want -- I think the goal is that we do this in unison. And if we're going to do that with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 the district , I think that conversation needs to start immediately . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I know those conversation s have been taking place. At the PEL meetings Mr. Laffey, the Business Finance Manager for the School District I think is almost at every one of the PEL meeting s. So he has been -- I know for a fact that he has been in touch with Mr. Deeley and before him Mr. Sheridan . So they are -- the School District and the City are working together on this. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, when you say working together , I mean, Mr. Laffey is fantastic . But he's the business manager . This has to be passed by a board. It has to be that, you know, it was presented to us by -- when I was there the school district solicitor that it's not a good idea that it wasn't recommended by the PDE or the state. So, you know, like Kyle said, you know, we need to go Payroll Prep Tax. But guess what, this has to happen. And 18 months comes around very quick. And we talked about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 back and forth on this for almost a year so -- actually two years. So I hope these communications continue but more in-depth. That's all I have. Thanks. DR. ROTHCHILD : Along those lines I did have a quick question . And it's something that I think we perceive d as a question from citizens as well asking if the Shared Services Committee has met which I don't believe it has. I think Councilman McAndrew and Councilman Donahue (inaudible ) if I remember correctly , and I didn't know if there were any planned meetings . MR. DONAHUE : So the last time we met was the end of February . And we talked about ways that all administration s can start sharing information and communicating , especially on purchasing and that sort of stuff. You know, Council can facilitate those conversations . But we can't force each individual administration to do, you know, to actually do that on a day-to-day basis. And I think that's where we've been finding difficulties in that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 So, I mean, we could request an update. I'll put together a list of everything that we discussed at our last meeting at the end of February . And we'll request an update from the administration on where we are on each of those points. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, that would be great because that would increase the communication and then help us to resolve the issue of the payroll prep tax. MR. SCHUSTER : I think possibly get a date for when a meeting -- when a shared services meeting can occur. MR. MCANDREW : That is scheduled by the administration . MR.
