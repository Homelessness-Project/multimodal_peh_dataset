GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have one comment just on 3-F, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 the Single Tax Office report. As I mentioned in the caucus tonight , it is very concerning to see that in all categories , real estate, delinquent real estate, LST and EMS and Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax that the City is down from where we were this time last year through the end of August to the tune of $632,617.85. I do think it's very important as Councilman Schuster and I discussed in the caucus that the administration come to a public caucus as they did in June and give us an update on the overall financial health of the City in terms of the effect that the pandemic has had. So I am looking forward to that as soon as possible . I know that we did send out a request for that meeting . And we'll keep everybody updated on that. Any other comment s on Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. This is a reminder . So this Saturday , September 12th 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 from one to six, St. Stephen 's Booster Club will be having their drive through chicken dinner. Unfortunately , this is the only way they can raise money this year because of, you know, restrictions with COVID. So the donation is $10. I have tickets right here. I got my tickets already . You could actually go without tickets . I'll probably send my daughters at half time during the Notre Dame/Duke game to pick up our dinners . Please help these guys out. They really need the money. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Excuse me. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. We have receive d public comment from Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus. So I'd ask that one of the Council members , please make a motion to accept public comment from Miss Schumacher and Miss Franus at this time. MR. DONAHUE : I'll make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm going to ask our City Clerk to read the comments received from Miss Schumacher and Miss Franus into the public record at this time. MS. REED: Thank you. The first comment received was from Marie Schumacher and it reads as follows : If you read today's Times-Tribune , you may have noticed the article "U.S. Debt to soon exceed entire economy ." So I believe you realize the Federal Government would be unwise to go further into debt to fill Scranton 's tin cup. May I suggest it is time to do one or both of the following : Number one, ask the Commonwealth 's Governor Wolf to stop playing dictator and allow all business es to open. And, number two, sharpen your pencils and get to work on a bare bones budget. The second comment is from Fay Franus and it reads as follows : Council , number one, I appreciate that you are allowing question s from the public to be read aloud for the public hearing on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 capital budget September 16. My question to all of you is, why are you still not allowing our question s to be read aloud during the Council meeting s? Every week you say Fourth Order Citizens Participation and you never read our questions and comment s. That is also suppose d to be public but not when you don't allow the public to hear. Number two, how many City inspector s are furloughed ? Number three, how many City inspectors are working every day? Number four, who is in charge of making sure owners of rental properties have been registered ? How many people are working on getting properties register ed? Comment on question number four, we have been hearing about properties not being register ed to landlords for years, yet the Mayor is saying we are working on it. Really? Now I'm going to enclose Mayor Cognetti 's comments from a recent article in the Scranton Times by Chris Kelly about this absentee landlord Ken Bond who has none of his numerous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 properties register ed. Scranton Mayor Paige Gebhardt Cognetti sent an inspector to the property Friday morning . He was greeted with huge chunks of the building 's stucco siding that fell off in a recent rain storm and still lay in a pile where they landed. The Mayor said the inspector did not assess that the building should be condemned , but the City is connecting tenants with free legal help and monitoring the situation closely . Given that all of Bond's apartment s are unregister ed and illegal , why can't the City just shut him down? Such a move would likely involve numerous legal hurdles and would definitely come with unintended consequences the Mayor said. "If we did that, where would they -- tenants go, she said." "We have a lot of work to do to get our house in order and clean up the way we track things and respond to things on the legal end. We've really beefed up our legal team and we're working to fix a broken system. We are making progress ."1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Additional comment , so I say to you, Council , I am certain that you will back up anything the Mayor wants. So far you have not challenge d her except Kyle Donahue once in a while. It seems Mayor Cognetti is using the excuse about it may cost the City money in legal fees if we go after Ken Bond not register ing his properties and who knows what else she is worried about. Allow me to remind you, you work for the people as does the Mayor. We pay you. Apparently , all of you must have forgot about the lawsuit pending that we the people have against the City for charging us way to much money for our garbage fee because we are paying for the thousands who do not pay like Ken Bond. You should care more and worry more about all of us who are paying our taxes and care less about Ken Bond and all others who are not paying their taxes and fees. Where will those tenants go the Mayor asks? That is their problem not ours, not yours. They should research landlords before renting . That is their responsibility . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 You need to worry about the taxpayers that are keeping the City afloat as much as humanly possible by paying our taxes every year and our garbage fee every year. For years I have been after the City to go after people in neighborhoods who pay their garbage fee. Still nothing done. Thousands of dollars lost to the City because you do not enforce your laws. We work hard to make sure our bills are paid. May I remind you there is a law in the City that states that anyone who does not pay their garbage fee, the Department of Public Works does not have to pick up their garbage . Another law you do not choose to enforce . You cannot say because people will put their garbage in bags and that is unsafe because Council passed a law last November stating all garbage cans must have lids on them, another law you choose not to enforce . Every member of Council should concentrate on having City departments condemning buildings that are not obeying City codes and go over landlords that do not have their properties register ed. Stop protecting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the people who break City laws and help the people who obey your City laws. Do you believe you could possibly do this for once? Do you wonder why people have lost faith in their City government ? Mayor Cognetti 's remarks in Chris Kelly article says it all. Help the unlawful and the heck with the good citizens of Scranton who follow the law and work hard to pay their bills. That conclude s the citizens comments . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Just on the question , I want to thank everyone who submitted public comment . Miss Franus had submitted several questions last week. I do have an answer to one of them. We're still waiting on some of the other answers here to her question s. But one question was, when is the last time ECTV received money from Comcast , the franchise money, if ever? We did receive -- I asked the City Controller today and he responded that the last payment disbursed to ECTV from the City for the Comcast Cable Franchise Agreement was $56,657 in 2019. And hopefully by next week we'll have answers to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 all of the other questions . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion to accept public comment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I do. We asked for a -- well, we had an update for July 23rd on the following audit work that has been completed so far. Payroll (inaudible ) controls and pension census testing are completed and the census data for OPEB plans have been received . HR Department has the items we selected for testing ready but have not determine d a date to return the complet ed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 testing. And then all of the other outstanding items that were noted in the last update are still outstanding . MR. GAUGHAN : Anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : No, that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I actual do. I have two. As Chairman of the Public Safety Committee , I would like to just say that my thought s and prayers go out to the Scranton Fire Department for the firefighter that tested positive and the other firefighter s that were identified through contact tracing . I pray all is well with them and their families . Secondly , I would also like to make mention of Chris Kelly's article the other day on Kenneth Bond. Bond states that he's not going anywhere . So guess what, I'm ready to send this guy packing . So I know that past administrations along with the Solicitor in 2019 stated they were going to explore options . I also know last year Council , you know, the current Council , you know, made some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 suggestions in wanting to do corrective actions . I think the exploration process should be over by now. This guy owes 74 grand in back taxes, 152,000 delinquent garbage fees. He illegal ly rents apartment s of properties not registered with the City, nor has had official inspection . He claims both are satisfied . The City claims no. I realize that the current Mayor and administration are working to fix this broken system. I also get the fact that displaced tenants might need a little help. But Mr. Bond has expressed or, you know, excuses , loopholes in the 11th hour checks to pay back taxes to live another day or actually another year, I should say. So I believe the citizens of this City that pay their taxes and garbage fees along with my colleagues deserve some answers like the next step or action plan and maybe some more explanation . So what I would like to ask is, President Gaughan and/or Mrs. Reed, would you invite the administration and maybe the new blight task force to come to a caucus and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 explain , you know, give us an update what is changed , what has not changed , what do we do moving forward so, you know, because the citizens that do, like I said earlier , that pay their taxes, pay their garbage fee, they deserve some answers along with myself. It's not clear. And I have to read it in an article and I don't want to read it again a year from now, the same article . And that's what continue s to happen. So if that correspondence could be sent, I'd be very happy. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I just wanted to say that in caucus I had mentioned there's a piece of legislation that we tabled before we went on our August recess. And I wanted to send additional correspondence to the administration . We had some questions it was regarding the proposed plan for an exploration committee for a municipal Department of Health. And I think we had some concerns about if that was something that the City would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 be able to do and I think the history behind it too if we -- when we have it -- Department of Health previously . And that was all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you so much, Dr. Rothchild . And, Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Just to add to what Mr. McAndrew said a little bit. Back in I think it was the end of June, early July when we were told that they weren't -- the administration wasn't going to go ahead with the review of the LIPS Department , we were told that the new Business Administrator was going to look into the processes . So to add onto Mark's too, if the administration does come in, I would also like an update on where we are in terms of modernizing the LIPS Department and also what strategies we're going to implement in terms of quality of life because driving around some of the neighborhoods in this City, you know, there's major quality of life issues and they're only getting worse. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 much, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few things tonight , ladies and gentlemen . The first I just would like to request from the OECD Director , if possible , an update on the status of project s that were funded through the 2020 Action Plan with CDBG money and then what will the -- what date will OECD start accepting application s for the 2021 CDBG funding ? So, Mrs. Reed, if you could just send a note to the OECD Director requesting that information , I would appreciate it. As I mentioned in the caucus, we did receive responses on the Serrenti Center from the Business Administrator so I just want to say that I appreciate that. Solicitor Hayes was talking about the LGN trucking issue that or LNG trucking issue that has come up in Clarks Summit. And I don't know, we're still trying to figure out if that route goes directly through Scranton . But if it doesn't, it goes right, you know, along side of us on Interstate 81. And I do think that it's important for Council to stand with Clarks Summit and any of the other boroughs that are going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 affected from this in Lackawanna County. You know, the plan is to ship a very, very large amount of liquified natural gas by truck through Lackawanna County. And of the plans that I saw, that would mean that there would be an additional 800 heavy trucks a day coming through our community here. We're already dealing with the affects of having a landfill in our community . The last thing that we need is 800 more trucks coming through Lackawanna County and all of the issues that that would bring. So I do support a resolution standing with Clarks Summit and any of the other boroughs that are going to stand against that. And I think that would be good for the City and good for Lackawanna County. So I appreciate Solicitor Hayes looking into that. Also, I talked in the caucus about scheduling -- and I think we did send out a request to schedule a meeting with the administration to update Council on the financial projections . The last time we had the previous Business Administrator in was June 10th, 2020 and basically gave us a very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 sobering look at -- at that point where, you know, we might stand looking forward to the end of the year. I think the projections were between a 6 to 10 million dollar deficit . So I think we're due for another update to see where now we stand due to the new numbers that have come in and the new financial figures that have come into the City. So I'm looking forward to that. The other thing that's been talked about now for quite some time is an RFP that was suppose d to go out for the last several months from what I understand for engineering services regarding stormwater runoff issues in Keyser Valley. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could connect with the Law Department or the Mayor's office to find out where exactly that is and when that is going to go out. On top of that, I would like to request a meeting with Herbert , Rowland and Grubic. Herbert , Rowland and Grubic, they're a company that the City hired in July of 2019. And they were suppose d to work with the City and are working with the City on a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 pollution reduction plan and helping us comply with pollution reduction requirement s by the EPA. They were also going to help the City determine the best management practices that we should implement to maintain our MS-4 permit and also we're going to work with the City to explore the feasibility and benefits of managing stormwater on a regional basis. Last week when we had the Mayor in, this topic came up and I was a little bit concerned that it didn't seem like maybe we were where we should be in regards to stormwater management . I do know that, you know, we're facing a pandemic and all the other things that came with it. But I am very concerned about stormwater management throughout the City. As all of us on Council know and since I've been on Council , one of the really major complaints that we get is about water runoff, whether it be in Keyser Valley, East Mountain , Minooka , North Scranton , you name it. There are really, really unbelievable infrastructure issues that are going to cost an awful lot of money. So I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 think now after asking quite a few times for different updates , I think we should just reach out directly to this company that the City hired and ask them to come in and give us an update on where they stand and what those options look like, what the feasibility and benefits of managing stormwater would be on a regional basis and where we were in that process and what the timeline looks like. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could find the contact information for that company and reach out to them so that we can get them into a Council meeting . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

It makes total sense. It should have been done a long time ago. I'm glad that we finally had this on our agenda. I do think that there are some things that need to be ironed out between the City and the county in terms of what we talked about tonight in the caucus with the county potentially collecting not only the delinquent real estate taxes but the delinquent refuse fees as well. So there does -- according to Attorney O'Brien, have to be a mechanism in which the refuse fee is placed within the real estate tax bill, which I know was under discussion last year in 2019 but for whatever reason did not occur. So I think that it's incumbent upon the administration to make sure that everything is in place that the refuse fee if it needs to be included in the real estate tax bill that that's done and all the people that need to be in a room together or over the phone or over zoom or whatever , are all on the same page so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 there are no hiccups as we've seen in the past. So I'm hopeful that will happen and we'll have final passage next week. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
