CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS DATED JULY 13, 2021 REGARDING LEGGETTS CREEK AND LEACH CREEK FLOODING . 3-B. CONTROLLER â€™S REPORT FOR MONTH ENDING JUNE 30, 2021.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 3-C. MEMORANDUM RECEIVED FROM KEVIN C. HAYES, ESQUIRE , CITY COUNCIL SOLICITOR , DATED JULY 15, 2021 REGARDING SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO RESOLUTION NO. 173, 2021. 3-D. MEMORANDUM RECEIVED FROM MAYOR PAIGE G. COGNETTI DATED JULY 12, 2021 DESIGNATING LAWRENCE D. WEST, BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR , AS DEPUTY MAYOR. MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? I have one comment on 3-A. This is correspondence received from DPW Director Tom Preambo regarding Leggetts Creek and Leach Creek flooding . So this is an issue that has affected a lot of the residents of North Scranton near where I live in my neighborhood . And I do want to thank the DPW and Mr. Preambo for getting back to us with this information number one; and number two, for really trying their best to rectify the situation . He has been in contact with the resident even after we had initially met. And I do know that there was two permits -- emergency permits that were issued. There's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 still a question about a large portion of Leggetts Creek where islands have formed and we're going to continue to discuss that. But I did want to publically thank them, Mr. Preambo and the DPW workers for all that they've done so far for those residents . Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. I skipped one part. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? Okay. I have two announcements . So the first announcement is -- and I believe Dr. Rothchild mentioned this week last week. There's a fundraiser to benefit Shane Conway and family. Shane Conway is the son-in-law of our City Clerk, Frank Voldenberg . And he's going through some medical issues at this point. That benefit is going to be held Saturday , July 31st, 2021 at the FOP Lodge, 46 Aston Mountain Road, Moosic from 3 to 7 p.m. There will be hamburgers , hotdogs , pasta, beer and soda. Adults will be charged $20 in advance , $25 at the door. Youth from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 ages 10 to 20 will be charged $10. And then any children under 10 are free. I would urge all Scranton residents and residents of Lackawanna County if you can make it out to this benefit . I could personally attest to the fact that Mr. Conway is a gentleman . I've known him for a long time now. I know his wife. I went to high school with her. They are great people. If there's one thing I know about Scranton , when someone is in need we step up for them. So if you have the time and you could make it out to this benefit for this young family we would all appreciate it. And that's all. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Before we get started tonight with Citizens Participation because we do have some new speakers I see tonight , if you could please just -- I know some of you listed your address if you could please for the stenographer list your address or your hometown where you live. You do have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 to be a Scranton resident to speak or a business owner. Also, just a reminder that you do have five minutes to speak. There's a time clock right below the dais here and then there is also one that we could see below where you speak. You'll see it blink yellow when you have about a minute left and then red when your time is up. Please try to keep your comments to agenda items and anything related to City business . And the first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton resident . First, you know, I'm still waiting for those Collective Bargaining Agreements to pop back up on the City's website . And the reason I keep mentioning this week after week is sooner or later, that legislation is going to come before you when they want to renew those Collective Bargaining Agreements . And it's not enough for citizens just to see a memorandum of the changes . We need to see the base document . We can't make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 any kind of meaning ful comment s. And remember , it's taxpayer dollars that are going to fund those Collective Bargaining Agreements . So please let's try to get them back on there. That's a matter of full disclosure and transparency . Next, is there any status on -- progress on the City's 2020 audit? We used to have the auditor 's report and like Rossi and Rossi would tell us week after week what he was looking for or missing. And I haven't heard anything except that it's suppose d to be done by the end of September . Are we on track? MR. GAUGHAN : We are. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : We are on track. MS. HODOWANITZ : That's good. MR. GAUGHAN : I think they pushed it back to October now. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Sort of on track. MS. HODOWANITZ : Sort of on track. It's an essential document as you prepare the next year's budget. And you don't have the numbers , you know, you're shooting in the dark. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Okay. Did we ever get an answer on the difference between the mission of this new health coordinator and the Lackawanna Scranton Health and Welfare Authority how their missions differ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I got something from Mr. Kozlanski {sic} from the Scranton Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority . It's about a paragraph statement if you'd like me to read it in Fifth Order -- MS. HODOWANITZ : No, would you do that in Fifth Order then? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, sure. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I appreciate that. I am a little concerned about a possibility of a duplication effort between the county level and the city level. So hopefully we aren't going to waste money duplicating each other. Also, last week you may have noticed we had a little bit of rain. It's time to start getting serious about stormwater management planning . There is only so long you can kick that can down the road. So I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 keep asking you, you know, what's the status of when we're going to get some information on what you're going to do. And finally , I've got to agree with speakers from the prior weeks about renaming Spruce Street for President Biden. I think it's appropriate to rename Central City Expressway after the President . That's fine. I don't have a problem with that. But I don't see any need to really mess with Spruce Street. You know, I mean, we have the Casey Highway . We have the McDade Expressway . But I'm not aware of a Casey Avenue or a Casey Street or a McDade Avenue or a McDade Street. And we properly recognized the contributions of those two gentlemen and without having changed an entire city street. I think you need to look very, very calmly at the financial fallout for business owners and residents on Spruce Street. It may be only six blocks long, but there's a lot of money that goes into running a business and changing your address , especially if you're like the ice cream place Scoops on Spruce. What are you going to be, scoops on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 scraggly kid from Scranton street? Think about it. Now, I hope you do that. And finally , I was very happy to see Mayor Cognetti and Mr. West and Miss Cipriani here for caucus. One thing I would like to keep reenforcing and you should with the administration is we need to constantly partner with all the non-profits in the City, the schools , the hospitals , the public library , all those entities . They're not just people who don't pay taxes. They're people who could serve the interest of the City. And we need to be constantly asking them to do that. You know, those schools can teach. The hospitals can handle public safety and public health. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. The next speaker is Richard Loreto{sic}. I hope I said your last name correctly . MR. LORETO: Joe Biden was born and raised until the age of 10 in our hometown Scranton , Pennsylvania . He did not abandon Scranton . His parents moved to Delaware for a job opportunity as my dad moved to Hartford , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Connecticut in the early 50s when work was lean in the Lackawanna Valley. Joe did not forget about Scranton after he left. He returned hundreds of times after his family moved to Delaware . Joe Biden says his values were learned as young boy in Scranton , Pennsylvania and he has never forgotten them. I have met and spoken to President Biden twice while he was here as a Senator . I felt like I was speaking with an old friend both times. I was 15 feet from Joe on Election Day 2020 as he came to visit his childhood home on North Washington Avenue with some of his granddaughters . I have tried to figure on average how often a president of our great nation will come from Scranton , Pennsylvania . I know for sure that the chances of this happening is less than once in every one thousand years. We must embrace this moment instead of letting partisanship muddily the waters of whether or not we should name a street with addresses on it in the childhood hometown of our President and his namesake.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 When I called the Mayor's office early on in this conversation , her spokesperson told me that the single sign that sits over the North Washington Street sign in front of Joe Biden's childhood home which says Joe Biden Way caused considerable blowback and that the matter has at least been temporarily shelved . I would venture to say that 90 to 95 percent of the current complaint s are from bare Trump support ers. They just won't accept the reality of today that Joe Biden won in a landslide. When Donald Trump won in 2016, he stated that he had won in a landslide. He lost the popular vote by 3 million cast ballots. If anyone ever had the right to kick and fight and scream about losing the presidential election like a grade school sore loser, it was Al Gore. When five conservative Supreme Court justices decided to stop a full recount of the state of Florida vote, George W. Bush was ahead just by over 500 votes out of over 6 million votes cast. Best guess estimates were that Gore would have won the state by 100 to 200 votes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 had the conservative lived Supreme Court not stopped the counting of all ballots . Al Gore accepted this ruling. He did not want to drive our great nation into a bitter partisan country of hatred and animosity . He was even the person to preside over the certification of George W. Bush's presidency . Vice President Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes. Katherine Harris, Secretary of State of Florida was with Bush all the way. George Bush's brother was the Governor of Florida . If ever an election was stolen, it was from Al Gore. It was not even close with Donald Trump. As this whole idea of naming a street or avenue after President Biden started developing , I heard Wyoming Avenue, now Spruce Street and the Central Scranton Expressway mentioned . I couldn't understand for the life of me why it wouldn't be North Washington Avenue. I thought leave South Washington Avenue as is. I procrastinated and didn't get to share my thought s with Council when the idea was in its formative stages. After all, North 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Washington is the very street that Joe grew up on. But on further examination having a grand announcement as visitors enter the City that Joe Biden Street is straight ahead would be an awesome badge of honor for the City. It would bring a lot of people here from Erie, PA. My daughter lives there. And her friends in Erie family think Scranton is just awesome . They love the architecture , the restaurant s, the people and things to do and see. The Office TV show poked fun at our city but also created an uncountable amount of tourism dollars into the City and still does. It is the most in demand streaming rerun series in America . If we can't laugh at ourselves and let the money keep coming from in from that show, we have lost something inside of ourselves. This is another Office moment for businesses in Scranton . We need to take this once in a millennium opportunity and make the most of it. Changing address es is a very simple task in 2021. Keyboards could do most of what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 letters and phone calls used to do. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Loreto. MR. LORETO: It is not nearly as difficult as it was to do in the era of -- preceding my next paragraph . MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Loreto, I'm sorry, I don't want to cut you off but you're -- we have five minutes and your time is up. MR. LORETO: All right. I just want to say 955 streets and avenues have been named after Dr. Martin Luther King in this country . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate your comment s. MR. LORETO: 955. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Thank you very much. Next speaker is Nick Fallon. MR. FALLON: Good afternoon . My name is Nick Fallon. I'm coming here today to follow up on an issue that I present ed before. And to think I almost wore on my Dunder Mifflin shirt today too here to follow up on that last conversation . I wore it earlier . I changed it before I came in. So I had previously mentioned about trying to get parking permits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 enforced on Farr Street. And Councilman Gaughan had advised me that there was a method to try to do this. I am bringing in the form that I filled out and had a petition signed for this to try to get -- to try to have it reviewed. One of the things I thought about before I came here today is, on Farr Street I walked -- the day I got this I walked down the full extent of the street. I cautiously knocked on doors and, like, I got a fair amount of signatures . Some people just with COVID and everything I think that they are either afraid or kind of just not -- didn't want to pursue this, I guess. I had a couple people that were like, hey, we don't want to be bothered with it. There -- before I left tonight on my section which is the beginning of Farr Street, there were two commercial vans parked there which are constantly parked there. There's no business on that street. And they're (inaudible ) vans at the beginning of the street. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 I personally , like, have a lot of elderly neighbors . One of my neighbors he just turned 97 this, like, on the 15th I think it was of July. A lot of them are afraid to say stuff. And sometimes it takes somebody like to me to kind of step up and kind of say, well, hey, this is what's going on. They just don't -- they think if something like happens that there might be, like, either ramifications or, like, say another neighbor gets angry because of something like that. I have about 13 signatures on here. And I wanted to bring up this -- I don't need to use the full five minutes. I didn't want to take too much time away from everybody else. On Farr Street they have -- they're renovating the Farr Street Tavern, I think. There's a new business that's going into place there. So there's going to be a lot more traffic probably on there. And then the other thing, there's a magistrate 's office on there. So, like, that would be one thing that I would bring up that there should possibly be parking permits on a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 street like that. You have businesses . You have a restaurant coming into play and hopefully all that stuff works out. That was before my time when I moved into the neighborhood . So I was never there when the tavern was there. But I think it's going to be very exciting and invigorating for that neighborhood . And I really do appreciate everything and I really do appreciate you guys taking your consideration with this. And I appreciate everything . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Yes, we'll submit that to the police department , the traffic division . And they'll take a look at it and they'll make a determination and then we'll be in touch. MR. FALLON: Okay, I appreciate it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a good night. MR. FALLON: You too. MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Greetings Council . In the caucus before this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 we have heard that the Mayor was looking for roughly 30 to 40 percent for education for possibly going out door to door to canvas for the COVID vaccine . I think at this point in time every one in the country is well aware that there's a vaccine out there and for a lot of us that they should get that vaccine . That being said, knocking on the doors of people to ask them whether they got the vaccine or not or even hand out information sheets seems to be a waste of time and money. There's many social media platforms that have handled this. And we've seen news articles on it every single day. I don't think there is a person out there or at least very few people who have not made their decision to get vaccinated or not get vaccinated . And those who will not get vaccinated are not going to agree just because someone knocks at their door. Actually they are more likely to get hostile and verbally attack if we're lucky just that, the people coming to knock at their door to tell them what they should or should not do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 So I think that is a bad allocation of funds and even as a concept because there is not a place in this country that does not know the COVID vaccine exists and how dangerous this outbreak has been to every single citizen in the country . Moving onto the Biden issue. I took the time after last week to do some research on it because anything that comes up here I tend to dig into records from other cities. New York handled a lot of it by making honorary streets or double street signs. Broadway and 103rd or West 103rd Street is Broadway and Humphrey Bogart Place. There is nothing saying that if you want to make Spruce Street Biden Street, Biden Way, whatever you'd want to name it that you have to eliminate Spruce Street. You could make a second name as an honorary name for that have it on the signs and have it as a same exact draw to Center City without causing the issue of eliminating Spruce Street as a name. It would basically have two names. And it would be recognize d under those two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 names. That's how most cities handle it because in looking at this, it is not only the problem of businesses with web optimization for web searches , for business cards, for street names and promotional that go along with Spruce Street; but it is also a fact that every person who has a residence on there is then obligate d to and get a new driver's license or get that fixed. If they have a car, they need to change the registration within a period of time. Not only is it businesses , but everyone who lives -- for an example , the Jermyn apartments . If they have that as a residence , they to go out and change all the documentation -- legal documents for that. A lot of cities also took a look at whether or not deeds would have to be changed because it's tied to a legal street name and most have said that's not the issue because they coordinate with the license and deeds because it's done by lot numbers rather than street names. But it's another bit of mechanic s at work when you change the name of a street. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 find no issue with the changing the Expressway 's name. I just think it would be more reasonable for Center City and Spruce Street to choose the path if you want to put an honorary name in there of dual naming it rather than substituting Biden Street for Spruce Street. And that would solve a lot of the issues and financial impact because there would be none. They could choose whether they wanted to use Biden Street as their business street or continue on with Spruce Street. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you have a good night. Next speaker is Joseph Albert. Mr. Albert, you're up. MR. ALBERT: Members of the Scranton City Council , I thank you for the opportunity to speak with you this evening . As an unaccustomed public speaker I hope you bear with me. I come before you as a resident of Scranton , a business owner in Scranton and a veteran . And may I suggest that this Honorable Council reconsider and table the resolution proposing the renaming of two key 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 transportation arteries into the City of Scranton for the 46th President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden, for several reasons . First, protocol s in society are such that one does not name building s, ships, airport s and roads for living people. One waits until they are deceased and all embarrassing information has been exposed . Case in point, let me give you Lackawanna College here in Scranton which embarrassingly had to remove from buildings and walls the names of a federally convicted felon who despite bringing millions of dollars and numerous jobs, including the construction of a medical school was never the less a convict ed federal criminal who did not deserve to be honored . Second, the City of Scranton does not own the exit off of Interstate 81 north and south. That artery is owned by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . And I don't remember PennDOT gifting that road to Scranton . PennDOT is responsible for maintaining that road. Third, you, the Council , decided 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 without consultation nor approval of business es and residents located on Spruce Street just to change the name. Mr. Gaughan , if you wanted to rename a street in honor of the 46th President , why not rename Gilbert Street? Oh, you live there. Or perhaps we should consider renaming Forest Glen Drive Joe Biden Drive, right, Councilman ? Or perhaps we can do Gibbons Street, right, Councilman Donahue ? I know, let's do St. Ann's. How about that, Councilman McAndrew ? Council people, the bottom line is simply Joe Biden has done nothing for Scranton except to claim that as his birth place. And in over 40 years on the public payroll as a U.S. Senator , eight years as Vice President and seven months as the 46th President , what has Joe Biden done for Scranton ? Nothing . You want to recognize Joe Biden, put a welcome to Scranton birth place of Joe Biden, 46th President of United States sign at the entrance to the City off of Interstate 81. And one last thing, speaking as a retired US Army officer , in 1975 when the 38th President of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 United States, Gerald Ford was trying to evacuate as many people as possible from South Vietnam who had helped us before the Viet Cong could get to them, he ran out of money. He went to the Congress . The House approved it. It went to the Senate. One hundred senators voted for it 99 to 1. The one Senator who voted no, the Senior Senator from Delaware , Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Thank you. I urge you to table this resolution . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . As I spoke a few weeks ago, I would be honored to have Spruce Street and the Expressway named after our president . Not many people could say they live in the city that they have the President of the United States. And as far as changing addresses with today's technology , it should be very easy to change addresses . I'm not good with technology . I don't know a lot about it. But it shouldn 't be that difficult to change addresses . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 And as you stated last week, Councilman Gaughan , we already have many streets named after presidents , Washington Ave., Jefferson , Madison, Monroe. So precedence has been set already . And I think you should pass that legislation tonight . Next thing, when I was here two weeks ago, I talked about the stop sign at Dorothy Street and James Robeson Way. That was Tuesday night. I walked my the dog that Thursday afternoon and a new stop sign was there already . So I want to thank Director Preambo and DPW for doing a great job. That was less than 48 hours later they changed that sign. So I think they did a great job. Another of my favorite subjects , utilities . Still on Bulwer Street where I live, still four pave cuts which are getting worse by the week and nothing 's been done. As I stated two weeks ago, you have to almost stop going over those pave cuts because you're going to get a flat tire. So I don't know what it's going to be. The utilities are killing all our streets . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Main Avenue which was paved I'd say less than five years ago from Taylor to North Scranton and from Linden Street to Jackson Street, there's one huge pave cut the length of the street and other cross pave cuts. And it's terrible . You get streets paved around here and they don't last too long. The utilities are killing us. I know Main Avenue is PennDOT . It's a state road. Maybe we could send a letter to them. I don't know. That whole street from Linden to Jackson should be repaved. Next thing, fireworks , so, like, approximately until 10 days after the 4th of July there was still fireworks going off in Tripp Park. I don't know what the solution is but something 's got to be done. Everybody thinks it's a holiday day every day of the week anymore. And lastly, the article in the paper last week about John Basalyga wanting to build a 17 floor skyscraper , I for one think that's exciting news. He plans on having a lot of retail shops on the bottom floors, several floors of professional space with anchor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 tenants , possibly apartment s or condominiums in the upper levels. We haven't had anything like that here in my lifetime . And maybe a building like that could attract businesses with high paying jobs. Maybe they are looking for office space from another city. Maybe they could bring it here and bring good paying jobs to the City which is exactly what we need. We need good paying jobs in the City. And I was very-outspoken about what he did with the mall. I hate what he did with the mall. But I think this is exciting news. And I hope he goes forward with that project . I think it will be a positive thing for the City. And that's all I have. One question , is next week the last meeting until the summer break? MR. GAUGHAN : Correct . Yes. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Well, I don't know if I'll be here next week. But if not, I hope everybody enjoys the rest of the summer. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. You as well. And, Mr. Voldenberg , can you forward Mr. Spindler 's complaints to the DPW? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is John Hein or Heim. MR. HEIM: I am John Heim and I'm here with my wife Carol. We're from Clarks Summit. We own both buildings of 406 and 408 Spruce Street. We also own Bartari and we own Scoops on Spruce. We're here to urge you not to change the name of Spruce Street because it's not an easy process . We've spent millions of dollars renovating empty buildings in the City. And for us to change the name of Spruce Street we have to get into roof warranties , window warranties , business names, businesses , stationary . It goes on and on and on. And we worked real hard with Scoops on Spruce to get known in this city. For the first two years we were open, no one even knew we were there. We're finally getting name recognition as Scoops on Spruce. And people are coming to our business . And now we're going to change the name. So we have to start and rebuild our business again? I urge the five of you to pick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 a date and a time, make it publically known, put it in the newspaper , put it on TV, get together and go down and walk down Spruce Street and stop and see the business owners. And the reason to make it public is business owners aren't there all the time. They could make sure they're there so they could talk to you about the inconvenience of changing the name and how it hurts their business . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Next speaker is Stephanie Grudis. MS. GRUDIS: Hello. I'm Stephanie Grudis and I own two businesses on Spruce Street, Tom Grudis Optical which was established in 1980 and The Bare Accessories which came to fruition in 2012. I know you've heard both sides to this situation . But I think really the people you need to listen to are the business owners. I think every business owner on Spruce Street should be able to speak their mind. I think you need to get a forum and get them together , ask them what they want. Nothing against Council , but you do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 not have a monetary stake in this game. You think it will better the City, which it might. But you're going to have to do more than change a street name. We have more problems downtown than a street name. Until you do something about parking , I don't care what you name Spruce Street nothing will change. So I beg of you to table this resolution . And as the last gentleman said, talk to the people that own businesses on Spruce street. That's your job. That's what you should do. You need to get their input. They're the ones most impacted by your decision tonight . You want to better the City, well, start by taking into consideration those businesses -- those taxpaying people because the cost -- it's not as easy as contacting the post office and changing your name. Not so. Stationery , you have no idea -- and I have two businesses . And the last gentleman , I don't want to be in his shoes because the cost for him, astronomical . You say there's a bigger picture that you're looking for with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 changing the name. Well, I think we need to see what that bigger picture is. Therefore , table the resolution , get these businesses together , talk to them. See what they want. See what's going to be better for them and then let's decide. And what's the rush? He's only been President since January . What is the rush to change the name so quickly ? I don't understand it. It's been Spruce Street for how long? Another year or so, is it going to make a difference if we table the resolution ? Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, hello Council , Ronnie Ellman of Scranton . I'd like to change the subject a little bit about that tragedy in Dunmore where the young man was shot. Maybe, just maybe if he had a free gun lock on that rifle that wouldn't have happened . But otherwise , these were military people and they had a live chamber -- a live bullet in the chamber which you don't transport guns like that. I really hope they just throw the book at that fellow. He killed someone . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 And next about that quad on the government property that hit and run, it's time. It's past time to do something . And it's very simple. These quads are uninsured , uninspected , no license plates. Confiscate them. And when the owner comes in, charge them with state charges . That will scare them and start keeping them off the streets maybe. And one of my favorite subjects lately is Friends of Lackawanna . I see where they imported protesters . Friends of Lackawanna are just -- they're just a group that made a very, very poor decision in buying their property . Now they want the taxpayers to get them out of it. The state's not going to do nothing for them. They want a buyout. They're going to keep harping away with the silly reasoning of theirs, you know, the landfill is over 100 years old. The houses are built on a very poor location . Let them go after the builder s or their realtors . There won't be no buyout. The state's trying to make that positive . And you people -- you're choosing the wrong side. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 need to be on the side of the State of Pennsylvania . Well, I know you won't like this but I'm fed up with developers in this City being treated like heros. They are a bunch of leeches . They suck the City dry. We need money now from taxes, not 10 years from now. Look what happened over here on Keyser Avenue with those apartments . I forgot how many there were. If just one -- one -- one apartment has one child going to school for six, eight years, look how they beat the taxes. This tax abatement stuff doesn't help the taxpayers . According to our paper, 20 percent of the people in the City are seniors . In Georgia , seniors don't pay house taxes. It looks like it's time for a sales tax. You're just pushing the wrong things. It's time to start thinking there's more than downtown in the City of Scranton . For years Council after Council had given 3 million dollars to Lackawanna College to repair buildings that aren't even on the pay -- you need to start thinking about three-quarters of the City besides downtown . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Go out here in the street. These people don't care about preserving buildings . You got the paper today, 18 apartments going to be there. He's not going to pay taxes. It's just time to terminate all of this ridiculous tax abatement s and everything . You people, you're just not facing the reality that the City is in. It's not in good shape. Everybody might keep saying it but it's not. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I think Tommy must have read my mind on the way over because that was my solution that I was going to suggest for Spruce Street tonight . Retain Spruce Street and make it Joe Biden Way. That way, everybody is happy. It's a win-win. You don't have any disruptions . I could see where that would be pretty disruptive to some of these people. And we don't need any -- to lose any more businesses . That's for sure. Most of the mall is history except for Boscov's and an occasional shoe store, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 something like that. COVID, once again in some states triple digit uptick. How long do people have to continue to just be outright stupid? I couldn't wait to get my shots. I called and called and called and finally I was feeling like kind of safe on the middle of June. It's just crazy. So please go out and get your shots. Dial 211. They'll be helpful . It's a must. Okay, budget for an IT man in 2022, please. We have to pay somebody the wage they're worth. And you're not going to get anybody at $61,000. I read the paper today. And a little suggestion with all of the properties that Scranton U once again took over, maybe they could lend us some people from their computer science department in lieu of taxes instead of just complaining about their pilot and how it should be spent and demanding . I don't get to tell anybody how my taxes should be spent. I have to pay them. That's it. And keep in mind, 30 million dollars or more every year from the school district , how many old people may have lost 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 their homes already over that kind of money not coming in from the state. Now, once again, my favorite subject , Mastriano . I think he's a State Senator or Representative subpoenaed voting machine s in York County and one other Center County or something . And a thought popped into my head. Will those machines be replaceable by this November ? We may not even be able to hold an election if he gets his paws on those machines in the fraudit . And that's what it is. It's a fraudit . Those people are out in Arizona are from QAnon. In Texas, there's -- part of their bill that the people fled the state could be criminal to persuade someone even elderly or ailing relative to get out and vote. Yeah, and if you try to convince them who they should vote for, you could be arrested for that. There's all kinds of misdemeanor s and felonies written into that law just for the right to vote. And there's hundreds of proposed bills in every state. Almost every state in the union, some won't pass. Our Governor won't pass it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 But who knows what's going to happen to him or us as of, what is it, 2024? He's in until 2022. So that's a year and a half off. So he's holding down -- back. He's got his finger in the dike. And when these hacks come in and start making their qualifications and phoney statements and getting people fired up and in their fraudit , then, you know, who knows what we'll have for Governor . This started with the Republicans . And by the way, I still think that anybody that is taxable should have the right to vote, not paying taxes, taxable . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I think I'll be relatively brief tonight . I did stay home so I could hear the caucus on ECTV since you can't hear it in the room here. You guys sort of blew my mind away last week when you voted 5 to 0 on the what is tonight 7-A because I thought why? You had all these people here that I thought you were suppose d to represent . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 thought that's what you did. But I was faced with a reality that you do what you want. And I am struggling a lot. I have a lot of as you know comment s on issues and ideas. I wonder if it's worthwhile . You people I am convinced are going to do whatever you want, not represent the people. And I'm just very saddened by what you have done and I don't think there's -- with all the options there are and were, to do what you are doing to so many people it's pathetic . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? You already spoke, sir. You only get one shot. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just a few comment s. So I'd like to thank DPW and the administration with helping getting a street sign for a neighbor on North Fillmore Avenue in West Scranton . I spoke with the resident and they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 were very appreciative and also to thank Tom Preambo and DPW with help for some of the flooding issues in the Keyser Valley over the weekend . I do await to see our caucus meeting to hear some updates with DPW as well as the Keyser Valley project and to talk about some of the storm drain basin maintenance . Mr. Voldenberg , I have two complaints possibly for the LIPS Department on a quality of life. One is in North Scranton I will send to you after the meeting and also to follow up with the property over in the Hill Section . So I'll follow up after the meeting with an e-mail to you. And that is all, President Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have a few concerns brought to me by concerned resident s. And I'll just go through them quickly . One is actually a question I'm posing. Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please reach out to the police department . So this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 gentleman 's issue is he has a detached garage with a driveway that's not really suited to park. And he's an elderly gentleman who wants to apply for a handicap placard . So his concerns are because he has a garage and the garage is mostly for storage , he really can't get his car in and the garage is twice the distance to his front house than if he was to park in front of his house or at least his driveway . So he's concerned with ADA Act and equitable because he has some other neighbors in his area that were allowed to have handicap signs or placards . So I guess he previously , you know, a couple of years ago requested one and it was denied. So if we can please just see what we can do for this gentleman , okay? And then secondly , let's see here. Some are on my phone. I apologize . Some were text. So the second one is on St. Ann Street, 1145-1147. There is quality of life issues. I had a bunch of photos sent to me. There's some overgrown grass. There is multiple police calls. So this will be a dual inquiry to the LIPS Department and the Police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Department . There's a car parked there almost a year that's halfway on the driveway and halfway on some sidewalks with flat tires. So please look into that for me. And then there was -- let me see here. Excuse me, one second. The issue with Lenahan Avenue -- the 1200 block of Lenahan Avenue -- I just want to bring it up here. We've been trying to hash this for a while -- for a long time. It was back in -- initially his concern s -- this concerned resident brought forth a bunch of issues with this property in the 1200 block of Lenahan Avenue. And that was initially in last February . So there was correspondence that we received because we brought this forth again -- or I brought this forth again in May. And the feedback we got from the LIPS Department was, a citation has been filled or filed, I'm sorry, and we're waiting a court date. Well, since then nothing has changed . I have more pictures -- recent picture s sent to me today with garbage all over the property , high grass, etc. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 So if you could please -- them two issues I brought up I will forward the pictures I have and you could took take a look at that. And then last -- well, not lastly. I have another issue with water. This one is up at west mountain . It's a lengthy concern . I asked for bullets but that's okay. Let me just find that. And this also has a bunch of pictures . So after any rain or snow or thaw, we have constant water running which is -- of course leads to ice in the winter. So a lot of this isn't water runoff. My understanding is the concerned resident believes that it's an underwater street, okay? So the ditches are dangerous all year long. We have a number cars and trucks land in them. The City's past solution has been to dig out the ditches and place large rocks in them. They did that. And I remember them doing that. It looks great until the leaves fall and then the ditches are too full of rocks and leaves hold water. All right, so along with that the intersection of Fig Street -- and I'll forward all this to you. You don't have to write this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 down. It's lengthy . So the intersection of Fig Street and Froude Avenue at the beginning of the 1500 block seem to have a blocked pipe on the 1400 side of Fig Street. This is my opinion the source of some of the water. I believe a new pipe and storm drain would resolve this part of the problem . And also the 1500 block side of the intersection is so clogged that little water goes into the ditch. Again, a storm drain might relieve this. There also seems to be an issue with parts of Fig Street as water also runs across it. The 1500 block of Froude Avenue has several elderly people who often need ambulances . The ice makes the block impassible . So my understanding this resident also expressed that, you know, the constant water even though it's not always just rain because it's underwater stream, they're constantly calling DPW during the winter for salt trucks. So there's issues with elderly people, ambulance s can't even make it up the hill. So that's a concern . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Let's see here. So unfortunately in the winter of 2018 and '19, our road was dug up for sewers. It was replaced in June of '19. However , my curbs were not restored. Due to this, we're getting water in our garage. All right, so like I said earlier , I will send all of this correspondence to you and the related picture s. And if you could please forward this over to the LIPS Department so we get some type of resolve or feedback . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then lastly, three weeks ago I asked for a job description for Business Administrator , three weeks. And the latest -- and thank you, Mr. Voldenberg , for staying on this. So the latest response I got from Miss Viola in the HR Department is they don't have a copy. They can't find one. So -- but they're going to create one. So I look forward to seeing that document . And thank you for following up and we'll stay on that. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few comments . First, I would just like to thank OECD along with the Director for Housing , Liza Carroll for their help. Someone came to me, their parents who are an elderly couple are having issues with their roof for a number of years and are not in a financial position to pay for it and reached out to see if there was something we can do to assist them. And I was happy to see that they were able to get their roof replaced through a weather ization program from the Scranton Lackawanna Human Development Agency. So, yeah, I think that there are a lot of positive things that we can do to help homeowner s and property owners in this City. So if people are having issues like that that they'd like to bring to Council , then I'm happy to direct them to the appropriate departments and see if we're able to assist them in a cost like that. And the next thing I wanted to bring up with Birch Street which has been a topic for a long time and the street was completed -- the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 work that was being done there from American Water I believe in April and a resident complained to me that there was still issues with the paving of the street. And there's quite the dip in the street. And I've actually driven down there myself and noticed the issue as well as some grates. So I wanted to ask about the status if there would be any further adjustment s to the work on Birch Street. It does not seem to be satisfactory for those who drive on this street daily. And I know we've been in touch previously with Miss Coleman so if we could reach back out to her, Mr. Voldenberg , I'd appreciate that. And a couple of other concerns that I have that I previously brought up and we had sent correspondence s to SPD to our police department . First, related to the issue of fireworks , I know I've noticed in my neighborhood that it's been improved over the past few weeks. But that doesn't mean that's the case throughout the City. And I have requested information on number a citations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 issued or responses to calls related to fireworks and I haven't receive d a response yet. So if we can send another correspondence I would appreciate that information from our police department . And I also haven't received a response regarding any citations for the illegal parking that's taking place on Harrison Avenue. I will be doing a walkthrough of Harrison Avenue I believe from the 100 block upwards of the 700 or 800 block with an inspector from our LIPS Department and hopefully from -- someone from SPD to discuss the ongoing issues on that road. And that's all that I have for Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just quickly , Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to check with someone in IT regarding Mrs. Hodowanitz 's request for the CBAs on the website? I agree those should be on there. I think it was fire and Single Tax Office. Mr. Spindler also brought up Main Avenue, the extent of work on Main Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 should require UGI to do full restoration once that work is complete . Usually it doesn't start right after but they'll factor that in so it should be repaved relatively shortly . And then lastly, I did see where Amtrak has entered into a joint planning agreement with the Northeast Regional Railroad Authority that will allow for Amtrak to conduct a study that will explore the feasibility of both the potential commuter and noncommuter ridership between New York City and Scranton . This is an important first step to begin the process of restoring train service to New York City and Scranton. And it is very encouraging . That's all I have for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I have a few things. Last week I had mentioned an issue with CVS in Minooka with weeds growing all over the place. And it was just unkept, the landscaping . So they did -- the City sent an inspector out there. The manager informed them that CVS hired a new landscaping crew that does not do their work. The manager was frustrate d with the situation as well. The inspector gave them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 three days from July 19th to clean it up or they would have been issued a quality of life ticket. It's my understanding they did clean it up. So I do want to thank the Licensing and Inspections Department . It was also brought to my attention that on the corner of Mulberry and Wyoming another convenient store, same thing, weeds all over the place. And it looks really bad. Mr. Voldenberg , if we can send something to Licensing and Inspections if they could have someone in each neighborhood spend a week or so focusing just on the Convenient , CVS, things like that. I've noticed even driving through the City some of these businesses are really letting weeds get high and the grass get very high. Thank you. Also, we are still in the process of scheduling a caucus with the DPW for the first few weeks of September and also on Meadow Brook Creek Project . Mr. Voldenberg , there was a $50,000 transfer from the Workers ' Compensation Fund, professional services in the Business Administration office if you can follow up with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 them and find out the reasoning for that transfer . I would appreciate it. That came across our desk earlier today. Last week Miss Hodowanitz asked about the process of how an inspector in the Licensing and Inspections office works through giving a business or a homeowner a ticket. So I just want to run through that because I think it would be beneficial to the general public as well. So Licensing and Inspections inspector , they receive d a complaint in their respective inspector mailbox each day. And they will -- or they should respond that day. The inspect or then travels to the property in question , inspects the issue, issues a violation letter to the property owner via both certified mail and regular U.S. Mail. Picture s are then taken to document the violations . And depending on the violation they are given a minimum of two days to rectify that the violation . Certified mail is received and the inspector then visits the property a second time to follow up. Citations are issued if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 violation s are not rectified . Pictures are then taken a second time as proof of further documentation . The inspector and the supervisor then determine if an action by the magistrate is warrant ed. Once papers are then filed with the magistrate , the property owner is given the opportunity to plead guilty or not guilty to the charges . If the property owner claims not guilty, a hearing date is set at the discretion of the magistrate with the scheduling timeframe depending on the charge of the violation . So it's not a quick process . And I know over the last several years since I've been on Council , people do expect things to happen over night in terms of an action like high grass or a complaint like high grass and things like that. And generally , the Licensing and Inspections Department has been successful . But in some of these cases when it gets to the magistrate it does take some time. So hopefully that explains the process there. The second question -- MR. MCANDREW : Can this get posted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 on the website ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. MCANDREW : I mean, so people have access to it. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. MCANDREW : Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : The second question that you had, Miss Hodowanitz , was about the mission statement from the Scranton Lackawanna Health and Welfare Authority . And that was provided to us. It is a municipality authority incorporated jointly by the City of Scranton and County of Lackawanna . And it is existing under and governed by the provision s of the Municipality Authorities Act of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . And that was effective June 19th, 2001 which codifies and amends the Municipality Authorities Act of 1945. The Authorities Act permits the Authority to assist in the financing of buildings and facilities for eligible borrowers , primarily nonprofit health care and education al institution s and certain other nonprofit entities . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 The Authority acts as a conduit issuer so that eligible borrowers can borrow funds at a tax exempt interest rate and thereby reduce their borrowing cost. The Authority does not lend funds and has no repayment obligations in connection with these financings . The Authority is simply a conduit issuer. Commercial banks or investment banks make the loans to the eligible borrowers and the Authority is involved so that the loans may be made at a tax exempt interest rate. The Authorities Act require s for certain types of financings that the incorporating municipalities like the City or the County approve the financing . So that's why over the last few years you've seen us have to approve certain project s with Marywood , University of Scranton , so on and so forth. So hopefully that answers your question . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

Mr. Smurl has previously served on the Authority and then someone took his place when he resigned. And now he's back. He is a very valuable , valuable asset to the Recreation Authority and specifically at Nay Aug Park. I know him and others on the Recreation Authority have done a lot of work at Nay Aug Park on their on dime and do a ton of volunteer work up there. So I'm very pleased to see Mr. Smurl back on the board. Anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I agree.

FOR INTRODUCTION â€“ A RESOLUTION â€“ ALLOWING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT , CENTER FOR BUSINESS FINANCING â€“ GRANTS OFFICE, FOR A MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS GRANT TO BE UTILIZED FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON INTERMODAL STREET SIGN PROJECT WITH A CURRENT ESTIMATE OF $400,000.00. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm very pleased to see this on our agenda tonight . Ms. Jeffries , a frequent Council speaker I'm sure will also be glad to see this on our agenda. She was pushing for the last few years for an update to some of the signs -- street signs, stop signs and other signs throughout the City that have been faded. It's things like this, the little things in the neighborhood that really matter. When you're driving through the Hill Section or other neighborhood s in the City and you see street signs that are hanging down that they're faded, it looked bad. It looks bad for the neighborhood . It looks bad for the City. This is going to correct that. I want to take a second and thank our DPW, the workers and the Street Sign Department who have been working tirelessly with only I believe a three man crew on 26 square miles of signs that are faded and have to be replaced, not just street signs, stop signs and a lot of other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 signs. And they've really been doing a phenomenal job. As Mr. Spindler mentioned tonight , we submitted a concern about a stop sign and two days later they were out almost immediately to replace that. So they do have a very large job in front of them for that small size crew. But they do a great job. So I want to thank them. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION â€“ A RESOLUTION â€“ SUPPORTING NEIGHBORWORKS NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA â€™S APPLICATION TO THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO DESIGNATE THE WEST SCRANTON NEIGHBORHOOD FOCUS AREA AS A KEYSTONE ELM STREET. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , again NeighborWorks does a fantastic job. They did a really great job over in South Side with the Elm Street designation on Cedar Avenue. Anyone -- obviously we're all familiar with West Scranton . This part of West Scranton needs revitalization and redevelopment . This group -- there's no better group in the City or I think in the State of Pennsylvania that could take this project on and that can get results . So I'm very confident in them and I look forward to seeing their results . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 77, 2021 â€“ AUTHORIZING THE RENAMING OF SPRUCE STREET AND THE CENTRAL SCRANTON EXPRESSWAY IN HONOR OF UNITED STATES PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to say that this is a great day for the City of Scranton . Once again I want to thank my colleagues for being a part of this momentous occasion in supporting this effort. I also want to thank all the committee members for their input and all of their work which was extremely important . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Councilman Donahue , Kevin Hayes our Solicitor , Mark Dougher , Roberta Jadick, Don King, Leslie Collins and Lori West. I also want to personally thank Councilman Schuster , Councilman McAndrew and Dr. Rothchild for their support . On election day, November 3rd, 2020, Joe Biden could have been anywhere else in the United States of America . He could have been in Washington . He could have been travelling in all the swing states across the country . But where was he? He was here. He was in his hometown, the City of Scranton . While he was here that day he stopped at his childhood home on North Washington Avenue and he wrote a message on the wall, "From this House to the White House with the grace of God." And with the grace of God a Scrantonian was elected to the highest office in the land as our 46th President of the United States. So it is fitting that tonight we vote in honoring President Biden by renaming not only the Central Scranton Expressway but also Spruce Street after him. In my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 estimation , this represents a new chapter in our history as a City. A chapter that says we are not afraid of change, we are not afraid to do something different that our people, future generations can be anything that they want to be. They could be anything that they put their minds to. They'll get knocked down and face adversity and hardship just like our President and like our City has. But they will keep getting back up and moving forward . Over the last few months I've heard from hundreds of people including many business owners on Spruce Street that are excited for this change. And I've received many positive comment s from business owners on Spruce Street. We've also heard tonight from some business owners who are opposed to this and I respect their opinions as well. As I said last week, I have gotten a commitment from the Mayor and her administration that we will work with the small business owners on Spruce Street throughout this transition . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 I want to make a note that this whole process was publicize d in the newspaper , on the front page of the newspaper . It was publicized multiple times in the newspaper and we've also had three weeks of public comment . Also Leslie Collins the Executive Director of Scranton Tomorrow was on our committee and wholeheartedly endorsed our approach . We took a measured approach to this. And the committee met several times over the last few months. And we weighed all of the different concerns . As the gentleman noted I think his name is Mr. Loreto, this sort of thing happens all the time across the country . I think really we should wear this as a badge of honor. Someone mentioned about renaming the Express way after Congress man McDade and Governor Casey. And they deserve that. We're talking about the President -- not only the President of the United States, we're talking about a Senator , a Vice President and a President who grew up on North Washington Avenue. So I do think that this is fitting. And I don't think we should be as a Council or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 as a City afraid to make this change. I mentioned last week to everyone and I truly do believe this that this is going to benefit the City, the downtown and the business owners in the future. We have to look at the big picture here. This is going to bring people from all over -- I think the country . Anyone who travels down Interstate 81 will be coming into the City of Scranton to see the hometown of Joe Biden our President . So I think it's very, very important . I also want to say that I look forward to inviting President Biden and our First Lady to the unveiling ceremony when we have the new signs ready to go in the near future to celebrate this great accomplishment . And again, I want to thank everyone for this. I think it's a great night for the City of Scranton . Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes.
