ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: I'm going to save all my comments for agenda items tonight . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Just to comment quickly on our caucus with See, Click, Fix It. I think it's a great concept and I don't think it's a matter of if it's how we are going to go about doing that. A couple of weeks ago I asked for an update on Crowley Park and I received back some updates . Some sink holes were identified in the parking lot that the city engineer is going to review. The meeting took place with a conservation district and they are going to have to get permits from them. The whole design stayed the same. There is going to be improvements to the area around the play equipment . Trees are being saved along the walkway . A lot of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 asphalt is going. Storm water is being looked at and a rain garden is being constructed in the area where water pools. And then on the issue with the residency waiver for Mr. Bulzoni , this is one of those issues where I tend to understand and agree with the arguments on both sides, so tonight I'm going to vote to introduce it, but at this point I can't see myself voting for final passage . And that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Thank you, just a few. Earlier this evening we had our caucus and we participated in a Power Point presentation on See, Click, Fix, so for those who didn't recall my comments last time on the issue it's basically a request and work management tool that empowers and engages citizens by giving them the ability to report quality of life issues through an app on their phone. It also allows a city to be more responsive , transparent and efficient in handling those requests all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 while keeping a citizen informed of the status of their complaint along the way. It also provides analytics that would allow the administration and city council to more closely monitor the success of those items and clearing them along the way. Efficient , engaged and transparent government is something we should all strive for and we should never shy away from it so I think See, Click, Fix could be an integral component in that endeavor and I fully, solely endorse that fully because it's something that I think we definitely need and efficient government is always a good thing. I attended several community events since the last city council meeting . Last Tuesday , I attended along with several of my council colleagues the annual police memorial service to remember their fallen officers . As usual, it was a beautiful and solemn service that continues to remind us all of the dangers of being a police officer . They put their lives on the line every day for us and that should never be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 taken for granted . This is my fourth year attending the ceremony and I always find it to be inspirational , simple and an effective message and as well as the musical message again reinforced by the talented chorus from Scranton High School. On Thursday , I attended the 25th anniversary celebration of Scranton Tomorrow and as well as I'm very proud to have been part of Scranton Tomorrow from it's infancy . I was there in the very beginning when they had the forging the future plan that became the blueprint for Scranton Tomorrow 25 years ago so I'm happy to be able to be part of that and part of the participation and celebration as well as the new role in the new Scranton Tomorrow and it's vision for the next 25 years as they move forward being the lead on the creation of a downtown business improvement district which is something I have been advocating for for decades . So congratulations to Scranton Tomorrow on their 25th anniversary and to Leslie Collins and the many volunteers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 involved over the years. Thank you for all of you have done for the downtown Scranton , all you have been doing in the years here to come. On Saturday I attended and walked in the Armed Services Parade. It was and has been an honor the past several years to be part of this event. It was certainly a very small sacrifice on my part to walk the parade route in Saturday 's rain especially considering all that our current and past armed services and forces have done for us. It always says a lot about who we are as a city and a community and how we honor our veterans as well as our active duty military . And, finally , on a totally separate note, I took a walk on Sunday morning in downtown and stopped to see for the first time Renaissance Park, which is the elevated park along Bogart Court in the 500 block of Lackawanna Avenue. So I would urge anyone who has the time while they are downtown to stop and check it out. It's a very unique and very interesting urban park within our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 city and a great place to catch some interesting news as well as a place where you can relax for a nice break while you are downtown on several of the benches that are located there, so it's another asset that we have downtown that I think a lot of people haven't had a chance to take a look and check out. Otherwise , all my comments on agenda items will be at that time. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you, quite a few. First of all, I usually don't respond to nonsense at these meetings but I would like to say one thing about the Armed Services Parade. You know, I have marched in that parade since I have been a councilman , I have attended it before I was a councilman . I was not at the most recent parade this weekend because of some family issues. My wife had surgery , she is fine, and we had a death in the family. So when Mr. Bolus gets up and, you know, makes some kind of nonsensical remark about not supporting the veterans because we don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 attend a parade that is just nonsense . My father is a United States Marine. Both of my grandparents were -- both of my grandpas were in the military , almost all of my uncles were in the military . So just because you don't attend a parade does not mean that you don't support veterans. So I just wanted to make sure that everyone understood that and I'm sure you already did. On the caucus that we had with See, Click, Fix, I would agree with Councilman Evans and the rest of my colleagues , you know, I think that one of the biggest complaints that I have gotten in the last four and a half years being a councilman is that someone calls city hall and they make a complaint and then that's the last they ever hear usually from anybody involved in city government . So whether or not their problem gets fixed, either they are not sure or they have to call back or when they do call back they get told to call the Sewer Authority or now Pennsylvania American Water, Licensing and Inspections and they get bounced around 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 all over the place. This software will allow city government to organize all of these requests . It's going to streamline everything and it's going to make it more transparent in my opinion . And obviously from the caucus that we had earlier tonight it has worked in I believe 320 other cities larger and smaller than the City of Scranton . Somebody mentioned tonight , you know, why pay for a service like this. I think the woman that gave the presentation mentioned that it was $16,000. Well, you know, why would you pay for it? Well, why not? At this point, what we have been doing obviously has not worked based on the volume of complaints that we all have gotten. So if something hasn't been working then why would you continue to do it, you know, for the next several years. Why not change it. And that's really the mentality in this building not just in this administration but in prior administration s that this is the way we have always done it, you know, we are afraid of change, there is no buy in, let's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 just stick with what we know. I think that we should, you know, if the table is not set in your favor flip the table over and try something different and I think is going to accomplish that. So I'm supporting it 100 percent . I hope we meet with the you administration soon and we get the ball rolling here. On a more somber note, I'd like to ask everyone to keep my wife's family in their prayers . We did have -- we lost my wife's grandmother Mary McLane from North Scranton , she passed away this morning . She was a life-long Scranton resident , active in politics in the city for her entire life. She was a staple in Ward 1, Precinct 1, Bangor Heights. Never missed an election working the polls. She was one of my biggest supporters . When I campaigned the first time around as I was making my way throughout the city I stopped at Park Gardens, knocked on somebody 's door, I went to introduce myself they told me Mary McLane had already called. In fact, she called three times and if she called again they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 weren't going to vote for me and then went all around North Scranton and all around the city. So, you know, she is going to be dearly missed. She was a class act. One of those members of the greatest generation and my prayers are with my wife's family at this time. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just a couple of comments , I echo the comments of my colleagues regarding the See, Click, Fix presentation . It does seem like a very good way to bridge the gap between those in the community when they see a problem and those in the city that are in charge of fixing those problems . I do think especially with, you know, the vast majority of people have a smart phone or have access to somebody who does, it's very easy to just take a picture of a pothole or a problem in your neighborhood and send it into the right person, so it does sound like a very good idea. The cost does seem a little high to me so hopefully that is something we could work on negotiating down with the vendor, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 but it is an idea I think that really can help our city quite a bit. This has been brought up a number of the times so I'm going to address it regarding the illegal health care at the Sewer Authority of Jim Mulligan . I agree with the Sewer Authority and their request to recoup those funds. I would hope the school board would do the same thing regarding the illegal health care benefits that have been rendered over there, and I think that it would make sense for the Sewer Authority to look at other solicitors that may have received the same illegal health care benefit . So I do commend them for taking this action and I know Mr. Bolus brought it up, but it was a motion by this counsel that initiated this process by sending it to the Attorney General 's Office for review. They came back with their opinion that it was a civil matter and then it will be up to the Sewer Authority to file suit against Mr. Mulligan or anyone else that has received the illegal benefits . Mr. Evans brought up the police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 memorial . Again, a very moving ceremony and he mention ed. Again, I can't say enough how great of a police department we have in this city and to thank our police officers locally and nationally or all they do to keep us safe. Regarding the Bulzoni appointment , I think one of the speakers , Mr. Spindler, hit the nail on the head with this one. This is not something that is new despite what some people want to say. The proper process is being followed when there is an employee that a mayor wants to appoint who lives outside of the city. The proper procedure is to send legislation to council for a waiver and then council has a choice of voting up or down, which we will do this week and next week. In the past, it was done once previously where a director was given a waiver without going to city council . If that was the case, it would not be appropriate . That would be circumventing the rules so council members can vote as they wish how they feel on this waiver. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Personally I have been on council almost ten years now and Mr. Bulzoni is by far the best business administrator that we have ever had. Do I wish that he would move in the city? Of course. Do I think it's fair that he lives outside of the city and the rest of the city employees do not? No, I don't think it's fair, but I think in the best interest of the city to have a competent business administrator who knows what they are doing and will do a good job for the city, I think having him as business administrator is the right move. And that is all. MS. REED: 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR DAVID BULZONI , CITY OF SCRANTON BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question , I know I spoke briefly on this during participation , but as far as I'm concerned Dave Bulzoni has been a fantastic business administrator for the City of Scranton . He has seen us through some very difficult 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 times. I thought he did it with just the best communication skills that I think I have ever seen and without pulling any bunches our business administration hasn't been the same since he has left. Through no fault of anybody 's, it just no one has reached in my opinion the standard that Dave set for a BA in the City of Scranton . He does live outside of the city. I think -- I'm with everybody , I wish he did live in the City of Scranton , but Section 66 is put there to make sure we have the best of the best to serve the city and the citizens of Scranton . If there was somebody that was going to take the job, they would have already taken it when Dave left the first time, but we put that job out for awhile and, you know, we weren't getting blown in by application s or applicants , so in my opinion this is exactly what Section 66 is made for to make sure that the city has the best person available for the job, and that's my opinion on that. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. GAUGHAN : Wait. Sure. I'm going to be voting against this waive for several reasons , and let me preface my comments by saying that I believe Mr. Bulzoni , as I mention ed earlier in this meeting , does an admirable job as our business administrator . This isn't about his job performance . It's not about who is best. This is a matter, in my opinion of principal . The public rightly excepts that city employees , in this specific case pulling down $90,000 a year, which is more than most people in the City of Scranton make in two or three years combined , the public excepts that that person face the same school and city property taxes, garbage fee, sewer bills, and everything else that comes along with living in the City of Scranton . This is only possible if the business administrator lives within the city. If we are going to invest in Mr. Bulzoni , then I think it's only fair that he invest in the city and live here. Remember , Mr. Bulzoni was part of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 mayor's first cabinet back in 2014. He had six months to move in the city and he did not, even though he said he would move to Scranton . At that point, my colleagues granted Mr. Bulzoni an indefinite waiver. He ended up leaving at that point a few years later for a banking job and then now decides to come back. I would argue to my colleagues that Mr. Bulzoni no longer deserves the waiver. He is choosing this job, therefore , he chooses the consequences and one of those is that you have to live in the city. Theses are the terms of employment . Every fireman , every policeman, every DPW worker, every clerical worker has to live in the city, has to pay property taxes, school and city. And as somebody mention ed tonight , they are a burden especially for our senior citizens . So what kind of message is this council and this mayor sending to city employees , to our community , to our business community that one off our highest paid employees and one who makes crucial decisions that effect every taxpayer in this city isn't willing to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 invest, isn't willing to live in the City of Scranton . I would urge my colleagues to vote against this waiver. The mayor sending us this waiver once again and allowing Mr. Bulzoni to live in Newton Township and outside of the city is unfair to every single taxpayer in the City of Scranton . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: Yes, on the question . They won't be clapping after this I'm sure. There are times that I might have supported the granting of a residency waiver. This is not one of them. Although , in all honesty I'm not quite sure it is not a practice as it relates to cabinet appointments whose time has not passed. We have seen firsthand over the past four years the level of performance by Mr. Bulzoni . We have someone who is clearly an exceptional business administrator and you have someone who has helped lead this city out of decades of financial quagmire that we were in, who has proven to be a solid partner in many of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 initiatives of this city council like Granicus , Smart Cities, the grant program for first time homebuyers, the reduction in the real estate transfer tax and the garbage fee discount and others, when you have someone like that you know at the end of the day it's in best interest of the City of Scranton , it's taxpayers , it's citizens to have him back as business administrator . The answer is easy for me. We should always have the fiduciary responsibility to effect positive change when we came, that is why I'm voting yes for this waiver. We should have the best possible people working at the cabinet level that we could find so we could become a city that people want to move to voluntarily not be forced to, so I'll be voting yes to move this legislation along. MR. GAUGHAN : I just want to make just one comment , I also agree that we need the best possible people, but it goes without saying that the message that's being sent here today the community is that Mr. Bulzoni came once for a waiver, and he got it. He left, he went to a banking job, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 then he came back to the city, he is asking for another waiver. He also got a raise to $90,000 a rear. You know, that's great but he lives in Newton Township . He needs to invest in the city and live here. He is making decisions , crucial decision s, possibly on raising property taxes, fees, decisions that effect the lives of every single person in this city, so when I look at the elderly woman on my street who pays $4,000 or $5,000 in property taxes and is up to here in her fees and everything else, and one of the highest paid employees in this building doesn't live here it sends the wrong message . I am not questioning Mr. Bulzoni 's professionalism or his capabilities as a business administrator and I told him this four years ago when I voted against the waiver of the first time, this is a matter of the fairness. This is the principal of the whole argument . Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question , I'm going to get into a debate about this issue, my point is simply I want the best of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 best period, and if takes granting a waiver then I'll accept that responsibility . MR. ROGAN: I would agree with Councilman Evans and, you know, to Councilman Gaughan 's point I understand that what he is saying sounds good and as I agree that as a matter of fairness he may be right, but I would much rather a competent business administrator that's going to be make good sound decisions for the city regardless of where they live than have an incompetent business administrator who lives in the City of Scranton . As was mentioned by my colleagues , Mr. Bulzoni does an excellent job. I don't think there is many people that could disagree. When I heard he was coming back to work for the city I was thrilled . In my time on council I have probably worked with close to half a dozen different business administrator s and it's not even close that Dave Bulzoni is head and shoulders above the rest, so I am glad that he back and I hope he will continue the good work that he put in over the first couple of years that he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 was here.
