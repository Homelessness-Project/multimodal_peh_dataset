Sharlene Stancavage Robert Stancavage Tom Coyne Lee Morgan Pat Hinton Dave Dobrzyn Marie Schumacher MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : My only comment would be in response to Joan about 511. You know, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 haven't seen a copy of any decision yet. So until I'm able to review that I wouldn't have any -- wouldn't be able to give any comment to you on that. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Attorney Dempsey , do you have any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : I do. Good evening everyone and thank you for coming. I as well receive d a letter from the Department of Licensing and Inspection . So I went to do a little investigating today. It was interesting to me because my letter is dated December 2nd and I received it Saturday via certified mail. So I received it on December 12th. And it gave me 15 days from the date of the letter, not the day of receipt to take action which would be tomorrow which is difficult for anyone under any circumstances . But luckily I work in a law office. And I read the body of the letter at least two to three times because quite frankly , from my perspective -- and I send out letters pretty regularly like this. It is an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 intimidating letter to anyone who receives it. And the letter specifically stated that according to City records my above property was listed as a rental unit. I as well have lived in this home for 25 years since the date I purchase d it with my family. So I was seeking clarification on that statement because they said according to City records -- and I was thinking what records do they have to prove this because this is an untrue statement . So I did make some calls today. I did call over to Mr. Oleski who I did not personally hear back from. He did get back to Lori and there was a little bit of a communication delivered to me on that that they were going by a tax record from Lackawanna County, which I live on a corner lot. And it does specifically say it's a residential single dwelling . But then I thought I'll call over to the number that was given to me and just say my regular name. I didn't say what I was or what I did. And the message I received was that we have gotten tons of calls on the letters that we have sent out. Please bear with us and we will get to you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 So I called a second time because I thought I don't think I heard that right and I did hear that right, currently we are getting a ton of calls regarding the letters that we sent out to everybody , please bear with us and we will get back to you. So I did. I left my number. And I with everyone else am awaiting the same phone call. So I'm not going to lie. I do like to see some aggressive action with some of these things that we've probably all complained about from time to time. But if it's not done the right way and if it's not done in good faith, I think this created a lot of fear and anger with our residents including me to be quite frank. I am concerned about elderly people who received this. I got two calls today from people, one was a 77-year-old man who was so afraid he was going to lose his house. He was going down to City Hall today. I did not hear back from him. But I could tell you he had tears in his eyes. And I heard of but did not speak to someone else who received 16 of these and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 really could not even figure out why, how or any relationship . So I'm also concerned about the cost because from what I understand I am not obviously the only one that received this and it was sent certified mail which I believe -- I could be wrong on this is about $6.80 per letter. I talked to some neighborhood leaders as well because again, I wanted to make sure I wasn't overreacting when I received mine over the weekend . And the neighborhood leaders as well had indicated to me that they had had quite a busy weekend receiving complaints on these. One other man told me -- and this was a little bit alarming that he called and he gave them his number -- his address and they said, oh, no, you're fine. There's no problem . He said that's great. Would you just send me a letter to confirm it? And they said we don't send letters and hung up on him. So this is not really the customer service that I expect or want. And it really makes me feel much better quite frankly even in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 light of Mr. Hinton's comment s that we need to go ahead with that full review of the Licensing and Inspection Department because I do think that changes need to be made. And it's quite ironic to me to be quite honest and candid with everyone that they could send out this letter to me in a house that I lived in for 25 years and, you know, I wish someone would pay me rent, but they don't. I have adult kids who I still let live there for free when one door away from me is a dilapidated falling down structure that my neighbor s and I have consistently complained about. It is a health hazard. It is a safety hazard and nothing has been done to that but they could send out this letter to me. So I'm concerned about the priorities . The letter also says magisterial action will be taken against people. That's concerning me again as well. Why? Any time you file a magistrate complaint , there is a cost associate d with it. Is the City going to file these actions against people? You're going to have, number one, the cost associated with it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Number two, are they going to go and send employees to these which we're going to have the employees ' time out of the office and at magisterial actions or are we going to hire a lawyer and then we're going to have lawyers ' costs. And with all due respect having practiced law for 29 years, if Mary Dempsey is the magistrate sitting up there and a person comes in and says under oath that they are not accepting rent and they have lived in that property , I'm going to dismiss it. So then we're going to have the postage fee, the filing fee, potentially an attorney fee and potentially an employee 's time out of the office fee -- cost. So I plan on fixing this by going into my office tomorrow and creating four notarized statement s from me and my three adult children that I have lived in this house for 25 years that I do not receive or accept rent. That having been said, I'm concerned as I always am about our most vulnerable residents , the disabled , the elderly, those who are economically disadvantage d and those who may 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 not have access to transportation . They will not be able to get to City Hall. They will not be able to know what to do. So instead of complaining , I also wanted to think of what I thought was a reasonable solution . And I thought the way this could have easily been rectified was if an affidavit of ownership was placed in the envelope . And then I could have filed it out as the owner, Mary Dempsey , I could have attested to the fact that I do not receive rent and that I reside there myself and that all you would ask them to do is go get it notarize d. And then when the Licensing and Inspection Department receive s it back, it would also be subject to the penalties of perjury under Pennsylvania law. They would put it in your file and the issue would be solved. That having been said, I do have a motion tonight on this matter because I would like to at least get to the bottom of this some way. My motion is to do a letter to Mr. Oleski the acting director . I would like to know, number one, who authored this letter; number two, who authorized this letter; number three, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 the number of resident s this letter was sent and to. If possible , I would like the list of all people that it was sent to. I would like just the listing of all the City records that the LIPS Department relied on sending out these letters . In other words, what evidentiary basis did they have to send these to the homeowners in question . I would like to know what was the cost of the total postage bill sent with these letters . And I would like to know just as importantly what is the plan of action for the people who wrongly received these letters. And I would like an answer to these questions by Monday, December 30th as I will only be attending one more meeting on January 6th. So that is my motion at this time, gentlemen . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion made on the floor by Attorney Dempsey . It's been seconded by Councilman Donahue . On the question ? On the question , I agree with Attorney Dempsey 's motion. I too have received several calls from people who have received 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 these letters . And I do agree with Attorney Dempsey that we need to receive a response in writing . This is just unacceptable . To say that it's unbelievable is just not accurate . I do believe that -- I could believe that this could happen again. This happened a few years ago. At this point though I just -- I cannot imagine that you would send a letter of that magnitude without making sure the list was correct . Are there going to be some inaccuracies and maybe some errors, sure. But to send this out and then from what I understand people are calling the Licensing and Inspections Department and they're being told, well, there's really nothing we can do at this time. It's just unacceptable . As Attorney Dempsey noted, there is many senior citizen s who probably received this letter. Maybe some of them will just go and pay it because they don't really know what it is. To send a letter like this out, just a mass letter is simply unacceptable . If this letter were sent out to people who actually owed for a number of years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 I could understand it. Again, I don't understand the thought process behind it. And I agree with the motion and I would hope that we would receive answers as soon as possible . Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion is approved . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Thank you. And I just have one final comment for tonight . This got put aside a little bit because of the audit and because of the budget. But on November 6th, 2019, the Mayor sent the late Mrs. Novembrino , our Controller a letter which had to do with Chief DeSarno 's self-audit. And without getting into the details of the whole letter because quite frankly it's not relevant . The last paragraph said the following : I would defer to your office if you would prefer to have the auditor to be hired for the full gas card usage audit review this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 information as well. So in caucus I brought up the following that I do think that is proper. We have been provided copies of what Chief DeSarno put together . And quite frankly , it's difficult to interpret . It really is. So I think it should be done by someone who is an expert in this field. So I would like to make a motion at this time that Chief DeSarno 's self-audit be sent onto Mr. Moretti , our accountant who was hired for the gas card audit for him to review the same and to provide his recommendation regarding the self-audit and whether it is, in fact, satisfactory or not. And if so, how it should be rectified . MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion made on the floor by Attorney Dempsey . Do we have a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. All those in favor -- on the question rather? Anyone on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. ATTY. DEMPSEY : That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have a few things. First, Mrs. Reed, if we can contact -- and I believe this was agreed to when Barry Isett, the company who is going to do the assessment of the Licensing and Inspections Department was here, but can we please contact Barry Isett and ask them for -- to provide regular updates and progress to Council on their assessment of the Licensing and Inspections Office? I think that this is very important for Council to receive periodic updates . I prefer to do it if it's not in writing -- Actually I'd like it in writing and I'd also like them to come before Council if they can do that. Moving forward -- and I've asked for this before, these periodic updates and periodic appearances by people who are contracted and work for the City to find out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 exactly what they have been doing is important . And I was shocked tonight . I was actually shocked when we had the audit firm Kohanski and Company in for a caucus prior to the meeting to find out why we have not received the 2019 audit yet -- or the 2018 audit rather. They provided a list to us, a timeline of the audit proposal . It's three pages. I'm not going to go through everything . But I want to point out a few things that stuck out to me. May 20th -- or May 6th, 2019, the audit contract was signed by this Council . May 20th, 2019, Kohanski and Company and their staff were onsite at City Hall to start the audit. Preliminary meeting and planning discussion with City official s, no financial information available . Told by a member of the Business Administration Office that Rainey and Rainey who's the audit prep firm had not started year end work. That's May 20th and no year end work had been started yet. June 10th, 2019, received pension fund trial balance from Rainey and Rainey 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 contained obvious errors, returned for corrections . We had asked the firm, you know, what the obviously errors were and they went through them. And they basically stated to us that these were things that should have been caught. There's no way that it should have made it to their desk -- onto their desk. June 14th, 2019, Kelly Lindey{sic} from Kohanski responded to City official 's e-mail indicating that we would meet the deadline as long as we had trial balance s by Monday, July 15th. No information received by that date. There's a pattern here -- going to go through a couple more. There's a pattern here that the auditing firm went to receive information and they couldn't get it. July 10th, 2019, financial information needed to audit the General Fund, special city, OECD, capital assets and compensated absences is not available . Kohanski and Company leaves the City. October 31st, 2019, Kohanski and Company received a schedule of expenditure s, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 federal awards from Rainey and Rainey, received it one month after the due date for filing with the federal audit clearing house. I think that's what Miss Hodowanitz was referring to. The gentleman from Kohanski explained that if you miss the deadline , you could lose federal funding -- the City could lose federal funding . I think one of the followup question s is have we received anything from the federal audit clearing house and are those funds in danger? We don't know that. November 1st, Kohanski and Company contact ed Rainey and Rainey regarding the amounts on the scheduled of expenditure s of federal awards related to OECD expenditures . Kohanski and Company also inquired why one program was excluded from that report. As of December 16th, 2019, Kohanski and Company has not receive d a response . November 18th they receive d revised OECD trial balance from Rainey and Rainey. Additional errors were noted. You know, I could go through this whole thing. I would like this, Mrs. Reed, to be placed in Third Order when we have our first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 meeting in January because I think the public should see this list. It was to say the least just unacceptable . I would like to make a motion at this time that this Council ask for a meeting as soon as possible with the Business Administrator and with Rainey and Rainey. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. We asked continually over the last few years why wasn't the audit in on time. Why wasn't the audit in on time? We received , you know, it will be next month we'll get a draft audit. It just -- there's definitely an issue here. I don't know exactly what it is. But from what they said it has to do with Rainey and Rainey. So I think we need to figure out exactly what's going on because when you put an RFP out to have an audit done and you continually are late with it, it's just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 unacceptable. As was mentioned here, the gentleman from Kohanski said he's not even sure how you could make decisions based on the budget that we voted on without an audit. It just is unbelievable and unacceptable that we continually year after year do not have the audit on time. So I cannot wait to hear what the answers are from administration and from Rainey and Rainey. The second thing that I would like to mention is about the residents from Third Avenue who came regarding the truck traffic . I've talked to Mrs. Reed about this. I've talked to Mr. Pocius, the City engineer in length about it. We're going to put something in writing to Mr. Pocius so that he could respond to us in writing , come up with a game plan for the situation that we find ourself in. They're basically without going into great detail, there are trucks because the Elm Street Bridge is closed, the trucks are now rerouted from the salt plant where Danny Sansky's garage used to be on Elm Street.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 And they're now are being rerouted through Third Avenue. So this is causing major issues with noise, major issues with the destruction of some of the sidewalk s and the roads among a number of other things. So I have been in touch with one of the neighbors down there and one of the business owners and neighborhood leaders , Mr. Chomko. So we will get that letter out to Mr. Pocius and I will update those neighbors as it progresses . As for the breaking news I guess on the City losing the Act 511 case, I also can't really comment on it because I have not -- I just heard it as I was coming in tonight , wasn't able to confirm -- although I know my colleagues have heard it as well. So I haven't read the opinion yet although I think it's obvious that it is -- it would be devastating to the City. But until I actually read it, I can't comment any further . Mrs. -- Miss Schumacher rather talked about the conversion of the Business Privilege to the Mercantile Tax. We do have a copy and it was on our agenda a few weeks ago, the memo from the Pennsylvania Economy League that detailed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 all the steps that are involve d in that. And Councilman Donahue is correct that we do need to go before the courts to get it approved . And then I think some time in July is when that process will start to take shape. What the school district is doing at this point I'm really not sure. But the Pennsylvania Economy League did lay out all the different options . The only other thing I wanted to mention as I mention ed at the beginning of the meeting , this will be our last meeting for 2019. The meeting s for December 23rd and 30th will be cancelled . We're going to pass the legislation in Seventh Order tonight so there will be no reason for us to meet moving forward . The next meeting of Council will be held the first Monday in January , January 6th at 10 a.m. And the reorganization meeting will follow at 11 a.m. Tomorrow again, I just want to announce we are having a public caucus December 17th at 6:30 p.m., in the City Clerk's Office for the purpose of discuss ing reorganization , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 committee assignments , that sort of stuff for 2020. And an executive session will be held either before or after this meeting to discuss personnel matters, specifically the City Clerk and the Council Solicitor . I would just like to thank -- and I know we'll thank Attorney Dempsey and the other members of Council who are leaving during the sine die meeting January 6th. But I do want to take a moment and thank Attorney Dempsey for all the work that she's done. It has been, you know, she was only appoint ed I think for six -- five or six months. It could have been easy for her to just mail it in and, you know, just go through the motions . I have never in six years on Council seen anybody work as hard and be as committed to the City as Attorney Dempsey . So I want to personally thank her for all of her hard work and her dedication . And it's been really outstanding . I think we had a really good team. And Attorney Dempsey added a lot of value to being a member of Council . So I want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 to thank her for that. And I want to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and with that we'll wrap it up for tonight . Mrs. Reed, you can proceed . Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

DEMPSEY : I would like to make a motion to table Item 7-C. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There is a motion on the floor and a second to table Item 7-C. On the question ? Yes, on the question just to explain why we're tabling this. Last week as has been noted, Council made the decision to raise taxes 7 mills on land. This is the tax enabling legislation . We are going to table this for two reasons , number one, we're not exactly sure if the Mayor is going to veto the budget. So if we were to pass this tonight and the Mayor vetoed the budget, we'd have to go back and entertain this again which wouldn't make sense. So that's number one. Number two, there's question about whether we have to run a special ad for three weeks with this legislation . So what we're going to -- the plan is we're going to introduce this our first meeting back in January . It will be on the agenda for three weeks. It will be amended to recognize the 7 mill increase and then it will be retroactive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 to January 1st. And Mrs. Reed and I have discussed sending correspondence to Mr. Fox the Tax Collector just notifying him that we're going to make that change and that there will be a 7 mill increase on the land, granted that the Mayor does not veto the budget. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 7-D.

MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-G. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, on the question , first I want to thank the Director of OECD, Mary-Pat Ward. I had several question s about this legislation . I was kind of going back and forth on it until she actually came to the -- at the tail end of the meeting last week and I had a conversation with her outside of chamber s. And this afternoon I posed several questions to her in an e-mail which she immediately responded to. The responses are a little lengthy . I'm not going to go through all of them but I just want to explain two things. First of all, the way this will work is NeighborW orks will get reimbursed up to 10 percent for each project . So if, for example , NeighborWorks expends $300,000 on the Homebuyer Program , they're subject to reimbursement of up to $30,000. One of the questions that I had was, you know, why would we farm this out? That was my initial concern . You know, why wouldn't we just have OECD's own staff run the whole program . And she made a good point last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 and then in the e-mail today. She went to a conference regarding all grantees through OECD in Philadelphia . And one of the things on the agenda was the Home Investment Partnership Program . And she explain ed that regarding the Home Program and municipalities , especial ly larger cities throughout the state, they -- their staffs have shrunk over time. And they don't do the direct service work and the compliance at the same time. And she states here the question is how do you self-audit for compliance in an ethical way? So the third party programs can provide the certified training required , time, funding and an opportunity for expanded training and education , receive more technical assistance and has the ability to use technological platform s that the City doesn't currently employ to sell the program . My last question to her was what would our role be then? What would be the OECD Offices ' role since we're farming the program out? And I thought this was an important point that she made. She said our role in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Homebuyer Program remains key. OECD are the conduit s for the money they applied to HUD each year for allocation . They're the ones required to input the data collect ed for each applicant . And as stated above, they're require d to complete compliance on the program including reporting , determination of its successful ness and ethical duties such as conflict of interest . There's no homebuyer program that all the cities buy in. This is a three year contract . Again, after talking with her I don't see a reason why we shouldn 't do this. I think it does make sense. And I think after three years obviously we'll reevaluate it and see how successful or unsuccessful it's been and then obviously we'll go from there. So I'll be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Attorney Dempsey . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes.
