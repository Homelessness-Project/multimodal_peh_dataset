MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing now for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away recently in our community . Let us also take a special moment of silence tonight for people in our community and throughout the world who are suffering or who have passed away from the coronavirus . Let us think about them and their families at this time that they may find peace. Like us think now about the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they find protection and peace. Whether we are here at home or abroad surround ed by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together , persist and prepare together .

COGNETTI DATED APRIL 6, 2020 WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FOR COMMUNITY AND FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS . 3-E. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION DATED APRIL 1, 2020 REGARDING LOCAL BRIDGE GROUP REPLACEMENTS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : So I'd just like to say I'm happy to see the continuation of these bridge projects . They're much needed, the improvements of ageing infrastructure in the City. And those original 2003 studies on bridges in PA, several of the bridges were in our area. And I think two of the -- two of the bridges that are on this list here were on that original list. I'm happy to see that work is going to be taking place. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Just to sort of extend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 on what Mr. Schuster said. One of the bridges in this list is the Elm Street bridge which is going to be the permanent solution , you know, to the problems that people are facing in Bellevue on Third Avenue and those other streets over there with truck traffic because that started because of weight restrictions on the Elm Street bridge. So that is going to be the permanent fix. I know we're still trying to figure out a short-term solution . But that will be the permanent fix to that solution -- or to that problem , excuse me. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anybody else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just comment on the Third Order that we received from the Mayor's office for the letter for guideline s for religious organizations . I know that I think it was talked with the recent holidays , Passover and Easter for people to not congregate where they would normally . And I think that places in Scranton did a very good job of avoiding that and holding services online so places can continue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 to do that to the best of their ability . I understand it's a different -- different way and not the -- certainly not the same. But, you know, I think it was important . So thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Just a reminder that if you haven't filled out your census form to please do so. Census forms were mailed out and a couple reminders were mailed out in the past few weeks. To respond online you could go to my2020censusdotgov. You know, there's a lot money out there for the next ten years. So please take the five minutes and fill out your census form. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements ? Okay. I have a few. First, if there's any groups or organizations offering free services or assistance to someone in need during this national emergency and you'd like to have that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 information available on ECTV, please e-mail ChrisECTV @gmail.com. The wording of your e-mail is exactly what they will publish on ECTV. If anyone would like to comment on agenda items -- Council agenda items or City business , please send those comments in writing to our City Clerk, Lori Reed by e-mailing Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. Council will accept public comment until the day of our meeting Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. Public comment is reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed on the official record and in the minutes of our meeting s. Council 's agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting and our agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. And that is all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. At this time I'd ask if someone could please make a motion to accept public comment from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 following individuals to be placed into the record and our official minutes of this meeting . Those citizens are Patti Fowler, Craig Beavers , Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept those correspond ence. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. There's been a motion. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just would like to say I have gone through every comment that has been submitted by members of the public. And I did put together a document of any of the questions that were posed to this Council . The questions that were posed that would require information from the administration , I have sent those along to the Mayor and the administration and hopefully we will get an answer to those questions . Now, in saying that, I do know just, you know, the reality of the situation that we're currently in some of these -- the question s that were submitted on stormwater and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 overtime , they're not going to be maybe high priority at this point. So I do think we need to give a little bit of leeway in terms of a response to those -- some of those questions . But I know that they will be addressed at some point. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (PUBLIC COMMENT ) (PATTI FOWLER) Will the City itself be doing anything to help in any way the displaced city workers that were furloughed by the Mayor at the beginning of this crisis? Patti Fowler 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 (CRAIG BEAVERS ) Good afternoon , I am inquiring about the status of the “Downtown Scranton Connectivity Plan”, aka the walkability study from Speck/Barry Isett. I understand that current issues facing our community may require this study to be temporarily sidelined , but I am curious if there has been any progress thus far, or if any further action has been planned . I believe that this study will be a tremendous benefit to our city. Scranton is a city that is experiencing a new urban renewal , and one important aspect of this is making our city friendly to pedestrians , bicyclists , and other non-automobile transit . I frequently walk throughout the city for various purposes , including to run errands , for recreation , to save gas, and to simply enjoy our city's streets . Unfortunately , many areas of our city, including downtown , are not very inviting towards pedestrians . Crosswalks are faded, walk signals seemingly never change, sidewalks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 are cracked or non-existent , etc. These issues discourage residents and visitors alike from experiencing our city, patronizing local businesses , and enjoying our amenities . An important factor that younger people looking for a new city to live in is how walkable the city is, and if they can easily get around without a car. From my experience as a student at Marywood University , many students who would have otherwise stayed in Scranton after graduating left for other cities where they did not need a car, and could instead walk or bike. I strongly believe that our city should make a concerted effort to improve walking , biking, and transit around the city. Not only will it attract new residents , but studies have shown that walkable cities improve the local economy and citizen health. I would greatly appreciate any information you can provide . I am very optimistic about the future of Scranton , and I hope that efforts like this will improve the lives of our citizens and the liveliness of our city. Sincerely ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Craig Beavers (MARIE SCHUMACHER ) Acknowledging that Governor Wolf's restrictions on our Civil Rights will impact the City's Revenue I would like to hear the plan for reducing the expected deficit if it exceeds the savings of the Mayor's furloughing of City employees . For the sake of transparency it is critical that you post in Third Order as soon as the accounting is available at the end of each month the Cash Flow Chart for the 2020 year-to-date actuals and the comparative 2019 Chart. Has the Isett Contract on the Licenses and Permits Department Service Assessment been executed and what is the delivery date of the Assessment ? Please explain how expenses for the Serenti Property are budgeted and recorded . What is the delivery date for the HRG Stormwater Report? Please acknowledge receipt of this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 e-mail when received . Thank you! (FAY FRANUS) Fay Franus -- I went to the minutes of the march 31st meting and read all of the comments from people who submitted questions and comments -- I thought there were MANY very good questions asked. Guess what I and everyone else in Scranton will have no clue what the answers were to these questions . Bill Gaughan stated he would e-mail people to reply to their questions . I would like to know did you get those questions answered and what were they/ Since you are silencing us from speaking at the meetings via telephone I think you need to put all of your replies in the minutes of the next meeting and if you can't answer certain questions say which ones and why you can't answer them. Another thing I heard Bill Gaughan stating some questions will be on the back burner-- perhaps but Marie Schumacher asked many questions that certainly can be answered --even the one about the storm water. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 My very firm point is you all are getting paid there should be no reason every questions asked is not answered . I would like to know the reason any and all of you may have for NOT replying to ANY questions asked of you? This virus does not prevent you to get answers from citizens who pay you to get these answers -- The very ones you are SUPPOSED to be representing . I was a very saddened to see that not one other council person spoke up and stated that THEY felt it would be correct to read aloud the comments and questions people have submitted . Just because Bill Gaughan feels that he does not want to and does not have to does NOT stop YOU from reading the comments aloud for all to hear while the meeting is going on--I also want to know from each one of you exactly how YOU feel about having comments read aloud during the meeting . I definitely want to know how YOU feel about this. I only know how Bill Gaughan feels. By the way did ANY of you bother to get in touch with the Scranton School Board to ask how they were able to have people phone in live while the meeting was taking place-- they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 also had people use ZOOM to be seen as well if they had the app to do so. You have had a week to do so and I highly doubt any of you were interested enough to make that a possibility for the people to call in live during the meeting on April 14th. Did any of you inquire about this? If not why not. So please go over these comments and make note of EVERY question I put to you and I really would appreciate detailed replies . How you do it is up to you. Just please do NOT lose sight of the fact that you are there to represent us. That seems to have left your thought process . Thank you Fay Franus. (END OF PUBLIC COMMENT ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I would like to commend the efforts and quick response time of the fire department , police department and the DPW with regards to yesterday 's horrific windstorm and their ongoing support they are providing during this pandemoniac . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I do not. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . And, Councilman Donahue , do you have any comment s or motions at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have two comments . As I mentioned in the caucus if anyone had missed it, I did ask 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Mrs. Reed to check in with Arthur Moretti and his firm for an update on the audit of the gas cards in the City. As I stated earlier tonight , I do understand with the crisis going on that that process may have slowed a bit. And I don't know that it was complet ed yet or where they are in the process . But I thought it was appropriate at this time for Council to check in to see where Mr. Moretti is. So hopefully we will receive a response there. The only other thing I want to say is that I just want to continue to implore people to stay home as much as they possibly can. As Dr. Rothchild mentioned I think as a whole, the City is doing a pretty good job of following the recommendation s and the guidelines from the federal government , the state government and our local government . I just hope that people continue to have faith and hope in light of everything that's going on. I just think that today is April 14th. And it was about a month ago when the shutdown started . So the past month has been extremely difficult for myself, my family, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 all of your families , everyone in the City of Scranton , in the state, in the country and really in the world. And it may not seem like there's light at the end of the tunnel. But there is. And we will get through this together . So I just want to continue to ask people to pay attention to those guidelines . And if we do that, I think the quicker we will resolve this crisis. And my last comment for tonight is I would like to wish my wife Kellie a happy birthday. Today is her birthday . And also wish my daughter Maeve a happy birthday . Her birthday was on April 6th and she is a year old. Thank you. That's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 4, 2020 - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE CONSOLIDATED SUBMISSION FOR COMMUNITY PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS TO BE FUNDED UNDER THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT (CDBG) PROGRAM , HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP (HOME) PROGRAM AND EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANTS (ESG) PROGRAM FOR THE FIVE YEAR CONSOLIDATED PLAN, ANALYSIS OF IMPEDIMENTS TO FAIR HOUSING CHOICE, AND ANNUAL ACTION PLAN FOR THE PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question . I spoke earlier with Mrs. Ward and Mr. Preambo and -- regarding this piece of legislation with just some additional questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 that I had after taking the time to review it. And I just want to say that I really appreciate the hard work of OECD and all of those involved in putting this together . They want to make sure that as a City we receive as much as we can to help those in need for housing and to identify the most vulnerable communities as well as just what our highest needs and priorities are here in the City because that becomes unique to every place. And I know there was a lot of thought in putting this together . And the Advisory Committee had -- which is composed of community members they also worked hard on reviewing the surveys of our citizen s to make sure that their concerns were appropriately addressed in this five-year plan. So I look forward to this. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Anyone else on the question ? I too want to thank the Executive Director , Mary-Pat Ward. I want to thank the Deputy Director , Tom Preambo , the staff of OECD for all the work that they put into this. This as Dr. Rothchild mentioned is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 very long process . And it does take a lot of hard work and a lot of input from the community . So I want to thank everyone involved . Anyone else on the question ? Okay. Roll call, please. Sorry, Mrs. Carrera , roll call, please? Lori, are you there? MS. REED: Yes, I am. I'll call roll. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. MS. REED: Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. REED: Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. REED: Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. REED: Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. REED: Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 29, 2020 – APPOINTMENT OF ALLEN LUCAS, 2722 BIRNEY AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18505 TO THE POSITION OF1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 FIRE CHIEF AS WELL AS EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR EFFECTIVE MARCH 23, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I'll recommend final passage of Item 7-B. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question . I'd like to just first say that, you know, nothing against Al Lucas. I think he's doing a great job under extremely challenging circumstance s at the moment. And I am sympathetic to the fact that the Fire Chief's salary being lower than it probably should. I just have a problem with the precedent that we're setting here by the administration increasing the salary while we're furlough ing employees without Council 's approval . I think when you send down legislation that requires out of budget spending, there should be a detailed explanation to justify that and where the savings are coming from. Otherwise , it's just undermining, you know, the budget process and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 the role of Council and public both have to play in that process . For that reason, I would just like to table this legislation just until we get some detailed information exactly where in the fire department line items are they pulling this and where were the savings that were expressed to us a couple weeks ago actually coming from? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll give a second on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Well, we're -- there was no motion made. So are you making a motion, Kyle? MR. DONAHUE : I believe I did make a motion. If I didn't, I apologize for that. I would like to make a motion to table this legislation just until we get that detailed explanation back. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question of Kyle's motion? On the question , I'm going to be voting against Kyle's motion to table it. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 agree with everything that he said. But I don't believe that at this time it makes any sense to table this legislation appointing the -- MR. DONAHUE : Bill, I think we lost you. Bill just sent me a text. His computer froze. Just give him one minute. MR. GAUGHAN : Sorry, everybody . I froze there for a second. Let me -- any time it's windy out, it seems like my internet connection goes out a little bit. Let's recap here just so I -- MR. DONAHUE : You can start from the beginning . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So Kyle made a motion to table 7-B. Tom seconded it. And now we're on the question of Kyle's motion. So before I speak, does anyone want to speak on the question of the motion to table the legislation ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I mean, I share the same concerns as Kyle. And mine's a procedural problem that I'm having with regards to policy and, you know, and the budget issue. I mean, I'm not going to prolong this any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 longer. I'll vote no for the motion. But I don't really feel great about the whole process . But I guess we need to move forward . So that's my opinion . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, as I said in our caucus, I am prepared to vote on this piece of legislation tonight . You know, I don't agree with tabling it at this time although I still have questions too. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : With that, I mean, I'd be in favor of tabling it to next week. But to vote it down would be a different story. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thanks, Tom. Yeah, on the question , I agree with everything that Councilman Donahue said. As I stated two weeks ago, I don't, you know, agree with keeping the salary at 95,000-some odd dollars . The Fire Chief's position in the budget is 84 -- roughly $84,000. So I don't agree with that. However , in saying that, I don't agree with tabling this legislation -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 tabling this appointment because I don't really know what -- I guess I don't understand what the point of that would be that the administration and the Mayor has told us that the unexpended salary is coming from a position that's not filled. We can certainly request and will request more information on that if everybody , you know, if that's what everybody wants to do. But in terms of tabling it when we're in the middle of a crisis and this person is the emergency management coordinator doesn't make much sense. So I'll be voting against it. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. Motion's been made. It's been seconded. Everyone has stated their case here. So all those in favor of the motion to table Item 7-B please say aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Opposed ? No. DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. GAUGHAN : So the motion fails three to two. Now we're back on the original 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 legislation Item 7-B. And we're still on the question here with this piece of legislation . Does anyone want to speak to the legislation on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : I'm going to be voting against this -- again, not because of Al Lucas in any way. Again, I think he's doing a tremendous job under difficult circumstances . But I just think we need -- as a Council we need to not give up our budgetary authority and our part in that process . So without justification of savings of where that money for that salary increase is going to come from, I can't in good conscience vote for this. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. The only thing I would add is, I don't believe that we're giving up our authority . The action has already been taken by the administration . So, you know, to vote against this or to table it, I don't think makes any difference . The horse is already out of the barn so-to-speak. They already set the salary at $95,000. And while I disagree with that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 think that the legislative fix here is to entertain legislation prohibiting the Mayor or her administration from raising salaries outside of the budget. I would be in favor of that. But in terms of this legislation again, we're in the middle of a crisis. We need an Emergency Management Coordinator and a Fire Chief. And he already is the Fire Chief. He's acting for a couple months. So I'll be voting for it. MR. DONAHUE : And I think that's important to point out that he already is the Fire Chief and, you know, the Emergency Management Coordinator . And it's not going to affect -- you know, us passing this tonight or not isn't going to affect, you know, his status there and the ability to do his job. I just feel like, you know, if we're going to work together to get through this and we still have challenging times ahead especially with some of the loss revenues , I think we actually just have to -- I think we actually have to work together . It's not just, you know, just going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 along just to get along sort of thing. I think we actually have to work together . And we have to work these issues out. And, you know, we all have to do it. It's between us five Council members and the administration as a whole, I think that's the only way we get through this is getting through it together . MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. I just don't -- I don't see the point of voting against it or tabling it just because I don't -- it just doesn't -- honestly , it just doesn't make sense to me at this time. So I'll be voting against it -- or voting for it. Anybody else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I mean, just at this point in time my stance on this is, yeah, I would like to see some kind of justification for it being that we're going to have a slight deficit this year with the budget and not knowing the effects of the situation right now how that's going to play out. MR. GAUGHAN : And so the only thing I would add is, you know, even if we have -- again, it should be $84,000. It's at 95,000. It's the difference of $11,000. So in terms of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 120 or 130 million dollar budget, it is a drop in the bucket. Okay. Am I back? Can you see me and hear me? All right. I was going to add something else. But you know what, I'm going to let it go because I'm afraid I'll freeze again. Okay. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I mean, my concerns remain. I share concerns with everybody in this room. You know, it's on our plate right now. So please, moving forward so we don't have these conversations again, let's introduce the legislation to prevent this from happening again. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I would like to see additional legislation in the future to prevent this issue from happening again. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I agree. Okay. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Okay, Bill, I apologize for 7-A because my phone dropped the call right when you asked me to call roll. So I'll do 7-B and then if you go back and we can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 do 7-A? MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, that's okay. Lori actually -- I figured something happened , Kathy, because Lori -- Lori did the roll call. So we're good with 7-B. And I froze so don't worry about it. It happened to the both of us. MS. CARRERA : Okay. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No. MS.

If there is no further business -- I can't imagine what my face probably looks like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 when I'm frozen on the screen for anyone who's watching .
