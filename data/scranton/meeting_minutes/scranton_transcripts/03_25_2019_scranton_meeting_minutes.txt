Butalways remembering thatweare thestewardsofthisbuilding .Wearethe caretaker softhisbuilding .Andthat'sour responsibility .Andweshould takeitvery seriously .Thecurrent credit rating isBB plus.Generally credit ratings donotchange unless thereisaneventthatrequires areview likeincurring ofadditional debt. However ,Ididparticipate ina conference callnotlongagowhereseveral financial expertswereonthecall.Andwe basically triedtomakeanimpactonthemas farasourfinancial storyandhowit's improved. Sowehopethatpaysdividends when thetimecomeswherethenewcredit rating unfold.Ourgoal,ofcourse,should beatthe veryleastatriple Bminusrating whichisthe indication ofinvestment graderating, something wehaven'tseeninyears.Something thatwouldopenthedoorforsoundand strategic borrowing atfavorable ratesor further debtrestructioning ifitmadesense1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 forthecity. Butpartofourcaseforabetter rating istoformulate adebtpolicy aswellas aninvestment policy asdirectedbythe recovery plan.SoIhadconversations withBA Bulzoni thisweek.He'sintheprocess of formulating thoseplansnow.Andweshould expect something before Council inthevery nearfuture tocreate thatanswer tothe recovery plan. Ialsowanttotalkaboutsomeofmy debates withPennDOT officials .Firstofall, therewastheKildare 'sHousing project .This Council tabled legislation inthehopesof having aconversation ontheimpactofDOT rulesimposedbecause ofthatproject . Thatroadisconsidered astate road.Thelackofresponse byPennDOT officials toevendiscuss thismatteris troublingatbest.Thesecond issueisone thatCouncil manDonahue andmyself havebeen working on. Severalmonthsago,wemetwith PennDOT officials ,ChiefGraziano ,DPWDirector Gallagher todiscuss theintersection of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Pittston Avenue andOrchard Street. Atthetime,therewere38 documented traffic accidents atthat intersection overthelastthreeyears.Asof today,thereare39.SoweaskedPennDOT at thetimeforwhatwethought wasareasonable andsimple request toplacea4-waystopsign system atthatlocation anddoa90-daytrial period andthenreconvenetoreviewtheresults ofthattrial. PennDOT officials inattendance ,of course,saidtheyhadtogobacktotheir office todiscuss request swiththe decision -makersandgetbacktous. Months havegonebyand,ofcourse, wehadnoresponse .Everydaythatpasses is another opportunity foratragedy tohappen at thatintersection .Several things became clear atthatmeeting .DOTofficials wereseemingly moreconcern edwithtraffic congestion than theywerewiththeissueofvehicular or pedestrian safety. WhilePittston Avenue isastate road,Orchard Street isacitystreet.Andas such,weshould atleastbeequalpartners in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 whatisdecided atthatlocation . Sowiththeriskofgetting intothe weedsalittle bit,I'mgoingtotalkaboutthe difference between aroadandastreet asthey relate tothisdiscussion ,something youmay nothaveheardbefore. Butaroadisbasically ahighspeed connection between twoplaces.It'sabout moving carsquickly .It'sdesignedtominimize congestion ,etc.That'stheprimary focus. Anditcanbeadetriment tobikespedestrian , joggers ,etc.ThisistheDOTmottothough. Streetsontheotherhandaremore complicated .Theyhaveon-street parking , maybebiketraffic ,turningtraffic ,different speeds,pedestrians .Thisiswhatyoufindin mostneighborhood s.It'swhypeople feelsafer onstreetsthantheydoonroadsbecause they areencouraged bydesign andotherexternal factors tomovecarstomoveslower. SowhatPittston Avenue isaccording tomanyurbanplanners iswhatshould really be calledaSTROAD.ASTROAD isahybrid between aroadandastreet.SoPennDOT triesinmy viewpoint tomovetraffic quickly and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 efficiently through aneighborhood street which iscomplicated because ofthebikesand pedestrians andjoggers ,etc. SoaSTROAD justdoesn'twork.It shouldn 'tbepigeonholed intothenormal DOT design guidelines because it'sneither aroad orastreet.Soitshould notbeapplying thoseonesizefitsallstrict DOTruleson whatisclearlyacitystreet environment . Earlier todayIhadaconversation withChiefGraziano .Andheindicated tome thathehadstarted theprocess ofgathering information onthetraffic andspeedof vehicles nearthatintersection .Andheshould havethatinformation backtousoverthenext several weeks. Sowiththatsaid,I'mgoingtoask Mrs.Reedifwecaninvite PennDOT officials to aworksession orapublic caucus todiscuss theirdesign rules,regulation s,andhowthey impactourcitystreets . Iprefer aworksession because I thinkwecouldmeetwiththemface-to-faceand haveadialogue andaconversation that hopefully willbringaboutbroader ideaofhow1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 wecanbenefit eachother.Wewilldiscuss the format asCouncil andwe'llalldecide howwe wanttodothat. ButChiefGraziano ,ofcourse,and DennyGallagher ,theDPWDirector should be invitedaswell.Iwouldsuggest sometime afterApril15th.Iwanttogivethatstudy timetobefinishedandforustohavean opportunity toreviewit. Andfinally,Idon'twantyouto forget thateverydayisyourchance tomake thiscityalittle better.Andthat'sallI havetonight . MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Mr.Gaughan , anymotionsorcomments ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,afew.First, I'dliketomakeamotion thatweenterinto ThirdOrderatournextCouncil meeting the memothatwereceived March23rd,2019,dealing withmunicipal building improvements fromthe Business Administrator DaveBulzoni . MR.EVANS:Second. MR.ROGAN:Onthequestion ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,onthequestion . Ijustwanttotalkforaminute aboutthememo1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 thatwillbeputintoThirdOrdernextweek because itshedsalotoflightIthinkonthe thought process thattheAdministration hason thisbuilding andhowtheymightwanttomove forward . So,firstofall,Mr.Bulzoni -- I'mnotgoingtoreadthrough thiswholething. I'mnotgoingtoreadthewholethingintothe record because it'saboutfourorfivepages. ButIjustwanttotouchonsomeofthe highlights because Ithinkit'simportant . Mr.Bulzoni statesthatwhilean alternate solution torenovating CityHallmay beabridge toofar,wemaynotknowunless we investigate itfurther .IwouldagreewithMr. Bulzoni inthatstatement . Oneofthethingsthatcametolight asfarasthismemoisconcerned ,isthatthe Business Administrator wasapprised ofthesale oftheformer PenFed Credit UnionHeadquarters Building onFranklin Avenue.Hesaysthe building presently houses acredit union branch. Thecorporate functions havebeen relocated toWashington ,DC.Thebranch office1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 willeventually close.Thebuilding , therefore ,ismostly vacant.Hesays,"Iwould fairlyconfidently statethatthebuilding is inturn-keycondition formunicipal use." Hegivesalittle bitofbackground onthiswholesituation .Thecitywhichwe haveonouragenda tonight applied forroughly 5andahalfmillion dollar RACPGrantwiththe state.Therequest wassubmittedbasedonan8 million dollar authorization formunicipal building improvements approve din2017. Sincethegrantismatching ,the maximum thecitycouldapplyforwouldbe50 percent oftheestimated project cost.Mr. Bulzoni statesthathewasadvised thatthis roundofRACPfunding mightbelimited .He says,whileIamhopeful thatthecityreceives fullfunding,Iwouldalsolikeeveryone to consider theprospects offullfundingwiththe senseofrealism . WhichIthinkisimportant because eventhough we'reputting fortheRACPGrant fornearly fiveandahalfmillion dollars , thatdoesn'tmeanthatwe'regoingtogetthat. Andashestatesinhismemo,he'sbeenadvised1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 thatthisroundoffundingmightbelimited . HesayswhileI'mhopeful thatthe cityreceive sfullfunding,Iwouldalsolike everyone toconsider theprospects --Ialready readthatpart.Theremaining fundsrequire d tocomplete theproject mightbeobtained through adebtissue. Market factorsfordebtissuance are presently favorable forthecity.Thecity mightbeabletouseaRACPconcept tokeep debtservice ataminimum untilsomeexisting debtmatures .Thecitymayalsoconsider a threeyearconstruction noteduring the renovation period. Construction notestypical lyrequire interest onlyduring theperiod thenoteis outstand ing.Princip alwouldbedueat maturity andwouldberepaidfromabondissue. ThisisoneofthethingsthatItalked about lastweekandwheremyquestions comeinand whereI'mconcerned . AndIthinkweshould slowdownjust abitandtakeamoredelibera tiveapproach as itrelates tofinancing andtheimpactthisis mostdefinitely goingtohaveonthebudget no1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 matter whichwaytheAdministration decidesto move.SoIthinkweneedtohavea conversation aboutthat. Mr.Bulzoni alsomentions the logistical issuesabound during construction . Andthegentleman fromHighland Associates touched onthisaswell.Hemention sthatthe building waslastoverhaul edin1979.During thattime,theentireoperation wasmovedto theConnell Building . SoIthinkweneedtoalsotakeinto account thecostof--depending onhowthe cityintendstodoit,moving offices ,moving employees ,andwhatkindofadditional cost thatwilltakeon. Healsomentions whichIthinkis interest ingthatthecitymighthaveoptions following theSerrenti Building Project .He saysthatthispublic safety building project mightnotbecompleted substantially untilthe endoftheyear.Ithinkweneedtohavean additional conversation aboutthatandwhathe meansbythatstatement . Healsosaysinhismemothathe wouldnotrecommend afragmented approach to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 improvements ,whichiswhatIhadmentioned as apossibility inthecaucus thisevening .In otherwords,ifwe'regoingtodothis depending onhowitimpactsthebudget,wemay wanttolookattaking careofthefirstand second priorities ,thethingsthatarereally pressing first.Mr.Bulzoni doesnotthink thatweshould takeafragmented approach to that. Healsomentions whichIthinkis important apartial completion wouldrequire an annual capital budget allocation toaddress the issues inentirety ,whichwouldbeinaddition tothedebtservice requirements forthe amounts borrowed . Thebuilding evenwithfull renovations hasissueswhichwillnotbe eliminated and,obviously ,aseveryone knows, parking willremainanissue. Couple oftheotherthings thathe mentions inherethatagain,Ithinkisvery interesting isthatthemembersofthe Administration --Idon'tknowifitwasMr. Bulzoni andanyone elsebuttoured thePenFed Building .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Hementions itimpresses onewith howmuchturn-keypotential thebuilding has formunicipal use,parkingissubstantial , refuse payment scouldbemadeatdrive-up teller windows .TheLicensing andPermits Department couldhavepersonnel located behind teller windows onthefirstflooralongwith manyotherconveniences wepresently donot haveinouroperation . Thatbuilding istotally secure. Upperflooraccess canonlybemadethrough secure access cardsandmentions thathewould estimate thatoperating costmightbe substantially lowerthanthosepresent ly realized andforecastevenuponimprovement to themunicipal building . Hestatesthatit'shis understanding thatthePenFed Building present lylistsforapproximately 5million dollars .Andwewouldneedtohavean addition alconversation aboutadditional costs tothecitytomakethatbuilding fully operational . Buthefeelsthatitshould be relatively maintained --orrelatively1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 contained .Thecitywouldusethesamedebt structure without theneedforconstruction financing .Andthenthereissomeother comment sthathemakeshere. ButIappreciate thememo.Ido thinkthatweneedtocontinue tohavethis conversation .I'mnotreally soldeither way yetonlybecause Ithinkthereisstillalot ofoutstanding questions . Ithinkfinancing beingoneofthem. Whatisthe--goingtobetheimpactofthe budget.Ithinkweneedtoseethosenumbers flushedoutalotmore.Mr.Perry'ssuggestion aboutthepreventative maintenance manager ,I understand whathe'ssaying.Idisagree with itthough justinthethought process thatit's myunderstanding thattheLicensing , Inspections andPermits Director isthe maintain erofthebuilding orshould bein charge ofmaintaining thebuilding . Sothatshould beoneofhis responsibilities .Idon'tknowifweneedto addanother position inthebudget.Thatmay bedouble work.Idoagreethough thatweneed tohave--Ithinkweneedtohaveapublic1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 caucus withtheMayor,withtheBusiness Administrator todiscuss hismemowhichIthink isimportant todiscuss abuilding maintenance planmoving forward . Iunderstand thatthisisn'tjust thefaultofthisadministration .It'sthe pastadministrations goingbackdecades.And it'seasytocomplainaboutwhathasnotbeen doneinthisbuilding andtheoversight onthe partofmanyadministrations . Butwhatwearetasked withasa Council nowiswhatarewegoingtodomoving forward ;howarewegoingtomaintain the building ifwe'restaying here?AndIwould justliketoknow,youknow,whatdirection the MayorandtheBusiness Administrator wantto movein. Soweneedaclearerpicture on that.Idothinkthough thatweneedto examine alloptions extremely carefully usinga meaningful deliberative approach taking into account theimmediacy ofthebuilding maintenance issueswhichwesawfirsthand by thePowerPointfinancing andmostimportantly impactonthebudget moving forward .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 AndthenIthinkweneedtovoteon themotion. MR.ROGAN:Oh,we'restillonthe motion?Isthereasecond?Actually we'reon thequestion .Allthoseinfavorsignify by saying aye. MR.PERRY:Aye. MR.DONAHUE :Aye. MR.GAUGHAN :Aye. MR.EVANS:Aye.

Sohowdoesthecityplantoaddress eachpark,whenthey'regoingtogoinsince thespring ishereandsummer isapproaching , howtheyaregoingtoaddress theneedsofeach parkandwhatthatschedule lookslike,when andinwhatorder.Soifwecanaskthe Administration aboutthat. Also,ifyoucouldasktheDPWwhen pothole patching willbegin.Mrs.Schumacher1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 hadbrought upaboutthestreet sweeper .I'm alsocurious ,Imayhavemissed this,butcan wealsoaskifthecityreceived thegrantfor thesecond street sweeper thatweweregoing for?Ican'tremember ifwedidornot.

AndwemightwanttocopyBernie McGurl onthatletter aswell.Lastly,the paving program forthissummer --Idon'teven knowifwe'rehaving oneatthispoint.Butif wecancheckonthat.AndI'vealsobeenasked byaresident toseeiftheAdministration wouldconsider paving the16and1700blocks of Wyoming Avenue.Andthat'sallIhave.Thank you. MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Justa couple comments .Mostofourdiscussion tonight hasbeenabouttherepairofthis1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 building oralternative solutions .Andagain, Iwouldliketourgeeveryone toremain open-minded. Personally Ifeeljudging bythe numbersthatwe'veseensofar,financially it'sinthecity'sbestinterest toexplore otheroptions .That'snottosaythat'sthe routeIfullysupport.Ifitcostsmoremoney tomove,Iwouldn'tsupport it. Butonethingthatourcaucus tonight really brought intomyrealization is thatthis10million dollar plusproject doesn'ttakecareofeverything .Thereisa number ofitemsandbigticket itemsthatare notreplacedorrepaired inthisrenovation . Oneofthebiggestisbeingwindows . AndIunderstand thereasoning whybecause it wouldcostevenmillions moretodothat.But whenyou'relooking atdoingallofthese upgrade s,youwouldhopesomeofthebenefit wouldbeenergy efficiency ,lessutility bills. We'renotgoingtoachieve awhole lotofthatbyleaving theseoldwindows in place.Also,someoftheotheritemsthat aren'ttakencareofinthisreviewarethe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 bathrooms .Thebathrooms arefunctional .But ifyou'vegoneinthem,they'renot-- especially thefirstfloorbathroom isnot the--it'snotastate-of-the-artfacility by anymeans. Security whichissomething thathas beenbrought up,Scranton CityHallisprobably theonlygovernment building inthecitythat doesn'thaveanytypeofsecurity .Whether thatissomething thatneedstobelooked atin thefuture ornotissomething that,youknow, certainly upfordebate. Butthat'snotpartofthisplanas well.ITupgrades ,whichIknowwespendaton ofmoneyontryingtogetourITuptowhereit should be.It'snowhere nearwhereitshould be.Andagain,partofitatleastwithinthis building ,youknow,it'sbecause oftheage. Watershutoffs,IknowIdidmeet withPaulO'Horawhohandles almost allthe building maintenance .Iknowthere'salotof issueswiththecurrent plumbingwithin our building .Todoasmallrepair inabathroom , wehavetoshoutdownthewholeplumbing system.Thatcertainly shouldn 'tbethecase.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Andwithout thesebathrooms beingaddressed ,I wonder whatwillhappen withthataswell. Andfinally,thelastthingthat really wasn'tincluded atall--andIhope it'snotinthebuilding butanytypeof environmental issues.Looking atthose picture s,tomeitlookedcertainly likeitmay beasbestos .Thereisalsomold.Therecould possibly beled.Removing thesetypeofitems isnotcheap. Thatisnotincluded inthis10 million dollar figure aswell.Ithinkthe suggest ionthatMr.Bulzoni madeinhismemoto explore thePenFed Building makesalotof sense.I'veneverbeeninthatbuilding .But Idoreally liketheideaofhaving parking for residents . Oneofthebiggest frustrations with thisbuilding foranyresident coming hereis thereisonlyacouple spots,15-minute spots infrontofthebuilding .Thereisnoparking lotforthepublic.Andyoupayameter.Soa lotoftimesafterdriving around theblock five,sixtimes,they'refrustrating before theyevencomeinthebuilding andthengoing1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 upaflight ofstairs,waiting foranelevator . Anewfacility canbemuchmore citizen friendly forpeople coming intopaya garbage bill,getapermitfromLicensing and Inspections .Andthebuilding couldbe structur edinawaywherethefirstflooris allofthosedepartment sthatthepublic is interacting witheveryday. Andthentheupperlevels wouldbe thedepartments thatdon'thavequiteasmuch foottraffic .Andontheparking note,one thingtokeepinmindis--andagain,it'sa beautiful building .It'sahistoric building . I'mcertainly notsaying tearitdownorthrow awaythekey. Butthisbuilding wasbuiltbefore people hadcars.Soyoucouldseewerethere isdeficiencies fromaneaseofuse perspective .SoIreally thinklooking at otherfacilities outside ofthisbuilding if thenumbers makesensereally isthedirection thatweshould begoing. LikeIsaid,a10million dollar pricetagwhichinmyopinion doesn'teven cover--maybecovers 75percent ofwhatneeds1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 tobedoneversus purchasing abuilding that's listed for5million. Thatmeanshopefully wewouldbe abletogetitforlessthanthat,doingsome renovation sandhaving anewbuilding with lowerutility costs.Itmakessenseto explore .Idosupport thegrantapplication . Itdoesn'thurttoask. Butbefore voting foranyactual funding ,ifthecityweretodoamatch,it wouldbe5milliondollars .I'msurethere willbedebtassociate dwiththat.Before voting onanything wherewe'reactually spending money,Iwouldwanttoseea side-by-sidecomparison basedontherenovation ofthisbuilding andafewotherbuilding sthat arepossibly forsaleinthecity. ButIdothinkthepresentation tonight washelpful .AndIdoagreeif renovation saredone,thereneedstobea number offirmsbidding ,notjustone. Andfinally ,Iknowmyself anda number ofmycolleagues spokewithsome residents onthewayin.Theyweregoingto speakandthentheytalked toallofus.Sowe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 didgetalistof--alengthy listofissues withtheproperty located at--afour-unit property at1208-1210PhiloStreet.It'sa four-unitapartment house.Residents state there'sbeen42police callsinthelastcouple years,twoorthreeabandon edcarstowed,which Iknowthatpersonally because Ihelped them getthemtowed,threepitbulls removed , numerous quality oflifeviolations .Todaya drugaddictleftandpassedoutonthe neighbor 'slawnnextdoor.
