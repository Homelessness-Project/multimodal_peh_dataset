Also this Monday, St. Ann's Solemn Novena starts at the Basilica of St. Ann's. And that is all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Derek Raines. MR. RAINES: My favorite nurse and wife Jill has pictures of our reoccurring water problem which we have discussed I don't know how many times. I remember Mr. West asking a couple times is that hole on Myrtle or Ash Street. And those holes are still there. The number one injury in the United States is slips, trips and falls. And you listen to your scanner every day, there are people in this city who have slips, trips and falls and get hurt. And there is no reason our DPW can't fill up those two holes. There's a lot more stuff that needs to be done. The pictures my wife passed out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 every time it rains the water is just atrocious . There is no reason that should not have been fixed by now. Snow is going to be here before you know it. My wife is the closest operating room nurse to CMC. If you have mass casualties or some emergency , my wife has to be there. We traded in our Chevy Crew Cab Silverado and we got a handicap van. And there is just all that water that is just going to ice and frozen. And it should be rectified . That should not be a 20-year problem to get this stuff fixed. There's no reason. Our head of DPW came to my house. He said, oh, yeah, I'm going to put in an RFQ and we're going to get it taken care of. Everybody here, Mr. McAndrew , Dr. Jessica , you've all said, oh, yeah, why don't we get this done, why isn't it done? And here we are now once again it's still not done. And it's a disgrace the amount of dirt that I bring into my house because they don't sweep our streets . I was driving down the other day to take pictures , there's still leaves on my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 street, fall leaves from last year because the sweeper doesn't go up and down the street because nobody has any idea when they are going to come sweep so they come by and there's all the cars are there. As I always say, we have the cleanest middle of the street. And then we go back to the whole water issue. And you could look at those pictures . And the other one that I have is this one which is the 1000 block of Jefferson Avenue. Here, do you want to take that up? That is 1000 block of Jefferson Avenue. You go into that area. It used to be part of where the railroad tracks were. And the train tracks are all still there. They are there and they are just a hazard for people walking . They are a hazard for me. It needs to be ripped out and paved that thousand block is goes directly into all of those doctors ' offices and everything . But number one, there are no sidewalks on that road at all. The city built new sidewalks for that grocery store that is there. And I asked the guy, I said, who is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 paying for these sidewalks ? And he said you are. This is being done for the city. So if the city could put in sidewalk for a business , why can't we get our sidewalks done and especially something like that? I mean, there's kids that go there. There's people walking all the time. There is no reason that is not done. Do I have any more? So I think you all -- you guys all do a great time -- how much time do I have left? One minute? So in talking , all of you -- Mr. West -- Mr. Smurl -- oh, I did have one thing to tell Mr. Smurl. I'm a former scuba diver. I'm a former parachute r. There is nothing I enjoy more than jumping off of something high. And these kids that are going and jumping into the gorge, we got to get the pool in there with a nice high dive on it. In Indianapolis , my sister's house, it has the 10 meter diving board on it. And I would love for to us have something to do like that. These kids would have so much fun jumping off something like that. And it's a lot of fun. People love to jump off stuff. My 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 wife does it. I just really think all of you guys are doing a really great job and I appreciate all of you. No time left. Thank you so much have a great day. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Raines. You too. MR. RAINES: Mr. West, are you going to get all that stuff done for me? MR. KING: Mr. West is gone but we'll ask Mr. Voldenberg to reach out to DPW and try to get an update as to what the game plan is to address these issues. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with DPW in the morning and with the water company . MR. KING: Mr. Raines, I'm not sure if you know the water company is going to be digging up that street this year which is probably partially why that hasn't been done. MR. RAINES: As I said to the guy from the water company , this problem is not caused by the water company . It's caused by the city putting six layers of pavement on top of the road (inaudible .) It is fabulous . They did a beautiful job. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Raines. Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Well, I'm going to start by complimenting the city. I was walking down the 500 block of Lackawanna Avenue going to the dentist . What did my wondering eyes see? The clock that the city owns has been repaired, only took several years but the clock works. Okay, also, I would like to recommend to everybody if you get a chance on especially if you have children , go visit the Civil War museum which is now open in the Marketplace at Steamtown . It's right in front of Crunch Gym on the second floor. It's beautiful ly managed . I think the guy that runs it is Hal Meyers. He has ancestors from this area who fought in the Civil War. And the museum's displays and artifacts and records all have to do with the people from this area who fought in the Civil War. So, please, I mean, it's a wonderful part of our history . And I wish that people would come and take their children to see it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 It's open Monday, Wednesday , and Friday 11 to 4 and on the weekends 12 to 4. Now, I was looking at the items on the agenda and there was one on traffic signal improvements which the legal cover sheet referenced connectivity walkability study which caused me to reflect back on questions I have not had answered . I was really surprised when you didn't ask the members of the Parking Authority that were giving you an update what they thought of that study since it had specific recommendations as you know, Mr. Smurl, on changes to parking downtown . And the guy said, yeah, I'm kind of broadly aware of it but he said I think I'm going to go and download it, download it from the website and read it. Here's what surprised me. The Parking Authority should have been consulted during that study. The Center for Independent Living which represents many of our disabled downtown residents should have been consulted . The downtown residents and business owners should have been consulted . But I get the impression 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 that the connectivity study is a done deal and now we're going to start seeing legislation going forward to implement it. I don't disagree with its objectives . But, you know, I feel like when we were going through the renaming of Spruce Street to Biden Street, yeah, yeah, yeah, we hear you but it's a done deal so just sit down and shut up. And I really do think, you know, that the citizens and the taxpayers , people who either live downtown , work downtown or drive through downtown or for whatever reason come downtown should have a voice. And their questions and concerns should be addressed and not simply ignored . And I think that's where we stand right now. It's not that they -- the objective is bad or wrong or not supportive . We all want to see improved safety, both for vehicle s and pedestrians . But you treat us like children who have no right to say anything , you know, why? Because I said so. Okay, and that's the way I feel. I hope during Fifth Order you give us the status 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 on the pocket park what you got from Scranton Tomorrow . And I'd also -- I'm still waiting for an answer -- oh, tell me what's going on with the police contract 's arbitration . MR. KING: Status quo. They are still in arbitration . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, Mr. Ufberg, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, making a lot of money. MR. KING: The Mayor indicated she was hoping that would he wrapped up very shortly . MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, yeah, that's what they said about the audit. Speaking of the audit for 2022, have they said anything about how that's going? Are they still going to get it gin by the end of September ? I'm just warning you that when you come back in September , that's the first question I'm going to be asking you, so please have the answer ready. MR. KING: We're very optimistic . MS. HODOWANITZ : I still want to know what the city is going to do if we have another code red alert. That question you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 never answered . And that's a public safety issue. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I only had one thing to talk about tonight but then my paper is filled after listening to the presentation about the Parking Authority . Going forward I don't know if it would be appropriate because I do have questions as they are talking . And I'm always hoping that maybe Council members would address some of the questions that we the common people of Scranton residents have. So I don't know if we know that the Parking Authority is going to be here is it appropriate for us to read who is going to be here and send you e-mails of the questions so that you could address those questions to the panel as they are here. MR. KING: We'll try to announce that in a timely fashion . They typically come I think every quarter . MS. JEFFRIES : I was away on vacation . So, you know, I'm a little behind on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 what's going on with Council . But when I saw that they were here, one of the things Mr. Smurl mentioned the credit card, you know, he was right on. I do use a credit card now at the vending machine because I got tired of getting tickets . But the one that I use is only for -- I call it my play debit card. I don't use the one that has all of my living expenses on it for that very reason. I'm not quite so sure how secure the kiosks are. But, you know, I got tired of getting tickets. So I did go and get myself a credit card, debit card just for that reason. It does work well as the gentleman was saying. One of the things that I wanted to -- my question was and I even ask about it is that the sign on the kiosk, does it say anything that after 5:00 you don't have to pay? Do the machines -- the kiosks get shut down so that it doesn't accept the money because people think I'm Council . I'm not Council I just come here and talk. But one of the things I've been asked is, you could put money in those machines after 5:00. I didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 know that. So I told them, I said, well, that sounds like something we need to go to Council and ask about. So here I stand asking that question that is there some kind of shutdown mechanism that will not accept money after 5:00 or what are the hours that they run. And then the second thing that the gentleman mentioned was, I can't believe that they don't have a more sophisticated system to monitor the kiosks. When he had the screen up and he had the line items, I was looking for something that had an update to their kiosk system. Do they update it and monitor even more closely the kiosks as we -- as the public should not have to call them and ask them about the kiosks and tell them that the kiosks are not working and to go down and find a kiosk -- and I've been in that situation where you have to find a kiosk that's working , it's very frustrating especially if you are only going to be in town at a kiosk or maybe 45 minutes or so. So I had a lot of concerns . I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 very interested in what he was saying. And I have to thank Mr. McAndrew for asking him to speak up because again, we can't hear back there unless they are told to speak into the mic. Okay, that wasn't on my list to talk about but being that he was here. I was on vacation as I said and one of the things I kept watching was street signs. Street signs, street signs, street signs, I was all -- I went all the way up to Maine to Bar Harbor. It was a wonderful vacation . And the street signs, not one street sign that we come across that was illegible , that we got to where we needed to go. And, you know, it's just so frustrating , especially when I hear -- and I go along with you, Dr. Rothchild , with the handicap . My husband had to have a handicap placard . So I know the seriousness of that and why and when someone is parking there. But how can they jump to your item and put -- and get the signs made for the handicap and yet I've been up here at this podium for over five years talking about the street signs. I'm coming back up from vacation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 driving up 81 and I got off 81 there at River Street and I'm thinking nothing has changed , not that I expected it to in two weeks. I was only gone two weeks, but nothing has changed . So, you know, when I hear Dr. Rothchild talk about her signs are going to be made that they're going to be marking the streets and put the signs up, so what do I or what do we the people of Scranton need to do so that we could get more action on the street signs? And my time is up and I didn't get to say all that I wanted to say. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Frank, can we check with DPW to try to get an update as to where they are at in terms of I know that they were making the signs. It's just a matter of, you know, actually starting to put them up. I know there was talk about possibly -- I think there is only three people in the department , possibly maybe putting out or subcontract ing to get some of those signs up. But that needs to be a priority . We need to get that moving. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. KING: Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . I'll make it still available that we still have disinfectant wipes available that we have been donating out. The past week we donated a tractor trailer load to one of our local volunteer organizations here donated by myself and President Trump. We've done it in Florida . We've done it in Palestine , Ohio. And we would like more and more people in our area to make it available if they are interested through myself, through the Masonic organization that I belong to that we're making them available to everybody . So they could call my office in Throop, 346-7659 and make arrangements to come pick them up or if they want a tractor -trailer load, we'll deliver it. The other part of this is, I'm not happy walking into City Hall with the doors locked. I think it's a joke to try and call phones down here and get somebody to answer a bloody phone. Our time is as valuable and more valuable than those that we're paying. This is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 our City Hall. It's not Council 's. It's not the Mayor's. It's nobody else. And if we are worried about who is going to walk in here during the day and this and that, have the sheriff department do it. We pay county taxes. If we're that scared about what we're doing -- you have a police officer standing here tonight . Why wouldn't that be possible for him to stand outside the door downstairs ? We've had this all open since I'm a child here. We need to take the locks off the door and open up our city to the people who actually made the city what it is today. That's our citizens . This other nonsense here about neutral gender on doors, let's get realistic . It's men. It's women, period. There is no other explanation for whatever it is. Would you like your daughter s in there while some clown walks in there, some guy walks in there while your daughter or your wife or your sister or whoever it may be in there? It's got to come to an end. There's no more of this nonsense neutral gender, gender neutral crap. We got to bring it to a halt. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 We started around here with this nonsense . You know, I pulled in today and we have the queer flag still flying. July -- it's over with. What's the flag, Mr. Schuster , behind you? What's that black flag say, sir? MR. SCHUSTER : (Inaudible .) MR. BOLUS: That's correct . Why isn't that flag flying out to honor our vets, our fellow vets that didn't come home. We got one day, Memorial Day. That flag out there got a month? I'd like to know what honor they did. What war did they go to? What did they bring us? What freedom did we get? We got zero. Maybe we should open this up now to maybe we want to come in and talk about our sex orientations on our side of the fence. Maybe we should have that open up publicly and we could discuss it. We discuss everybody else's orientation . Let's have it on our side, maybe it will be a little bit more interesting because you'll hear both sides of the story and you know that is the stuff that happens . Tomorrow at 6:00 Laureen Cummings , former commission er and myself are holding a City Hall type meeting for everybody to come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 and speak out tomorrow at the Holy Cross Hall on 5th and Broadway which I own we're holding it there tomorrow night. And the purpose of it is to address the grooming of kindergarten children in schools with drag queen story hour, castration , surgical of 14-year-old kids. How about puberty blockers rendering them their service at 10 years old. This is only the tip of the icebergs . We need now to worry about our children , not what other people have in their mind what they should do or we should follow this. I just come back from a trip down south in Florida . And I saw what's going on there. And I saw the people now standing up and saying wait a minute. Enough is enough. They are protest ing it because you haven't offered our moral support and I say me and others. We don't have to be led by the nose by somebody for some other reason. This is America . Everybody has a right to their own sexual orientation , their own privacy ; but that doesn't mean we have to accept it and see our children persecuted because our officials will not take the stand to give them the right under 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the Constitution they are entitled to. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. MR. BOLUS: It's time we wake up and start doing what we need to do. And that's take care of the kids first. Thank you. MR. KING: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Last week, Mr. Smurl, you talked about driving up Linden Street and you hurried up to get through the three green lights. What makes you think the stop signs are going to make it any different ? I think it's going to make it worse. People are going to rush to the stop signs and if there is -- if they don't come to a red light, they're going to roll right through . They'll see nothing's coming. What's going to happen if three or four cars get there at the same time? Who's going to go first? You might have two, three cars trying to go at the same time causing accident s. This walkability study is ridiculous . When I was a kid growing up, downtown was a heck of lot busier than it is right now. You didn't have empty storefronts . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 You had the Globe Store, Oppenheim , Kresge's, Woolworths . You had three movie theater s and countless other stores which I can't remember them. There was no walkability problem . My friends and I used to walk to town and shop or go to the movies almost every Saturday . There was no walkability problem . Why all of a sudden is there a walkability study? If you want to get more people downtown , the people who were here before are most of the problem why nobody comes to town to shop. It's too expensive . You can't afford to park down there. And plus as I said, there is not that many business es as there was when I was growing up. Next thing, that paying a fee if you have firemen come to your house for a fire, that's totally ridiculous . We pay our taxes, number one, to have our garbage picked up and for fire and police. Nobody should be getting a bill if their house is on fire. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard of. And for years I think the garbage fee is illegal . That's why we pay our taxes to have our garbage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 picked up. Okay. Next thing, any date on the pavings for streets ? MR. KING: We're going to address that in Fifth Order. MR. SPINDLER : All right. And another thing, I sympathize with the gentleman that spoke before with the water problem . God knows how many years I've been coming here trying to get the problem on my corner fixed and then I was promised over a year and a half ago that the whole intersection is going to get done. We're still waiting for that. It will be two years in October . So I don't know what the answer is. But something has to be done. I think if Tom Preambo was the DPW Director , things would get done. He told me when he was the director he would watch the Council meeting s. And when he heard about a problem he would get it taken care of. I think we got to get the right people in there to get things done. When I asked the Mayor one time why did he resign she said, oh, it's a personnel problem . Every time they don't want to answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 questions , it's a personnel problem . He was doing a heck of a job and it's a shame he's not here anymore. Next thing, I brought this up many times about Family Dollar on Main Avenue people coming out the wrong way. Is there any news about that? MR. KING: I believe that we inquire d about that, didn't we with the Scranton Police? Did we get an answer? MR. VOLDENBERG : The traffic officer referred it to the city engineer who is looking into the matter. MR. KING: Okay, the city engineer is looking at the situation . MR. SPINDLER : It's definitely a safety problem . That's all I have at this time. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . I'm here tonight regarding the condition of the Theodore Street overhead railroad bridge. Please take note of the picture s. And after looking at the picture s, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 would you agree that it looks to be a danger to the community ? Theodore Street is a daily well-travelled roadway . Many trains travel over the bridge 24 hours a day. We have North Scranton Little League still under construction , North Street playground , Neil Armstrong School all within one block away from who must walk under this bridge. We have the apartments at North. It's a Colts and a school bus route. Electric , phone, cable lines run through this bridge. The bridge is over 100 years old. Do you know if it's owned by the City of Scranton or the Railroad and whom will assume responsibility ? Who has been maintaining this bridge? Do we have any inspection reports and can you provide them to us? Will you request an emergency inspection by a structural engineer after viewing those pictures stating the condition and recommending for this bridge and signing their name to that report? North Main Avenue Railroad bridge -- I'm sorry, the bridge bounces when the trains go over it. The bridge is also home to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 hundreds of pigeons . We all remember the Minnesota bridge collapse and the many train derailments we've had lately. I'm not going to get into all the scientific s with you. But a buildup of pigeon dung contains ammonia and acids. If all the dung isn't washed away, that drys up and it turns into concentrated salt and water. It combines with salt and ammonia , it creates small electric al chemical reactions that rust the steel underneath . Oxidation on these bridges usually from bird dung reduces integrity dramatically , like, one inch half piece of plate can be reduced to 1-8th inch because of the oxidation . That's a 75 percent reduction . This bridge has pieces that have literally evaporated . There's going to be financial collapse very soon. Do we know if any of the trains travelling through our area are carrying radioactive material or hazardous chemicals ? And are we prepared to handle that? The way it looks, we don't seem to have a very good record of maintaining or inspect ing our bridges , Parker Street, Howell Street, Green Ridge 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Street, Lackawanna Avenue, Elm Street, Broadway Street, Luzerne Street, South Webster Avenue near McNichols Plaza, the 2800 of North Main Avenue, the 500 of West Market Street, the North Main Avenue railroad bridge, the Luzerne Street railroad bridge, you get the point to name a few. Putting up orange cones and barricade s, yellow tape doesn't fix the problem , nor does it protect the citizens who pay taxes. We are the investors in the city. The Mayor was bragging at her City of the Union about the credit rating and the ARPA money. That's great. Now, let's use it for some improvements in our city. Instead of us being like a city on welfare waiting for our next free handout in way of grants, address the issues now while it's under your watch, Mayor. Don't leave here and leave the infrastructure worse than you found it. So in closing , Council , I'm demanding that the Theodore Street bridge, the area between Ralph Street and Return Avenue be closed to all traffic until you can assure the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 citizens of Scranton it's safe for all of us. MR. MCANDREW : I'm going to bring it up in Fifth. People approached me over the weekend about this. MR. ARGENTA : Thank you. I appreciate that. Okay. And also, Mr. King, is there any word on the inventory list of the city-owned properties , vacant lots? MR. KING: Frank, did we submit a request for a list? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did submit it last week. And I'm awaiting the list. MR. KING: Okay, if we can check on that. MR. ARGENTA : Thank you. I appreciate that. Also a list of the Job Johnnies or porta lavs, or whatever you call them, location s and how much they have been costing us. MR. KING: Frank, I'm not sure if we inquire d about the porta potties . But if we didn't, if we could request a comprehensive list. MR. ARGENTA : I only have 40 seconds left. So with Rubicon , do we know how many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 more trips the smaller trucks are making to the landfill ? And do we know what goes on with the guys that are on the back, the throwers ? When these trucks are going to the landfill s, do they have a job or is there a task that these guys are doing as the truck is gone to the landfill or are these two guys off the clock? How are we watching the two guys that aren't on the back of the truck and how much extra trips, the smaller trucks are making to the landfill if we could find out and is that the cause for the overtime the guys working later trash being picked up and being missed? Thank you if we could -- the bridge. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Mike Eagan. MR. EAGAN: Good evening , City Council . Mike Eagan, 500 block of North Webster Avenue. I live in Webster Towers. We have a lot of handicap . There are a lot of sidewalks where when they come to the intersection there is no way for the wheelchairs, the walkers , the walking (inaudible ) to get up to cross. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 And I contacted Senator Casey's office and somebody told there that the city was suppose d to do that to be in compliance with the ADA Act. So is that true and if it isn't, why don't you look into it so we can, you know, us disabled can go down and support the businesses , you know. I fell at the corner of Hancock and Vine. The curb is about this high (indicating ) and there is no way to -- across the street on the other side, it's the corner of Monroe and Vine. There is a huge multifamily house. And I mentioned it. I saw the landlord back there and I mentioned to him people are parking so they block the sidewalk . And you can't get through . And a couple times I had to walk in the street and people came flying up the street not expecting -- I guess not expecting me to be there and I almost got run over. So is there something that could be looked into that we could get this resolved because I would love to go shopping downtown but I'm afraid to. And I'm not going to pay Uber and the taxi companies $10 to go from North Webster 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Avenue down to the mall. I don't have the money to. I'm disabled . I don't have the money to do that. So I would like to walk. And the buses, it's hard because the bus goes up -- now it used to go up Webster Avenue. Now it goes up Quincy. And so I still have to cross streets that don't have the curbs cut into it. I like to go to church. I am a Catholic . I like to go to Immaculate Conception of the corner of Taylor and Gibson I think it is. There is no way from North Webster or from Taylor Avenue to cross Pine on this side of Pine because there is no way to get the walkers up and down. And I'm not suppose d to be lifting . But I do kind of -- therapy did give an idea how I can get the walker up. But I don't feel comfortable since I fell. I don't feel comfortable doing that. So I would appreciate if we could look into this and get this solved because like I said, I would love to go downtown and support -- I would love to support the local businesses . But if I can't get there, it's hard to do. Thank you very much. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Eagan. We took some notes here. We'll look into those curb cuts for you as well. Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : I've got them. MR. KING: Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you, Council . I don't have too much to whine about tonight . Last Thursday 's paper about the state of the city article , it mentioned Mrs. Cipriani , the Business Administrator said that the -- I'm not positive if I got the figure. I think she said 80 percent of the projected revenue was in and 56 percent of the wage fees, how can they be different if you pay your wage fee with the taxes? I just wondered about that. And on the walkability , one of my neighbors asked me if you need a sidewalk because they are more welcome d to travel around my area. You have to avoid junk cars on the sidewalk and all the cars on the sidewalk for the illegal boarding houses on North Main. But I would like to see the walkability for the whole city, not just downtown . It seems like our Mayor is just so obsessed that downtown is her -- like her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 little dollhouse of her own that she could do what she wants with. I think they collected , what was it, 68 million in American Rescue and 20 million last year? She seems to have no control . There seems to be no control of what she wants to do with it. I know there is some put aside for the work on the sewer work and so forth. You people are just so detached from let's say a quarter of the city's residents that for some reason it seems like the ones -- the low income people seem like the ones I always run into and are telling me something . Yesterday the Salvation Army held an event with -- I guess they sponsored the utilities . Two hundred seventy -eight people showed up. That was I think that was 95 households in dire need of financial help with their utilities . So many people have a fear of this coming assessment will be nothing but a fraudulent worth of our properties . Like I said, I get that paperwork last month $195,000 they got my house appraised at. You've been there. You know my neighborhood . Is that sort of -- you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 you're talking about people from out of town working for an out-of-town company telling us what our property is worth. They have no idea what property at Nay Aug isn't worth what it was when they started . I don't know. It's -- I hate to see -- I do have something nice to say though. I was talking to a lady that said the nicest thing about the -- she had to use the police and the fire department . She had nothing but praise. And I know I mentioned a few seconds ago the waste department people, I sure don't have any complaint s against them. They do -- Roseanne always has some kitty litter in one of the things. That has to be awful heavy for them to pick up and throw on the truck. One other thing real quick, can you answer when I ask about the taxes -- thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in list. Are there any other individuals that would like to speak? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First, I would like to thank Tim on ECTV YouTube channel . Thanks for the offer for an Irish coffee, maybe an Irish coffee but no beer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 for me. Now onto Council issues, we had a reference here about the health concerns and code red. Homeless and smoke health concerns by the Home Rule Charter Section 5215 are City Council 's power to meet public emergencies affecting life, health, property and the public peace verified by Section 60916, the power and authority of the Mayor, not to enact but to enforce any emergency powers that Council may establish by ordinance to preserve health, welfare , and the safety of the citizen ry. Why is City Council afraid of the power granted exclusively to you by charter ? Smoke and code red, write it, pass it, and make the Mayor comply. This is your duty. It looks like Code 360 is also a bad copy because the powers to Council relating to public health were not ordinance required . Public health emergency is by emergency order of Council . And the Mayor has no veto power in this case. It resides strictly with this body. Next, pilots, can we get a list of who and how the city has reached out on the request of pilot donation and who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 has not respond ed or declined? Mr. King said the administration 's reached out to people. Provide a list of the organizations reached out to, please and if they have since responded . Let's not talk about RFP for a HUP test. A payment in lieu of taxes is not a HUP test. You seem to want to confuse and commingle both of the issues. Onto the pool, Mr. Smurl wants another study done for the Nay Aug Park pool complex to pay for it. And after the research is done, reach out to the entire community for ideas and feedbacks so you could again go back, have new plans and create new plans based upon the feedback . Have you ever thought about public input prior to paying for designs to avoid repeat costs as the administration never puts a plan out that the public is happy with or would desire with. And I doubt that's a mistake . Let's talk about rentals . Have we gotten any response yet about the universities and other non-profits who offer rental housing AKA dorms, charges a rental fee? As I understand it from the past it's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Scranton 's policy for taxes for fires and overbilling trash. It's charged first and then respond to legal issues later. Why not just bill them for the rental fee $45 a year a per dorm and let them challenge it like you do with everything else? Onto questions about the future, it was asked what difference do you see in the city in five years from now. But that's not the question . What have you achieved sitting in this seat? How have you reduced costs? You had special session s to hide the administration 's wish not to make employees responsible for overtime . What was the city's resistance and if they have resistance , why can't the Mayor appear here and defend the no paperwork for overtime policy? Dr. Rothchild mentioned a number of times that you often see people in the Penn Avenue handicap spot occupied by a person in the parking space who does not have a placard and want the police to patrol more. I wonder how often have you called to report to the police illegal parking when you see it or do you just note it, walk by because it's somebody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 else's problem ? The walkability study as Fozzie bear would say, it's the walka-walkability study. The study is a joke. Maybe the use of red light cameras would stop speeding and gunning to beat the red lights. There's a lot of problems here and part of it is this body is given certain powers. And this body tends not to use them and passes the buck to the Mayor. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxes paid. The train came up again. There was a train accident out in Ohio. And I will reiterate in 2018 the office of the President laxed our regulation s on rail and rail maintenance and also in thanks the bank failure with the Silicon Valley Bank tied up 8,100 payroll account s. It could have been three people. It could have been 30. So keep that in mind when we're pointing the finger. Now, this has been going on for years with me. We have too many, way too many tax exempts in this town. I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 care why they are tax exempt. I really don't care. And if they are unwilling to at least contribute to a pilot, then they should be willing to sign a petition . And actually it would be even if they are paying a pilot signing on a petition would be in your best interest anyway because it's ridiculous that you are being asked to pay it and only a few actually are at 40 percent or near 40 percent of tax exempts . Furthermore on tax exempts , in 1958, they establish ed a new tax law. And tax exempts were supposed to be silent on political issues. No political issues are allowed . However , they left and sneak it in I think 1959. But in the original law, all political activities are not to be conducted , any by tax exempts . And myself I deeply resent it. I don't need everybody poking their nose in and then on top of it paying no taxes. Now, let's get back to the traffic study. I have a very old article here from Brian Fulton's that I recently harvested from the paper.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 But we astutely study our astute studies to ensure that our astute studies were properly astute to ensure proper astuteness to our studies . And I am nearly totally against turning this town on its head. I think it's just a coup de grace to the business district downtown. It's a coup de grace. If I think I'm going to come and get my car plastered and T-boned and have some jerk that couldn't wait his turn at a stop sign and come out and say you cut me off or even worse yet we'll get a government in Pennsylvania that thinks it's okay to carry loaded guns in the car or something and start pointing stuff like that just because they felt they were in a bigger hurry than me. I don't worry about where the next stop light is. I stop at this stop light if need be and I pull out and I look where I'm going. I wasn't driving . I was -- but I was in the car that hit a kid. He ran catty-corner across the street at North Scranton High. His older brother was beckoning him, no crossing guards. He practically just ran -- I noted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 by the driver practically just ran into the hood of the car himself and a year later, $19,0000 lawsuit over it. And he wasn't seriously hurt. But it's just ridiculous . I mean, 500 Lackawanna Avenue, 30 million ; Hilton, 5 million ; the mall, a couple million . It's all just money over the dam and we're constantly after a redo of Scranton downtown . So I'm going to leave this article with you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Good evening , things are -- MR. KING: Excuse me, can you state your name? I'm sorry. MR. LITTLE: Rick little. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. LITTLE: I think people around here have to recognize the chain of command and how things work, civics and especially in the judiciary and how it relates to full blown communism and how that communism is based on fear. You're scared you are going to lose 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 something . I was scared I was going to lose my child. I realize the family courts in New York State, this is criminal racketeering when the state gives 65.5 million dollars to the -- to one New York City attorney for the child law firm, well, that tilts the scale in justice . So when I moved to Scranton I see that just about 10 years ago the FBI came in and they looked into the other name for attorney for the child which is the Guardian ad Litem and, you know, found all these weird things. And that's about the same time, you know, I certainly watched the whole trial of, you know, an ex-Lackawanna Commissioner and a chief judge -- I guess a family court judge Ciavarella and how all that went down. I said, yeah, this place is good. But my experience since then is, there's a lot of problem s. And people have to realize that this communism based on fear which I certainly saw when I went to East Berlin in 1986 and a guy holding an AK 47 looking at my Nikon F and I notice that all the people on the street, you know, people coming in from West Berlin, all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 the guys are pimps and all the girls are whores really. That's what it was. They wanted something , you know. You get a Coca-Cola, it tastes like dirt. And it's been going on a long time. And there needs to be a change in the thinking because people have been taught in schools too long and they aren't taught the civics. And they have been led to believe that, you know, everybody is racist and, you know, I have special rights for my identity and I'm a victim. And they grow up this way. And it's been about 30 years when it started in the family court. I had a little girl in the year 2000. I saw her every day for the first three years. It was great. It was the best part of my life. And then I, you know, the state of New York is giving me visitation and certain times I could talk on the phone, phone calls, you know, and I didn't have a cell phone, any kind of, you know, that sort of technology . So the whole thing blew up the same way. And the last time I saw my daughter was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 as a supervised visitation . It's the judiciary , how they keep things going with process . And they are highly paid. I mean, it doesn't take much to keep the process going. And they kept the process going with me for 15 years. And then all of a sudden, my daughter turns 18. And she's been parentally alienated . She doesn't want, you know, doesn't want a relationship with her father. This is happening across the board. I saw it start in New York state when Hillary Clinton became Senator and all of this stuff started building up. And I was a Democrat but I changed in 2015. And I see people -- we need to get rid of this Democrat thinking that's been going on. I mean -- and what I mean is, the same people and especially in the media and the judicial system it has to change. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yeah, just a few quick things. I read the article Mr. Dobrzyn provided us on the one-way streets and how it is to control traffic and to process it through the city as quickly as possible . That's not the whole idea of the walkability study. It's online if you download it or just go online and read it. It explains reasons if three people arrive at an intersection at the same time which one is to turn first. There's a lot of consideration of other people how they drive. But if you just read it all, you will see all the question s that you had are pretty much in there. And there are going to be numerous meetings for the public to go to. This isn't something that's going to happen tomorrow . This is years of work that has to be done in town. It's not going to be cured. I think by having one-way streets and rushing traffic through town, that was PennDOT 's job years ago was to move traffic , not to slow it down. It was to move traffic . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 And it moves pretty well downtown . And as far as how fast they travel downtown , I don't shop downtown because I can't run across the streets fast enough to get across before the lights change. So look online, read the study. And then when the meeting s become available , go to them. And we were at the meeting . There was a few of us at the meeting , not a lot of people. So it didn't seem like there was a lot of interest . But the best thing to do I believe if you want to grow the businesses downtown is slow the traffic down and do it the right way, not to push it through town. That's enough on that one. And the playground mulch I believe they finally got bids in for it. So that should be distributed through all the parks shortly . Thursday evening I was up at the Recreation Authority 's meeting . And there is a lot of interest in what we're going to do at Nay Aug Park as a city. I spent three and a half hours there and there were endless questions . And everybody stayed most of the night. But there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 is going to be a lot of public participation . The proposals that were brought back, we had two of them. I believe we accepted one. But what it's about is, everybody will have the opportunity to speak and say what they want for the park. And then after all of the study has been done and it's all brought together , then the design will take place. I mean, I don't know how else you could read this. But if you read the whole thing, that's how it's going to work. So if you want to be involved , go to the meetings and put your input in of what you expect at the parks and what you want in. That's all I have, Mr. King. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, thank you. A quick one before I say anything else is on the way to the meeting tonight I did get a call about the slide at Tripp Park playground if we can send it over to Parks and Rec. I guess there was some boards that were screwed into one of the slides that said do not enter. I did check it out before I came 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 over. The screws are still in the slide but there are no boards in the slide. I don't know if the city put the boards up to keep the children off of the slide or if the boards were attached by someone , I'm not sure. But it's the side of Tripp Park, there's some screws -- multiple screws maybe about 10 screws sticking out if they could just check that slide out and see what needs to be done there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much, Frank. We got a question today about the smaller trucks. It's been something I have been interest ed in since the city has put out the order for those small trucks. I didn't like the fact that we were getting the smaller trucks. I thought it was going to be more trips to the landfill , more wear and tear on the machines . So I am interested in Chris Smith coming over to meet with us. I thought that was going to be this month. It seems that it will be in September . But I would like to see what they have to say about the small 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 trucks. But if we could send a message over to Chris to see if we are making more trips to landfill with the small trucks or if all trucks are making the same amount of trips to the landfill, that would be great. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. The bridges over in North Scranton and the one on Main Avenue in West Side and North Scranton there, they've been in disrepair for a long time. Can we reach out to the administration and see if they could -- I do believe it's the Railroad Authority that would own these bridges . If they reach out to the Railroad Authority and get inspectors over immediately and check those out or if there is any updated inspection reports that they have if someone from the administration could reach out to get those to let us know where we stand with those bridges . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I have contact s with the Railroad Authority I'll reach out to in the morning . And I'll also have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 city engineer look at both bridges Theodore and North Main to start. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, thank you very much. That's all for tonight . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few different things. First, last week I brought up a couple streets that trash hadn't been picked up on that we receive d a complaint about and this week I received more complaint s about them being behind on trash not being picked up or missing trash. I think Hurts Court was missed last week and then Birch Street was late today. So I'm not sure if it has to do with the new routes with Rubicon . That's what I'm assuming but I would like to ask DPW as to why some of these streets are being missed because I haven't really been receiving these complaints like I have been over the past week. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. Another thing I brought up last week was a property on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Hampton Street, 1158 Hampton Street. And that is something that code enforcement is getting to and should be given a quality of life ticket for. But there was another question about the property . There was some confusion. One of the resident s said that there was a sign up from the Land Bank that said -- asking if anyone wanted to purchase the property . But to my knowledge , it's not Land Bank owned. It's privately owned by out-of-town owners. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could figure out where that sign had come from. It's been torn down since then. But the resident is not really sure why that was there, what that meant. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find out. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And for Mr. Raine's property and his comment -- just going to wait a minute while the sirens pass. I did previous ly discuss with him that American Water was going to take care of that street and it was going to be on their projects and that is why it was taken off of the paving list. But I had asked here -- I had asked -- I have an e-mail here if there was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 anything else that could be done as a temporary solution or fix for him. And I don't think we had received a response on that; is that correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : They did do some light work. However , with the paving schedule , maybe they can bring the street sweeper every two or three weeks for Mr. Raines and his wife. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. That was going to be my request about the street sweeper could be out there or -- MR. VOLDENBERG : -- until the work is done. DR. ROTHCHILD : -- and then we had also been told they were waiting for some added money in the budget for some of those project s. So that one might be done either this year or pushed off to 2024. So I would like to know if that's been decided yet or when they will have their project s budgeted out to determine when that will be done. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find out, Doctor. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And in response Mr. Coyne had asked about the handicap 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 spots and I had obviously contact ed the SPD when I've seen that people are parking in those spots who aren't using the placard . So I have no problem being that person if I need to be but I would rather not. And then there was another response that I had in reference to the gender neutral restrooms . I personally have no problem with them being there. A lot of places have gender neutral restrooms. They are also called single use restroom s. There is only one person in there at a time so it really shouldn 't be an issue with anyone entering it unless you are not locking the door. So that's a way that you could ensure that someone is not going to walk in on you if you lock the door. And also on that note, you could use either one which is nice as opposed to just being designated to the one that matches with your gender. So if that's taken and then you have to wait for that one to be used. So I do find them more efficient and I like having them here in City Hall. And I hope that more places take the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 lead and have gender neutral restrooms if they have single use bathroom as opposed to having them designate d for a specific gender. And a similar note with regards to LGBTQ youth, I just wanted to point out that there have been numerous studies and research over the years that when LGBTQ youth are not accepted by their families or kicked out from their homes that they have a significantly higher percent age of depression , of drug and alcohol use, of suicide . So I'm happy to, you know, bring those studies in or reference them if that's needed. But LGBTQ youth do much better when they are accepted by their families . And I don't think it's a really great use of time here for people to attack transgender youth. And I also don't think that in any way is going to help them. I think it's going to hurt them and the community even more. So that's all I have to say on that. And that's all I have for fifth comment -- Fifth Order tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. So poor Mr. Raines. Here he comes again. And this issue has been at least three years that I have been here. And so he was all excited and I don't blame him his road was going to be paved this year, right? There was light at the end of the tunnel. And then now he's told -- or we're told that he just found out that his street's not going to be paved until next year. All right. So that's fine. I'm glad that for once the water company lets us know because as long as I've been here, most of the time they didn't. They would have paved that street and dug it up, six months, three months whatever later. So but I think he needs it more than just sweeped . This guy has an issue with his driveway every winter. And if it's not going to be paved until next year, guess what, he's going to have another winter dealing with this. So I don't think the little issues that he's begging for should have to wait until next year. So can you please reach out to DPW, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 go back over and find the money? He's told there is no money. There's money flying around. Four hundred fifty grand tonight went for parking , a grant. So please take care of this, make sure they take care of this for this guy so him and his wife could get in and out during the winter once and for all. All right, second, so the garbage , yeah, it is an issue. I get calls almost hourly about garbage . And it is Rubicon . This is groundhog day. Last year when they started Rubicon for one week they shut it down and went back to the routes. And then we asked for them to come in with an update. This is last year. And they said, yeah, sure. Larry West said, yeah, sure. And then they pushed it until after our recess. Fast forward one year they were suppose d to come in since April. Guess when then are coming in? We were told last week they are coming in September right through recess. And why? Because the problems are starting the same time as last year. They started using the Rubicon . And it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 working . And guess what, people's garbage aren't getting picked up and then we're incurring overtime . Did the Mayor give a reason why we're waiting for September when she told you last week? MR. KING: I think because Rubicon actually didn't -- it got started so late I think they wanted to give it some time to actually work some of the kinks out before they come in with the full reports . I believe that's what she said. MR. MCANDREW : Well, what I believe and what I've heard -- well, first of all, work the kinks out. We've been paying for these guys for two years. Their contract is almost up. So the kinks -- there should be no kinks. What I've heard is the last three people that worked for Rubicon on our contract left. That's what I heard. So there is no one to come until September . They got some new guy. So that's the reason with the trash, folks. It's not that hard to read. And then next, when our parks director was hired a month ago he stated that he would get his certification or promised when the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 certification and training process started in June. So one of the lovely ladies that swim at Weston Field reached out to me today and asked if that occurred yet. You remember that conversation , don't you, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I do, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I couldn't find the e-mail where it actually states and I was looking before. But could you circle around and make sure -- ask him, hey, say, you know, first of all, how did the lifeguard training go, how many do we have? Are we good to go for the whole year and did he receive the certification also? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thank you. So then last Friday was at the -- was it Friday or Saturday -- Friday I was at the fundraiser for the Scranton Police Department for the Scranton School District , great event. Very proud of the police department that run this every year. But somebody came up to me in North 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Scranton . Somebody came up to me with the same picture s or similar picture s that Mr. Argenta presented tonight to us on the Theodore Street bridge. And it's deplorable . These picture s look like Chernobyl . It's ridiculous . It's scary. It's very scarey to me. So, you know, just to piggyback on Mr. Schuster here, where are the inspections ? I know that you have -- you have a contact because this has come up before, not this actual bridge. But I remember an issue coming up I think it might have been one on Luzerne towards Railroad a couple years ago. I know you have a contact . Please reach out to them. Definitely -- we have a new city engineer who is very capable . I agree send them both out because -- wait until you see the picture s. I'm going to send them to you. It's horrific . We need reports . We need why and when they are going to fix these. Also, somebody during caucus sent me a picture of the website for the parking . And it says in the browser when you click on the website not secure. I asked if it's secure, didn't I? They said, yeah, sure it is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 in addition to the kiosk. So I'll send you that picture . Just send it to them. Just say, hey, what's up with this because it doesn't make sense all right and ask why. Also, what else did I have sent to me? So there's an issue that was brought to my attention from the Sunoco to Division Street and 17th Street near the Russian Church, Peter and Paul's, the road is horrible and deplorable . Instead going into great detail, I will send you this also, Mr. Voldenberg , so you could pass it on to the proper departments . MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And what else do I have? I believe that's it. No, that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few followups . We had a city resident inquire about grants for Papis Kitchen and Connell Park. Papis Kitchen received $83,600 to support startup costs for the Puerto Rican restaurant including hiring new employees and interior renovations marketing and more. The monies for Papis includes a food cart for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 remote use. There was a $300,000 grant for improvements to Connell Park which include wellness loop trail, playground maintenance and updates, dog park upgrades , green infrastructure and ADA accessibility improve ments. Scott Thomas, the CEO of Scranton Public Library , the no parking here to corner sign at the library book drop has been updated by ABM parking to allow easy vehicle access for book dropoff. Thanks to Daniel Dolan, ABM Parking Coordinator and the ABM team for their assistance . As indicated earlier , I was downtown on Sunday. I had to get tires put on my car so I went for a little stroll around town. And I was walking up Lackawanna Avenue as Miss Hodowanitz was. And I looked up and saw that it was 9:08 and I couldn't believe it because it's been 11:20 for about eight years. I was a little surprise d because I thought -- I actually stood there to make sure that it turned to 9:09 and 9:10 and it did. So I took a picture and I reached out to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Mayor. I thought they were coming this week but apparently the group from Chicago or from Ohio came in and repaired that clock. So I was thrilled to see that that's up and running again. The paving list, City Council asked DPW and the administration to please provide regular updates to Council regarding any changes to annual paving list. Council members advise that several streets of great concern to both the resident s and Council since the last paving project were removed due to updated work project proposed by the water and gas utilities . As Mr. McAndrew indicate d, it's a good thing that at least we're not going to go paving streets that are going to get ripped up. I think the communication is key there. But still, it's important I think that we update that list and make sure that those streets that were earmarked to be paved this year, make sure they are on that list for next year and they don't get jumped by others. Fire property list, Council member Dr. Jessica Rothchild asked the current fire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 damage property list need to be expanded to include a current status, any pertinent notes, dates, timelines as available. She expressed concern over the long periods of time that the fire damage properties remain in city neighborhoods . Code red notification assistance , the city homeless population . City resident Joan Hodowanitz asked that the administration establish a process or protocol for assisting the city homeless population during code red declarations related to extreme heat or the recent air quality issue related to the Canadian forest fires. Council asked what the administration currently has in place and also additionally to talk to Dr. Saxena and see, you know, if there's a plan now that we have been through this, make sure there is some type of plan for the homeless in the future should this come out. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Homeless camps, residents and Council ask for an update and next steps on how the City of Scranton is addressing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 growing number of homeless camps along the heritage trail downtown and now extended to city neighborhoods bordering the trail if we could send over a request to the administration . Weston Field bathhouse repair and other Weston Field complex issues. Resident Virgil Argenta asked for the latest update on the repairs related to the bathhouse at Weston Field. He also asked how Parks and Rec was addressing the large groups that use the complex for soccer games and how the food trucks, drinking alcohol , noise and vehicle s in the park are being addressed by Parks and Rec and the Scranton Police Department . I think the food truck are allowed quite frankly . The drinking of alcohol is, you know, obviously not permitted on public parks. So that is absolutely something that, you know, maybe Scranton Police can do some drive-bys and check on that and then the noise levels. Listing of city vehicle s, the city and Virgil Argenta asked Council for a listing of all city-owned vehicles . Same resident asked for a number of all portable toilets as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 mentioned earlier that are being placed at points in the city and the rental cost for each of those units if we could get that answered . As far as the HUP test concern , Council is looking to have an update on the next steps related to the RFP for the HUP test. Joan Hodowanitz had asked about the delinquent real estate tax when is that going to be on the website . So we got a response from the STO Assistant Solicitor . At first glance -- I'm reading what the response was now. "At first glance it seems that placing delinquent real estate tax information on the city's website would be some combination of extremely difficult , very expensive and open the city up for liability that it current ly does not possess ." The following are the initial problem s that they see: The amount of delinquent taxes on the property changes each month. Someone would need to be in charge of maintaining these numbers or investing in some software that would automatically do this, both of which are not cheap options.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Also, this opens the city up to liability if the incorrect amount is ever posted on the site and somebody relies on this information . Of course, we can put disclaimers on the site as well indicating that the amounts are not certified and should not be relied on. But there is some still risk there. This also applies if delinquent taxes are posted for someone who is not actually delinquent . Essentially right now the burden and risk is on the Tax Claim Bureau. There would have to be a very big incentive for the city to take on the above risks in his opinion . That's the response I got. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : With that one, can we reach out and see who used to do that? It was something that was there for years. So can we just find out who used to do this service ? MR. KING: Frank, if you could check into that, I would appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. KING: In terms of the gender neutral bathrooms , I'll tell you what, I really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 appreciate gender neutral bathroom s here in City Hall, especially , you know, once you hit 60, you really have to go to the bathroom quickly and having the opportunity two options as opposed to just one and having to stand in line, I think that that is a great thing. You know, in terms of LGBTQ, in terms of the diversity in our city, I think that's what makes our city a great place. Mrs. Hodowanitz indicated in the past the people in this city are what makes the city a great place and I couldn't agree more. And I think the more diversity we have in the city and the more welcoming we are, I think it makes our city a far better place. And that's all I have at this time. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mr. King, your -- the request for the porta lavs, I don't know how many -- I do know the Recreation Authority orders and pays for the ones at Nay Aug Park. And there may be a dozen. Sometime s with the concert s and stuff there is more or private events. So (inaudible ) for those separate and I knew the Recreation Authority pays for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 them separately . But Parks and Rec also pays for theirs separate ly. Now, I don't know other department s. I just know about the parks. So if they are looking for the full amount, you're going to have to go to the Recreation Authority too, Mr. Voldenberg , if you are looking for the full amount that they have. And they're all different accounts . MR. KING: True. All right. Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Fifth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING A “NO RIGHT TURN” FROM NORTH MAIN AVENUE TO POND AVENUE, “NO LEFT TURNS FOR TRUCKS” FROM POND AVENUE TO NORTH MAIN AVENUE, SEPARATE THE INTERSECTION OF POND AVENUE AND DEAN STREET VIA LINE STRIPING TO IMPROVE TRAFFIC OPERATIONS AND SAFETY. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT OF COOPERATION BY AND BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND THE SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE CREATION AND EMPLOYMENT OF THE SHARED COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COORDINATOR POSITION . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , just to clarify this, and I know what I think. But there's two community development people in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 budget. One is a community development manager . I assume that it's not this position . And there's a community -- well, actually there's just a development coordinator . The full salary is listed at $51,133.62. This is the full salary for this individual . It is in included in our budget, the fully salary. But this is split with the School District . So if we could just ask the Business Administrator if we can just get what the actual breakdown is just for clarity on this position and maybe just for clarity why the full salary is in the budget. And do we have a job description for this position if you could ask that of HR. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: I think it's listed in there. They have a list of all the responsibilities expected . On the question also, I called Mr. Voldenberg this afternoon after I was reading through this legislation . And I noticed that there was a discrepancy between what the city's obligation is and what the Scranton School District 's obligation is. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 One had 51,000 and the other one had 52,000. Were you able to get an answer on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did get an answer from the Law Department and they filed an amendment to correct the amount to the 51,000. So it was a typographical error. MR. KING: So what was the 51 -- whatever -- MR. VOLDENBERG : -- 332, right. MR. KING: The second one that was listed as 52,000, I figured it was a typo but I just wanted to make sure of that. MR. SCHUSTER : But that is going to be a split. So about 25 -- MR. KING: Right. Yeah, roughly like 25,5, 26, what have you. Okay. All those in favor -- MR. MCANDREW : Well, on the question too, so I've taken a look at this too. So I know we talked about this sharing responsibility for grants. And, you know, of course, the salary is going to be split down the middle and who they report to it says one is going to be the director of Community Development . Where is this person going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 work out of, City Hall or the District ? MR. KING: I think I read in the legislation that it's -- MR. MCANDREW : Maybe I missed that. Where? MR. KING: I think the School District is what I read. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. All right. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Now I'm going to add to that so can we also ask what the hiring process was and is the person currently working ? Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , this is a great way for us to be able to work together and combine resources with the Scranton School District . Although I did -- I thought that the title of the position was different before too. Maybe I'm wrong. I could see why that would be confusing with the (inaudible ) position that's there and also Community Development . That's all. MR. MCANDREW : One more quick one on the question . So you know what, if I was taking this job I'd want to know where my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 pension is coming out. I'd want to know if it's coming from PSERS because the city doesn't have a good a plan as PSERS. That's interest ing to see how benefit s are going to be, where they're coming from what is she getting . MR. SCHUSTER : So what entity the benefit s are coming from -- MR. MCANDREW : Well, think about it. MR. KING: Or if it's the School District , is there a union that they're associated with at Scranton School District and is there a union they're associated with here in the city, which would they fall under, if any? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, well, these are good questions so let's get them before -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, if we can get them before Sixth Order. MR. MCANDREW : Nothing against the hire, just the -- MR. KING: On the question , I plan to vote for it and introduce it. But let's try to get these answers before we, you know, move it along.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – REVISING TRAFFIC PATTERNS ON MARION STREET TO ONE-WAY TRAFFIC WESTBOUND FROM WYOMING AVENUE TO PENN AVENUE, REVISING TRAFFIC PATTERNS ON MARION STREET TO ONE-WAY TRAFFIC EASTBOUND FROM WYOMING AVENUE TO NORTH WASHINGTON AVENUE, RESTRICTING EASTBOUND MARION STREET TRAFFIC APPROACHING NORTH WASHINGTON AVENUE TO RIGHT TURNS ONLY, AND RESTRICTING WESTBOUND MARION STREET TRAFFIC APPROACHING NORTH WASHINGTON AVENUE TO RIGHT TURNS ONLY FOR VEHICULAR AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , it's a very simple question . Can we just ask if any of the neighbor s or resident s were asked for any input on this decision ? MR. VOLDENBERG : A number of them were. I know a majority of them were in favor but I'll ask those questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: And on the question , I know that -- I know some of the neighbors up there -- and I think this is going to be a vast improvement . It's still not going to slow traffic down, cars are flying out to Green Ridge Street from Larch from the light at Larch to Green Ridge Street or from Green Ridge Street out to Larch. The one thing it is going to do is it's going to eliminate cars trying to pull out from Marion both from the east side and from the west side. It's very dangerous . I don't know if anybody ever tried to pull out there. So now, you know, all traffic will go east on Marion toward North Washington and all traffic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 will go west on Marion toward Penn Avenue. I think that that will be a vast improvement in improving safety on our street so I applaud that. MR. VOLDENBERG : And they also inserted the digital speed limit sign on Wyoming Avenue recently to control speed. MR. KING: Beautiful . Okay. Thank you, Frank. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – RATIFYING THE EXECUTION OF TIME-SENSITIVE TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION EASEMENT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN AFFECTED CITY OF SCRANTON PROPERTY OWNERS AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO COMPLETE THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (“FEMA”) PROJECTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEMA DEBRIS REMOVAL CONSTRUCTION PLANS, WHICH ARE TO BE COMPLETED 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 BY THE DEADLINE OF DECEMBER 31, 2023. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , Mr. Voldenberg , I sent an e-mail about this memo. So did Council receive a memo from the Law Department ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did with the legislation but I have no record of receiving it prior. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay.

Did we -- so this you may know, did we get a copy of the other proposal ? We did? I'll take a look at that.

KING: No, I have no problem . Yeah, absolutely , we should know that. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR.
