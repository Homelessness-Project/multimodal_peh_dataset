MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.Iagreewith Councilman RoganthatIthinktheblight committee hasgreatpotential sandI appreciate themayortrying toputit together andformingitandwelookforward tosomeprogress beginning nextweek.Our firstsession willbasically bea brainstorming session butIthinkweare goingtohavesomething constructive over thenextcouple ofweeks. Before Icomment onthearticles on today'spaperIdidwanttostateforthe record thatmydisagreements withtheunions andattimesthepension boards should not beconsidered areflection onthegreatwork thatthepublic safety employees doforour citizens .Wehavethemostprofessional1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 police andfiredepartment inthenortheast andthat'ssomething wecanalltakepride in,butbacktothepensions .Yesterday thereweretwoactions thatweretakenthat continue tomakemattersworse.First,the Pension Board'sdecision tolitigate the administration 'sdecision nottopay increases fortheretiree pensions points to thedeeper issueofnotfullyunderstanding theseverity ofthematter athand. Sure,itwouldgreattogivepension increase storetirees,manydeserve raises andmore,butmaybeifweweren'tpaying $5.2million dollars indisability pensions eachyearthatwouldbepossible .Maybeif wedidn'thavetwotofiveyearsbefore thosepension plansdefault ormaybeif double pension swerenotgivenoutormaybe ifthecitywasnotfighting forour financial lifejustmaybethatwouldbea goodidea,butthepensions areseverely distressed andIknowthiscouncil has demonstrated bytonight 'spublic caucus is committed tofinding solutions andnotbeing accelerating theirdemise.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Secondly ,thepolice unioncontinues tothreaten litigation foraclerical error andit'ssuccess willpretty muchguarantee thatScranton willbeforced intoafiscal emergency .Again,thiscouncil wasinfull support oftheadministration 'sposition on thismatter.Now,onewouldthinkthatthe number oneproblem facingthecityisbudget andpensions andfromafinancial perspective thatwouldbetrue,butthereis adifferent problem facing thiscityand maybeamoredifficult problem tosolve, whilethereissomanygreatemployees that workforthecity,theyareassets anddoa wonderful conscientious jobeverysingle day andthecitycouldnotexistwithout them, butoverthedecades andgenerations a culture thathasbeendeveloped within the wallsofcitygovernment thatjustdoesnot allowourcitytoprosper andifthat culture doesnotchange andwecannot come totermsaswewouldhavetodotogether to moveScranton forward Istrongly feelthis government mayimplode fromtheinside out. Ourgovernment should beforthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 people,allofthepeople,andshould not existforaselect fewwhohavehighjacked progress ,highjacked cooperation ,and highjacked reality . WhileIstillthinkrecovery is possible ,mygutistelling methatthis government mayneedtobetotally overhauled andreinvented,mayberecovery issimply not enough. And,again,whilewecontinue to worktowards recovery thedecisions thatare beingmadebysomeunionsandpension boards tofightthecityateveryopportunity asif thisgovernment issomehow flushwithcash, asiftheirpensions werenotnearing default andtheygoaboutasbusiness as usualisdisheartening .Thoseactions among otherissues willsooner thanlaterdriveus toreceivership andultimately bankruptcy . That'sallIhaverightnow.Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Gaughan .
