MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,Ithinkcommon sensewouldtellyouthatitshould be stopped .Itwasn'trightinthefirstplace andwhat'srightisrightandthat'snot right. MS.FRANUS:Wayne. MR.EVANS:Well,morally Ithink theyshould bestopped certainly ,but legallywedon'tknowwhereit'sgoingto leadusyet. MS.FRANUS:Iwasjusttold,I don'tknow,thatbecause citycouncil ,not thiscitycouncil buttheprevious fromway back,didn'tapprove this,soIjustthought thiscouncil couldhaveanemergency1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 resolution oranamendment tostopthese pensions because sinceitwasneverapproved bycouncil Iwouldthinkyouwouldhavethe powertostopitwithout goingthrough the Court'soranything else.Haveyouever looked intothat?Couldyoulookintothat?

MR.MCGOFF:Anyone else? MS.REED:FIFTHORDER.5-A. MOTIONS . MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Wechsler ? MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou, Mr.McGoff.Tuesday 'spresentation by Auditor General Eugene Pasquale was certainly aneyeopener.Hisfindings indicate thattherewasatremendous failure oftheentire citygovernment inregards to howthesepensions wereissued.Healso1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 acknowledged thattheAuditor General 's Officefailed innotfinding these discrepancies earlier .Ialsothinkthe fundmanager hadsomeresponsibility in this,also. Ibelieve thatthestateandthe citybothfeltthatanoverperforming stock marketwouldprovide funding forthese increases .Themiscalculations and contributions infundsperformance havelead tothepension crisis across America ,but whatdowedonow?Thefindings ofthe Auditor General should befollowed yobythe statepolice,Attorney General andtheFBI, ifnecessary .Theabuseofauthority should notgounpunished . Astothepension ers,Ithinkit willbedifficult toretrieve monies that havebeenalready beenpaid,butfuture payments mustbeevaluated toestablish a newpension amount thatisfairtoboththe fundandtothepension ers. Thereport alsoindicated thatprior citycouncil s/-Sdidnotdoenough to preventthispension abuse.Thiscurrent1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 council hastakenamoreactive roleinthis matter.Council hasbegunreviewing the pension legislation .We'vestarted totake alookatthemakeup oftheboardtoimprove fundmanagement .Wehavealsogoneon record requesting thatpayments bedelayed untilthefundishealthy .Wealsohave goneonrecord supporting pension reform in Harrisburg .Wealsohavepassed legislation thatrequires uniform bargaining unitsto contribute moretotheirpensions . Realistically ,weallrealize that increased contributions orslower withdrawals arerequired tobringthe pension backtohealth.Future pension plansmustbeatleastsometypeofhybrid planthatwilleasethecrises astimegoes on,andbefore themeeting tonight wewere givenaletter written byMayorCourtright suggesting thattheScranton pension plans jointhestateplan.AtfirstlookIthink thatthisisaverygoodidea.Aswas mentioned ,itwouldbringprofessional management tothepension fundsanditwill alsorelieve someofthepressure ofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 people thatareserving ontheboards that arealsogoingtobepension recipients ,so atfirstlookIthinkthat'saverygood idea. Onsomeothermatters,Iwas surprised thattheMallatSteamtown actually garnished a$5.2million bid.When wesatherelastThursday nightMr.Boscov discussed hisbid,hisstarting bidwas around $700,000sohopefully theperson who orpeople whopurchased themallwill continue tomakeuseofitasaretail and alsoasperhaps anoffice orresidential community .Iagreewithseveral speakers tonight ,Ihopeitdoesnotbecome ownedby anonprofit . Onsomeotherissues,Ispoketo JohnPocius earlier thisweekconcerning the engineering studythatisbeingdoneforthe paving oftheroadsthataregoingtobe funded underthePIBprogram .Mr.Pocius toldmethathehasbeenincontact withthe engineering firmandhewillgetbacktome withhisupdate lateronthisweek. Also,Mr.Gaughan andIhavealso1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 beenworking totryandrelieve aproblem up onEastMountain withthehomethatis severely adetriment totheneighborhood . Wehavebeendealing withMr.Hintonand thatandheismaking progress ongetting thatproblem corrected . AsMs.Schumacher brought up,there hasbeenanincrease inovertime overthe pastmonth.Theproblem withpicking numbers likeandjustsaying thatthe overtime isup,itreally doesn'tgivea fullpicture onwhatthesituation is.It istruethatovertime from2015isupover 2014,butwearealsodealing witha situation whereinMayof2014wehad128 firemen onstaff.Currently ,thisyearwe onlyhad118sotheworkisbeingcovered by overtime soactually thereisasavings to thecityofaround $131,000because the extramenaren'tonrightnow. LastweekIdidspeaktoMayor Courtright andIalsoambecoming concerned aboutnothiring newfiremen .Currently , rightnow,wearegetting verylowonstaff. Tothebestofmyknowledge thesoonest we1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 couldaddanyofficers wouldbethenext classisinSeptember andifwedon'thire anybody bythenI'mnotsurewhenthe following classes. Ifwearefortunate enough to receive theSAFERgrantthatwouldallowus Ithinktohire11newfiremen andthat classislargeenough thatitcanbejusta classforScranton firemen ,soitis something thatIbelieve andit'ssomething thatIhopethemayorisbeginning to realize thatwehavetogettheseofficers , fireofficers onhand. Andintermsofthepolice department ,it'sthesametypeofa situation ,theovertime hasincreased from 2015to2014,butthatisbecause thereis currently 13officers offonheartandlung related issues.Fromspeaking tothechief, Iamalsoconcerned thatsomeofthe programsthatweputinplaceandwaiting fortheireffectiveness ,oneofthethings thathedidtellmewasthatthrough June 17,2014,itwas722shifts offbypatrol officers .Forthesameperiod thisyear,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 ending June17,therehasonlybeen373days off,sothesicktimepolicy thatwehave instituted seemstobepaying off.SoIam goingtositdownandspeaksomemorewith theChiefandRebecca McMullen todosome moreanalyzing ofthesenumbers andIthink whatwehavetodoislookforthepayroll forthepolice andfiremoreasanoverall picture thanjustanovertime picture .
