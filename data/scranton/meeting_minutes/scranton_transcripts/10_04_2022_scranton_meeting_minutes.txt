CITY OF SCRANTON ’S TIRE RECYCLING EVENT THAT WILL BE HELD OCTOBER 15, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 2022. 3-D. CITY OF SCRANTON ’S FALL 2022 LEAF RECYCLING SCHEDULE AS PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm just going to make a comment on Third Order. It was one that we just pulled from the table about the City Hall upgrades . So when looking at that last week I noticed some things that were incorrect . I did, you know, say that it brought the bidder that was selected out of the lowest bidder category , and I do understand that it's in the administration 's realm to choose who they feel is most qualified , the RFQ. But I just wanted to make that stated at the time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Are there any other comments on any Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one. This evening starts Yom Kippur and to anyone who observes I just wanted to wish them an easy fast.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. KING: I would just like to announce that the Steamtown Marathon schedule for Sunday, October 9th, we have over 1,025 runners registered from over 35 states and five countries . The race will begin at 8 a.m. at Forrest City High School and will travel through 14 municipalities and end up here in downtown Scranton at the finish line at North Washington Avenue. I just want to remind people if they would please be patient with the runners between pretty much the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the City. The volunteers and the police will be making efforts to make sure that traffic can keep moving and cross the path -- the running path. I just want to thank everyone for their help and participation in this great City event. We're hoping for great weather . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just to add to that, I'm happy to see the Steamtown Marathon coming back this year and acknowledge Councilman King for all the hard work that he puts into putting on that event. Are there any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 other announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : Before we start Citizens Participation tonight I would just like to make a quick statement regarding the Rules of Council . Last week during Citizens Participation a resident made comments that bear no repeating because they were vile and hateful . Those comments had absolutely nothing to do with the business of the City which is why we're all here and everything to do with ignorance , bigotry , and racism. My colleagues and I along with many others who were subjected to this resident 's comments were rightly outraged . As Council President , it is my job to ensure these meetings are conducted with civility and decorum . And I will not tolerate anything less. There's a fine line between someone 's First Amendment right to free speech and common decency , something we all should have been taught at a young age. The Citizens Participation portion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 of our meetings represent democracy and action. And I would urge all speakers tonight to be respectful with their comments . As a reminder , Council Rules specifically state that no person including Members of Council shall use their time during citizens participation to personally insult or attack any individual , name calling , profanity , racial or ethnic slurs, discriminatory remarks based on race, color, religion , national origin, ancestry or place of birth, sex, gender identity , sexual orientation , disability , marital status or age or any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall not be permitted . We are here to conduct the business of the City and we look forward to listening to your comments or concerns . So with that, first on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I'm going to start with the code I think you've heard before. The only thing necessary for the triumph of the evil is for good men to do nothing . Now, I've spent most of the past 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 week thinking a lot about the comments that were made last week and about Chris Kelly's very good column that he wrote on Saturday . And if you don't want me to repeat what the speaker said I'll just say he made a reference to putting illegals in concentration camps. And I spent 23 years in the Army protecting his First Amendment right to free speech. But during that time I spent six and a half years in Germany. And I visited Dachau, which is very near Munich. And I will say it was a most disturb ing experience , one that I'll never forget. And I can't imagine any rational person wanting to recreate that madness for any reason whatsoever . I mean, it's just astounding that anyone would suggest such a thing. I have to agree with Rabbi Swartz that when hateful speech is spoken it must not go unanswered and that we must speak out immediately . Now, I couldn't do that last week because you don't get two turns at the podium. So this is my first opportunity to speak out. When that speaker comes to the podium I will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 listen closely to what he has to say. And I will respect his First Amendment rights even if his words are hateful , ignorant , and down right stupid. And at the end of the day I will give him all the respect that he and his opinions deserve , no more and no less and I would suggest that you do the same. Now moving onto tonight 's agenda Item 5-B, the DPW contract , I was surprised that in the backup the copy of the agreement says tentative agreement . Is that now written in stone? MR. DONAHUE : I believe it just says tentative because it is not -- because we have to pass it for it to be -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, well, Article 3 says modify this section in accordance with the James ruling. That doesn't sound very concrete . Take a look at Article 3. Also, since they worked on this thing for nine months, I would like to see some hard numbers . Now we know that they're going to get a 2 percent wage increase starting on September 13th through the end of the year. What does that come out numberwise ? You should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 be able to calculate it because I did. You should have that in the backup. I would like to see the numbers -- the hard numbers for the savings and/or costs of the changes in healthcare , life insurance , short term disability benefits , reduced buyouts and the City's increase in pension contributions . Those numbers should be in the backup before you get to a final reading and passing that contract . Also, somebody needs to take that tentative agreement , fold it into the actual contract so that it reads as one document and post it on your website . Now, what's the status of the other contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding that negotiations are still ongoing . MS. HODOWANITZ : And the beat goes on. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : How about the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : We still have not received the 2020. MS. HODOWANITZ : Second verse, same as the first, okay.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. SCHUSTER : I did get an update if you would like me to cover it in Fifth Order. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Please do. And that's all I have tonight . Hopefully next week I'll be in a better frame of mind. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Barb O'Malley. MS. O'MALLEY: Good evening . Last week the man stood at this podium and made vile disgusting comments about a family of immigrant s who settled in our community . He stated that he wanted to round up illegal immigrants and put them in a concentration camp. A concentration camp, a place where children last saw their grandparents as they were being led away to gas chambers , where people's bodies were ravaged by lice and open sores, where people starved to death. As Council woman Rothchild reflected how someone could have a such a callus disregard for the horrific sufferings of others. And to say such hurtful things is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 truly incomprehensible . In my opinion he is beyond redemption . But I am here because of what inaction on my part, say about me as a member of this community . I too like Council man Rothchild cannot and will not be silent in the face of such venom. I cannot ignore or brush off his comment s as the deranged rantings of a misinformed bigot. Hate speech must be denounced in no uncertain terms. Hateful speech is not reflective of my community . My community is filled with caring people like my neighbor Norma Jeffries who came to this podium last week and calmly refuted the speaker 's ugly assertions . In 2017, elementary school children and their parents started a campaign in response to rising anti-immigrant sentiment s. Their message simply and powerful is hate has no home here. I display a sign on my front yard with these words printed on in a variety of languages to declare that hateful words and actions against others will not be tolerated in my home. I came here tonight to publicly say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 to Mr. Ellman and his ilk, your hate is not welcome here. Your hate has no home here. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Karen Lemery. Sorry if I butchered -- okay. MS. LEMERY: Good evening . My name is Karen Lemery but I'm not a Karen. I love living in Scranton . I'm originally from Vineland , New Jersey where I taught English as a second language for 12 years. I grew up in a diverse community built by hardworking immigrant s and minorities . In fact, the population of my class of 1971 was about one-third white, one-third Latino and one-third people of color. In 1990 I moved to Morgantown, West Virginia . Sadly during the events of the past two years I saw growing racism, bigotry, and homophobia consume the souls of the people of that state. When I retired I wanted to move to a place that reflected my values. But I didn't want to live in a place where everyone looks like me, speaks English like me, chooses who they love and have the same customers as me.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Now, I do confess that my daughter lives in Old Forge. And that did affect my choice to live in the area of Pennsylvania . But a little over two years I chose to move to Scranton because of its diversity , spirit, strength ; and its great restaurants . But after watching the video of the City Council meeting last week I was heartsick and appalled . Now I do realize that citizens of this country have the freedom to believe what they want. But we do not have the right to blatant hate speech. We do not have the right to advocate the violence to overthrow a legitimate government, to disparage other human beings by stating they should be placed in concentration camps. And what made this worse was that it was done in this building during the City Council meeting and spewed of vitriol . And unadulterated hate was allowed to continue for five minutes . This is unacceptable . If the person speaking were a person of color, a minority , or an immigrant , we all know it would have been stopped immediately . I was also taken aback by the tone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and attitude of Mr. Donahue when he snapped at Dr. Rothchild for trying to stop the vile rant. I know condescending male behavior when I see it. He never would have spoken to a male colleague in that manner. MR. DONAHUE : I don't believe I was speaking -- I'm sorry. I don't believe -- I was not speaking towards Dr. Rothchild . You know, when you're up here you have a full view when you see people. So it's trying to tone down. I said relax to try to tone down the rhetoric overall . MS. LEMERY: Okay. And I said telling a female Council member relax, what's with that. Dr. Rothchild had the right and had the responsibility to step up and end this disgust ing behavior . We cannot let this stand. None of this is acceptable . And I hope to God it never happens again and is allowed to go on for so long. Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Bob Bolus, Scranton . Council , I've got a few things based on everything that's been going on. I've been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 coming here for many years. I'm going to put a few words out there. You tell me if they violate the Rules of Council or not: Ignorant fool. Stated name calling is not allowed by the rules of decorum . Weak-minded bully, disgust ing, disgraceful comments and spewed uneducated venom against a speaker here. Do they violate the Rules of Council ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. BOLUS: Okay. Bill Gaughan past president , on the record on March 10th, 2020 Scranton Council meeting called me an ignorant fool stated name calling is not allowed by the rules of decorum . But that wasn't name calling because it's true. Called me a weak-minded bully, said I made disgusting , disgrace ful comments and spewed uneducated venom. Those were comment s made to me by the past president of Council which I took as a great insult. I've done more for this City of Scranton in many, many ways than Bill Gaughan can ever even imagine . He's in a federal lawsuit right now. And I hope justice is served that had Bill Gaughan never serves another day as a city official in any type of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 capacity . This is not what this forum was for. I read with great interest Chris Kelly -- and him and I have gone back and forth for many, many years. But we'll sit down and have a cup of coffee together and still talk because what happens here doesn't mean a darn thing outside or anywhere else. When I read his article , the comments that were made here disturbed me. But a question I have, who removes the Council President when he makes those kinds of comment s to a speaker here? Since the Council President could remove an individual here, have him thrown out or whatever it may be, who removes the Council President or any Council member from Council ? MR. DONAHUE : According to Rules of Council , the Council President as the sole discretion to enforce the Rules of Council . MR. BOLUS: What I just read to you was a violation of the Rules of Council by the Council President . Who removes him from making those comments ? MR. DONAHUE : All I'm responsible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 for is how I conduct myself. MR. BOLUS: I understand that, Kyle. What I'm asking -- MR. DONAHUE : So I don't know what you -- MR. BOLUS: What we need to look at is a double-edge sword here. If the Council President makes these kinds of derogatory comment s to a citizen in this City and it's against the rules and violates them, who removes him from Council ? And that's something that Council has to take up now on an agenda and make that determination that if the Council President or any member of Council does what Bill Gaughan did then, they need to remove him from the seat because if it could be against us, it's also got to be against them. And I'm asking Council tonight based on everything that went on here, it's time we start putting the rules down for everybody . Now, it's basically the law is the law and it's for everyone . So is everything that goes on in here, whether it's a Council President or a speaker . Council 's got to live by sword just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 like we do. And I'm asking you guys to do it. Remember , Council and the Mayor took our voice away by putting Joe Biden's name on City streets . You didn't give us a chance to speak about it. You took our right away. Six people voted for everybody in the City. I like motion -- I put this out here before to put it on a referendum with this November election coming up unless everybody is so darn afraid that the name's going to come the hell off the street signs and we're going to go back to living in our city and it's going to be ruled by the people who live here, not a handful of people who think they could dictate to us on how we have to live whether we agree with them or not. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is the Council President read off some kind of rules that you believe you're entitled to enforce . But, you know, the Court's already ruled on what's open for discussion in this forum. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 And to be honest with you, I don't think you get to make that decision . And if you were to make a decision on controlling somebody 's speech, just let the Court decide if you are showing defiant indifference to the ruling of a court and you'll stand in front of a judge and he'll tell you what he thinks. And you know what you'll do, you'll stand there and listen. The second thing I have here, we're talking about creating another authority . It's almost ridiculous . We just sold the Sewer Authority . Pennsylvania American Water consumed it and the reserve. And how much money from that sale went into the pensions ? I think none. I think we injected borrowed money into the pension s. MR. DONAHUE : We actually we -- we borrowed -- we did borrow money; but that borrowing has already been paid off with money that was in escrow that was left over from the sewer sale. MR. MORGAN: But that's fine. But the whole idea is we never should have borrowed anything . And the other thing is, when we name 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 another authority , it shouldn 't be done. The City needs to follow the course of action that was going to take place to retain the authority . We need to build retention ponds. We need to on our own build a small facility capable of handling the flow of this water and stop creating authorities which hold Scrantonians and citizens and property owners hostage to an authority that they don't have the authority to liquidate . Once you create authorities , you don't have the power to remove them, okay? Now, I want to do another ECTV; but I'm having a tough time setting up a time to do it because I really think what the City of Scranton needs to do is unincorporate itself, okay. And in the process of unincorporat ing itself, reorganize itself under a timeline to get rid of all the authorities , all the contracts , shed the Scranton Fire and Police Department to the county and make it a regional police force and refound the City without all the shenanigans that politics has created .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 And it's legal. You could unincorporate this City and give most of its obligation s and authority to the county. And by the same token rewrite in that ballot question whether you want to reorganize the City or not because to be honest with you, my question is where are the kooks and the crazies at because I think they're on the Council and I think they're in the Mayor's office and I think they're at the County Commissioners ' office because you reign over us like we're your subject s. And you don't want to hear anything we have to say on any issue. And that's why there is no legitimate small business incubator . That's why people can't afford to pay their property taxes. That's why senior citizens sold their properties and moved to high rises. That's why there's just unbelievable amounts of poverty in this City. That's why there're kids going to school and you can't understand how they could be forced into poverty . The government's doing it. You've shed all the employment opportunities out of the country . And this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 president in my opinion , he's the problem we have in this country and the vice president . They have looters, robbers, and everything else during the 2020 elections burning and looting everything and then they were bailing them out of jail. Now you got women getting raped in some of these democratic cities. And you know when you start talking about rape, let's talk about the 37 to 40 percent of illegal people coming across our border that are female that are being raped or the people that are getting paid to ferry them across our border put up panty trees to brag about all the women they raped. This is the president we have office. So when we get indignant about what one man says at this podium, we need to take a look at and hear what our elected leaders are saying, especially the ones in office. And understand one thing, this country is in decline not because of the ordinary person but because of the government they elected . What government sheds all of its manufacturing and technology jobs all around 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the world for the lowest possible wage and starts unionizing warehouse workers because that's all that's left. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is and forgive me if I'm butchering this name. But it's Ushu Mukelo. MR. MUKELO: Council Members , ladies, and gentlemen , I'm here today to tell a story of who we are, a story about refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo who came to this country happy and proud to be part of the greater Scranton community . Last week, a Scranton resident that I have found appropriate to characterize as a misinformed and hateful grandpa came here to tell Scrantonians how he read a story about one of our families and took to the podium to trash the entire Congolese Community of Scranton , a group as he referred to us that boasts of 55 families in the city that have emerged thanks to U.S refugee resettlement . Council Members , ladies and gentlemen , there are several falsehoods that the misinformed and hateful grandpa made about us, and it is important to clarify this. As a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 proud African , this situation reminds me of an African saying, “If you want to kill a Monkey, don't look at its eyes, you might think it's a human being." The misinformed and hateful grandpa without a doubt does not represent Scranton values, American values. He certainly does not understand our stories as refugees , nor does he understand how we got here in the first place. I don't want this African saying to be taken out of context . What I am saying is that the behavior and sentiments reflected in the crazy -- sorry, in the misinformed and hateful grandpa 's last Tuesday speech in this room should cause a chilling effect in every resident of this historic city. It is not just up to us to stand up to the ridiculous lines of lies and hateful speech. Every Scrantonian should. And this is exactly what this saying is all about. All of us, all Scrantonians should call the misinformed and hateful grandpa for who he is, not informed and driven by hate and maybe a racist. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Council Members , ladies and gentlemen , the Congolese Community of Scranton comprises of 55 refugee families from the Democratic Republic of Congo who have been resettled from various refugee camps to the City of Scranton . Others were resettled to other cities such as Philadelphia , Baltimore , and Chicago and have decided to move here because of how conducive this city is to Congolese refugees in particular . Relatively small and convenient in a lot of ways, we've lived in refugee camps and urban centers in various African countries not because we chose it but because of the political crisis plaguing our country up to today. We came here through a legal process that includes rigorous scrutiny of our lives to determine if we fit the refugee definition as stipulated in the 1951 UN Refugee Convention ; multiple interviews , medical checkups , U.S Cultural Orientation to endure months of waiting to obtain a visa that allows us to come in. To give a clear picture of what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 refugee resettlement involves , I have this statement pulled from Senator Bob Casey's website : “Refugee applicants are subject to the highest level of security checks for any category of travelers to the U.S. The process , which involves 18-24 months of review, including screening by the National Counterterrorism Center, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center and the Departments of Homeland Security , Defense and State. This robust process includes biographic and biometric analysis .” Council Members , ladies and gentlemen , I hope the misinformed and hateful grandpa finds mercy to understand that we are safe and don't pose a threat to our city and now our new country that has given us a second chance, USA. I hope he finds God's mercy to see us as useful people who came to this country with good intentions . I hope the holy spirit of the most high transforms him from having hate in his heart to someone that sees us as a positive people that are doing all we can to positively contribute to the well being of this city, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 county, the state and the union. Council Members , ladies and gentlemen , in the last seven years or so, our families have been working and paying taxes, have opened businesses in the city. Our parents have seen our children graduate from high schools and colleges . Our families have sent their children to serve in the military . Our sisters are serving in the health and home care services . Our families have bought properties in the city, and they are learning English . Both the old and the young members of the community are again going through a complex and expensive process of becoming U.S citizens and many are citizens . As I speak in front of you, I am a naturalized U.S citizen who also holds a degree in Political Science thanks to the University of Scranton for a generous four-year scholarship . This is what Americans do. They are ingenious . They adapt. And they certainly stand up to bullies . We are not here to milk the system. We are not un-American . We are not lazy. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Often what happens is that when we arrive here, the transition is not a simple thing. Anyone that has traveled to a new country where he or she does not speak the native language can relate. It's not easy. Our family whose story was published in the newspaper should not be politicized or be made fun of. They are new to the city and they may be struggling a little bit just like many of us did when we got here. It should not mean they are lazy or useless or unskilled . No human being is useless . I have a message for the Scranton residents . In Africa we have another good saying: “If you don't want Monkey tails to touch you, don't attend a monkey dance”. For over seven years now, I have not heard this level of hate projected towards me or the community . And I am convinced this is not who we are as Scrantonians . We are better than this. Dear Scranton residents , please say something when you hear someone say such hateful things about people whose stories they don't know. This is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 not healthy for the city. We have known the City of Scranton as a hospitable city. And I suggest we keep it just as that. Hate can spread like a pandemic and it's up to all of us to uproot it out of the city. On behalf of all the families and the community of Scranton , thank you and sorry for have taken more time than allocated . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you for that. And I want to assure you that you are welcome here and do not take the actions or words of a couple of our bad apples to think that's what we're all like. I believe the vast majority of this community is loving and welcoming to immigrant s from all across the world. But thank you for offering your perspective . Next on the list is Julie Schumacher Cohen. MS. COHEN: Good evening . My name is Julie Schumacher Cohen. I'm a resident of the City of Scranton and I also work at the University of Scranton . Like others who have come here tonight , I'm deeply troubled by comments that disparaged immigrant s. Those made at last week's Council meeting also disparaged as we heard Congolese refugees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 specifically . It went so far as to invoke concentration camps, which we know were sites of genocide where millions of Jews perished . And today is Yom Kippur. As Councilwoman Rothchild stated, this kind of rhetoric scares immigrants from wanting to be in our community rather than welcoming them. But I'm not here to talk any more about that commentary but rather the people and the topics that it raised, specifically the Congolese community whom I've gotten to know over the past few years. We just had a chance to hear a Ushu Mukelo, a University of Scranton graduate , a hard working father, a husband , a Congolese community leader and a dear friend of my family. I gotten to know Ushu over several years meeting him when he first came to Scranton hearing his storey and that of many others in our community , Bhutanese , Syrian, Afghans and other refugees who have found a new home in Scranton . Just as immigrants who came to Scranton over 100 years ago also sought a better life here to escape poverty , famine and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 other hardships . Ushu is an example of resilience , courage , and strength . He like many in his community overcame the horrors of civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, life in refugee camps and the long journey to Scranton . He also helps those who are struggling in his community . In fact, many Congolese employ mutual aid providing care for one another . It should come as no surprise to anyone that being resettled in a new country after having lost everything adjusting to a new culture and language , living with trauma, that all of this would make the initial transition difficult as we heard in the Times-Tribune story that was cited last week. In the work that I've done in my role at the University and together with many communities , resettlement agencies , thankfully I see many Scrantonians open doors and open their hearts ready to give the assistance to anyone in the situation of a refugee would hope for. Simple really, do unto others what you would have done unto you. But ultimately 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Congolese like any refugees and immigrants are working to empower themselves to build their own community up and they are very much in the process of doing that as we heard from Ushu. We should support them and we should welcome them. I'm grateful for the many Congolese I've gotten to know and I would encourage others in Scranton to get to know their refugee neighbors if you have not already . As we know at Scranton High School over 40 languages are spoken. In closing , I want to let Scrantonians know about opportunities for learning and community building that are coming this following winter as part of a project that I lead called Scranton Story Our Nation's Story with many community partners . It speaks to share the different stories , histories , and experiences of this city and this country reflecting on the work that we still have to do to form a more perfect union in the run-up to the 250th anniversary of the United States. On October 25th, we'll have an event 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that will focus on immigration called To All the Places We Come From, stories , food, and community at the Scranton Cultural Center. This will include a chance for Scrantonians to share stories about migration and to build empathy , something that we very much need in our community and in our world. On November 17th, we will host a (inaudible ) American leader (inaudible ) tribe whose ancestral homeland includes Northeastern , Pa for a key note lecture . As we heard from Councilman Donahue last week, most Americans have some immigrant story, but not everyone . That includes Indigenous nations who were here before it was the United States. It's also true for African Americans whose ancestors were brought here forcible during the slave trade. And we will also have events in the winter of 2023 highlighting the black history and the experience of Scranton and the Black Scranton Project . The public can find out about these free events that are funded by the National endowment for the humanities at Scranton dot edu forward slash Scranton Story. I appreciate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 your time and attention this evening . And I believe firmly that our country , our democracy , our city is strengthened by our diversity . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Julie, and thank you for the work you do. Next on list, Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Hi. Well, I was here last week when the hateful speech took part and I was ashamed of myself that I didn't get up right then and say something like Jessica said or Dr. Rothchild said. I was so aggravate d and angry I was really afraid to come up and talk because of the words I would have said would have been flying around. So, first of all, tonight what I want to do is I want to welcome these people. I want to welcome them to the United States of America and I also want to welcome them to the City of Scranton . Now when the hateful speech brought in the Holocaust it hit close to home. I myself should be at synagogue tonight because of our highest holy day when we ask for atonement . But I felt I had to come and speak 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 instead because we've always said never again. That was our cry never again when you see this. And these things can happen again. Look what's happening in Russian and Ukraine and look how welcoming the Polish people were to all of those people crossing the border carrying their animals and their children with them. We have to welcome them. This it hits close to home to me because my granddaughter whose father-in-law's entire family perished in the Holocaust except for his mother and father. My best friend growing up, Lucile Crone{phonetic }, Monroe Avenue, her father was in the concentration camps. His whole family was -- his whole family was slaughtered except for this brother . Leon, the tailor, I don't know if any of the old timers would remember the Leon Padalowski 's{phonetic } tailor shop on Spruce Street. He was in the concentration camp. He was my neighbor on the 400 of Colfax. And I used to have to walk my dog right by his house and he'd say to me, Doris, I know your German Shepard is friendly , but when you come by my house with it, it takes me back.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 So how anyone could have (inaudible ) doing anything like that to anybody else no matter who they are, I don't want to say anything that I'm not going to say or get in trouble with. But this is how I feel. And I think that this is how everybody I know that I'm friends with and they're Jewish, they're Catholic , they're Protestant , they're Muslim, whoever I know do not feel this way. So we just want these families to know we don't feel this way. This is a select few. And that same select few, they felt the same way about my parents and myself and the Italian people when they came over and the Irish people when they came over. But we're now in 2022 and we should know better. We shouldn 't be frightened of the unknown . And when they open their great Congolese restaurant , I bet everyone will be there to try their food. There would be no pizza without the Italian immigrants . There wouldn't no soul food without certain immigrants . There wouldn't be any Abe's Delicatessen without immigrants . And there'd be no Chinese dinners without 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 immigrants , etc. There's more, Vietnamese , everybody , Irish. But we wouldn't have an Irish pub to go to. Now, so I don't get in trouble for talking about Scranton , on Olive Street and Colfax Avenue there is one side that wasn't cut down for the handicapped . And being handicapped I know this because I have to go around a little bit. All the sidewalks up there were cut down and somehow they just missed that one. Now I shouldn 't be in trouble for not talking about the City. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Doris. Doris, that was a handicap sign -- that was a handicap sign that wasn't -- on the curb, yes. Okay. We'll look into that. Thank you. Next on list is Glynis Johns. MS. JOHNS: Well, good evening , Council and City residents . I just felt very moved today to bring support and solidarity for everything that we have heard today. It's gross and disgusting that we still have to create testimony , stand here and talk about your immigrant story when there are so many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 people that don't necessarily have to. And I might sound funny saying this as I constantly advocate and create world histories and document our history but no one else has to come to this podium and stand for their residency in the City of Scranton . When Ushu was speaking , I was reminded of a resident here in the early 1900s who became the first African American to -- the first black person to be a naturalized citizen through the City of Scranton 's naturalization courts. Obviously the story is not too similar . But this gentleman and his family have to fight for the right to live in the Hill Section . He bought a property on Prescott Avenue. And all of the resident s on Prescott Avenue did not want to have a black person living next to them because it would change their property value. They would be dangerous and all of those things. And so what has happened has reminded me of that and that there is still so much work to do. But simultaneously I'm so proud of the people who came here to speak up for our friends, our neighbor s, our resident s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 and the people who need to be most protect ed. I didn't prepare anything today. I just wanted to come up here and show solidarity to my brothers and sisters that are here or anybody who feels marginal ized or left out in the City of Scranton because that's not fair. And that's the basis of the nonprofit that I created . Some of you know I started coming to the City Council meetings in 2016 and talking about these very topics and creating space and having people come up here and say disgusting things to people that do not look like them who feel that the city was for them, was built for them when in actuality a lot of us have been here before your ancestor s have came here. And that's not to play tit for tat or say who has, you know, the longest ancestry. It just shows that we all come here for a certain reason. And we all love the city for various reasons and a lot of commonalities . So with that, I want to just remind everybody that we are a community and I just want to continue to create space for folks and remind people of stories that are relevant .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 And I want to thank Julie Schumacher Cohen who is working with us in the University of Scranton to share our Scranton story. And so this weekend we're also inviting people to the Center for Arts and Culture to share their Scranton story to say what Black Scranton means to them. And we can start telling the story of our city the way that we see fit. So thank you. I don't need five minutes . That's all I wanted to say. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Glynis. And thank you for the work you do. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Well, big bad Ron is finally up here. First off, I apologize for any I offended by my inadvertent usage of concentration camp last week. I meant to use internment camps. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Ellman, that's not any better. MR. ELLMAN: How can I express what I -- MR. DONAHUE : I know. But that's -- MR. ELLMAN: All right, nothing more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 controversial . MR. DONAHUE : I'm just saying that's -- yes, thank you. MR. ELLMAN: I don't know how to say something without saying a word, you know. Anything else I said I stand behind. You people wouldn't be up there if it wasn't for taxes. Taxes for putting our kids in school, I complained about six children at $15,000 a piece and I'm the bad guy. Taxes for people to walk on the sidewalk , the streetlights . That's not important to you people. And Kelly's article in the paper attacking me, that's the pot calling the kettle black. This man has spent outrageous hours and hours writing the most hatred things about the then President , Mr. Trump, the Republican party and close to half the people in the country . And then in his extreme leftist paper, twice a week he's allowed to do this. I have five minutes up here, you know, and you can't wait to tell me to shut up and sit down. I'm an honorably discharge d veteran , eight years in the international guard and the reserves. What's Kelly? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Ellman, please don't make any personal attacks . You could make your point without making any attacks . MR. ELLMAN: Okay. I got about 300 signatures last year when I felt like I might run for a seat up there. And I know I talked to another hundred people. You people know how hard that is. It's a job. How many people you think Kelly has talked to his whole career in this city, maybe 25, 50. I first attended a meeting in the 80s in this very room with Jimmy Klee, all the meetings I've been to year after year I've never him seen attend one. He doesn't know what goes on in here except secondhand . To me, his article -- he's just a phoney hypocrite that gets by with half truths and misleading information. His very article against me leaves out facts so he could get his opinion over on everybody , I suppose . But on the other hand, real quick we had a 20-year-old cat was sick. I stayed up with it until 4:00 this morning . And at 2:00 I had to take it to the vet to put it down. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Mr. Kelly wrote a beautiful article last year that was very impressive to me about his occasion when he had to put an animal to sleep. I guess there is not all bad in both of us. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , you know, excuse the mask. But every time I walk into a doctor's office I get something shovelled on me. Something else was discovered last summer. You know, it's just unGodly. I picked Scranton myself because I lived in a lot of different towns around and a small farm town and things up in Susquehanna County. It's amazing what people can find to fight about. You got a homogeneous society and everybody looks the same or pretty much the same. And they come home. One guy has 490 acres and his next door neighbor has 495 and because the driveway is mislocated a little bit, there's a -- one of those Jersey blocks right across the front of his driveway . It's just amazing how people can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 invent things that they really shouldn 't even be concerned about. The only time I'm concerned about taxes is that we keeping getting buildings -- public buildings and tax exempt buildings increasing and increasing and increasing . And there are all a lot of older people that are having a hard time here and young people I'm sure because I didn't have a -- I didn't have nirvana . My father didn't leave 450 million dollars to me. And on immigrants and refugees , a lot of the reason that they are here is because some of our politicians have supported people like Putin. And one of the people that are being negotiated for a trade for Brittany Griner and another person with probably trumped up charges ; it's probably a bunch of BS. She might be just saying she had those cartridges because she was told don't bother saying you were setup or whatever . And maybe she did have them. But anyway, they've been running around Viktor Bout has a C-1 30 style transport loaded up with machine guns and rockets and grenade s and everything . And he runs around peddling them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 I have heard of AK 47s in emergent countries being sold for 5 bucks. They might not shoot very well. They might not be very accurate , but they are damn effective in a little village when you want to get your point across. And it's all over. It's in Asia. It's in Africa, South America . It's just a shame. And we have to really, really clamp down. Today I read an article where they are selling the Ukrainian grain to Turkey, one of our alleged NATO partner s. And the ships that ship the grain couldn't have left the ports that they proclaim because the draft was twice as -- half the draft -- the ship would have ran aground. And, you know, I'd like to apologize . The reason that I never -- try not to say anything like that. I hope I'm not around when I'm silly and old enough to think that way. But I moved to Scranton because I saw a lot of diversity . And I had a pretty good time. And then we got a mayor that just took it all away. When we had Mayor Connors we had the music festival up the park. I saw a lot of old acquaintances and made some new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 ones. And I thought this was pretty nice. And I found a very reasonable house to buy and I bought it. And I've been here since. And I'll probably be carried out some night. Hopefully not next week. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I'd like to touch base on the brief comment that was brought up slightly tonight . The word internment camp creeped into this room. Beforehand I've talked about how we don't recognize and have not taught as much about internment camps that happened in the United States, how devastating , how horrible and how wrong they were to strip people of their Constitutional rights and their rights of human dignity and property . They were completely illegal . And they were taken against citizens out of fear. And it was not just the Japanese population . It was more common in California who were prisoner s in the internment camp. We actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 had two German internment camps in the United States. We also had one Italian internment camp in the United States. A lot of this just is not taught. And a lot of people don't go into how much was lost by all of the people that were stripped of their property , their homes, their family and their dignity . And that's a large issue. Before coming here I watched multiple air strikes in (inaudible ) as I've been monitoring and working with people for the past seven months over in Ukraine . As we're talking now, people are under fire from combat. That is a reality we've seen. Hatred is out there. Aggression is out there. And it must be addressed . I thank the people here for standing up for that and giving that a voice that it's not acceptable . Now, onto City business we had mentioned the flag -- the Mayor had mentioned bringing back redoing the flag again. Maybe it could be the city of Texas or the city that Biden left or the city of one thousand patches in honor of our roadways . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I think the flag is something that does not need to be anywhere near our agenda at this point our of economic struggles . Looking to the parking contract on the list tonight , it looks like we're going to try to extend it to to 2067 and introduce a 3 percent per year increase . How nice. I mean, a 45 year -- an extension for 45 years from the date of signing . That's no more than selling the parking spaces -- MR. DONAHUE : I do want to point out it's not a 45-year extension . The original deal I believe was -- MR. COYNE: It's a continuation . MR. DONAHUE : So it's basically a 6-year extension . I'm just -- go ahead. MR. COYNE: Understood but it's still selling more time to them and also giving them money for repairs for businesses that they are going to sell as part of a retail front is in there through the Recovery Act which is suppose d to be for the people of this city, not for outside business investment companies . Last, touching on it is the DPW contract . So we have a 9 percent increase , 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 percent , then 3.5, then 3.5. In Section 5 sufficient for discharge , it's surprising it's not introduced in Section 3. It states willful abuse of City-owned or leased property . Should it not be amended to unauthorized or willful abuse of City-owned property like if someone dare to remove for use for personal gain, for example , a pressure washer for an extended period of time, not that that would ever happen. Contract data, again we're setting the contract to December 31st. Why don't we set it six months later to June 31st so that bodies actually have a time to come together and negotiate this before budget? Performance bonus is in there unlimited in scope so the Director could get a performance bonus. That's really convenient . The City's pension plan, why isn't there -- why aren't we switching to a 401k rather than continuing the pension plan that is burying us? There's more including the carry overtime . But I'm out of time and I'll save that for next week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 And just to bring up in terms of the NDC agreement that's on our list, NDC will be in for a public caucus next week to answer any of Council 's question s and for them to present what's on our agenda this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. Marie Schumacher , I have a bunch of questions tonight . But first I would like to thank you if I'm assuming you guys were responsible for getting that sign down on Moosic Street that was blocking the vision of us small people. Moving on now 7-D -- yeah, 7-D. I hope you do not pass that if there is not an amendment going to be made tonight that specifies when that is done. MR. DONAHUE : We did get a response . And that will appear in our Third Order next week that the contract is a 12-month duration . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh -- MR. DONAHUE : Is that what you're referring to the questions we asked last week? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. MR. DONAHUE : We did get a response . It came yesterday after -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MS. SCHUMACHER : Did you read it though? It says in there they'll do their best is I think the way I was -- to make it a 12. That's why I brought up -- because I've seen them bump this down, bump this down. HRG is pretty good at that. Look at how just stormwater of itself is. Remember too, you said by the end of the year, remember ? MR. DONAHUE : I was pretty close. For municipal government time, you can't say I wasn't close. But like I said too, throughout my time here I thought that we would never even get to this point but we have. So we are making progress there. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now the Times-Tribune had an editorial on the esthetics of this City. And it was really in writing in terms of making sure that the Center City or Center Street goes ahead. I'd like to put my two cents in and say that for that quarter of a block, that goes down to the bottom of the priority list. When you look at that -- half to look going up to Lackawanna Avenue from when I did go down and look, it's named Stations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Center up to the Radison . That is terrible . We have money. We have money to give. We have our -- some of the American Rescue Plan. We're giving it to other people. Why can't we put it into that project ? The county has money. We have money. Why don't we just get that done? That is disgust ing. And I think we deserve -- everybody in the -- deserves to know is the rental income taxed under the new taxing? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding that's the position the City is taking. We're still, you know, expecting to have Berkheimer in for a discussion on that October 25th. MS. SCHUMACHER : But it's already been -- I mean, well, that should have been publicize d then if that is part of it. But I -- MR. DONAHUE : I believe it's the City's position that it is in the ordinance that -- and that's the way it should be enforced . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then Cedar Avenue, does anybody know why it was milled and when they're ever going to come back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 to pave it? MR. DONAHUE : So I do know -- that's under PennDOT 's control . I do know that the contractor had a delay -- an unexpected delay in getting some of the concrete , not necessarily the asphalt but concrete to put underneath as a base. There was an unexpected delay there. And it's also my understanding that it should be paved within the next week and a half, two weeks. MS. SCHUMACHER : Excellent . Is the LERTA Program ended now? MR. DONAHUE : No, the LERTA Program extends for 10 years. MS. SCHUMACHER : Ten years. No, I mean, that's the people who signed up. So it's really a 20-year program then. Somebody could do it on the last day. MR. DONAHUE : Essentially it could be, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes, okay. Got that. Now 5-E, why are we doing that when just a couple months ago I believe it was you were giving our OECD Director a nice bump-up in salary in a title that include s doing the work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 for that? And she said she had time. Now, why are we then going to put this out? Oops, I'm sorry. MR. DONAHUE : This isn't managing the program . It's collecting meaningful data on the performance of the program . That's my understanding of it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I would think that would be part of the Director 's job. But I'm out of time. I'll be back next week good Lord willing . MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: The only comment I have is unfortunately I was not able to make the meeting last week. I had a work commitment and I couldn't be here. But I'm just proud to say that I'm a proud Scranton ian, number seven of eight children born and raised here, attended all Scranton schools . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 I actually ran Scranton schools and have been proud to celebrate the diversity in our city and welcome people from all over the world to our great city. And I love the fact that we've become even more and more diverse over the last 20 to 25 years. And I think it makes our city a greater place. If I had to miss a meeting , I'm kind of glad I wasn't here to hear that. I did watch it on YouTube and was saddened to hear that type of speech. But I'm just hear to say that I'm proud to be a member of this city and of this community and celebrate all the great aspects of our city including our diversity . So that's all I have to say. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I did get an update on the audit. So what was given to me from the auditor was that last week they received the trial balances for the general fund and special city's fund of the city. However , they noted that the general fund trial balance does not balance to zero. There's a difference in debits and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 credits of $3,370,887.14. And they noted that the equity does not properly roll forward in the general fund from 2020. There's a couple other items that they're looking to get. Some of them are with Rainey. They also need the schedule of expenditures of federal awards and several others. The loan fund that went through OECD, HUD program should be broken out in more detail like they breakouts in prior years. Whether there was any expenditures through the coronavirus relief fund in 2020, any expenditure s in ARPA for 2021. And they're also still waiting on the Sewer Authority audit, Scranton Redevelopment Authority audit and additional items and testing that go along with the audit. So that is the latest update I got there with that. That is all, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do have the comment . I just want to thank the community members who came out here tonight to stand up against hate and bigotry and what we had heard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 last week. I also wanted to thank especially the Ushu -- the members from the Congolese community who came here tonight to share more about the Congolese as well as their struggle s to come here as refugee s. I would love to learn more about your culture and your experiences here. I'm here as a Council member to stand up for everyone in Scranton . We represent the City entirely . We don't have certain sections of the city or certain people. We're here for everyone . And to the immigrants and to the refugee s that are here in our City, I just want you to know that you are welcome and you belong. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I would like to revisit a couple issues that were brought to my attention and then forwarded to your attention . This one -- same resident . This was brought up almost a year ago requesting an update or followup with parking issues of South Irving 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 and Alder Street and then also South Irving and Willow Street. Many people are parking too close to the corners , obstructing views of oncoming traffic which presents an accident scenario . So I know this was looked at. I'm not sure where we're at with this. Please ask for an update with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So then also, a few concerned resident s have reached out to me about blight and quality of life issues with a property of 723 North Main Avenue. Also, the backyard is in the 700 block of Hyde Park. I guess code enforce ment has been called by neighbor s with no callbacks or visible visits to this property . So can you please contact them and make them aware? And I'm still receiving -- complaints -- complaint s about the pool issue. So the Weston Field swimming remains a concern with residents and members . A few more members have reached out to me. Almost everywhere I go -- over the weekend at least someone has reached out to me about the concerns that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 brought forward over the past couple weeks. One was actually from a former volunteer and also a member. So as a paying member of Weston Field and a daily user of the pool as well as a volunteer conduct or who uses the aquacise classes, the hours of operation s went from five and a half days, then and three, and then hours of five evening s a week. So now it's down to, you know, a couple days a week like we said over the past couple weeks. And they received a quick notification that it's closed for the first two weeks of October . So these concerns along with others in summary -- that's why I spoke to, you know, at least three more this week, two of them being the same that they understand the lack of finding lifeguard s or maintaining lifeguard s. They get that. But it's only been a problem up until this year. What they do want is they don't understand why the administration is not making this a priority and not trying acquire them. So their suggestions -- they still have great suggestion s as to reaching out to the area colleges to student s that have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 lifeguard s or certified that could work in between classes . They just want a set schedule . They want to re-up their memberships . They don't want to take, you know, public transportation or some of them live out of town, drive from North Pocono, come down here and then there's a note at the door that they're close. They're having a great issue with this. So with that said, they said, you know, please can they take our ideas and at least, you know, help us understand or help us be part of the solution instead of not knowing . Another one being maybe conduct a class itself at Weston Field to certify lifeguards , promote it, advertise it. So with that said, can you please send these bullets again and just ask if they, you know, they could be part of the process or actually sit down with these residents slash members that are very concerned about this social and therapeutic , you know, exercise that they've been doing for years and now they don't have anything concrete or there's no answer to the solution . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 So if you could please forward that to the administration . I think they would like to sit down, help, you know, solve the problem and move on from there. And what else do I have? That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Like I mentioned at the beginning before citizens participation tonight , the citizens participation portion of our meeting I do truly believe represents democracy in action. A lot of times, you know, that's a place where citizens can express their frustrations , their concerns . Unfortunately , sometimes you get off-colored comment s. And often times, you know, when you are sitting up here you leave here and you'll leave, you know, you might be frustrated , you might be discouraged just for a short period. Tonight is not one of those nights. Tonight 's one of those nights where I could say I'm proud to be a Scranton ian because of the love and support that the community did show to say that these words, you know, don't belong here. So and it was done for the most part in a completely respectful way. And I appreciate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 that from everybody . It really is an honor to represent the citizens of the City and things that, you know, we'll continue to do the work to benefit everybody , not just people that voted for us, not the people that, you know, supported us but for everybody . It's an all inclusive thing. And I'm happy to be sitting up here with my four colleagues because I believe they all believe in this City and that's why they're here. But it is refreshing to, you know, leave here tonight and not be completely discouraged or frustrate d but instead to be proud to represent the City. So I want to thank everybody for expressing your opinions tonight in a respectful manner and I am proud to represent all of you. And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , like I mentioned before, NDC will be in for a public caucus next week to discuss this proposal , the reasoning behind it, etc. And that caucus will be at 5:45. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , if we could just have Solicitor Gallagher take a look at this and go over it to see if anything stands out to you. ATTY. GALLAGHER : The only thing that I noticed and I spoke with Councilman Donahue , the previous original agreement and First Amendment are cited in this third amendment . And so it would be appropriate if they were also included in the -- attached to this third amendment so we know. It specifically cites certain sections so we know what we're talking about when we pass it. MR. DONAHUE : And I did ask Mr. Voldenberg before the meeting to request the original concession agreement so that we could compare and have something to reference , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 you know, the references in the backup too.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE CITY COUNCIL OF SCRANTON AND MAYOR TO SEND A LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR PASSAGE OF THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 the question , I want to provide some background and insight into this piece of legislation tonight . Back in 2015, that is when the Supreme Court decision was made which allowed for same section marriage rights throughout the country . And since the overturning of Roe v. Wade and some of the opinion s that have come out, it's very possible and real that that decision could be tried to be overturned as well. And this is obviously very personal for me as I'm married to a woman. We actually gotten married in 2015 the same year that the Supreme Court decision was made. And we've been fearful ourselves of what the future could hold for LGBTQ Americans . And so what the Senate is trying to do is to pass legislation that would codify same sex marriage into law. It would repeal the was Defense of Marriage Act. It would enshrine marriage equality for federal law purpose s and it would also provide additional legal protections from individuals seeking to undermine marriage equality while acting under state law including for out-of-state marriages .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 And so this would be -- this a joint letter with the Mayor. I'd ask for support from my fellow Council members in sending this letter in support of this legislation . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE INSTITUTE TO PERFORM SCRANTON AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN PROGRAMMATIC EVALUATION SERVICES .

On the question , Attorney Gallagher , I know that if we were able to have our regular caucus tonight you would have brought up some issues. So can you just briefly explain those, if you would? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, Councilman Schuster I believe at the beginning of the year repeatedly requested additional backup for those who not only won the bid but the other bidders of the -- on these RFPs and RFQs. So I think they would also be appropriate if they were also included and sent down to us. And unless I just didn't see it, I don't believe that the insurance certificates were attached with the submissions . So as long as they have that, then we should be okay. But I think that needs to be included as well. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thanks. Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to pass Attorney Gallagher 's -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll secure both. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 MR. KING: Aye. MR.

SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote on Item 7-E. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , there is a couple things that I brought up with the capital budget that I'm really not in favor with, the 1.8 million dollar purchasing of another building for City Hall, also a fleet of electric vehicle s. With them still being in that capital budget, I will be voting no tonight for that. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I'll be honest with you. I like the majority of all the items on the capital budget that was presented , especially the public safety pieces. They were are all need to have, not nice to have. But I was strongly against -- and I brought it up even while this was tabled that I'm not in favor of buy a building rumored to be next door for 1.8 million dollars . I see no need for that. And I'm on the fence about the electric cars, a fleet of them. I posed the question s that they require special training to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 work on them, you know, I'm all for clean energy. But it seems like, you know, we're the guinea pig for that process that, you know. We hear a lot of horror stories about how to store them, where to store them, in garages they're blowing up. Batteries cost as much as a new transmission in another car. So I'm not against clean energy. But I just don't think we should be the guinea pigs for this. So for them reasons , I'm voting no for the capital budget. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? On the question ? You know, I don't think I agree with absolutely everything in here either. But it's more of a long-term plan than anything set in stone. I think, you know, the vast majority of these initiatives would require either another vote, whether it's on the budget or, you know, any sort of agreements , contracts that would be required here. So for that reason I will vote yes on this piece tonight . Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS.
