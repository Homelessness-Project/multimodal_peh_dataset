Norma Jefferies spoke on matters of general concern . Lenny Srebro spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. Motions. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, just one brief -- brief comment . This is 5-C in regards to -- it's just from the Amos Towers. They've just been a great partner with the City of Scranton . They made another donation to our fire department . I want to read a letter they address ed to Chief Lucas on June 11th: "Dear Chief Lucas, on behalf of Amos Towers located on Jefferson Avenue, we would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 like to thank you for all the hard work that the Scranton Fire Department does on a daily basis. Each year we reach out to see what the department is in need of. This year we would like to make a donation of $2,500." So Amos Towers, every year they make a very generous donation to our fire department . They seek out some of the things that we need that maybe we couldn't get through a grant or other funding measures . And our fire department always comes up with something that would really would help the city. This year we're going to use that donation to purchase a 35 mm Nikon camera and three sets of cordless tools to be used for fire investigations . So again, this is -- this letter was sent by the Vice President of Community Development , Martin Fotta. So I want to make sure I give all the thanks and praise to Amos Towers and Mr. Fotta for the generous donation . They always reach out to us every year and this year is no different . And I know our fire department will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 put this equipment to good use to keep safe and do proper investigations in the future. That's all I have for you right now. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Evans, any motions or comment s? MR. EVANS: Yeah, first of all, I want to comment a little bit on what Mr. Srebro mentioned about your increasement in assessment of taxes. It's my understanding you built a brand new house that should have been eligible under the previous three year tax abatement that the city had in place. So you might want to check into that. And if that's the case, you could save yourself some money for the next three years. Maybe we can get -- if you want to stop by the council office, maybe we can get a copy of that legislation for you so you can review it and see if that is appropriate for you. Recently , I have been discussing for a need for a coherent -- not recently , for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 long time -- the need for a coherent policy on condemnation s and demolition of buildings almost since I have been on Council . I've asked for this information from the administration for longer than I could recall. In fact, recently, I requested that the LIPS Department provide me with a complete list of properties that are currently eligible to be on the demolition list as well as the policies and procedures that are currently in place to determine what property should actually be demolished . To that point, I've been waiting for weeks and weeks for an answer to my latest request , maybe longer. And it's clearly longer than any elected official or citizen should have to wait for information . So last Friday I had no recourse but to send a right to know request to the city's Right To Know Officer for this information . The fact that I even had to do this points to a much larger and more serious problem . So that's all I'm going to say about that subject right now. I also want to comment briefly on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the editorial in today's Scranton Times entitled Apartments Hide Behind An Old Assessment . I appreciate the editorial board confirming what I've been saying for, what, it's probably been decades . Not only will reassessment bring about tax fairness and tax equity to property owners throughout Lackawanna County, but the City of Scranton it will bring information and data that we can use to finally address our seemingly endless ability to accurately establish how many apartment units are actually in the City of Scranton . For 25 years we have been chasing our tail with the rental registration effort that is still operating with dated and sometimes extremely inaccurate information . With new and more accurate information created through the data collection process of a reassessment and combining that with possibly renewed commitment by city officials to give the city employees in charge of that the resource they need to get the job done, we might actually get it right after 25 years. And then we can begin to register 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 rentals at a much higher level, which not only gives us valuable analytic s to use in planning and allotting for the limited resources of the LIPS Department ; but it will also ultimately allow us for a reduced reduction in rental registration fees and refuse fees across the board. Parks was a subject tonight . So I want to bring that into the conversation . With the recent announcement by the Recreation Authority and Geisinger on an agreement that will infuse approximately 1.3 million dollars into Nay Aug Park over the next ten years as well as a reopening of the downtown Renaissance Park in the rear of the 500 block of Lackawanna and the Pocket Park plan by Scranton Tomorrow at the corner of Linden Street and Wyoming Avenue, parks are being talked about quite a bit lately. So I'd like to expand that conversation just a little bit to put it in context . A recent Penn State researcher study conclude d that 83 percent of responder s to that study said that they personally benefit from their local parks. And 92 percent said that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 their community as a whole benefits from local parks. The research has also found that trails and parks and open spaces can increase nearby property values. In a separate study in Chicago , they focused on a 2.7 mile trail that was added to the Chicago Logan Square neighborhood . That's an area where the real estate market really isn't that strong or wasn't strong before the trail was put in. But after the trail was implemented , they saw 22.3 percent increase in market value for properties that are within a few blocks of the trail itself. These type of results tell me that we need to refocus and continue to build on the current assets that we have because parks are assets. We need to develop new ones when it makes sense. But most of all, we need to find ways to get more value from our park system. This can be done partial ly by creating connectivity . Parks need to be connected to neighborhood s. Trails should be connected to the downtown and other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 neighborhood s. And bike paths and lanes should connect to all of our city assets. It's a simple solution to getting more value from an existing system. So we continue to see some positive elements like what is happening at Nay Aug. The neighborhood parks like Connors Park in South Side shown what could happen when neighbors take ownership of a park and downtown park and park and admission by Scranton Tomorrow that is moving forward that will serve the ever-expanding residential community that is becoming part of downtown . Most of that has happened organically because of initiatives by caring resident s and neighbors and other organizers . But the park system can be much more. It can not only be a city asset but a community draw, a marketing tool, a property value enhancer and a neighborhood anchor. So for too long we have struggle d just to cut the grass while barely maintaining the status quo. We have not committed the necessary talent, vision, and resources to our parks. And we can do a lot better than we are.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 So I'm hopeful that the Geisinger CMC Nay Aug model can show us a blueprint for corporate and public engagement . And we can begin to look at our parks and trails and open spaces as more than just a line item on a very, very stressed budget. It just might be worth taking a different look at our parks and what they provide for all of us. And finally as usual, I'd like to remind everyone that every day is your chance to make this city a little better. Thank you very much. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. Thank you. Mr. Evans made a comment about having to do a right to know for the demolition list. I'd just like to remind everybody and Councilman Donahue brought this up a few weeks ago. This Council has subpoena power. It's in our Home Rule Charter . And we should start using it. Why should elected official s have to put a right to know in. We are a body that has oversight over the Mayor's office and over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 every other department in this building . And that is one of the reasons why probably the fathers of this city specifically put in that this Council would have subpoena power. Now, should it be abused and used all the time? No. But in the cases I have seen over the last four or five years we should be using it. Come in here -- subpoena people to come in here, subpoena documents if you need to. I don't think any elected official should have to put a right to know request in. And then this administration pulls their typical BS all the time. And if you're looking for one letter, they extend it to 30 days. It takes them 30 days -- and that's I'm sure what they're going to do in Mr. Evans' case, thirty days to come up with a document that they should be able to hit a button and print it out. Secondly , I usually don't comment on this. But I just have to say, first of all, Mr. Ellman, her name is Jessica , not Jennifer . And I am sick and tired of sitting up here every week through the character assassination of this person who is a very good person and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 who decided to put her name in the ring and run for this office and we allow it to happen every week. It doesn't have anything to do with City Council . It has nothing to do with city business . It has nothing do with the agenda that I'm looking at right here. There's nothing on here that says Jessica Rothchild, nothing about her. I'm sick and tired of it. And the ignorance and the -- it's suffocating . And it's a wonder why the hell anybody would want to run for this office. They are not even elected yet -- officially elected and they have to sit through this every week. Shame on all of you who stand up here and attack this woman who ran for Council . Shame on you. It's the last time I'm going to say it, but there needs to be decorum in these chambers . It's turned into a WWF. Get up, talk about Jessica Rothchild , talk about what she ate for dinner last night. It's ridiculous . And everyone likes to cite free speech. There's something called hate speech. Read a few Supreme Court cases on that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Also, Mrs. Jefferies brought up Third Order correspondence about the letters that I had read last week. Just for the record, I have brought up time and time again that Third Order should be reserved for any -- and it says right here if you look at our agenda, reports and communications from the Mayor and heads of department s and interest ed parties and city clerk's notes. So I do agree with you it should be a matter of regular practice that any letter or correspond that we get from a department head or the Mayor should automatically be put in Third Order. I don't know what else I could do. I've said it before. I've request ed it. I've made motions to put these letters in Third Order. It should be a matter of practice . I don't know what we're waiting for. So I hope that answers your questions . Onto a few citizens ' request s. A resident reached out about Knox Road needs patching . Mrs. Reed, if you could please send that to DPW. Also, I would like to send a letter to the Chief of Police regarding issues at building s 26 and 27 of Hilltop Manor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 The past few years I've received several complaint s. I think the police department is trying to do the best they can. But I continue to receive notice from resident s that there's noise, loud music, cursing . No one can sit in their backyard . So if we can please send something to the chief again and remind him about that. Also, I recently met with residents of Kay Avenue regarding water runoff issues. There's a an issue with a pipe that runs along the alley there. I met with two of the resident s within the last week and a half. Mrs. Reed and I were in contact with DPW. And we received notice that they are going to assess that situation for a possible remedy. Also 1132-1134 Rock Street, a gentleman has reached out to me I think every year when the weather gets nice. There's a vacant lot that's overgrown all the way over the sidewalk and into the road. We did send it to the Licensing and Inspections Department . And, Mrs. Reed, if we can ask and see if DPW -- I know they can't go on private property , but if they can at least clear the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 brush off of the sidewalk because at this point it's impassa ble. Also, a few weeks ago we asked for an update from Joyce Hatala and Tom Lynch about the Recycling Program . We requested specific information during that caucus within a few months ago. We have not heard back yet. So, Mrs. Reed, if you can remind them to please provide us with that information . In the caucus tonight the Ethics Board was brought up. We current ly have four members that have been chosen. Mayor Courtright has sent down one person that he has picked. Council has given their two candidate s and Mrs. Novembrino has given her one candidate . So at this point instead of waiting for the Mayor to send down the last person, I do think it's appropriate instead of to continue to wait to ask our city solicit or and the city solicitor to draft a legislation for those appointments , send it to Council and we'll leave one seat empty. They'll end up having a quorum. In the meantime , we could have -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 once they're appoint ed we could have the lottery for the length of the stagger ed terms. So I would appreciate , Mrs. Reed, if you could take care of that. Also Solicitor Minora is not here tonight . But I would like to move forward on the BYOB legislation if you remember from a few weeks ago with the case of the Castle Club on Main Avenue in North Scranton . I do think we should try to find a way to regulate those type of establishments . They're allowed to stay open because people that could go into them could bring their own beer. And they are allowed to stay open I believe until 5 a.m. Obviously that poses a lot of problems for people in that neighborhood . So I would like an update on that next week. And we also received a letter from the manager of the Borough of Taylor regarding an incident on Reynolds Avenue with water runoff. It runs into the Taylor/Scranton line. I actually was in contact with the president of Taylor Council , Kenneth Mickavicz . And we're hopeful that the city will do their part to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 take care of that issue. That's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just two quick items. I wanted to give a thank you to the DPW for quick response regarding a handicap sign that was left up for quite a long time in a neighborhood . And I know there's a shortage of these signs. So I think the city does need to do a better job on an ongoing basis of removing signs that have expired because they are taking up spots in neighborhood s where they shouldn 't be. And then I know there's also people out there that are waiting to have those signs put in in front of their house. But I want to thank the DPW. I sent in a request last week. And within two days it was taken care of. One other quick item, Mrs. Reed, I don't want to read the addresses on the air. But I did get a report from a resident of South Scranton about possibly illegal rooming houses that are operating on one particular block in South Scranton . So I will send you those addresses . So if we can send those to Director Hinton to have them take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 a look at it to see what the status of those properties is. And that is all. MS. REED: 5-B.

I think this is going to be a much more user-friendly system. And judging by their comment s tonight , we're going to begin to use technology that many other cities have been using for years across the United States. So I think this is a net benefit for the city. MR. ROGAN: I would agree on that point. And I would also like to mention that one item that was discussed a little bit at the cause that I think will be possibly an issue in some areas, the elimination of the time zones, the park 15 minutes, park 30 minutes . I've had a discussion with a number of business owners who wanted these signs in front of their business as well. Part of the problem with the old system was these signs were pretty much just thrown up by request . There wasn't really a rhyme or reason as to why some businesses were allowed 15 minute or 30 minute parking in front of them and others were not. So I think this standardizes that system. And also, I'm a huge fan of the kiosk model versus the old fashion meters for many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 reasons but one being convenience . If you go to any major city or medium size city, this is the system that they are on. And we're finally catching up in that respect as well. Anyone else? (No response .) MR.

And I'm also a customer of ABM. And I pay the monthly rate of $90 per month in one of the garages that is part of this legislation . So as a Councilman , I will not opt into this program while I'm on City Council . And, therefore , I will be not paying the reduced rate. I will continue to pay the $90 per month that I am paying now. I just wanted to disclose that before we vote. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: On the question ?

ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I'm going to be voting for this. But Miss Hodowanitz brought up a good point. I believe I brought this up before about attachment D for the disclosure s by firm or contractor . It's my -- it's my understanding that when the firms sign off on the bottom and they don't include anything else that their answer is that they have not -- they don't have a direct financial commercial or business relationship with any municipal official , so on and so forth. But I do agree that it is confusing when you look at it and there's nothing on there they just sign the bottom of it. So I will be voting for this. But, Mrs. Reed, if you could just find out from Mr. Bulzoni would probably be the best person to go to for this and just ask him if, in fact, that is the case. And if it's not the case and there is additional information , then they should provide that. Thank you. MR.
