REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, first I'd just like to send my condolences to Mrs. Novembrino 's family. She was a wonderful lady and, you know, 30 years of service to this City should be commended . In response to, Mr. Hinton, I did say that at a Green Ridge Neighborhood meeting because in my first 18 months on this Council I would week after week send up request s to Licensing and Inspection and so would my colleagues with zero response , week after week. And it was -- I would put complaint s for Licensing and Inspections actually above 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 complaint s for pothole s. And then you add onto that, you know, we've had multiple federal lawsuits . We settled one for about 250 grand. I think there's about three more still out there. And also, you know, the Pay to Play involving the Mayor. Whether you knew or not, you were responsible for that office. That was your responsibility . And I'll leave it at that. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, actually . I'm going -- I have no motions . I'm going to refrain from making my budget comment s until later on both the budget and the amendments . I again have to speak to Mr. Ellman. You have again succeed ed in offending me. I don't know what the problem here is with you and women. The comment s were offense and chauvinistic . You got up here and you started to talk about the ladies of the school board. There is also a male member of the school board. And Miss Cruise{sic} is sitting here in the back and I'm sure she was taken aback and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 insulted by it as well. And one of your comments was they can't say no. What does that even mean that can't say no? And why would you make that generalized comment about women in general ? The comments were demeaning and they were disheartening . And then you started to talk about Mayor-elect Cognetti and Dr. Rothchild . May I remind you one has an MBA from Harvard and may I remind you the other one has a PhD. And again, you call them ladies. And then you spoke about an unwed mother in the project s. What that has to do with anything , I don't know. But I do know one thing, the unwed mother, it was not an immaculate concept ion. So there's men involved in that as well. And yet, you didn't bring that issue up at all. This is the second or third time I've had to address this. And I don't understand what this ongoing thing is against women. It is insulting . It's unacceptable. It's violative of our rules of Council . Honestly , I think it's about the third time I've asked that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 either or Council President or our Solicitor step in the next time they hear these comments and ask you to stop them. I think it's unfair to anyone in this room who has an aunt, a daughter , a sister or a wife to sit here and to listen to those comments . And I don't think any of us should acquiesce in silence when we hear them. I'm going to ask you again to refrain from those comment s in the future. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just wanted to also send my condolence s to family of Roseann Novembrino . I mention ed a few weeks ago when she had retired, you know, how in my opinion and I think and many others in this building and across the City that she was one of the kindest , most compassionate people involve d in public service in the City of Scranton . And I, you know, in the last few days since she passed away thinking about when I first got involve d on Council and in public service she was one of the first people that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 extended a hand and her door was always open. And I know that the employees who worked in her office and worked for her held her in the highest esteem. She really was one of the most well respected public official s and well respect ed people, not only in government but through out the City of Scranton . So again, we're -- we lost somebody that was I think one of the best people and one of the most well respect ed people in this building . And again, to approach that position with the compassion and with the kindness that she did and the way that she interacted with the public and the people I think should be commendable . So I want to say God bless her and God bless her family at this time. The only other thing I want to mention is the rescue mission on Olive Street. I know there was an article in the newspaper today. We did receive a -- or I receive d a phone call from a gentleman in that area. And some of the neighbor s are complaining again. This is a recurring problem . I know it got a little bit better based on some of the efforts made months and months and months ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 to clean the property up. But apparently according to this gentleman , there are some issues that are occurring again. So, Mrs. Reed, if we can just send a followup letter to the rescue mission . One of the recommendations after speaking to this one gentleman was maybe someone from the establishment could do a check at least once every 24 hours. There seems to be issues with clothes and debris and other things. So if we can do that and I know the Licensing and Inspections Office is aware of it. But if we can just send something again to them or copy them on the letter, I would appreciate it. And the only other thing I want to mention is if we can please place Mr. Bulzoni respond ed to our budget questions we had, I don't know, four or five, six pages of budget questions . He did respond . We received them last Wednesday . If we can place those in Third Order for the next meeting so that the public can see how he responded , I would appreciate it. I will save the rest of my comments for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 agenda comments . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. I will also save my comments for agenda items. MS. REED: 5-B.

MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . ATTY. DEMPSEY : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I went through this legislation . I understand what is trying to be done here. I know we receive d a confidential memo on this issue. We just receive d it tonight so I haven't had a chance to take a look at it. But what I would recommend is if we can have the Director of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 OECD, if possible , come into our caucus next week just so we can have a conversation on this piece. And I think I would like to get maybe a better sense of why we're doing this. And if things aren't working in OECD in terms of this program , I think maybe a little bit more background on why. And I'm not against this. Again, I'm still reviewing it. But I think that would be helpful to get some background on that from the Director . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else?

PREVIOUSLY TABLED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE FOR ADOPTION FILED OF THE COUNCIL NO. 78, 2019, APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2020 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2020 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to make the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 following motions to amend Item 7-D per the following -- and I'm going to make these motions individually . First, I'd like to amend account number 01.301.30706 Real Estate Taxes to increase the dollar amount from $18,800,058.98 to $19,366,031.15. MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I'm going to just take this time now I might as well to comment on the budget if I can on this motion because it all ties in together if that would be -- I think that's okay with everyone . So first let me just comment on the budget and then I'm going to explain the several motions that I'm going to make. I appreciated the Mayor and Mr. Bulzoni and our recovery coordinator coming to a budget caucus last Wednesday . And I have to be honest. It's the first time in the six years that we were actually allowed to have an open and an honest conversation in public about issues that face 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 the City. I could never for the life of me understand since I've been on Council since 2014 why we were never able to get everyone around a table in a room and discuss these things. It was always rushed. It was always at the 11th hour. We were given things 45 minutes before the caucuses . And so at least for the first time in a long time we were able to have a conversation . I was disappoint ed that it was cut short because I think there were still some things that Council wanted to zero in on and discuss but it was very informative . First, I do understand that the budget is a relatively fluid document and that no budget is perfect . Some years projections are on target. Other years they're off because of a number of factors . What is true since I have been on Council and long before that is that the City continuously faces systemic issues that no magical solution can fix, not even the long heralded exit from Act 47 distressed status. Scranton like many other cities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania cannot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 afford the legacy cost that we are saddled with, whether it be union contracts , pension benefits , healthcare , longevity , on and on and on. The State of Pennsylvania has failed every municipality in the state with their revisions to Act 47. As usual, they ignore the root of the problem s that face cities in attempt to cure them with a superficial boot from distress ed status as if we'll be cured when we come out next summer, which we won't. And that was confirmed by the Pennsylvania Economy League and other official s in our caucus on Wednesday . While there has been progress made, there's no question about that. The City cannot continue on the path that this budget takes us which is reliance on one-time revenue and maybes, what ifs. We were told by the administration that there are a lot of moving parts. And there are a lot of moving parts. This is a complicated budget in many aspects. We're now entering our fourth year without a tax increase when our exit plan calls for modest tax increases over time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 One thing that I was kind of struck by that the Pennsylvania Economy League had given us was this chart on tax rate changes . From 1991 -- and there's a trend here that I would like to point out. From 1991 to 1998, there was no tax increase . And then from 1999 and the year 2000, major double-digit tax increases . 2001 to 2006 no tax increases ; 2007, major double-digit tax increase ; 2008, 2009, 2010, no tax increase ; 2011, taxes were actually decreased by 11 percent on land and 11 percent on improvements . Then from the years 2012 to 2016, major double-digit increases in taxes. And then now we're on a trend again, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020, no tax increase . So the point I'm trying to get at here is the reality of the situation . Although unfortunate as it is and as the financial advisors warned us and made very crystal clear, if we don't raise taxes modestly this year, we may be looking at a punitive double-digit increase in the next year or two. It's a pretty simple equation . Our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 revenue bottoms out and our expenditures continue to increase . This budget had to be balanced on another quick fix which is a one-time sale of assets with the sale of refuse receivables . That gets us through next year and then what? And then what? And then what? And then what after that. So what I'll be recommending tonight to my fellow Council members is what I feel is the responsible path to take. I understand that it will not be the popular path. I'm going to be requesting a modest tax increase which would come out to about $10.50 on the average homeowner along with several reduction s in expenditures so that we don't as our Recovery Coordinator put it fall into the trap of delaying it and then crushing people in the next year or two. I'm talking about being realistic and being honest with people. We sat around the table last Wednesday . And we heard from our Recovery Coordinator and our Business Administrator that if we don't modestly increase taxes this year, we're going to do it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 next year but it won't be modest. It may be punitive and then the year after that. And then as the Pennsylvania Economy League noted -- and I just want to read a quote from what they had said and this is a fact. "We see one-time revenue , quick fix -- that's what's been going on here for as long as anybody can remember -- a sale of assets to fix a cyclical deficit . Past history of the City shows -- which I just held up with the chart that we will have a tax increase next year and the year after. Then you'll have a structural -- if we don't do that, we fall into the trap. We'll have a structural deficit that is large. It will grow over periods of time. And it will then get to the point like a few years ago when you have to lay out people with punitive tax increases . In the past, the City has waited until the problem has compound ed and then taxes go through the roof. So you can't just sit back and pat yourselves on the back to say that we can't raise taxes. And that was our Recovery Coordinator 's words, not mine.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Now, over the last few years I've had serious concerns with the budgets present ed to Council and this one is no different . I do have several concerns . And we were able to discuss some of them as we sat around the table last week. One of my concern s is that expenditures I think were out of control in many respects over the last few years. Since I took office in 2015, we have had major increases in capital expenditures , departmental and non departmental expenditures . I laid out the last few weeks those dollar amounts . One example that I could pull out, which I think shows the lack of foresight by City official s in the past is a new public safety building that we have. Some of it was funded with grant money. Other money came out of the budget. These are things that we take on when don't have a plan to maintain them. We don't have the resources to maintain it. It's great to have a new Public Safety Building and maybe it's warranted . But we can't afford it. We couldn't afford it and that's the reason I voted against it last year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 or a few years ago. Unfortunately these -- this spending while some of it was necessary , that ship had sailed; and there's nothing we can do about it. I want to say for the record that the Mayor's plan to roll the refuse bill into the real estate tax bill while I don't necessarily disagree with it and I think it makes sense, it's riddled with issues that have not been addressed to date. And I want to check through a few of them. Number one, legislation authorizing the lowering of your refuse bill from $300 to $250 will not come down this year. It will come down next year. So Council will not end up passing that legislation if it even goes through until the end of January , early February . The real estate tax bills go out in February . And I've had this conversation with the administration . Is it even realistic to expect that the Tax Office is going to be able to do all of this work and put your refuse bill in the real estate tax bill in this short amount of time? It's not clear that that could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 even be done. So that's number one. Number two, I think the plan the way it's set up is inherently unfair. For example , a business that now pays a private hauler under this plan will pay a private hauler but will also pay the $250 garbage fee for a service that they don't receive . Now, we were told by Mr. Price, one of the City Solicitor s that there is precedence for this and that there was a legal case showing that it can be done. And I don't disagree with him on that. But it's unfair. You cannot expect -- if we're trying to get business in the City, you can't expect business es to stay here when they're paying for garbage pickup from a private hauler and then they have to pay the City for separate fee. The same thing in terms of landlords . Now they're getting charged -- if they have three units they get charged for each unit. Under this plan they would just get one bill for $250. So people are skating for free. On the other hand, landlord s who have more than four units who have to pay a private hauler, now they have to pay both a private hauler and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 the $250 fee. Again, this thing is riddled with issues that I think have not really been addressed yet. The plan is also built upon maybes. The electronic recycle program , they put $350,000 in this budget for this program . I don't disagree with it. But it has to receive approval from DEP. There's so many steps that they have to go through . How many months is that going to take? The pay as you throw program that they talk about being implemented , there's -- could be a lot of issues with that. That hasn't even been flushed out yet. And then this amnesty program that keeps being talked about. I don't necessarily disagree with it. But we don't know enough about it. And the numbers haven't even been quantified yet. Healthcare increases . I know Attorney Dempsey is going to go into this in more detail than I will because she has a great background in it. I said last year that they were underestimated . I thought my concerns were ignored . It was underestimated . One of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 things that came up in our meeting was that a healthcare analysis they don't put it in writing -- our healthcare administrator which is a huge concern . Retiree healthcare came up last Wednesday in our caucus. Major increase in long-term liability for the City. It's something that -- one of the reasons why I voted against the contracts , the police and fire contracts back in 2015. Mr. Bulzoni said it's -- he's unclear on how to even quantify that cost yet. We don't know the future cost. There was an article in the Scranton Times a few years ago that stated that there's a possibility that that could be a budget buster. It's something that we gave back that I don't think we'll be able to bargain now off the table. And it's one of the moves that continues to get us in the financial quagmire that we always seem to find ourselves in. The conversion from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to Payroll Prep, I agree with it; but it carries some uncertainty .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 What will the school district do? And then there's other question s that go along with that. And finally , the lack of answers to questions over the years has always bothered me. Last year I asked a number of questions . I got answers . They weren't to my satisfaction . It left a lot to be desired . Mr. Bulzoni responded to questions this year. I appreciate it. But again, we're waiting -- always waiting until the 11th hour on this. I'm a person that needs to read this and understand it. So to get it and then have to rush through this thing -- although I think we did a better job this year. Hopefully with the new administration we're getting this month's in advance , a preliminary budget and we're able to ask questions and flush this stuff out so it's not a mad dash in December . I appreciate what the Mayor is trying to do with this budget. But again, there is just too many maybes. There's too many what ifs, especially with a whole new cast of people most likely coming in next year with the administration . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 It's my recommendation that we take a much more conservative approach that would allow us to remain somewhat financially stable and again, avoid having to crush people with double-digit tax increases which we've had to do in the past. So I'm a big believer in fixing the roof while the -- and making repairs while the sun is shining . I don't think it's shining all the way in the City. But it's there. We're not in as terrible condition as we were in the past. I don't make these motions lightly because I know that people are suffering and having a hard time paying their taxes coupled with what is going on in the school district . But again, to me it was a simple argument that was made last week. If we don't do it this year we're going to do it next year. I'll be sitting here next year and it won't be 2.4 percent , which is what I'm going to recommend . It will be 10 percent or 20 percent . We have a structural deficit . And it's going to continue to snowball unless we do these things. And again, my final point on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 this is just take a look at the trends. Take a look at when we don't raise taxes for a number of years in a row and then we get crushed . And that's what will happen. At least that's my fear. And again, I want to make the point that this was recommended to us by the Pennsylvania Economy League. This was from my understand ing a recommendation -- original recommendation from the Business Administrator to the Mayor. So I think that Council has to do the responsible thing. The one thing that we're doing which is going to be another motion here is to restate the amount of revenue that we will receive from the potential sale of refuse receivables . Again, when I spoke to Mr. Bulzoni , this is a complicated transaction . There is no guarantee that we get this money. And even if we get it and even if everything works out great which would be fantastic , we're still going to have issues in the next year or two. We still have a revenue problem . So I'm going to make these motions . I hope that my colleagues would agree with me on this. And I think at least it gives us a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 little piece of mind going into next year. And that's all I have to say tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Just as a reminder , we're on the question on the first amendment to amend the real estate tax amount in the budget. Anyone else on the question ? Just two points. I know you went through a lot there that I want to make. First regarding the taxes, every budget has a number of moving parts. This budget happens to be 137 pages. So there's obviously going to be some items that -- or shortfall some items that come in above projections . I know people have had reservations in years past that the budgets weren't balance d and the last three years with no tax increase they certainly were. This year we're on track to end with a small surplus . I don't see the need for tax increase currently . And the taxes eventually are going to have to go up. Councilman Gaughan is correct on that. But with the new Mayor coming in next year who has already promised tax relief, I think that we should give her an opportunity to propose , you know, opening the budget which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 would be her prerogative and make any changes she would like to see. I don't see the need especially with the timing. Taxpayer s are getting hit pretty hard by the school district currently . Seven years ago it was the opposite way around. The school district was in better shape and the City was struggling . It's just tough when it's from all taxing bodies at the same time. I do agree with some of these other amendment s that we are going to go through . And I will talk a little bit more. I know you hit on the changing of the garbage system. But I'll talk about that more when that amendment comes up. Anyone else on the question on the first amendment ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Opposed ? No. The motion passes. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I'd like to make a second motion under City of Scranton 2020 Operating Budget, Budgeted Revenues , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 General Fund. I'd like to amend account number 01.301.30706, account description from current real estate tax land millage rate 232.521 mills to current real estate tax land millage rate 239.521 mills. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I just want to take one second to explain this. So as I -- again, I'm not taking these numbers out of thin air here. I was going back and forth over the last few days with Mr. Bulzoni and the Pennsylvania Economy League. So what the recommendation was was to raise the millage seven points on the land. So the -- Mr. Bulzoni had stated to me that nominal adjustment on the land component would have the least impact on the average property owner. The increase is borne more by those who have larger parcels which would be commercial or industrial interests or those homeowners with larger parcels who can likely absorb the increase . In effect, it offers better dispersion . For example , if you have a typical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 property with an improvement value of ten thousand dollars and land value of fifteen hundred dollars , the tax increase would be on the land component . So a 232.521 mills, the tax liability on land is $348.78. At 239.52 mills which is what we're proposed here, the liability is $359.28 or an increase of $10.50. So out of all of the recommendations that were given, this was the least punitive . And again, I want to make the point that overall this is a 2.4 percent increase . It's a 3 percent increase on the land millage . And again, I want to state that this is necessary . According to our Recovery Coordinator it is necessary . If we don't do it this year we're going to be doing it next year and the year after that. So to ignore it this year and to wait for the next Mayor to come in, I think that's shirking our responsibility as a Council . We need to make sure that we are able to sustain ourselves fiscally . And again, in terms of the last few budgets 2017, 18, 19, those -- you know, those might have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 balanced on paper. But we continue to have -- we're relying on one-time revenue , the sale of the Sewer Authority , so on and so forth. I just -- I don't make these motions lightly . But I do want to drive home the point to everyone that this is a recommendation from our Recovery Coordinator . If we don't do it this year, we're coming back next year. I'm going to be sitting here in December and we're going to be raising it on the people even higher. And the other point I want to make too is, I had a chance to read a 2017 report called Communities in Crisis, the Truth and Consequences of Municipal Fiscal Distress in Pennsylvania 1970 to 2014. And I know some people sitting at home are probably saying, you know, every couple years you're raising taxes; when is it going to end? Your expenditures go up. Your revenue s either stay the same or they decay. They go down. The truth is that the Recovery Plan the -- this whole notion of an exit plan, this whole notion of Act 47 and distressed status, claiming to have fixed Act 47 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 municipalities by forcing them out of the program but not doing anything to repair the broken system, that's the state. The state has not done anything in my estimation , especially after reading this report for not just only Scranton but cities throughout the state who continue to face these problems of crisis with the pension , crisis with not being able to raise enough revenue year after year after year. And their solution is back in 2014 we're going to amend Act 47. We're going to give you five years. And then we're going to kick you out. We don't -- the notion that the City is exiting Act 47 because somehow everything is going great -- although we've made progress , that is just flat out false. That is not -- and if you read this report, it is stated in this report. So I just want to make sure that I state that that this is a more complex problem than sometimes people make it out to be. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yeah, I'd like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 speak on the question real quick, Pat, please. I thought about this long and hard because this is, in fact, a difficult decision . And I'm going to use some notes. Usually I speak spontaneously . But there's a lot going on with this budget so I created some notes if anybody sees me peeking down at them. And I decided that the real question to me is why would I keep this City in recovery for years and years and years and then just about when we're ready to exit successfully suddenly ignore PEL's advice. And I sat down at that table less than six days ago directly across from Jerry Cross and Matt Domines . And it couldn't have been more clear to me that they were recommending a 2.4 percent tax increase . And the terms Jerry kept using were Scranton is experiencing revenue decay versus expenditure growth, which I think in layman's terms is our revenue is decreasing and our expenses are increasing . And, you know, Bill is right. They gave us a chart that to me answers any questions I may have had about the soundness or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 the wisdom behind this because you look back at the years passed when we had zero, zero, zero tax increases , 2008, 2009, 2010. And it sounds amazing and it looks good on paper. And then in 2011 they actually went down 11 percent . Well, that sounds great too. But there's a natural repercussion to that action when our expenditures keep increasing . And then we got through the next three years in 2012 it went up by 5 percent . In 2013 it went up by 22 percent . And 2014 it went up 57 percent . That type of an increase is appalling to most of our residents and very difficult for most of our households to manage. I understand that. So for the average taxpayer , I'd rather do 2.4 this year as recommended by PEL, which again, Mr. Gaughan said has been told to us will be about 10.50 a household or less than one dollars a month than make some sort of unrealistic or unsustainable double-digit increase in years to come. In voting yes, I also believe that I'm looking out for the most vulnerable amongst us, which means a lot to me, the elderly, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 disable d, the single parents , one-income household s, those who are economically disadvantaged or going through difficult times due to layoff, sickness , or any other reason who are struggling . I do not want to create a situation where tax increase is a true hardship for these people our most vulnerable resident who may be struggling to pay their taxes or even to save their homes. And that's going to happen next year or the year after if we don't enact the 2.4 percent this year. In making the decision I'm reminded of something my dad told me a long time ago. "The right decision is not always an easy one and it's certain ly not always a popular one." But I am going to vote in favor of Mr. Gaughan 's amendments after much thought and deliberation . The decision is based on the facts and figures and the statistic s as provided by PEL on the opinion s of Jerry Cross and Matt Domines of PEL who have guided us through the recovery to this point where we are now successfully looking forward to leaving Act 47 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 in the summer of 2020. Because this decision will hopefully have only a small and minimal financial impact on most household s throughout the City that it will be more than bearable , I do believe that it's in the best interest of our City to make this decision at this time. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Opposed ? No. It passes -- motion two passes. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, motion number three would be I'd like to amend account number 01.380.38870, Sale of Assets to decrease from 2,256,796.05 to 1,520,823.89. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , this is the number that concerns me the most because it is a one-time revenue source. So we tried to -- in conversations over the weekend talking about these amendments was trying to lower this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 number so that even if we get in more than what we're budgeting, good. But then that's less than what we have to fill into going into next year. You know, if we were to keep it at that 2.25 number, we would be looking at probably 12 to 13 percent tax increase just off the top just to fill in that two -- next year just to fill in that 2.2 million . But by lowering it, you know, we might only be starting off about a 6 and a half, 7 percent , you know, but that's also with getting the new administration coming in, you know, hopefully some leeway to bring that number down then too. But it's getting into these one-time revenue sources that gets you into trouble because that's where you start creating those structural deficits . If you look at what happened down the street with the school district is they just constantly , constantly use one-time revenue s and then it got to the point where it just couldn't be replaced. So I think lowering this number was an important part of getting me to support these amendments . And that's why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 I'm going to be doing that. That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Briefly on this one, I actually oppose this one more than the others believe it or not. I understand what Councilman Donahue is saying. And it is a one-time revenue source. So if you oppose the one-time revenue source just take it out entirely then. The City has already had a commitment prior to putting out any RFPs for the sale of the receivables in excess of the 2.2 million dollars that is being put in the budget. And the reason I so strongly support this change is not so much a budgetary issue. But it's in reference to our whole garbage billing system to begin with. The current system is broken. The fact of sending out $300 bills and then 60 percent of people pay them, 40 percent don't. It's not working . Are there issues with changing to any sort of other system, of course, there's going to be. I think putting it in the tax bill and spreading it across more people at a lower rate is the right approach . Again, that's something that we're going to have to debate at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 length next year. But in order to fill the gap from moving from the current system to the new system, selling what's owed I think is a smart solution . The current system isn't working. With Northeast Revenue all the issues we've had there, the issues of big-time landlords not paying bills at all. If it's lumped into the taxes and you don't pay it, you get a tax sale. So you have to pay it just like you have to pay your property taxes. And that's been the issue with the refuse that people have looked at it as a -- something that they -- whether they want to pay it or not, some people just throw it in the garbage and just figure, well, I'm never going to sell my house. They can't come after me until the house is sold which unfortunately with lien system is true. So again, in regards to the budget, I think the budget number is actually conservative to begin with at the 2.2 million. Moving it to 1.5 in my opinion actually creates an even bigger surplus in the budget next year if the assets are sold. If the assets are not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 sold, then you're still left with a 1.5 million dollar deficit . So I think this amendment is a middle ground which you really can't go either way with it. I could understand taking it out of the budget entirely and say we're just not going to sell it. And I could understand the other end of it saying well, we're going to change systems . But I think this kind of straddles the middle between both. And I don't think it's going work either way. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROAN: Opposed? No. Motion three passes. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to also make an amendment to amend Mayor's Offices account number 4040-01.010.000000.4040 Other Salary from $35,000 to zero dollars . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 explain this as well. And it's going to be the same for the next few. One of the things that was done in this budget that I don't agree with is creating positions but not really creating them. So what the administration had done was apparently they were going to create a Chief of Staff position for the Mayor's Office. But it's not a line item in the budget. The money is located in the other salary. So I don't know if we receive d a job description for that. I know we received some tonight . I haven't had a chance to go through it yet. But my concern with leaving the money -- and I've had this conversation with the administration in the last few days -- leaving it the other salary sets a precedent that we just -- we don't have a check and a balance anymore as a City Council . We're giving the administration free rein maybe create it, maybe move it around, maybe give somebody a raise with it. There's just too much -- there's too much wiggle room to me. So my concern would be that again, we would set precedent if you're going create the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 position , create it. Put it in the budget. Give us a job description . And then I would love to make a decision on it. But until that happens, I'm going to make several amendments now to take the Other Salary down and if the position is going to be created in future just put it in the budget. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, I'd like to speak to this as well. I agree with those amendments although partially for different reasons, partially for the same reason. When we attended our public caucus again, six days ago, this is part of the area of law where I practice which is Best Employment Practices . And one of my pet peeves here is the fact that there are no job descriptions . Because the fact of the matter is, I'm not against some of these jobs. But no one saw fit to provide me with any job description rational e or reason, although I must edit that because today at noon one job description appeared in my box. To me, the days of creating jobs that have no responsibility or no accountability are over. Job descriptions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 assist employees in knowing what is expected of them. Job descriptions assist in performance evaluations . And they assist in managing employee s and issuing discipline if needed. They also give the public confidence that when a job is being created and funded with public dollars that it's a real job that it is needed that it would be managed appropriately . And to me, this should be the official end of no work jobs. Going forward I am insisting on culpability and responsibility . The same old status quo in this area is no longer good enough for me. And I know it's not good enough for many others including you guys sitting down there and many of the gentlemen sitting up here. What I will not do is approve jobs that have no account ability associate d with them, no definable tasks or no essential functions . Therefore , it is incumbent on me to agree with Mr. Gaughan 's motion to amend and to remove these jobs from the budget. I also agree with a comment that Mr. Gaughan made at the meeting that by creating these jobs in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 budget, kind of these no name jobs, it does also take away the appropriate checks and balance function s of Council which as we all know now more than ever is needed. And so for that reason, I'll be agreeing and voting for the amendment . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? I'm going comment on this one and next three actually all at once. I will be voting for the next four amendments . I agree with what my colleague s have mention ed. And again, as I mentioned earlier , we do have a new Mayor coming in in January . If she wants to open the budget and make changes at that time she has that prerogative to do so and send that down to Council for a vote. I do agree with the idea of just putting a number in the budget and saying well, they could do with it what they want isn't the right way to run a city, particularly the fact on this one and specifically the idea of a Chief of Staff for the Mayor keeps being floated around. And a salary number of $35,000 was put in there. You're not getting a Chief of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Staff for a large city for $35,000. It just doesn't make sense. And finally because I'm going to wrap these all into one. On the last amendment we're going deal with the idea of a Public Safety Director . That's been done in the past. I don't think it worked. Again, if the new Mayor wants to propose those types of changes, that's going to be up to her to open the budget and send it down to Council and we can debate those at the time. But I will be voting yes for the next few amendments . All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and motion four passes. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to amend DPW garages account number 404-01.080.00085.4040 Other Salary from $45,000 to zero dollars . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , with this one I believe it was for a second shift 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 mechanic , which I'm not really against . But again, as I mentioned to Mr. Bulzoni , it has to be put in the budget. And he actually I believe yesterday or sometime this weekend agreed with me that really these should have been put in the budget. So this will have to wait until next year. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and motion five passes. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to amend the Single Tax Office account number 4040-01.090.00000.4040, Other Salary from $45,000 to zero dollars . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : This was a position that was going to be created I believe if the Single Tax Office received the responsibility of collecting the Payroll Preparation Tax. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Again, it's way too arbitrary . Either it's in there or it's not. And we don't even know if they're definitely going to collect the Payroll Preparation Tax. So that's the reason that I made that amendment . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and motion six passes. MR. GAUGHAN : I'd like to amend the Fire Department account number 4040-01.0111.00078.4040, Other Salary from $250,000 to $205,000. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question , there's such a large amount in here because of some other things that actually should be in there like I believe retire incentive and something else Mr. Bulzoni had mention ed to me. The position was originally budgeted at $45,000 for I believe a Public Safety 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 Manager or Public Safety Director . Again, I don't necessarily disagree with that position . But we don't know enough about it. So I really can't, you know, make an educate d decision on it. So that's the other reason that I took that out. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and motion seven passes. If anyone wishes to speak specifically on the propose d amendments to the budget prior to the final vote you may do so at this time. I think we can allot two minutes per speaker . (The following spoke on amendments : Joan Hodowanitz Marie Schumacher Dave Dobrzyn ) MR. ROGAN: What is recommendation of the Chair for the Committee On Finance ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 ATTY. DEMPSEY : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend a final vote of Item 7-D as amended . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question , I agree with everything that Joan said. I would just like to add to expand the revenue I think we need help from two -- to expand our tax revenue and our tax base, I think we need help from two governing bodies, one being the county in terms of reassessment . And the second being the State of Pennsylvania because if you read the report that Mr. Gaughan brought up before, it outlines how although we're leaving Act 47, distressed status, we're no better off than we were. And that's because of Pennsylvania 's antiquated laws on how municipalities across the state are able to function . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, I do have some comments . And again, bear with me they're a little bit longer than probably most people would like. But it's my first year voting on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 the budget and it was a one hundred and what, 30 or 40 page document . Quickly on the procedure since it was the first time I had seen this process , I was very glad to see that Council spent time and energy preparing ten pages of what I thought were good solid questions . Trust me, we had more. But we decided to just put forth the ones we felt were the best ones and the ones that would help us obtain the most information on the budget and the ones that would guide our decision making process . My concern is the answers to those questions were put into our mailboxes one half hour before we sat down to caucus with PEL and other members of the administration . I've never been a game player. And to me, we're all here in the best interest of the City and its residents . But that process threw me off a little bit. I would have liked to have seen them in advance . I also want to make it clear to everyone that while my background is not in finance , I as well realize a budget is a moving document . It's subject to change. And it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 malleable. And for the most part, you're predict ing the future based on past performance . And Mr. Bulzoni consistently said plan, execute , and adjust are the tenants of creating a budget. And I want to say that I understand that. But a little bit more on the process , two weeks ago on our Monday meeting we asked for a plan B. And I have to be candid. I was hoping this was where we were all going to come to an agreement . To me, plan B was where we can maybe meet in the middle. We could all unanimously present the administration and Mayor-elect Cognetti in 2020 with a workable budget with a united front. Rest assured, I want to choose optimism over pessimism . And I want to choose faith in the future over fear of the past. But I do believe the administration and the Council owe a duty to the public to try to come together . But we never did receive that plan B despite our timely request . And that as well made me wonder. Now, relative to the merits on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 budget, I'll go over these quickly . Most of them have already been simultaneously covered by my councilmates . I share in some of the concerns regarding the revenue sources . The potential sale of the trash fee delinquents , I think that's a little speculative, which by the way, I still remain opposed to that on an equitable basis. I don't know the timing of that. I know some people have called that a very complicated process . I'm concerned if any of the moving parts related to that don't work that we're going to be out a couple million dollars . And while it sounds nice, I share concern about the alleged reduction in the trash fee itself. I'm concern ed about the timing of reduction of the trash fee. And I'm concerned about the addition of the trash fee to the property tax bill. I'm not opposed to it. I just really don't think sitting here right now I have been provided enough information on the logistics of it. And most importantly , though I feel this budget is very well intentioned -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 again, I commend Mayor Evans for what he's accomplish ed in five months and his dedication and commitment to the City, I'm not 100 percent sure that the trash fee was well thought out in terms of execution . And I reiterate what Mr. Gaughan has repetitively said how we can ask a commercial entity or business to pay $250 in a trash fee when they may already be paying for private hauling . We're doing our best to change the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax which has consistently been called archaic to the Payroll Tax. And now all of a sudden, we're throwing one more thing at businesses that might want to lead them out of the City. And the next issue is the homeowner. How do you say to a homeowner you owe us 250, but the three in the house next door owes the same amount and they'll obviously be putting out triple the garbage . So I do have concerns in the back of my head about those issues. I am confident however , in the transfer from the Business Privilege Mercantile to the Payroll Tax. I also remain an ardent advocate of that. And I do believe that that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 will come to fruition and will assist our City businesses sometime next year. Now, I just really want to briefly go over one small example of what has kind of driven me crazy professionally about this process because I'm a person who relies on documentation a lot in making decisions . Someone in IT or the IT Department had asked us for a car. And I thought we had rightly written back to them and said, well, listen, do we pay mileage to the employees ? If we do, can we have their job description s? And if we do pay mileage , can you send us copies of all the mileage bills? Because to me, that's a simple analysis . If we're paying a certain amount in mileage each month, is it more or less than what it would cost to buy or lease a car? Again, we got no document s back. So I don't know if records aren't being kept or if records are being kept and they just don't want me to see them. But nonetheless , those types of things would have went a far way in helping me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 make educated decisions . On a separate issue we asked for a legal opinion that gave me and some others some cause for concern . It's not proper to talk about it outside of an executive session . But it is proper to say that no legal opinion was ever provide d to us despite my written request for one. And I made it very clear that I would want that prior to voting. But as Mr. Gaughan had alluded to earlier , my final tipping point came with regard to rising health insurance costs. And to be very candid with everybody , prior to sitting at this table six days ago with PEL and prior to them explain ing to me what I thought was very credibly why we needed a 2.4 tax increase , I was just going to vote no on the budget altogether because I was so taken aback by the healthcare costs. Let me preface this so I'm abundantly clear. I do not deny anyone, any City employee or any union employee the right to healthcare coverage. Do not think that is my issue here because it is not. As most of us know, the City is self-insured. And I ended up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 doing my own numbers. And I went back three years. In 2018, total healthcare costs budgeted were -- I rounded these off -- 16,123,000. In 2019, total healthcare costs budgeted was 16,888,000. This year total healthcare cost budgeted are up to 18,644,000. So we're up 1,700,000 from one year ago and we're up 2.5 million from two years ago. And when I went back and I read the explanation s in the budgets, they basically said that they underbudgeted each year. Now, I'm not unreasonable . I understand that catastrophic health events occur and I understand that people want and deserve the best medical treatment available . Rest assured , I have no objection to that. But what I can't and won't accept is a simple answer that we underbudgeted . We sit up here in a fiduciary role as a project or and as a watchdog of the public's money. And again, those answers just simply are not good enough for me. I expect more. I want more. And the City deserve s better. I want someone or some entity looking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 at these healthcare costs daily, weekly, monthly , quarterly or annually . As I said to the gentleman seated at this table last Wednesday , this is an area where I do maintain some element of expertise . My firm works with private and public companies every day to try and control healthcare costs. And with all due respect , it's not fair to blame the unions or the Collective Bargaining Agreements . If I had a dollar for every time I heard that in the last five months I'd be rich. A Collective Bargaining Agreement is a contract between two parties negotiated at arm's length. Key word being negotiated . It is then up to each party to enforce the respect ive rights. I do not believe the City has adequate ly managed healthcare costs. And if they have, no one has provided me with any affirmative written evidence of the same even though I specifically asked for it. We should have an aggressive third party health insurance consult ant, someone who provide s the Administration , the Controller and Council with an audit, a review and an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 analysis , someone who could come in here and can mandate creative solution s and some ingenuity to give the City ideas on how to control these costs. My firm deals with these consult ants all the time and they're worth their weight in gold. You've heard me speak previously about grant writers and how they could pay for themselves . Note, that's one other thing. I'd like to have a grant writer in this budget but that didn't happen. These healthcare consulting companies or singular healthcare consult ant can pay for themselves as well. The savings can be significant and they could long-term. And, yes, they can be done within the confines of a Collective Bargaining Agreement . When I asked for copies of the written reports authored by our healthcare consult ant, I was advised via e-mail quote, that someone provides the rational e of the range of healthcare costs and they do not generate any reporting or spreadsheets , end quote. I must repeat. That is not good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 enough for me. And it was not good enough in the past. And it should not be good enough anymore. I raise right now as a red flag that the unsustainable rise of healthcare costs in this City appears to me to be wholly unmanaged, appears to go unanalyze d and appears to be rubber stamped each year without analysis and it's wholly unacceptable . I've not been provided with one iota of documentation to show me that these costs have been reviewed, analyze d or examine d in writing by a third party healthcare consult ant, someone who's an expert in this area who could think innovatively who could help Scranton contain these costs, contain them now and who's also simultaneously dedicated to protect ing the rights of our employees at the same time. MR. ROGAN: Attorney Dempsey , I don't want to cut you off. But ECTV just asked if we can take a two-minute break so they can change the disk. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Sure. MR. ROGAN: I was trying to find a good spot. (A short recess was taken.)1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 ATTY. DEMPSEY : I'm almost done. I want to repeat, in conclusion that I weighed my decision s on this budget heavily . I looked at the pros and the cons. And I did a risk benefit analysis . And I studied the budget and the numbers very carefully especially with respect to the 2.4 percent tax increase because , you know, for me it would be very easy of all the people to take the easy way out and to walk out of here with only 27 days left and only a few meetings to vote on the taxes and to let what is going to happen to the City happen and not on my watch. But, ladies and gentlemen , I refuse to do that. I refuse to be that person. It's not who I am or what I stand for. I'm here and I'm in this seat because people trusted me and they trusted me to do the right thing at all times. And I refuse to let people down by taking the easy way out. My votes tonight are made with my intellect and my conscience and with the mandate that I sit here in a fiduciary role for the taxpayers of the City. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : I just want to add one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 thing, Mr. Rogan. One thing that I hope people don't forget is in regard -- and Attorney Dempsey just sparked my memory. In terms of converting the refuse bill into the real estate tax bill, this is all being done under the umbrella of major litigation in terms of the trash fee, the class action lawsuit s. So there's another concern that I had about this. So I just want people to keep that in mind as well. MR. ROGAN: And just on that point and I won't belabor it. But I'm just of the belief on the trash fee that the system is completely broken. And we have to do something different . Much more discussion on that in the next couple years. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Attorney Dempsey . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: No. I hereby declare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 Item 7-D as amended legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-E. Previously tabled. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR ADOPTION RESOLUTION NO. 183, 2019 AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH SPECK AND ASSOCIATES AND BARRY ISETT AND ASSOCIATES , SPECK/ISETT PARTNERSHIP FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON DOWNTOWN SCRANTON CONNECTIVITY PLAN. MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend a final vote of Item 7-E. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question . I don't disagree with what the Mayor is attempt ing to do. I think walkability and connectivity is a good thing. However , in this specific case, we're going with a bidder -- a company -- now two companies together who has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 bid much higher than the next lowest. So to me in a City that's distress ed, we should always try to go with the lowest bidder. So I cannot -- I agree with the thought . But I cannot vote for this based on the amount of money we're spending in terms of where they stand on their proposal . So I'll be voting against it. ATTY. DEMPSEY : I as well would like to make a comment on this. I had concerns about this from the very beginning basically due to the cost that's involved . And because I had those concerns , I've sat down with the Mayor no less than two times personally and I've spoken to him on the phone no less than two times as well. After speaking with him but also again after using my own independent judgment , I think this is more forward thinking than we think it is. I think it's environment ally conscious what I like. I was speaking to someone at a cocktail party the other night. And he said, Mary, I have four kids between the ages of 20 and 30. And their sole issue for voting in the presidential race is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 the environment . And I think that's important to a lot of people. And I think that this connect ability study will be helpful in that regard. I also think it could be helpful for the economy to the extent that in the event we can connect up Lackawanna out into West Side, down South Washington Avenue into South Side, up near the hospital s, etc., I think student s from the medical school, maybe student s from the colleges will start to live in those further off areas and use their bicycles to ride to these places. So I'm hoping maybe it will induce addition rentals and I'm hoping maybe it will induce further purchases . And with regard to the money, I had said before I think it was either in caucus or sitting up here, Mayor Evans had told me that most of that money is coming from money that was set aside from grant proceed s. I believe it's about 190 or 195,000. But more recently he contacted me and told me that the University of Scranton also entered into a community partner ship with us. And they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 will be giving us $25,000 towards this study. So when I put all of those things together and when I look at this under a totality of the circumstance s approach , I do think it is in the best interest of the City. I think it's forward thinking . I always like to think what could this lead to five or ten years down the line. And I think this will have a very positive impact on the City. And I'm going to be voting in favor of it. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just want to make one more comment . The one thing that confused me about this whole process is the proposal that we'll be voting on is going to cost -- and I realize there is grant money involved here. But it's going to cost $218,000. The lowest proposed was $90,050. So there is a large difference in terms of dollars there. What confuses me is the narrative that was present ed by the administration . They find no distinct cost advantage in recommending the Speck/Isett partnership . All the firms 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 submitting are qualified . So to me, if they're all qualified and there's no distinct cost advantage , then why not go with the lowest bidder? That's one of the reasons -- I agree with what Attorney Dempsey is saying. And I think this is a good project . I still for the life of me can't figure out why they just don't go with the lowest bidder here. And that's the reason I have to vote against this. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Roll call please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Attorney Dempsey . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : No. MS.
