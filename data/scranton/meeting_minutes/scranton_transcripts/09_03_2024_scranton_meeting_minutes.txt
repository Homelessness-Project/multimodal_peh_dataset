MCANDREW : I have a quick one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 So Sunday, September 15th at 4 p.m. at Montage Mountain Road -- I'm sorry, Montage Mountain Resort, there will be an event Raisin' Some Hell for Hoppy. So please come out and show your support for one of Scranton 's bravest . As many of you may already know, our beloved Lieutenant Kelly Hopkins of the Scranton Fire Department is fighting his biggest fire yet. Kelly was diagnose d with stage four throat cancer and since then has started treatment . We all know he would give the shirt off his back to help anyone in need and right now he could use some love. There will be live entertainment , raffles , T-shirts and koozie sales, food and cash bar. Tickets will be $20 at the door, cash only. Hoppy is looking forward to his party and to see everyone that he knows and loves so much. So help us help Hoppy do what he does best and raise some hell for his fight against cancer. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: I would just like to congratulate Chris DeMattio for the Italian 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Festival , extremely well-attended . I was there on I think it was Sunday. I know it was marred a little bit with the fireworks , a few children got burned. Hopefully they could come up with a solution for that next year. But I know that all weekend downtown was filled with people from all over the place. And it was -- I think it was a great weekend for the City of Scranton . So I want to congratulate Chris and his committee for putting on a great Italian Festival . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I'd like to compliment the fire and police DPW departments for the rapid response on Sunday night during that fireworks incident . I'm sure that their actions prevent ed a much more serious incident . That's why we have them at events such as that. And it's not just the Italian Festival . It's porketta heaven. And if you didn't get your porketta , you missed out. Just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 a heads up. September 10th through the 14th, that's next week is the next book sale for the library . Again, it will be at the Marketplace at Steamtown right in front of the Crunch Gym. Books will sell for one to two dollars. It's a real bargain . I checked the website this morning for the city and there's still no union contracts for the police, the fire, and the nonuniform clerical unions. Do we have any updates on the status of those contracts ? MR. SMURL: I do not at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. How about a status on the annual audit? MR. SMURL: Annual audit, at the budget meeting we spoke about the audit. Everything for the city is on track. The only thing that we may be waiting for and they said it wouldn't be long is the audit from the Parking Authority . MS. HODOWANITZ : From the Parking Authority ? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, shame on them. MR. SMURL: Well, it's new this year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 for them. I understand that. But they should have it. And they should have it in time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. We'll check on a weekly basis. MR. SMURL: Theirs doesn't look good. MS. HODOWANITZ : How about a status on the investigation of the personnel files that were left in Dix Court back in March? MR. SMURL: We spoke of that earlier today. And we did not get a response from the administration that I'm aware of. I don't believe , Frank, we had gotten anything back. MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, sir. MR. SMURL: No, so we will reask that question . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, because that's pushing six months now. How about the triple recycling center commingling rate? Have we gotten any successful pushback on that rate increase ? MR. SMURL: I don't know. What I was told was, they're not going to look at it until the end of the year, Recycling Center themselves . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 So I know the administration was meeting with them and also with the county because we were all pretty much in the same boat. So I don't know what the cure is for that if it is not putting glass in or adding a separate day to the recycling having four different pickups a month. I understand what they're saying when you compact glass into the other recyclable s, you can't separate it. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, that certainly came out like a bolt out of the blue. MR. SMURL: Yeah, we were all surprised with that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I saw in the Third Order the capital budget. Do you have a planned date for a public hearing yet for the capital budget? MR. SMURL: I believe that is -- MR. VOLDENBERG : That will be on September 24th. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. What time? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5:45. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 I only glanced at it very shortly . But one thing that really peeks my interest is page eight, City Hall Operations Expansion . We're looking to purchase another building for 1.8 million dollars , you know, be half a million dollars every year just to operate and maintain the facility . My consternation is, you know, now that this is the age of information and everything is going digital , cyber space should allow us to reduce our physical space requirements . But yet we're going to be looking at another building . So I'd like to -- that would be one item I'd like to see discussed when it comes up. And finally , I saw in the paper that Mulfehan 's 2024 Scranton Community Health and Safety Landscape report has been issued to the city. First of all, I request that that report if you have it electronically be added to Third Order for next week. I think everybody in the city should read that report because it's addressed in what they call a holistic approach to crime prevention .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 And we all have skin in this particular game. So, please, if you could put that into Third Order for next week I would appreciate it. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Frank, can you see if we could take care of that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And tonight I'd like two things I'd like to speak about and the one is Serrenti Center. Over the -- how many months Marie has spoken about the Serrenti Center. And it was always -- she was always given the response that it was a training center. And that seemed like a good spot for the firemen , I guess, and the police department training. And I have seen training going on over there. And it's very impressive as you see how they learn to evacuate people and all. However , over the last month it's become a dump pot. It looks like they're putting everything that they don't know what to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 do with in the yard there. The thing that's most disturb ing to me as I go by there are the piles of salt. And I get out the one day and I went up to the fence to look and it's the salt tablets and the pellets that they use in the public pools. We don't have a pool at Nay Aug. So the closest place would be over at down at Weston Park so why they can't find someplace else to put that. And also, all of the outdoor equipment to mow the grass to, you know, just everything is just piled up there. Then the one day they pulled in -- it looked like a little house. I don't know what that's used for. But they have quite a few different garage type houses parked there. If they're for storage , then they should be used for storage and not the salt just hanging out there in the street. So it's very disturbing to me. It's very disturbing to my neighbors as we go along and see what's becoming of that Serrenti Center parking lot. Also with the salt shed that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 propose d to put up there we did get some positive news about that. I did go down to the Poplar Street. And I did look at the salt shed that's down there. It is in need of a repair. It is in need, you know, it's deplorable . I don't know how they're going to get through the winter with the weather going against the salt that's in that container . So there is a need. But I'm sure that the need and the place and I'm glad that it will find someplace else to put it rather than our backyard . So the other thing that I wanted to talk about were the street signs. As I go out and about people -- the residents of Scranton , you know, don't hesitate telling me about the street signs. But this time over the past months this summer, it was very positive the reports that I got. The people were stopping me at the grocery store or if I was out at a meeting or to tell me that, you know, they're very please with what they're seeing with the street signs, is what neighborhood is next. I don't know of what neighborhood is next. I don't know what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the plan is or how they're doing it. But one thing for sure it is being done. And it's being noticed by the citizens of Scranton . So that's a very plus and a positive thing for us as, you know, for so many years we couldn't see where we were and where we were going. A couple people did mention to me about the stop signs. I said, well, you know, I'm not the stop sign lady. But, you know, write a letter, call City Hall, call 311 or whatever and voice your concern . So, you know, thank you for listening to me tonight and that's all I have to say. MR. SMURL: Norma, I could answer for you. For the storage up at the Serrenti Center, all of the stuff at Parks when they took the old structure down at Weston Field, we moved everything up to the Serrenti Center. It's the only secured location we have to put that much equipment . All of the original stuff that you see up there is from various pools that we had in the city that are under construction right now. So there's thousands of dollars worth of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 material . We simply can't throw it out. So that is a temporary storage spot until we get Connell Park back up -- that pool back up and that building . They couldn't do any renovations in that building , nor in Nay Aug's building , the pool house. And I told you we took everything out of there also. So all of that is under construction . They can't have anything in there. So we had to put it somewhere . And that's what that stuff is for. And then all of the Parks and Rec, all of their trailers , their equipment , everything else, they are considering a site right now behind where the Recreation Authority where you're putting that building up behind there, looking at putting one directly behind there for the Parks and Recreation to get them out of the Serrenti Center. MS. JEFFRIES : Couldn't the salt though be neatly stacked up? It's just thrown there. And it seems that the equipment could be put in the back part of, you know, in the back part of that parking lot rather than right up front where it's so visible . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. SMURL: I will ask director -- MS. JEFFRIES : You know, if they could just move it to the back and so it's not so visible as we go up and down that street. MR. SMURL: I will ask Director Gassenmeyer tomorrow if they could do that. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Sure. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Council , let's quit looking at our computers and address this outrageous tax problem that we all share. The majority of property in this city is prewar. A quarter , maybe a third of the city are low income, retired people, seniors . These houses, these properties , always in need of something because of their age. I know there's -- I get all of these letters about water pipes and electric and so forth. But they add a tremendous amount onto your bills because I got it on my water. Our city is just -- these people are just suffering like I am under the tremendous burden of repairs and utilities and insurance . Everything has gone skyrocketed . It's hard to keep a property . I don't know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 what the foreclosure rate is. But I know a couple houses in my area where I walk the dog have been foreclosed on. They went downhill with undesirable people living there. The Zoning Board has just killed the city allowing single houses to be made into two and three apartments . And there's no place to park but sidewalks . And this is being allowed . Nobody considers -- you ought to walk down North Main Avenue with cars going by you a foot or two away 60, 70s miles an hour one after another . Now the street's torn all to pieces with the water company . You know, I mentioned it once. I don't know how many tens of millions of dollars are being spent there. All the pipes, they got tickets inside of them. They're made in Birmingham , Alabama . There's some stuff I don't know what it's called, great big connectors and all, some are made in China and some in Texas and some in Indiana , not a thing that that water company has bought is from Pennsylvania . Why? Somebody was asleep at the switch. I just didn't mean to change the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 subject , but Mr. Biden -- and I don't blame him, he left here and went to Pittsburgh talking to steelworkers without this knowledge . You know, nobody wants to mention I don't know how many of you read the business page, China got a $12,000 EV that can outshine some of the expensive cars on the market right now. They built that in Mexico, it would be the end of the American car market. Nobody's -- not one thing is being done to protect jobs like that. Getting back to the city's tax problems , Janet Evans was the last person I know that really tried to do something about it going to Lackawanna College and they just told her to go to hell. We got a city full of inept employees that need assistance , consultants . This city needs someone to run it like a business because it is a business . It's not a nursery like our Mayor thinks it is. It is a lousy business and it's going downhill terrible under this woman. This is the worst administration and the worst Mayor the city's ever had since its birth. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. SMURL: Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. To Ron's points here today, I think that people need to watch RFK drop out of the presidential race and listen to what he says about the democratic party. And then, you know, open your eyes a little bit and see what's going on in Aurora, Colorado where you call the police and they don't even come because the gangs from Nicaragua are setting up shop in a couple of states. And when the cops come, they'll just shoot them. This is what Joe Biden has brought to America . So, you know, people need to realize that our country is in big trouble . And, you know, they just executed an American in Gaza the other day. They blew the top of his head off. And you take a look at where our country is. And, you know, I'm just an ordinary person. But they're threatening Jewish people in all the colleges . You know, I said something about something called Capos one time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 And when you study history , you find out that the Germans used Jews to police the concentration camps. And they treated fellow Jews worse than the Germans did. And when you see what's happening to our country in elective office and we've got a president -- even a vice president with no platform to run on and just -- it's just ridiculous what's happened to our country because public education collapsed maybe in the 1990s. And we played silly games to believe that American s are education . And it's going to come back to haunt us. But what I want to talk about here today was, this is water that came out of a tap. Now, if you look at it, you could see it's yellow. People are paying for this stuff in Scranton . Now we've got to ask ourselves what can we do to our government to make it responsive to us. Now, the PUC failed because they're just political hacks that are appoint ed. And they allowed the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority ; and, of course, mismanagement of the authority under Council and former Mayors and turning it into what it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 turned into, just an employment agency in the most part for political people. We need a new Home Rule Charter here. We need to change the function of Council because what you do here is almost beyond silly. You borrow and borrow and borrow and mismanage the city. And after a city has reached the point where ours has where the population as Ron just said, you know, they can't pay their taxes. They can't live here. And you're oblivious to that whole problem , you know, borrowing , writing bonds, shuffling papers back and forth, that's not going to change the city. We need to change the way the Council function s. I'm not really sure we need a mayor anymore. We may not need a mayor. We may need a strong council . But the residents of Scranton have to realize one thing, the people that were wasting their time over almost the four decades I've come here were the people that were sitting home. They were wasting their time. And now they can't live in their homes. We talk about the people that were flooded out in the last series of floods. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 talk about, you know, the decay of the city streets and sidewalks and the borrowing and the tax rates. It all comes back to the Council but it can't function and, you know, appointing people to Council or having a majority for the Mayor and a -- or either a majority against the Mayor, that's not the way the charter was designed to function . The inability of a Council to use its power of subpoena and investigative powers to make the life of the residents better doesn't exist here, okay? Something really needs to change. And me personally speaking, I didn't vote for any of these people on Council . It's not a personal thing. I just didn't think you could do your jobs. And I've watched you function over an extend period of time. Forty years is a long time to come somewhere . And I just think that, you know, I appreciate some of the things you say. But, you know what, it's time to really have a come to Jesus moment and realize something . The city is fading. And you just keep -- keep in debt on it and mismanagement . And the Mayor, I really don't think she knows 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 what she's doing. We've gone through so many department heads, it's almost ridiculous . And the people can't take anymore. MR. SMURL: Next, Susan Connors . MS. CONNORS : Oh, shoot, did they both leave? I was going to say something . Oh, all this water is here. Anyway, I'm Suzie Connors from Scranton . I'm here without a -- not a complaint or anything like that. But I was going to say aren't we fortunate that we live in a city, in a state in a country where we could express our views whether they are the same or different from ours. And unfortunately he left, right? Anyway, I'm here to talk about -- you're not supposed to clap. I read the rules. I'm here to talk about an event that's also taking place on September 15th called Tour de Scranton . It's going to be our final noncompetitive bike ride. It's our 20th year. And it's to benefit the Erin Jessica Morgan Drug and Alcohol Treatment Fund. Erin was a resident of our area, a graduate of Scranton High School and a student at Temple University when she met 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 a premature death at the age of 28 due to drug overdose. The Tour de Scranton is held each year in her memory so that young people of our region may live their lives and achieve their dreams by concurring their substance use disorder . The ride, as I said, will be held on September 15th of this year. And the money that is raised has been used to offer scholarships -- high school scholarships in the area to those students who are going onto post high school education and despite the dysfunction in their homes because of drug or alcohol abuse. Erin's fund has provided rent money for candidates who have completed Treatment Court and are moving into a sober home. In addition , Erin's fund has brought inspirational speakers such as Chris Herren -- I don't know if he was a pro basketball player, I believe , for Boston Celtics and brought him into speak a few years -- several years ago at no charge so that others could hear his positive message in overcoming his drug and alcohol addiction . Pledges to Erin's fund help to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 fulfill our mission statement which is the Erin Jessica Morgan Drug and Alcohol Treatment Fund was establish ed to provide charitable gifts to qualified individual s, organization s, and families whose members have been impacted directly or indirectly by their substance use disorder . And as we all know, the drug problem is rampant . In fact, when we started this ride 20 years ago, nobody wanted to talk about it. Everybody said, oh, not me, not my family. Well, anyone who says they're not affected by drug or alcohol abuse somewhere in their family is probably lying or not admitting to it. But if you notice now in obituaries in the paper, people say he or she lost their battle with addiction . And it needs to be addressed . So that's why we have -- as I said, it will be our final year this year. We're all getting -- the committee is getting a little bit older. And so we are -- it will be registration is at 9 a.m. on September 15th. The ride then takes off at 10. There are several different routes. One is only 7 miles 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 which is on the trail, Lackawanna Heritage Trail or you could go to Scranton High to Valley View Elementary School. That's 15 miles. There's one that is 33 miles, goes to Carbondale ; one, 46 miles which goes to Forest City. And then for the real bike enthusiasts of which I am not, 65 mile roundtrip ride. And some of it is quite hilly. So it's for those who are really are bikers and do this -- when I say bikers, I mean bicycles , not motorbikes. And anyone who is interested in registering it's www.tourdescranton , T-O-U-R-D-E-S-C-R-A-N-T-O-N, dot org. And if you register by September 12th, there's a discount on the fee. There is also a walk too on the Heritage Trail that you could register for. And before I finish I also -- I know I think Joan comment ed on the police and the fire. I also want to commend the DPW because they were the ones in charge of cleaning up around the square, it's unbelievable . I know there's still equipment there. There's some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 tables and chairs and there is still some litter. But it looks like there is no way you would know that thousands and thousands of people visited this city over the four-day weekend because they did a phenomenal job of cleaning up. Okay, thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mrs. Connors . That is all that's on our sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . You know, sometimes I wonder with the speeches I hear, you know, you don't hear a lot of other than from law enforcement agencies or anything about the current people serving in Council and Mayor's office. Sometimes I think people just like getting screwed by local guys instead of an outsider . Anyway, there was a hoopla about DeNaples , the Recycling Center. And my recommendation is that we separate the barrels , bottles and glass -- plastic bottles and glass and steel and aluminum cans. Now, probably two or three years ago I called them maybe less; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 and they said that when a glass bottle breaks in a Pak Master it -- glass can -- broken glass can get inside the cans and then it gets crushed up. They have to throw that stuff away. And they have a point there. I mean, he doesn't really like paying people probably 12 or $15 an hour which is a good wage for the amount of steel involved . But, you know, it's really ridiculous that we don't do more recycling . And you would definitely need separate containers . It also was announced that hospitals going off of the for profit rolls and they are going to become tax exempt. That currently probably puts us at 40 percent tax exempt. And what I would like to see is a citizen 's board strictly exclusive from Scranton that sticks to their nitty and starts to try to do something with this by the state. If you people try to do something with it or the Mayor, you're going to get consternation from representatives , state representatives . And it might hurt you more than help you just like the parking garages . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 It wasn't a very big help to default on those although it was portrayed as one. And it was probably a serious mistake. But I will add that Mayor Doherty could have straightened out the Parking Authority and their accounting practices . They were handing out -- handing in requests for a million dollars or 1.5 million dollars at a time. And it wasn't worth the high school senior government class fundraiser class. It really was not. It was -- I could have wrote the same thing myself. And I am not as qualified as an accountant . Fireworks , I had -- I was there and I had wished I had a pair of goggles . But many years I got hit with the papers that they pack them in. And you wouldn't hear any boom boom without those papers. They have to be. Hopefully we could find a solution . It was a disappoint ment. But that's probably better off than having 10 or 15 people there with burnt paper in their eyes and such. Once again on the election , you know, we hear all about gangs and things.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 And I heard on the 4th of July I was suppose d to be at a yard party. And right away that subject came up which I totally disagree with. I don't want 10,000 people at the border every day myself. I have my concerns too. If we get a government in that wants to put the kiboshes to Social Security and freedom of choice and birth control and the works, we're in trouble . We're in trouble if that man makes it back. And as far as Kamala Harris, I'm glad that she was picked because the one thing I thought was Joe Manchin who voted against the Voting Rights Act talking about a mini primary and no thanks, Joe. Stay independent . We don't want you anymore. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Thank you. Anyone else? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . So much to say and so little time. First, I find it amazing the new defined intent of the nepotism clause. As long as you are not the person recommending them even if you are over everyone who reviews them and are in the position to punish anyone who does not give a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 glowing review, it's all fine. Moving on, last session we had a -- last session we had a comment on the removal of the requirement for employees to be residents of the city. Thankfully for Mr. King his reply was in Fifth Order when people could not respond . He said maybe he was wrong on disparate classes because as I pointed out it requires a protected class. So in Fifth Order he said maybe he intended a discriminate d group. A discriminate d group also requires a protect class. Last he stated he could not table it because if they did, on return from the August break it would have to go through a whole three steps again. As far as I know, that's wrong. When an item is tabled, it remains until it gets put back in order. The only time it has to start from page one on a process is when the yearly session expires as no old business carries over. I would expect you were aware of that, Council President King -- oh, my mistake . It just appears that you're still Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 President as whenever a point relating to Robert's Rules pops up such as a motion to amend or table, the current President turns in panic to you for the process as well as your continued role in explaining the Chair's business . Take off the training wheels. Again moving on, last session Mr. Smurl asked a few questions . Council 's attorney did a good job on presenting the facts in a light most favorable to his client. And we'll get back to that. But there is inconsistencies . Mr. Smurl provide d information that others had the same issue. He said it was hundreds . Council 's attorney stated it was three. How did hundreds become three? Council attorney comment ed that Mr. Smurl's LLC was now paid in current as a mea culpa. That was never the issue. The issue was stated -- until it was brought to light by a right-to-know request , no bill was generated . It seems we were told that the system was down in transition . Maybe they did not process or communicate or run a comparison to verify anything . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Nor did Smurl LLC, reconcile the books and discovered uncashed checks. Current now. It does not explain someone needing to do a right to know and you being one of the three. And as usual, no one is accountable . Moving sideways , you conversed on the issue with Council 's attorney prior to it being exposed . Council attorney at your request research ed the issue and brought it before the body. As far as I'm aware, Smurl LLC, is not a city entity and research and legal opinions for specific Council members about non-city business runs afoul of that job title. City Council 's attorney is paid for the people and the people should not be bearing the burden of your legal defense for your LLC. How was it paid? Did it come out of the city budget? Is it quid pro quo? Did he do pro bono work for you? As he has a direct financial interest in keeping the position , that puts the action in a questionable light no matter how you say it was done. But that's right, ethics and words 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 can be ignored when convenient like nepotism that was already stated. I'll finish off by addressing another last session comment , Mr. Smurl stated prior that Council is a legislative branch and administration questions can't be addressed here. And he also said he is not a lawyer and can't define terms. By inference he stated that he is a legislator who makes the law but does not understand what he approves that will he rubber stamp whatever comes down even if he has no clue to the meaning of legislation and he is unwilling to require clarification or definitions . Sadly, the people have no legislative intent to refer back to and that should be primary in a body passing legislation . Have a good evening , gentlemen , and keep stonewalling . MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , resident of the city. I'm going to start where I left off at the last meeting . I was talking about the overlook on 307 and requested that a light be put there admitting that it wasn't going to stop anything 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 but it maybe would slow down the fact that when it was really dark. Now, may I come up with these? MR. SMURL: Can you give them to -- Marie, I remember asking about a camera up there. You want a light up there? MS. SCHUMACHER : I can't -- well, you'd need a light with a camera, yes. MR. SMURL: Okay. I did request -- I sent that to the Chief for the camera. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. I know some of us go by there a lot but not all of you. That's what it looks like today. Would that have made a difference , I don't know. But we need to do something . This is getting crazy. For the people who don't know, I don't know what they're using if they come with a sledgehammer or how they do it. But a lot of the stones that have been there since the 20s are -- some of them have been thrown over the wall. I know that. But something needs to be done. A police -- something just has to be done or that's going to be thrown down the hill too. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Okay, now moving on a lit bit, when is the Nay Aug pool -- is there a schedule for when that is going to start? MR. SMURL: Marie, I have an update on all of the city pools and the park project s. I'll do that in Fifth Order. I'm going to list them all. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. SMURL: Okay? MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. Now, the sidewalks , who is responsible for sidewalks ? MR. SMURL: Well, you're responsible for maintenance of your own sidewalks . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I also put my sidewalks in. It wasn't cheap. I'm on a corner. But do we need -- do people need to each property have sidewalks ? MR. SMURL: I'm sorry, I don't understand your question . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, there are properties that don't have sidewalks at all. MR. SMURL: Oh, yes, I've seen that throughout our neighborhood going up River Street people don't have sidewalks .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MS. SCHUMACHER : Have you considered making that a requirement ? MR. SMURL: I could send that request to Code Enforcement to see if there is an ordinance requiring you to have sidewalks . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I mean, those of us who do have sidewalks , you know, we have to shovel our snow off. And we try to do the best we can. But -- MR. SMURL: Frank, would you -- I don't know if it would be code enforcement or Law Department who would give us that answer. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. I'll also check the ordinances . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I agree with Lee that we need a Home Rule Charter group. Again, if could you put it on -- I guess it's too late for the general election but for next -- for the primary next year, if you could do that, I think it would do us all goodness . And I was somewhat discouraged that our former Mayor was released so quickly from his -- the sentence that he was given, you know, what was it, three years out of the seven year sentence ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. SMURL: I'm not sure, Marie. I didn't follow that at all. MS. SCHUMACHER : Three or four. But it just -- okay, I'm over. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . Dr. Rothchild is coming up on her second term. Is there ever a chance that you could nominate her as the Council President ? I mean, it would be nice to have a female and Dr. Rothchild as the president . Now we could get to business . Are you aware that Villa Capri Cruisers Father's Day Car Show will no longer be held at Nay Aug Park over an extra 5 dollar charge and regarding the ignorant comment by certain board members that they'll be back, they have nowhere else to go? Wrong. It will now be held at McDade Park. That will be their new home after 30 years. Do we have a dollar amount on the cost of the DPW the manpower, the landfill fee, and the overtime salaries regarding the trash removal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 at the LaFesta Italiana this week? And correct me if I'm wrong, but part of the fee covers trash removal because when we were doing the Italian Festival , our fee covered trash removal . And it was previously picked up by a Dunmore trash company ; and, no, not Mr. DeNaples . Will the City of Scranton be reimburse d for the service s? And did they recycle the cardboard or was it trash and everything all mixed together ? Is it common practice for Council members to have keys to Nay Aug Park facilities ? And if not, Mr. Smurl, do you have any keys to any building s at Nay Aug Park? MR. SMURL: I'll have to check my key ring. I'm not sure if they still work. MR. ARGENTA : Council has no standing to personally have keys to the park. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. ARGENTA : I would find that to be a conflict of interest . MR. SMURL: Oh, okay. Good. MR. ARGENTA : I'm not looking to be a wiseguy or have an ignorant comment . I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 just asking you. Why would a Council member -- does Dr. Rothchild have a key? MR. SMURL: I don't know. MR. ARGENTA : Does director Schuster have a key? Does Mr. King have a key? You don't own the park, you and your little crew up there. Maybe that's the reason why we're having a lot of issues up there because you people think you own the park. There's a lot of people that can cut grass just like you can. And there's a lot of people that can do plumbing and could fix the fountains just like you can. I've been in the plumbing business for 30 years. It's our park too. You don't own that park, neither does your buddies and you should not have a key to the park. And if you have one, I'm asking you to return the key. And concerning the salt shed at the DPW garage, there's going to be a new salt shed built off of Capouse Avenue that's under the work now. And return the key, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Not happening . Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Mike Mancini , Scranton . First thing I want to talk about is the cemetery . Over the weekend at the Washburn Street Cemetery we found a bunch of headstones that were deliberate ly thrown over an embankment . The story that I'm hearing is a former owner back in the 90s who was ultimately incarcerated would deliberate ly tip over the stones. If the family did not pay $400, he would throw them over the embankment . We called police and made a report. Also, I would like to thank Councilman Schuster for showing up two weeks ago. There wasn't many of us. But one of the things he did was, you could see a lot of those trees from the road and upon working there he found somebody laid to rest who was a veteran from the Battle of Antigua . It was very nice of you to put a flag there. So this Saturday again from eight until two we're have going to have the cleanup at the Washburn Street Cemetery . And we could use everybody 's help. I want to talk about 817 Crown Avenue. It was brought to my attention that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 somebody set up a mechanic shop there. They were working on cars all over the whole weekend and into the holiday , all hours of the night. That's 817 Crown. I also got a call from a friend of mine, 1600 block of Washburn Street, there is a -- there was work done back in February . And they put the temporary pavement over that on the opposite side of the road, the odd side. So 1600 block, the odd side was just paved. Somebody tripped and fell over the weekend . A friend of mine has been trying to contact PA Water to no avail, so if somebody could check into that I'd appreciate it. August 2nd was First Friday. It was also meet the Mayor day. Apparently she wanted to be there before she went out and took pictures later that evening . So I took it upon myself since everybody here's portion (inaudible ) I took it upon myself to walk in. And to my surprise , I was the only one there. The first 10 minutes I spoke about my son and his passing and the nature of his passing and an 11 year old from Lafayette Street who tragical ly passed away as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 well. And I told her about my displeasure about the current climate . At that point shortly thereafter , Sean McAndrew showed up as well. We talked about the dogs that -- the canines that she refused to take on, $250,000 and include two police pursuit vehicles . It seemed like most of her answers were preprogrammed . We talked about blight and the fact that she's really not -- actually spoken to her about blight and the fact that she's really not from here initially . She didn't grow up in Scranton so she really couldn't see the difference . We talked about the Sewer Authority of the increase of $220 as opposed to 63 because the increase should only be 1.9 percent per year. And I also spoke to her about my displeasure with the roads, the sealing and lack of inspection which are now going to be in the hands of somebody from Luzerne County to take a look at our roads. I also spoke about the SPD testing with Scranton Police Department the way they are being tested. She had a little bit of a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 rude response . She said, Are you doing this for Virgil's son? No, Virgil's son was out in South Carolina during a hurricane . He got called back and he's a brave police officer that should be working in the City of Scranton . I spoke about the homeless , lack of crosswalks throughout the school districts , talked about a curfew. And, you know, I told her it does work in Luzerne County. She mentioned to me that there were 300 properties that she was notified by the county that the city didn't even know that they had. I said to her basically , look, we have eight code enforcement officers and, you know, at that point I'm surprised that they couldn't figure out what properties they were, so the only reason we're looking into it. I was walking away thinking that, you know, she was alone in the woods armed, shooting at anything that moved and taking credit for anything that fell. All right. With this festival we had a lot of roadwork done. It was a fiasco today. We don't have pave cut inspectors . We're down three supervisor s with the DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 superintendent , a Recycling Director and DPW Director . Parks and Recreation is overbudget with only one pool. You know, studies and other things, they don't work here. Consultant s don't work here, okay? You could be any Pat, Chris, or Tom with an H, could sit back and point. It takes a leader to change the city. It takes somebody with a backbone and a winning team, not an expansion team. Good night, Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : One more thing. God bless Hoppy. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS. MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I have some comments . Once again, I know this city is far from perfect . It's -- obviously needs, you know, a lot of things that need to be addressed . I'm not going to deny that. It absolutely does. And quite frankly , anybody can walk around and pick out things that need to be addressed . That being said, before I started 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 here in January of 2022, this city was distressed for 30 years financially . We are no longer distressed . We refinanced a 36 million dollar bond which resulted in 2 million dollars of savings to the residents of city in terms of interest payments . We improved our bond rating from no bond rating to BBB minus to BBB plus bond rating for the city. You know, we're upgrading our parks including Nay Aug, Connell Park, Weston Field, all getting new pools, skate parks, pickleball courts and things like that. And all of those contract s, all those contracts have been awarded. And all of that's happening . We increased code enforcement in the city and trying to address blighted properties . We have been running paving project s over the last few years. City Hall as you could tell is getting upgraded which is one of the most beautiful buildings architecturally in the city. We settled four union contract s. We've upgraded fire and police equipment and technology. And does the Home Rule Charter need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 to be updated, I would be for that, absolutely . But once again, it's not all doom and gloom. We have Tour de France -- or Tour de Scranton with the biking. We have Scranton Half Marathon , Scranton Steamtown Marathon , LaFesta Italian and it goes on and on about all the great things happening in the city. I've seen a ton of restaurant s open in this city that didn't exist a long time ago. And now you could walk around the city. And I'm proud, proud to be a city resident . Is it perfect , absolutely not. Do we have a lot of work to do, absolutely we do. But I believe that this city is a great place to live. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few comment s. So first I would like to thank Miss Kathy Carrera and also Frank Voldenberg . I kept them busy over the month of August, so thank you very much for your research on the proclamation . And, Frank, thank you for fielding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 the e-mails and the addresses and the properties that I sent over during that break. A lot of properties were sent over during the break. And I'll follow up with you via e-mails on each of those that were sent over. One thing I got several phone calls about was the work that's going on North Washington Avenue near Marywood with American Water. So I know we got some of the answers I'd say maybe first, second week of August. But if we could reach out to them and get a solid answer to the work being done and a timeline for a permanent fix. So a lot of the resident s over there are concern ed there's a sewer line running above the ground or above the streets and they'd like to know, you know, what's the timeline on that permanent fix. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. Some things to follow up with since before the break. There was some discussion I had with the Mayor about Keyser Valley, North Scranton meeting getting a meeting with the timeline of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 those project s, also East Scranton stormwater . So if we could reach out to the Mayor to see when that meeting will take place as she -- it was suppose d to take place last week of July, third week of July and then possible August. Now we're into September . So if we could just get a date on that meeting . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. We had a conversation a few weeks prior to August with the Zoning Hearing Board. They came to us with some issues that they were encountering within the last ordinance of 2023. So do we -- does anyone on the Council know where we're at with those conversations ? Do we plan on -- MR. SMURL: I do. Mr. Gattens and he is working with the Zoning Board with their questions . We should have them shortly and their questions and their comparisons of what it was to compare d to what it is now. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that's a conversation we need to continue to have because I know they're coming upon issues that they can't make solid rulings on without an update or at least a black and white -- black 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 and white language in that ordinance , so something we need to do. I'm glad the salt shed was discussed . In this meeting tonight you'll see on the agenda there is a location for salt shed. It's always been stated in every conversation I've had about it it's been stated South Scranton or West Scranton . Over August I got a few phone calls. We receive d a couple e-mails about the salt shed being placed at the Serrenti Center. I think we cleared it up in caucus that this wasn't the case but there was possibly -- the city was measuring the location , checking the location . But we've been told in caucus that's not the case that there is going to be some other locations for that salt shed. I got a -- we got some messages yesterday , 614 Sumner Avenue. This will be probably the only address I'll give you tonight . So 614 North Sumner Avenue, there's trees that are overgrown on the sidewalk that residents cannot walk on the sidewalk . They have to go out onto the road if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 we could send that over. Thank you all for bearing with me. I noticed coming in tonight it was something I discussed prior to August on 7th Avenue exit on McDade Expressway , I see there's more tents. As the leaves are going to start to come down, we're going to see some more of the encampments that we've discussed about at length. Let's see if we could get an update from the Homeless Task Force as to some of our neighboring communities have addressed the issue in their communities . Are we getting an influx of individual s that are coming from other communities that may have cracked down on camping out of doors? And maybe we can get that info from the task force. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Prior to the break I also spoke with Eileen Cipriani about the monument in Providence Square. An automobile crashed into that monument and that monument and is cracked. When I spoke to her before the August break, she said they were reaching out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 to insurance and they were looking to see if insurance could cover it that they were waiting on answer from them. So could we just reach out to Eileen and see if there's any update on the Providence Square. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. And last one I'm going to have is our open position s. I think during public comment tonight some open position s were discuss ed. I know we also had the DPW Director and the OECD Director as well as some of the other coordinator positions . So can we reach out and ask HR Department what open positions we have and any updates on filling those positions ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much and thank you for bearing with me. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 good to be back tonight . I think we enjoyed the time off but it's good to get back -- back to business here. So I wanted to bring up a number of things, some that have come up over that break. And first I just wanted to touch on the Unsheltered Task Force because I haven't received any recent updates or notification s of meeting s. So I did want to inquire with the administration about when another meeting will be held. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And the Novembrino Splash Pad, I know there's been complaint s in the past about it. And I was there a few weeks ago with my daughter . And the pad -- the surface that the splash pad is on is falling apart and crumbling and to the point where she was bringing me pieces of it. And I said, What's this? And then we looked and you could just pick up pieces of it. So I'm really concern ed because that's only a few years old and that shouldn 't be happening already . And I want to know if it's still under warranty and what we could do to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 repair it because a lot of money has gone into that. And the kids should be able to enjoy that without it falling apart and the city looking to put other splash pads in different location s throughout the city, I don't want to see that be a problem with the other ones too. It's really disappointing . And someone came to me with concerns about a lot of open burning happening in their neighborhood . And she wanted a copy of the ordinance that we have. So if you could send that to me and I'll forward it along. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll forward it tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Great. And on the subject of the salt shed, I have been contact ed by neighbors about the potential location would be on Colfax Avenue where the Serrenti Center is located . And the problem being with the current salt shed that DPW has there on Poplar, that's falling apart. We already knew that that needed to be replaced. But it can't be in that location because the DEP said it couldn't with it being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 in a floodplain . So they were looking for a new location . And it's not going to be there at the Serrenti Center. They were looking at that as an option but determined that that's not going to be the case. And so it seems they might have found another better solution and place where it won't be right in the neighborhood . And so I appreciate the neighbors coming forward about that with their concern s that were certainly justifiable . And also, on the utility pavings that previously had a lot of conversations about and continue to receive complaints about specifically on Myrtle but the number of the project s that happened over the summertime with American Water. I know there was suppose d to be a meeting between the administration and American Water a few weeks ago but haven't received any further updates . So I wanted to find out what occurred at that meeting and to my knowledge further work hasn't taken place. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a report on that meeting , Doctor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And I know I sound like a broken record with some of these properties , but it's really the ones that I have just not received any response on it or continue to see issues with and get complaints about. So 429 Prescott Avenue, the property had a fire a number of years ago. And, you know, first the owner was going remodel it and then didn't do anything to it. So then I think it was going to be on the demo list. I don't know what happened there. And there's been a history of squatters being there at the property too. And it's sometimes unsecured which it's unsecured again where the plywood that was on the front door is pulled off. So I don't know if there's squatters there again. But if you could have SPD go to that property as well as code enforcement to make sure it's properly secured . And then I want an answer if it is going to be placed on the demo list or what is happening with this property because this has been a number of years. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 And one of the people who often complain to me about it and lived next door in the apartment building has since moved out of town. I'm sure that didn't help her displeasure with living here in the city. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll contact the police department . And we also have a new blight coordinator demolition specialist and I'll ask that question . DR. ROTHCHILD : Excellent . One other property that was on the demo list and was taken off, 1068 Cottage Avenue, I'd like an update on what's happening with that because it was taken off. The owners finally said that they were going to do something with the property . But to my knowledge , nothing has happened and it's still a mess and a lot of animals going in and out of that property and problems with the neighbor s. So if we can find out what's happening with that one if there's been any tickets issued as of late. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 that's everything that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I got a couple. So I also received complaints and concerns about 614 North Sumner Avenue property with an extreme hedge overgrowth . It's extend over the sidewalk and impairing drivers line-of-sight. To be honest with you, I think I got the same concern last year because when I saw the picture s that I received , it just -- I just, you know, remembered it. So in addition to that, you know, a concerned resident , you know, he's walking his dog and it's very tough because they have to go out onto the road and his dog almost got hit. So this is becoming a huge safety issue. And then also, the DPW with their plowing it presents an issue with for them as well a safety issue. So I know Mr. Schuster brought it up, but I want to address it too. And with that said, also, it was also referenced to this complaint also across the street there's a pod. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 We talked about pods before and, you know, the ordinance and the new zoning. So I guess this pod has been there for five years. We need Code Enforcement to get over and take care of this safety issue. And then secondly , I'm not sure if it's 210 or 212 -- 212 Larch Street. My understanding -- and I got picture s. Mr. Voldenberg , I'll send them to you tomorrow . But it looks like another porch collapse in the making. And the picture s you'll see is there is no spindles on the porch. But they ran some rope in some type of pattern . And the wood surround ing it is -- doesn't look too good. And my understand ing is, you know, there is other issues of blight with regards to this property . And there's rats that are coming to and from this property . So this property is in need of some attention by code enforcement , please. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll send that out. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Finally , so over the course of our recess, a few crossing guards -- school crossing guards have reached out to me. And, you know, we all know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 they are our first line of defense for our kids every day. You know, and they brave the elements every day. And my understanding , I'm getting complaint s that they are receiving verbal abuse and threats from motorist s and parents . So it's a tough job. It's tough to keep them. Their concern is their rate of pay, all right. And it's a little confusing because we've had some dialogue about this. But it's a little confusing . I know that Solicitor Gilbride isn't here. But I initially reached out to him. And I know that we share the expense , the Scranton School District and the city. My understanding is they are trying to find an MOU that the school district prepared at one time. I know there was discussion a couple years ago, you know, looking for an increase in pay. They can't really find the MOU. But my concern is we have to continue with this dialog and communication . The school year already started . And, you know, I know that Mr. Domines ' who does a great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 job for the city sent us a redacted payroll report register ed. But it says rate of pay $20. So to me it looks like the city is saying we pay them $20 an hour and I don't believe that's true. I think the confusion is $20 a day. All right. And they are assuming it's a total hour, half an hour in the morning when they go and half an hour at the end of the day when they go and the students are dropped off. Either way, I know personally driving in the morning on the way to school that these crossing guards, you known, they definitely spend more than half an hour in the morning , all right. You know, they're there beforehand on Main Avenue, North Main Avenue up near Schiff's with that project I'm going to talk about next. It's crazy up there the stop and start of traffic . So their ask is minimum. They want an increase . So my understanding is that it's $10 an hour, okay? So that means $20 a day to brave the elements , to take on abuse and harassment from motorist and some parents 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 and brave the elements for our kids. So I think -- and I know there's some dialogue . I would like to make a motion that we continue to collaborate with the district . I know they're on board too, collaborate with the district and continue dialogue so we could, you know, clarify the amount they make -- no matter what it is in front of me, it's not enough and that we work together and provide these crossing guards some more money. MR. KING: I'll second that motion. MR. SCHUSTER : I would also second that. MR. SMURL: We have a motion and a second to keep our conversation going with the school district and the City of Scranton . On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I know, you know, we had some e-mails that went back and forth. One of the question s I asked was, can the district or city provide us when the last time an increase occurred for the cross guards? I know my recollection goes back to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 2013 or 2014, but when that last increase for the crossing guards took place. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question . I know we're still waiting on the MOU. MR. SCHUSTER : I know you already asked the question . But we're still waiting on the answer. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : And on the question , I'm just afraid if we don't continue this conversation and waiting for bits and pieces of information that the year is going to pass us and it's not going to happen. MR. SMURL: Okay. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : And one more piece, I was talking about North Scranton or North Main Avenue in North Scranton . It's at least two school years that I've witnessed that I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 Pennsylvania American Water is digging up that street. It's atrocious . It's a mind field. And right now they are at Schiff's near Schiff's or Toyota. I'm getting some information maybe it's the city's finishing up the work that the water company did. It doesn't matter. At this point what I would like because at the end of the day, you know, through our ordinance it's curb to curb paving. And that's the responsibility of American Water is doing the work. And I get stopped all the time saying, Mark, what's going on here, like, is this ever going to end? So for, you know, if you could reach out to American Water and ask them, you know, a timeline like, you know, and even something -- an estimate when they'll be done. When this road will be repaired finally . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Just to add a little bit onto that. Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I mean, I think the next step would be to reach 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 out to them to see if they could come in for caucus. We have several projects that are going on right now that North Washington Avenue project , the Myrtle Street project and the project that Mr. McAndrew 's talking about. And if we can't get some kind of answer, maybe we could have them come in for a caucus. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to Mr. Oscellinski and bring them in. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a lot of requests that we received over the month. I won't go through every one of them. I'll just give the 500 block of Front Street, rear of 521 North Irving, East Mountain Road and Hiller Avenue, one-way sign on Main Avenue and the Express way, 8 of Quincy, 5 of Prospect and on and on. We did not forget any of these. Mr. Voldenberg has all of these and everyone else's into the proper department s. So we will get all of those answers hopefully by next week and be able to update everybody on their question s.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 Before we had left for break we were discussing the crosswalks being painted by the school and ask if the schools would be a priority and they were. There were a few intersection s that were not completed , one by Robert Morris Elementary School, intersection of Boulevard and Columbia . And that is because that street is going to have a utility cut. And there's another one on Penn Avenue, St. Clare's, St. Paul's, Wyoming and Green Ridge. That also -- just one of those crosswalks wasn't done. That's also because of a pave cut. And Scranton High School, seven out of nine of the crosswalk s were done over. That's taking a little longer than normal because we have to have flagger s there. We have to have the police there. And then we have to coordinate our DPW there to also do the painting itself. So that's taking a little bit longer but it will be done. And also Lincoln Jackson Academy , they have two crosswalks pending for that school. The update that I'm going to give you is on all of our city parks project s that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 we have so we could finally get this cleared up and telling you what is on and what is not happening. As of right now, we have over 16 million dollars invested in our city parks, Weston Field Skate Park, its current budget $950,000. This was won by Artisan Skateparks won the project . They will be in contact or they have been with Bazaar skateshop in Scranton . They also plan to have two public meeting s in the area. And they will unveil all of their ideas at these meeting s. And then the second meeting will be to show changes in any of their plans or their designs depending on what they come up with the criticisms or the changes that the neighbors or the skaters would want to have. They also have a entire 3D design concept made up. But that will be -- they will bring that out with the first meeting when they meet with everybody . So that's the skate pool. Weston pool, that -- it was engineering firm was BKP. It was $3,600,000 was budgeted . The budget process 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 was won by D&M Construction over Opengov procurement . And their current contract that they have is $3,193,000. They did apply for all of the performance bonds and payment s that are required with the city as well as all their permitting . So that pool is starting now. Capouse Avenue splash pad, that was designed by McLane Associates , $500,000 was budgeted for the playground . One million dollars was budgeted from the ARPA funds for the splash pad. The City has procured the splash pad and all of the equipment for that project and also the playground equipment . So that project is going out for bid. I believe it is this week. The Connell pool and the fencing project up at Connell Park, that project was $1,025,000 was budgeted for that. D&M Construction is the contractor on that pool. And All State Fencing is the vendor for the fencing . That construction is ongoing now. So the Robinson Park, that is a design by Tom McLane. The budget was $963,354. Half of this was funded by ARPA and half was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 funded by DCNR. Chilewski was the contractor . The trail layout is done. Some of the extra stone and placement of stone up there was added for controlling some of the stormwater roll off. The basketball hoops and courts were all up there. All the equipment has arrived . So that should be within the next week or two up and running . The city did also procure a fishing dock and a kayak launch to be put at the lake. And that will also be added. Oakmont Park, Chilewski is the contractor . The bid was $215,296 was obligated through ARPA. And $193,245 of that has been disbursed ; $332,200 was also budgeted through a grant match; $226,925 of that also has been disbursed . And that park is open. Weston pool rehab project , bids were received this week. And it will be funded by CDBG and DCNR. The current budget for that is $396,104. The playground equipment was purchased from General Recreation via cooperative purchasing through COSTARS. So that equipment has already been purchased . Nay Aug pool, which has been started 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 if you went by you could see that. BKP is the engineering firm. It was funded by -- budgeted with ARPA, LSA grants and city grant match, $4,567,741. ARPA was 3 million , LSA was a million and the city's grant match was 567,741. Multiscape is the contractor up there working now. The city has received all of the proper documents from them, all of their permits and all of the proper paperwork has been submitted . And, of course, their performance bonds are included in that. So as of August 22nd, Multiscape has started . They've started with the fencing the work there and I've seen they were doing some other work up there right now. Multiscape is expected to complete most of the sidewalk before the cold weather hits. And once that does, they will cease work until the warmer months come back. And then they'll finish the final parts during the spring and they hope to have a functional site to be open by the summer of 2025. Nay Aug Park multicourts, engineered by Reilly Associates . An RACP and the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 grant match fund was $600,000 each for a total of $1,100,000. Billy Barrett Park, that is being paved. The entire project was $186,200. And that is currently under construction . The Butterfly Park up at Nay Aug Park, this was originally started by Bob Gattens , the Chairperson for the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority . And they have been working on this for a few years now. I'm glad to see this has finally gotten up off the ground. The project will be for a -- basically a handicap playground at Nay Aug Park, but accessible to all. The design services were bid out and won by Barry Isett, $48,000. The playground equipment bought from Recreation Resource . They will be doing the delivery and start the installation . That is scheduled for late September . And the rest of that project for all of the other part is currently out for bid for completion of that. So that is great to see that playground . And also, the playground what really they wanted to do up there and the Recreation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Authority wanted to do was do a huge project up there. But when you find that one swing can cost $65,000 for a handicap swing, you'll understand why we had to cut the project back. And it will be going to go now into three stages and hopefully each year forward they will add the next stage to that. But that is in the works. Novembrino playground upgrade is complete d and open. Connors Park, that was all done over. That is completed . And that is also over. The mini park behind Engine 8, that was upgraded . And all that playground is completed . All of those are open. And, Frank, I will give you this. And you will be able to add this into next week. MR. VOLDENBERG : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: If anyone wants to see that. So with that, with all the parks pretty much being well underway , I realize there is much more work to do and to complete all of these project s and will continue to work with the administration to keep moving on parks and recreation for our kids. But now I would like to go start 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 addressing a different problem we have which is abandoned homes and blighted properties . So I'll explain what we do now is when we get a call for abandon ed or blighted properties we will send code enforcement out to inspect them. So if they are issued a ticket and no response to it, then that will turn into a citation . And then if no one shows up or answers to that which is -- seems to be pretty common, then that will then go to a magistrate and basically wind up as a warrant . And then the magistrate will have a hearing for it and normally no one shows up for these and it just seems to have died there. So we see these blighted properties and overgrown areas, it is -- there's multiple reasons . A lot of properties were purchased by investor s that said they were going to be building in the future. Most of the time nothing happens with these properties . They just remain untouched for many years and become blighted . Some of the properties though do belong to city resident s and taxpayers . And some inherit these problem s and really a lot of people do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 not have the money to invest back into these properties , elderly people and stuff that these things that are left to them. Therein lies another problem which again, they turn into blighted properties . So I requested a meeting this -- we had it this morning with Mayor Cognetti and Eileen Cipriani and Attorney Cutillo . I had asked the administration if they would look into when I researched something that we would be able to do for abandoned and blighted properties is take these properties into what's a conservatorship . That is if you look at PA Act 135, this basically allows individuals or entities such as the City of Scranton to take these properties and -- into conservatorship and pretty much either figure out what we're going to do if we're going to clean -- if we're going to try to sell these to neighbors or if we get groups of contractors , some other way that we could start revitaliz ing all of these properties that are just laying idle right now. So we're hoping to find develop ers -- well, I am and develop a plan to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 get back into our neighborhood . So but I do believe that if we notify someone that we are actually taking possession of their properties instead of sending them citation s or whatever else we do that they pretty much ignore it. I believe this may get -- may get their attention . I know if somebody called me and said they were going to be taking a property , I think I would be a little more concerned over that than $100 citation . So as I went to the meeting , Attorney Cutillo also provided me with what he has been working on on the blight issues and dealing with blight in the city. So I'm proposing potential legislation , potential funding ; and there is a lot of other things. There's a lot of things that we have to do before we can go and just take properties off of people. I realize this is the beginning and it is going to be a long process . But, of course, I'm ready and Council and we will do whatever we have to do to support this so that we could eventually start to take these properties back or at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 get the people to move forward on cleaning them and maybe getting back on the tax rolls. And that is all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – APPROVING AND ACCEPTING THE CITY OF SCRANTON CAPITAL BUDGET, WHICH INCLUDES A CAPITAL RESERVE FUND SPENDING PLAN, FOR THE YEAR 2025 PURSUANT TO SECTION 904 OF THE CITY’S HOME RULE CHARTER AND FILE OF COUNCIL NO. 11 OF 2024. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: Second. MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , we said the hearing for this will be on the 24th of September . MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. I do have some questions on this but I will ask them later. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , so, I mean, this is my fourth capital 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 budget that was present ed to us. And I think three out of the four years, maybe four the Mayor's put in plans to purchase another building or expand City Hall. I'm against it. I was against it then. I'm against it now. You know, and the rumor was the place next door. Fidelity can't, you know, straighten out their own business because they're -- you know, they were trying to move. But either way, you know, buying a building next door if that's the intent taking it off the tax rolls and space that I don't believe that's needed. And we are putting a ton of money into refurbishing this beautiful building which I think is adequate for the services that are provided . So I'll vote to push this through -- or not push it through but to move it. But every year it's in there and I don't like it. And I still don't like the fact that piece is in there about expanding City Hall. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , yeah, I'll move to introduce it. And obviously we'll need more discussion on it. I look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 forward to the caucus that we'll have about the budget where we could ask additional questions . I do appreciate some of the changes that were made this year to the layout of it and how I feel like it's more thought ful for what's included for future years in the budget and, you know, where all of the money would be coming from whether it be grants. And I think that it just looks different , more readable , and understanding and helpful for the future -- future budgets with the changes that have been made -- made this year. MR. SMURL: Thank you. I also just a comment on our capital budget and capital reserved spending plan. First, I want to say thank you to Matt Domines ' and Eileen Cipriani for redoing and redesigning and doing the layout of the capital budget and the capital reserve spending plan. It is a brand new layout. It's much easier to follow than the previous ones were. The first columns kind of describe the department it's for or the project and then it goes into amount of years it's going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 financed for. And it also gives funding sources and also the project descriptions which if you looked at last year's, none of that really had any kind of order. So I know Matt Domines ' really did a lot of work on this. So I believe we have a lot of work done there by Matt and we do appreciate it. And right now I believe we have over 3 million dollars funded so far. And this evening in Fifth Order we are also looking at transfer ring another 2 million dollars from interest from the ARPA money into this capital budget. So this is just a -- just shows you another great job by done by Matt Domines ' our Finance Director . And I'm glad he stayed. Anyone else on the question ?
