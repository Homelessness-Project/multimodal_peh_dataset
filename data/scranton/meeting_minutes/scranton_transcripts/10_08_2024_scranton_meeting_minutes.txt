CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON OCTOBER 7, 2024 REGARDING UPDATED PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX COLLECTIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I do. We receive d a correspondence today Gifts For Kids. So this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 is -- it's from the Catherine McAuley Center. A partnership , the Catherine McAuley Center, Catholic Social Services and Friends of the Poor connecting the community with those in need to provide holiday gifts for children in Lackawanna County. All recipients must be preregister ed. There's an online registration link which will be shared on Tuesday , October 15th at 10 a.m. on the agency's Facebook page -- that would be the Catherine McAuley Center Facebook page, I believe . To be eligible , families must live in Lackawanna County. They have a household income under 200 percent of the federal poverty level and have children under the age of 18. Families must be able to pick up gifts on December 15th or 16th in Scranton . Toy donations are also being accepted Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 430 Pittston Avenue in Scranton . And that's the Catherine McAuley Center. Also, I'd like to announce as I did last week, the Steamtown Marathon is scheduled for this Sunday, October 13th. It starts at 8 a.m. in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Forest City -- Forest City Regional High School. Early in the morning Biden Street will be closed -- I mean it's really early so nobody should really be up, like, from 5 a.m. until about 7 a.m. The buses will be lined up to take the runners up to Forest City. And then the race will begin at 8 a.m. I expect the first runner to arrive in Scranton somewhere around 9:45. So between 9:45 and roughly 1:30, 2 in the afternoon , runners will be coming from -- basically from the Throop line in Scranton through Green Ridge and work their way right into North Washington Avenue to the finish line in front of the Lackawanna County Courthouse . So I just ask people to be a little patient with us. As there is gaps in the race, we try to feed traffic across the race course. But we're excited . We have over 1,050 runners from 36 states, 9 countries . So it's pretty exciting . So we're looking forward to a great race. And as always, it benefit s St. Joseph's Center. To date we are completely volunteer . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 We have no paid staff. We have all been volunteers for 27 years. And we've raised over 2.4 million dollars for St. Joseph's Center. And hopefully I know we've had an economic impact on our region too bringing these runners in from all over the country . So we're excited about it. We just ask the residents to please be a little bit patient on Sunday morning and early Sunday afternoon . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I wanted to add that for the Gifts for Kids, we do also have the information on that available in Spanish . So if anyone needs that or wants to hand it out to any Spanish speaking families that would benefit from it, just let us know. We could get that handout to you. And then I also wanted to congratulate the Greenhouse Project on another successful Honey Bee and Harvest Festival that took place over the weekend . I've been absent from here and not able to attend a lot of things recently because of illness . But there are a lot of great things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that I missed out on. We had the Scranton Fringe Festival that just ended. But I was able to make it to the Harvest Festival . And it's just really a wonderful day. I think it gets bigger and bigger every year. And it was a beautiful day for it. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Anybody else? MR. MCANDREW : I have two trunk or treat announcements that are coming up. One is called Giving Back to the Community . It's the third annual trunk or treat event and it's at Nay Aug Park. It's Saturday , October 19th from 12 to 4. There's a rain date Saturday , October 25th. And they are having a contest for the best decorated trunk. You know, they need some sponsors, candy, trunkers and volunteers are needed. And for more information with regards to that, you could go on giving back to the community five at Gmail dot com. And then the second one will be the local DPW workers , you know, and they do this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 every year, the past couple years and they do a great job. And their Trunk or Treat this year will be Saturday . It's usually during the week. But this year it's on a Saturday , October 26th from 3:30 to 6. And it will be again at the Scranton DPW parking lot over on 101 West Poplar Street. And they'll have a bunch of their equipment out, the trucks and heavy equipment will be on display which is pretty cool. So that's a nice one to attend. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: And first, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I have here in my arthritic hands the current collective bargaining agreement for the firefighters . It was signed on September 24th and posted on the City's website yesterday . So at least we have the firefighters ' agreement posted online. Still waiting -- this is only took 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 18 months by the way since when it was signed by the arbitrator and he made his decision . So now we have to see when we are going to get the police collective bargaining agreement . That was signed on July 28th, 2023. So it's been over a year for that. MR. SMURL: Joan, that is also on there. All of those lines, they're not really -- you can't really understand . There's a lot of numbers and stuff. But if you go back on that file and the police department and the FOP arbitration awards with all of the changes , they are all there. MS. HODOWANITZ : Where are they because I checked this afternoon . I didn't see the police department 's -- MR. SMURL: Yeah, they're there. There's like nine rows of things. I don't know which way you went to them. MS. HODOWANITZ : I went under the city archives under collective bargaining agreements . MR. SMURL: Okay, so if you go down, not the first column, the second row down, the second one in, that is where -- I'll show you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 where they're at. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, at the end of the meeting . MR. SMURL: They are going to make them more legible so that you could actually know what it is. Right now there's a bunch of numbers and stuff to match all of the stuff. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, there was only one that was posted in 2024 and that's this one, the firefighters . MR. SMURL: Okay. But the DPW is there. The CBA contract is there. And the old clerical union contract is there. The new one is not. MS. HODOWANITZ : What about the police? MR. SMURL: The police is -- the police is there with the arbitration awards and a lot of the changes . Now, they said that -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I want the retyped document . I have the -- I have the arbitration award. That was posted a long time ago in July of 2023. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : What we need is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 fully typed document . MR. SMURL: Okay. I'll show you how to get to that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. How are we doing on the audit? MR. SMURL: The audit, we are still -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Parking Authority ? MR. SMURL: This week we should have the Parking Authority . And then the administration will need two weeks to finish and then it will be done. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. How are we doing on the Dix Court investigation ? MR. SMURL: The Dix Court investigation , so the information I'm going to give you you're not going to like it. But I'm still going to give it to you. The city will not be releasing any information to the public about the incident . The insurance company that was -- dealt with this is satisfied with the changes that were made that were recommended . And they were happy with everything else that had taken place as far as shredders being implemented and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 stuff. So that is where it's left right now. MS. HODOWANITZ : I think -- I don't find that acceptable . I was here the night that Tom Coyne was given his document and virtually accused of some misconduct . And I think that the ball is in the city's court to explain what happened and to tell the public because it's not just employee s that were involved . There were names of next of kin and everything else who were not employees . So it affects the general public and I think that's a mistake . And I hope that -- I hope, Tom, you don't let it drop. 5-C, the appointment of Megan Alpert to the Scranton Housing Authority , she did not post a resume. All she has is a letter of intent. Does anybody know who this woman is? I don't. MR. KING: Megan Alpert? MS. HODOWANITZ : Yep. MR. KING: I know her. She lives in the Hill Section . Her maiden name was Megan McDonough . MS. HODOWANITZ : All she said in her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 letter -- MR. KING: She just opened a business , Joan, downtown here financial investor . MS. HODOWANITZ : She still should post a resume, should she not? MR. KING: Right. No, you asked if anyone knew her. I was just telling you I did know her. MR. VOLDENBERG : Excuse me, Joan, Joan, we do have a resume. And it was to be updated . I believe it's updated on the website now. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. I would like to see something about her background . She said that she's got a strong network of professional education and qualifications and relevant work experience . MR. VOLDENBERG : Yeah, it should be on the website now. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. 6-A, loaning the refuse truck to the school district , what is the term of the loan? I looked at the document -- MR. SMURL: The original request , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Joan, was like for 30 days. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, because all it says in the document is original term shall commence on the commence ment date. MR. SMURL: Yeah, and if it's required if both parties agree to extend it for a few more days if their truck doesn't arrive. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we get the term of that loan? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is that I really appreciate the fact that Donald Trump is coming here. And I hope that in the election he manages to win the city and set a new tempo for us because we definitely need a wind of change to come through here. But, you know, I think the residents should consider a couple of things because we're going to have a mayoral election relatively soon and some Council seats are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 going to be vacated here -- well, they're going to be up for reelection . And this city definitely needs to change direction . Something has to be done with American Water. And maybe it's time for the city to consider using eminent domain to get control of the water company and the Sewer Authority again and let the courts set a value on both and let the city float some bonds and get control of these two entities because the water quality is absolutely terrible . And people can't afford to live here with the rates as they are. And what brought us here was political corruption and a very corrupt mayor and a very corrupt council in my opinion pushed this deal through . And it's been a detriment to the resident s and something has to be done. And we can't rely on the PUC to bail us out because that's not going to happen. And just the way the city is going, we definitely have to do something about all the grant money floating through here, all the non-profits . We need a rewrite of the Home Rule Charter . We need to decide what kind of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 government we really need and want. And this is a complete failure . We have to decide what we're going to do with the city's pensions . Should we turn them over to the state or shouldn 't we because I really can't see how 75,000 people are going to carry all of this burden. We've got to enter into some kind of idea of what reality is because we're definitely not facing that now as the city just disappears . As you walk around this city and you go into the downtown , we have a ton of vacant lots. We have a lot of vacant lots throughout the whole city and we have no real economic development because the Council hasn't chosen to do that. And, you know what, there was a conversation taking place in here when I -- before the Council came here and there was some comments about, you know, Mr. Gaughan saying that the people in Scranton aren't very intelligent. That's the -- that's what I took from the conversation and I could be incorrect on that. But, you know what, he's absolutely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 right. We went through 30 years of distress and we haven't restructured our government . And we pass grant money around as if it's candy. And the people who really need the grant money never get any. It's really amazing . We keep electing people that are allegedly going to turn this city around. But we keep just slipping further and further behind. And when we sold the Sewer Authority , it should have been, all the lights should have came on because the PUC never should have allowed that. And when you see the quality of the water we're forced to drink and the antiquate d filtration system that we have and we have to look at our elected official s and say what are you doing to help us? Nothing. A city cannot sustain itself unless families can afford to live here. And if they can't afford to buy water and drink water, how are you going to convince people that they have a future here. And if you don't have economic development and a business incubator trying to create jobs that will sustain a family -- I mean, all the silliness about moving all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 grant money and, you know, the University of Scranton up on the hill and all the colleges , you know, we appreciate them being here but somebody 's got to take some of the burden off us. And when you take a look at how you've handled all the flooding we've had recently and for decades all that work had to be done and it wasn't done. And then you get the residents who put signs up about restoring the pride. And the biggest looter of the city was Chris Doherty , what he did to the city's pension s are just beyond belief when he took them off Mellon Bank. And the Council let it happen. And they've let a lot of things happen here. We've got to abolish all of these authorities , they have to go. And we have to collect all the debt they have. And we have to figure out what we're going to do with it. But you know what that takes, leadership . And we don't have any. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Bob Bolus, Scranton . What I'd like to do is kind of bring everybody up to speed on something here. Our location in Throop is now the official distribution center for the northeast for the hurricane relief that's going on in North Carolina and right now in Florida . We're asking everybody to if you have anything to contact my office. It's 570-346-7659. It's Bolus Truck Parts. We're accepting all kinds of donations . But don't bring us your used clothing . It's got to be new and in packages or we will reject it. Non-perishables , take anything you have, diapers , anything of that nature; but it all must be new and in packages . We've already just sent two trailers that I loaded up out of Albany, New York that have gone into North Carolina . I have three sitting to go to Florida down Anna Maria Island where I have a condo complex and I have a commercial business down there. And that's going to be the central distribution center for Anna Maria Island, Holmes Beach where our location is, Bradenton Beach, Coquina , and Long Boat Key. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I have properties on Bradenton Beach that I hope are standing after this hurricane hits. I'm right on the Gulf, 82 feet to the water. We already took one hit and I figured this one is going to wipe us all out. The island looks like a bomb shelter . It's been wiped right out. And prayers go out to everybody that's on the island for what they've lost because insurance doesn't cover 95 percent of what's going on down there. So a lot of people are going to be hurt on it. And this being the food that we're shipping that I'm donating is being donated by myself Bob Bolus (inaudible ) and truckers are the ones that are hauling it. But a lot of the products that we are donating , the wipes and things are by myself and my fellow masons that are all here in the Scranton consistory and the shrine that I'm a member of. So what we're trying to do is take care of that. Now, last week had I had an issue with Gaughan over at the Government building where he had a sheriff grab my shoulder . He didn't like what I had to respond to his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 accusation s and some woman in front of me made a smart comment . She turned around and she engaged me. I had nothing to do with her. And I just basically told her it was none of her business . And she didn't like my shirt that I was wearing . And I told her that's your next president . And I went and sat down. He ordered the sheriff to remove me from the meeting which he physically manhandled my left shoulder where I just had surgeries and this stuff on. And I already had to go for medical treatment and everything else regarding it. And it's insulting that somebody could think that they are above all of us. You know, I haven't seen any of you guys try to do anything , nonsense . You let us speak. You let us do what we got to do. And for a sheriff to grab me without authorization from Gaughan , he's not the sheriff . He's not an authority . And there's going to be an issue over it. They made an issue of the trailer I parked out front. And Chris Sherman -- not Chris Sherman , but Chris Kelly kept making a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 comment it was the Trump trailer , Trump trailer . It was Gaughan 's former skunk trailer with his head on the body of a skunk. He skunked us when he was sitting here. And now he's skunking everybody thinking he was a lot smarter and brighter than anybody that came in the room. And I challenged him on -- he never was an employer like some of us are and know what it is to make a payroll . But he made the insult that a bunch of the people are pretty much stupid. And I made the comment to him that in the past I would say respect is earned but not demanded. In this case since he's boasting how brilliant he is, I said respect is learned and not demanded. And he didn't learn any of that. So what he pulled the curb out front, Jeffers made comments that I blocked it with the trailer . I have a handicap sticker . I have the government sticker . And I'm a veteran . So three out of the four with the CYS parking space blocked partially by the back of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 trailer . You could walk around or move the sheriff 's car out of there or anybody else blocking it. But the irony is there is not a curb cut. It's almost an 8 inch high curb that's out there. You can't get over it with a wheelchair . You can't do any of that. If you want to take a wheelchair and go all the way down Wyoming to Spruce where the handicap ramp or access is. So they're shooting their mouth off I blocked the handicap area for veteran s or anybody else. And the ignorance part is they need to cut a curb cut and put a ramp there. Don't say I blocked the bus stop because I wasn't near anywhere in the bus stop. So this is the ignorance that we're dealing with on a daily basis. But if you're going to take care of our handicap and our veterans , then my message to Gaughan with his mouth is to go out there and put a new curb cut in that a wheelchair can be accessible and don't let anybody park near the darn thing at all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Bolus.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. BOLUS: One more thing I may say if I can, I'm proud to say I'm wearing a Trump shirt. He was saved by Jesus Christ. I put on there divine intervention . And he's coming to our town. And we need to respect that a former president or the future president still respect s all of us even though we're a liberal democrat you won't see the Mayor or any of the others guys there. But I'm proud to say we're American s and thank you guys for listening . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. BOLUS: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . People many, many years ago Danny Ellman told me never put nothing in print you don't want to come back and haunt you. That should go double for some as Chris Kelly. Maybe he needs to watch television and see what happens all the time with these people reading computers . Mr. Nice is nothing more than an over the hill has-been. Bob Bolus is an American . Kelly support the paper in articles of Dominick Sudotti {phonetic } is to -- Sudotti is a despicable pro Hamas, anti-Israeli 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 anti-Jewish. He's just a racist. And Kelly brags about his friendship with him and then tries to demean this man that has done more in one night than Kelly has for this city in these articles one after another . Well, in my opinion Kelly is a disgrace to the paper and the city. Next is about this excuse for a Mayor. I just hope that she doesn't have another disgraceful encounter turning her back on Mr. Trump like she did last time. She's suppose d to represent the city, not the democratic party. And the last two Fridays of the paper, there were scores foreclosures . These are so heartbreaking . I've talked to several people over the years. And these people have lost their most -- I don't know, I guess the most precious accomplishment and possession of their lives in losing your home. And yet, there's big article s we need money for signs for downtown . This incompassionate excuse for a Mayor has got to go. It's time you people start thinking of a replacement next year. Looking at these signs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 for the city, she intends to be here. You know, we're facing, what, all of this new taxation from reassessment , the county, the city, the schools . And this woman is interested in expensive signs for downtown . Now, I got a little something for you people. Start thinking what the city is going to do if some of these developers want to go nonprofit . And it's being investigated by someone . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for our sign-in sheet. Anyone else like to address Council ? Sir, your name and address . MR. DIAZ: Gideon Diaz, Captain Drexel House, University of Scranton . Yes, I was going to talk -- one of them was -- brought up really good points. Like, the guy was talking about eminent domain and investments and stuff like that. So just riding off of what he talked about, like, on Sunday just to start off I was -- I went on a walk with, like, this organization called the Greenhouse . You guys brought it up too. And we went to the festival . And then on the way there all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 sidewalks were awful, like, very awful. And also sometimes when I ride my electric scooter , like, sometimes, like, I'm scared of just dying. With that aside, just little investments like he was talking about the empty lot, just little investments could go a long way. And the way that, like, things are looking over here, like it's just stuck. You know, it's not going up or down. And you need to invest, invest and just little investments like the sidewalks , empty lots will bring the money back into the community and then bring money back into everybody 's pockets in a way that everybody can flourish hopefully if it plays out like that. But things are looking very stuck. And even just like sidewalks , little kids can't operate on the sidewalk . Old people can't operate on the sidewalk , you know, so that's pretty much it. Thank you. Investments . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. CZARKOWSKI : Hello, Joseph Czarkowski , Tripp Street in Dunmore . So I was at the Italian Festival a couple weeks ago. A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 firework had landed in my child's stroller burning his clothes , his stroller . So I went to request some information from the right-to-know law. In regards to that, I requested the permit that was pulled regarding the fireworks itself. And I got a response stating that I would need to wait at least 30 days -- or 30 days are require d to get this permit, which I found very strange that you would need to take 30 days to get information that is electronically submitted to you guys. So I did do a submit for the fireworks that were shot off on July 3rd which I immediately receive d a response within two days of the entire permit. So now I received the permit for the original request for the Italian Festival . That is a total of two pages. The permit that you -- or the information that you guys sent through the right-to-know request from the July 3rd is a total of 14 pages. So then I'm looking at this right-to-know request and in the information that you guys sent me through the City Hall, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the permit was issued on 9/3. So the fireworks and the event that this happened was on 9/1. So it's kind of questionable how you guys, like, allow this to be -- to go off. MR. KING: If I could just clarify , it's not us guys. The city administration would be the ones that -- MR. CZARKOWSKI : So city administration , so city administration allowed this to happen, allowed this event to happen without a permit being pulled, which is against 2022 Act 74 right under Chapter 11 states that the city needs to have a permit pulled along with verifying insurance . So also when I received the right-to-know request in the permit itself it needs to have the insurance information . The insurance information was not in that permit request . All right. So then I did go ahead and request the insurance information as another right-to-know request under that specific date. And what I received was an actual insurance policy from an event that happened 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 six months ago, not even the right date. So I think we -- I would like to know why I'm getting misinformation and why a permit was not pulled for this event. MR. SMURL: Well, sir, we won't have any of that information . We are not any way connect ed with the daily operation of the city. That would be our Licensing and Inspection department . Maybe if you went there and asked for the supervisor , maybe they could get that straightened out for you. We don't have any of that and nor do we have any access to any of that. MR. CZARKOWSKI : Okay, what about the safety of the event itself; do you know what I mean? So before the fireworks even went off, the Scranton Police stated that they weren't sure if the fireworks were going to go off due to the wind. They still allowed them to go off. The fire department was there. They didn't put a halt to them. The only reason why a halt got put off is because my kid got hurt and another child got hurt. Why was it allowed to happen? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. SCHUSTER : Sir, can you also leave your information with Alison there? MR. SMURL: Yeah, I don't have an answer of why it happened . We don't run any of that. So that I would suggest to go back to Licensing and Inspection . They have all that information . And perhaps , sometimes people file for permit -- I know myself if we put a permit in, it may not -- depending on how busy that department is and people are off and it may take a few days to get it back. So but if you're in and your permit is in on time, then it's considered . MR. CZARKOWSKI : The inspection , it states that when -- it needs to be inspected also before they allow the permit. The inspection wasn't done until two days afterwards . MR. SMURL: Yeah, again, maybe Licensing and Inspection could help you with that. MR. CZARKOWSKI : They told me to pull a right-to-know request and that's what I did and I'm not receiving the accurate information regarding this request .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. MCANDREW : I'm very sorry to hear what happened to your child. What happened that night was horrible and horrific . I get it. As our body, I mean, we could inquire somewhat . And it's unfortunate that you are hitting , you know, hitting some walls here. But for you to receive an insurance policy of another event that was six months prior, that's alarming to me. MR. CZARKOWSKI : I'll leave all of this information here and you guys could go through it. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, please leave your name and number and, you know, we'll see what we could do. MR. CZARKOWSKI : Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : Now, are you still waiting ? Are you still within that 30-day period for that other information or are we outside of that 30 days right now? MR. CZARKOWSKI : No, I just received that information today. But it's only, like I said, two pages compare d to 14 page from the one prior. So it seems like a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 information is being redacted . Even -- even stuff that I have in a police report that -- the information that I have in the police report is redacted on the right-to-know request . But, like I said, I then put a second right-to-know request for the insurance information and I received the wrong one. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, if you could please leave your information there; and if you want to leave that information as well. MR. SMURL: Frank, with that information , will you follow up with Licensing and Inspection and see what they could do with any of that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. CZARKOWSKI : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? Mr. MCGOVERN : Hello, Council , Daniel McGovern, resident New York Street. I had a major concern the past -- well, pretty much since 2012 since I moved into my house on New York Street, but the intersection of Capouse and New York Street, it's a very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 dangerous intersection . And it's caught my attention in recent years because of a -- my children are bussed. It's a bus stop. It's very hard to navigate for motorist . It's very difficult to cross that street. A lot of motorist use that street as a -- to avoid the lights on Washington , etc., a lot of speeding . I was in contact with the Mayor's office last May trying to get an answer on how to make this a four-way stop sign. I was redirected to DPW. DPW redirected me down to City Hall. City Hall told me to go to a Council meeting . I'm here now basically not only for the concern for the motorist , pedestrians , but it's a bus stop. And when I can't be there for my children , I have four children that get off the bus there from Howard Gardner School. It's at 7:30 in the morning and about 3:30 in the afternoon , there are people that fly by and do not stop. It's very dangerous . Somebody is going to get seriously injured or killed. It's going to happen. It's inevitable . I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 like -- I've been redirected from Mayor's office to DPW, to City Hall, now up to here. MR. SMURL: Okay, then what we will do is, Mr. Voldenberg , will you request a traffic study on that intersection ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll request a traffic and sight study by the city engineer . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : And City Hall. MR. SMURL: So we will put a request in for a traffic study on that intersection . And what that does, they'll go there and watch the traffic and then give us the results whether it require s a four-way stop sign or whatever it may need. MR. KING: They'll make a recommendation . MR. MCGOVERN : Right now it's a two way stop on New York Street. There is no stop signs on Capouse . And ironically , it's one of the only two, maybe three that are not four way stops or have a traffic light on Capouse Avenue. MR. SMURL: Okay, that's what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 traffic study will show us. MR. MCGOVERN : Can the traffic study come through when the children are bussed? MR. SMURL: That's not up to us. That's a private -- MR. MCGOVERN : I mean, because that's where my major concern is. MR. MCANDREW : Well, they should. And, Mr. Voldenberg , will make note of that. MR. KING: Yeah, make a request that they look during the times when children are being picked up, you know, in the morning and in afternoon when they do that study, please. MR. VOLDENBERG : We will. MR. MCANDREW : This is the first step. So without you telling us, we don't always know that there's a problem in your area. So the traffic study is the first step. MR. MCGOVERN : And how long will this study take? MR. MCANDREW : Well, that's -- MR. VOLDENBERG : We would estimate a few weeks. MR. MCGOVERN : I'll do the study for free and then submit it to you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. MCANDREW : All we do is pass it off to that department . And then they will schedule it and but at least it's on record now for you. MR. KING: They will come back to us with a report as to what has been determined . Hopefully it will be a four-way stop. MR. MCGOVERN : All right. Thank you. I appreciate it. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Is there anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , while we're with that as well, can we look at the Swetland request that was put in last week just to follow up on that one as well? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. That was submitted . I'll follow up on that. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . 5-B, regarding social contract LLC, two-year contract to help reduce and prevent violent crime. Did we not learn our lesson with Mulfehan regarding violent crime and gang studies ? Wasn't the holistic approach of candles and incense enough for 200,000? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Wasted more money and using another outside organization also with the mention of creating a nonprofit , is the administration trying to tell us or are they assuming that our topnotch Scranton Police Department , Lackawanna County Detectives and prestigious Pennsylvania State Police are not capable of doing their job that they are sworn to uphold? Remember how the City of Scranton changed the police testing from LEAB, Law Enforcement Aptitude Battery testing to the National Testing Network because as it was stated they were going to get us the best of the best of the police officers . How is that working out? Or was that also a failure considering 130 applicants took a test and less than 10 maybe passed. If you have so much money to waste, why not reinvest it in our police department 's manpower or equipment ? Why not revise full time specialized units that would make a difference in the city. We don't need outside organization s to tell us how to run a police department , nor do we need a mayor with no experience to tell us how to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 run a police department . Our funds, our city, our input, stop wasting our money on outside agencies . Now regarding 6-A, will the school district transfer all insurances on the garbage vehicle to the school district 's insurance carrier immediately ? In regards to the breakdown s and wear and tear, who will be responsible for that truck? Last night's school board meeting it was discussed and it was stated that their garbage truck's frame was rotted, cracked , and unrepairable . They have no timeline to replace that vehicle . It was stated that they would check with Enterprise Rental and see if there is any way that they could rent a unit from Enterprise Rental that a new unit would be $500,000. We may want to clarify how long they will have our truck and who will take the responsibilities in the event of a breakdown or an accident or someone getting hurt. Let's start running the city like it's a business . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. Marie 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Schumacher , citizen of the City of Scranton not too far away from the Lookout which continues to lose stones. Now DPW is doing a pretty fair job of replacing them. But something needs to be done there. Now, I have a cousin who went up to Lackawanna State Park yesterday I believe it was. It doesn't really matter. But they have lights up there that are solar driven. And maybe that's what we need up there. And as I say, it's still -- lighting it is not going to stop what's happening . But I'm sure it will cut back because people will be afraid somebody is going to come down and see them taking away the stones. So just a thought , maybe the administration could see about those other lamps. And I just -- I guess it's 5-A. I do not understand why we're going to hire somebody from the outside when we have a lot of brains in the building . I mean, why is everything going out? Anybody know? MR. SMURL: Marie, is that the Violence Intervention Program ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. SMURL: That's what you are speaking of? MS. SCHUMACHER : That was -- yeah. MR. SMURL: That we are actually doing that with Lackawanna County, with the District Attorney 's Office and many other law enforcement agencies are all grouping together on this. And that's what's being formed now. It's not just us. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. But I still think it could be done by -- inhouse and not -- MR. SMURL: Well, we're involved with multiple organizations . It wouldn't be fair just for us to run it. It would have to be somebody independent , I believe . MR. SCHUSTER : This is one that the Mayor was in a caucus a few months ago. They were going base it off of what York, Pennsylvania is doing. The Police Chief was in. And as, Mr. Smurl, said it was going to be in conjunction with Lackawanna County and District Attorney . MS. SCHUMACHER : I forgot about that, yeah. Thank you. Okay. And now I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 to say I love what Charlie Jefferson is doing in the 300 block of Adams Avenue. When I read that in the paper today I had to go down and take a look. And it's going to be absolutely beautiful , I think. And I thank him for what he does for this city. Now, the 500 block of Lackawanna Avenue, I would like to say I believe that is the worst block in the city. I really feel like I should take one of those pills that you have to take when you go out on a ship before you go down 500 of Lackawanna Avenue because that's about the same way you feel. And something should be done. And then what is the status of reassessment ? I mean, you know, like, today there was a -- there were two properties that were in the transaction article , one was sold for 13 -- or 1 million three hundred thousand dollars , the other was for one thousand two hundred dollars. And I thought , oh, that's really good. They're a lot alike. And then I looked it up. And one of them -- the assessment is 46,000. And the other is 78,000. I didn't have time to go out and take a look at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 difference . But it seems to me that we really need to get that reassessment . And when does it tie up, when we get our assessments and, etc.? MR. SMURL: Marie, I'm not sure how far the county is on that right now. I thought it was suppose d to be by the end of this year for the entire reassessment of the county. But I'm not sure exactly where they're at right now with that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, it can't happen soon enough for a lot of people. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, south of South Side. Greetings , Council . First of all, I'd like to make a comment about the fireworks . I understand kicking it to the administration , but by the City Charter , public safety is the domain of City Council . Public safety is this body. The Mayor enforces it, but the Charter says this body here is in charge of public safety. So trying to kick that gentleman 's case along saying we don't touch it is exactly opposite of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 what the City Charter says. I understand you don't want to be involved in making rules for public safety. You certainly dodged that during the epidemic by letting the Mayor run it even though the Charter specifically says it's your domain. Pass the buck. On to the audit, I guess the -- for the records left out back, since we're not going to talk about it, have you inquired whether or not the Federal Trade Commission has been contact ed, their Identity Theft Division that it's just not internal to the city because any identity theft should be reported to federal agencies . Has the city done that? Do we know? MR. SMURL: I do not know. MR. COYNE: Okay. Last, I'm sure that Brittany Hammer has probably been contact ed because her personal information including Social Security and all that was left out front. That's right, Brittany Hammer, you were exposed . And as this goes on and does not get any statements made publicly , I will continue to divulge names of people who were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 out there and exposed to find out whether or not they have been contact ed properly and informed and protected . I see we just opened a pave contract inspection , contract . Hey, it's only half a million dollars for a year. Hey, we got lots of money, I mean, do we really need to pay half a million dollars for a pave cut inspection by bid or can't we just hire someone ? I understand we don't hire people anymore with competence . We bid it out for a ton of extra money and hand it out to people for half a million dollars . The Charter , can I get a copy of the Charter ? Can I get it scanned , e-mailed to me, the original Charter not code 360 because the verbiage was changed . It's still not up there on the website . I did check. It's not there. Is there any feedback on DPW as the letter from the DPW Director involving the money exchange for the parks? Do we know why the DPW Director is doing the budget exchange for the Parks' request or are we also not going to address that because we don't want to touch anything related to Scott Gassenmeyer ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 DPW, I would love to see some of the people out there who are actually on -- causal workers who work 30 hours a week and get paid $14 and have been there for over two years actually get shifted onto union to get benefits to actually become DPW workers . I met a few of them. They do fantastic jobs. But when you are getting Wal-Mart pay and Wal-Mart 30 hours a week with no benefits for years when you are picking up trash in rain and sleet and snow is unfair. There should be a time when casual workers are actually transitioned , period. They shouldn 't be Wal-Mart checkout people forever when they're doing the job they're doing. Recycling , by doing nothing and not halting the recycling and using the dump exclusively , we are now at $14,345 that the city has lost because of inaction to put a moratorium on the process , just keep throwing our money away. And every week I'll bring it in and this number will rise until it's changed. Fifteen grand, I guess that's nothing . Fire for homeowners , I understand the original 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 reason for having the fees in there are for accident s, for oil spills, for the absorbant that has to be used. It was never intended to penalize somebody who had a fire in their house. I would like to thank Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew for pushing it forward because people who have gone on with these devastation should not be having to pay for a disaster . And this body needs to act on it and not act for (inaudible ) thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . I was over Harrison Avenue bridge again today. And it looks like to me that there is more cracks appearing in the safety wall along the sidewalk . And my point is that whenever cracks appear in concrete they should be repaired immediately and not put off or described as minor. Once the water gets in there it just sinks in. If you ever went to chemistry class, water is the universal solvent . It dissolves everything eventually . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 So, please, I don't know who is responsible for it or who would have to go into it, but let's not have it falling down in 5 or 10 more years or need major work. We have a lot of good hydraulic concrete and cements that could seal that up for years. And on the recycling , it's time to separate metal and glass and plastic . That would be the linchpin for the whole works. You could take even if the cans are too heavily compressed , you could take a sledgehammer to them and knock them apart or something . And by the way, metal cans are far more valuable than plastic bottles or glass or glass is probably a better way to get somebody injured on that shoot that it dumps down. I heard of bottles flying through the air like broken bottles and stuff. So that's all on the occupational insurance . And it's time to vote soon. My ballots are at the house. Be pragmatic . Vote with your better interests . The 2025 document done by 29 Trump associates and the Heritage Foundation want to put the kibosh to Social Security , Medicare , veterans ' care, health 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 insurance , Blue Cross, Blue Shield. You know, a couple weeks ago I mentioned that George Bush approached Pennsylvania blue in 2006. And they got a billion dollar donation . Now, I think that would be better if it went to a hospital . It was for Chip insurance . And why can't you put your own -- your own career, political career on the line and do something right. That should have been paid by taxes for kids. And I wouldn't have it any other way that they don't have it. I don't oppose Chip insurance . However , about early 20 -- 2007, the Blue Cross owed me $600 in copays that I covered . And they were playing hardball with it. They wanted document s. They wanted this. They wanted -- I used to pay my doctor right up front in the office. I would write a check. And I thought that was the way it was suppose d to be. Well, they wanted me to let a bill come to the house and then I could pay it or -- whatever and then they could use the bill as -- to justify the coverage. It was entirely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 ridiculous . But it was obvious that Blue Cross was running short on money because they took all the surplus money and donated it for George W. Bush who, by the way, probably contributed to many trillions of dollars to the deficit . And in other words when you vote, consider your better interest . Consider what people are doing. Look at what they have done. You know, you run around and call people vermin, call people stupid even when they have illustrious careers and they've been through colleges and universities . They have law degrees and got elected to Attorney General offices and stuff like that. They are not stupid. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : The person that says that type of stuff is. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mr. Voldenberg , will you notify the state of the citizen 's complaint tonight about cracks in the sidewall s again? I know they were there last spring. They did fill a lot of them, but notify them again. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm bringing it. In the city where we respond to things in seven weeks, seven months, and the case of Nay Aug Park pool complex seven years, we could do better. I showed up months ago along with a few other people that cared to the unhoused commission meeting . To my surprise but yet not to my surprise , the Mayor didn't even start with the pledge of allegiance . I took great offense to that. Back in August, myself and school board member Sean McAndrew showed up at the one hour meeting with the Mayor prior to her photo ops, the first Friday in August. She shut that down too. Apparently preoccupied Paige has her focus on other things. She promised to raise her right hand, promised safety, look into the sale of the Sewer Authority , progress for a better city than what we were before, promise to fix blight. Instead , our city is in the current condition that it's in. She changed the police and fire testing . And we had 59 lawsuits for almost 6.4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 million dollars since her recent election into office. We can do better than Pinocchio Paige. Crosswalks , better roads, street signs, holding utilities responsible , caring for our kids, we could do better. Procrastination Paige is not the answer. We're going through difficult times right now. This election in November like I said last week is extremely important . But just as important is next November . That's when we determine who the next decision maker will be here in the city. Now, I don't think we need an expansion team. This Council has gone through so many applications , so many people being hired and fired, so many extensions and a lot of the employee s that make our major decisions are from outside of the city. You know, like I said, we're a puzzle in a box. As long as we have this administration looking over things, the pieces will not be put back together . Today Virgil Argenta and I spoke to a gang member 16 years old for over an hour. Number one, he should have been in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 school today but he wasn't. We talked to him quite a bit. He was from the Bronx. He's in the area. He already has a couples kids. You know, there should be better things that he should be doing right now. But instead , the only thing he knows how to do is just run the streets . You know, this is not a future for our city. We could do better. Currently from what I was told there is about 300 kids that are active gang members in our Scranton school system. The youngest one is nine years old, nine years old. Well, and then to top it all off, the school system has a problem with a child they cannot notify Children and Youth because there's laws protecting that. Children and Youth is backlogged over 900 cases. We do not have a drug task force. We do not have a gang task force. We do not have a plan to put police on patrol in areas on foot or on e-bikes. You know, years ago the calls were a lot different but it was handled a lot differently . You know, we have immediate responses . We have a fabulous police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 department , amazing . We're blessed to have them every single day, right? But when we go out on these calls the response is quick. But the calls that they take are heart-wrenching in some cases. And our officers have to see this on a daily basis. We could do better than this. I believe our city can do better. On election day, she's going to be begging for votes. She's going to be begging for forgive ness. And she's going to use the ARPA funds to praise progress . Well, corruption , studies and consultants are not the answer. Neither is Paranoid Paige. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? No, sir, you already spoke. MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , I'm Rik Little. I'd like to report and thank Scott Thomas from the library for accepting -- for ordering and including the books by Brett Pike that I introduced to them. I think this brings into focus the bigger picture on education because people, oh, we need schools . But what are the schools teaching 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 the kids and what is it about and how does the government figure into that. There is always a big focus on schools , especially around here because just since, like, 1981 there's federal funds coming in for schools. But there's not much consideration for what might be the better thing for kids is parents that want to home school their kids or send them someplace else. But all the impetus is the money goes to the state schools . And the states are indoctrinating people. And it's overwhelmed now because this is a sanctuary city, all of these new people are coming in overwhelming . It's not sustainable . And they'll be arguing about it. The one business that really will never run out of money is the law business . They just, you know, billable hours. It just goes on and on. People are arguing . Every agency goes, oh, you need a lawyer. You need, you know, a DMV lawyer. You need a, you know, an election lawyer. You can't afford a lawyer. And so big change has to happen. And I think there's been a thing coming down the pike where they are destroying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 the American family. They've made families fatherless . And it's statistical . I mean, I ended up in the city through the Kings County Family Court. I spoke in then Mayor Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo's Moreland 's Commission about how they were going to fix their judiciary . And they pick out of thousands of people, 12 people were picked. I was one of them. And I told them, you should close down the family courts. I mean, there's a big brouhaha now about Roe versus Wade. It's put back to the states. But the family courts since about 1989, that's when it really came in through Mario Cuomo and the people that they put in -- and there's two things, Joe Biden's Violence Against Women Act and the Title 4 DNE for child support . And after that 90, 95 percent of the families are fatherless . I haven't seen my daughter since she was eight. She's 24 now because they get taught -- it's messed up. The kids are the most important thing. And Trump's coming. And people have to take a cue from Trump on how to do things. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 I noticed when I was in family court that Clarence Thomas I needed -- I needed, you know, pro se -- I needed a case, you know, and I found Troxel versus Grandville where it says, you know, parents have the right over the state. But we're a state indoctrinated society all over the place. And it's especially confusing around here with the newspaper . I'd just like to point out when you read the newspaper , look where it comes from because I'm reading the newspaper around here, the one newspaper , the Times-Tribune . And most of the articles are AP or from the New York Times, you know. This is -- this is a globalist indoctrination . And they put all the focus on, you know, we got to, you know, my body, you know, we should be able to abort. There's things that are wrong. And they are letting the schools out tomorrow because Trump is coming. Kids have to learn, you know. It's the next generation and we have to start thinking broad strokes in the future to sustain -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. LITTLE: -- this city. MR. SMURL: And you were mistaken again. Scranton is not a sanctuary city. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . It was mentioned that we weren't investing any money in stormwater . We are investing 23 million dollars , you know, of ARPA funds to address stormwater . So excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Little. You spoke. I'm speaking now. Thank you. So it was said that no money was being spent on stormwater , 23 million dollars is being spent from the ARPA funds to address stormwater . So I just wanted to correct that statement . There was comment made about the sidewalks . And I agree, sidewalks should be corrected . I have a suggest ion on how we could do it. We have five universities in the city, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 all nonprofit s. They don't pay taxes to the city. University of Scranton gives a measly $150,000 to the city in lieu of taxes. Maybe we could get all those universities and nonprofit s to kick in some extra funding that would help us improve the sidewalks here in the city. So maybe the next place to speak would be at board meeting s at the University of Scranton . And maybe they would be willing to contribute a lot more money since they benefit from all of the protection of Scranton Police and the fire department and all the street paving and what have you. So that's a thought there. As far as the dump truck, the Pak Master, I believe it's 30 days, Mr. Argenta . However , we do need to make sure that the city if you could check, Frank, it should be the Scranton School District should be naming us additionally insured on their insurance policy. So let's make sure that that's happening during that time when we're utilizing our Pak Master. And, you know, it was mentioned that Council 's job is to enforce laws. Now, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Council 's job is to approve laws and ordinance s and legislation concerning public safety. And it's the city administration 's job to enforce those laws. So we're part time City Council members who all have day jobs. It's impossible for us to be out there enforcing all of these laws of public safety. We pass the laws and the ordinances and the legislation . And then it's the city administration 's job to, you know, enforce those laws. I believe that's all I have at this time. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few comments . Thank you, Mr. King, for the University of Scranton sidewalk comment s that you made. I think the sidewalk s that you were referring to were sidewalks in the University of Scranton neighborhoods , correct ? Yeah, thank you. So I think that's a good idea to look into when we're talking about sidewalk replacement , especially in that area. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 know, what we heard about safety with the fireworks at the Italian Festival was very concerning . Thank you for leaving your information . Council will look into that to see what information we can get on that. As was kind of stated before, we're not the body that, you know, makes the agreement with the fireworks companies that are putting out those perform ances. But we could -- we could definitely look into that information for you. I got an update. For the last two weeks we've been asking about 902 West Elm Street and the basin there. I was told that tomorrow , Pennsylvania Water will be out to replace that basin. So I'm glad to hear that today. And I hope to get an update tomorrow saying that they've been there to do the work. I did have some question s about the refuse trucks. I'm glad that Mr. King brought up the insurance piece if he could definite ly check on where we're at with insurance with the school district . And can we get a timeline even though it may have said 30 days, can we clarify the timeline on how long the district 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 will be utilizing our refuse truck? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I did have some question s on leasing . At one point in time the city was leasing refuse trucks. So how many -- the question I had is, is the city still leasing refuse trucks and may Council please have the number of vehicle s in the fleet. And the answer I got back was the city owns its refuse and recycling trucks. So they just ignore the fact that we've leased trucks at one point in time. But to clarify that, could we just ask how many vehicle s we did lease, when did we lease them and the terms of the leases, what was the length of time that we leased them for getting the month and the year that those leases started and ended? And then the update was that we had 15 refuse trucks and four recycling trucks. I inquired about a sign as we all saw on WNEP and also in the Scranton Times, there was information put out there that the city is getting signage for different areas of entry in the city. And I did inquire . I spoke 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 to members of the Tripp Park Neighborhood Association who said quite a while back the area that we spoke about on North Main Avenue and Euclid Avenue, a sign was to go in there. And they did speak to the Tripp Park Neighborhood Association about the wording on the sign. The administration did reach out to the Tripp Park Neighborhood Association but they were a little bit confused on what they were asking the neighborhood association . So in turn, the neighborhood association was confused to what was being asked. The answer I got about the signage was we asked the Tripp Park Neighborhood Association . They were not aware of such a project . But we do know that in six places in city there is going to be some signage going up. Can we confirm whether the signs along North Main Avenue and Main Avenue will state either West Scranton , Tripp Park or just a board term Scranton , what that sign on Euclid Avenue and North Main Avenue will contain ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. I asked some question s about the MOU/MOA with the DPW and fire departments with residency being lifted are they being allowed to live outside of the city. They're still in discussion s with DPW and the fire bargaining units and the responses will be forthcoming . So we did not get an answer on whether those individual s are allowed or not allowed to move outside of the city at this point in time. Another question , Mr. Voldenberg , on the recycling contract , can we get an update on the recycling contract where the city is with negotiations and has there been any headway ? The last update that we got or that we received was that the city was reviewing the recycling program . And it stated that admin was requesting a meeting with representatives of the Recycling Center. Can we ask has this meeting occurred and what the updates from that meeting would have been? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. Thank you. First, I just wanted to thank the SPD because I noticed there were a number of abandon ed vehicle s within the Hill Section that were recently removed . So I wanted to thank them for that work. And I just wanted to make a note about the concern about the sidewalks , which we do appreciate hearing . So you'll notice that when you do walk around the neighborhoods or walk somewhere that the sidewalks , a lot of them are in disrepair . And that's something that we definitely need to work on as a city. I was happy that NeighborWorks included that into their Beautiful Blocks programming this year. And from what I was told, it was -- it was definitely a success . And they had more requests to -- for people to repair their sidewalks than they had money for. But it's just, you know, it's definitely a need that residents have. It is up to the property 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 owner, their sidewalks in terms of maintenance . So it's not just something that the city could come and do because it's someone else's property . But if we could find additional ways to incentivize people to fix their sidewalk s or if we are able to get the universities or colleges or others to help pay for it, then I'm all for it. I wanted to mention also on that topic we've had complaints in the past a number of times about the curb cut not being handicap accessible at the intersection of Olive and Colfax. I wanted to see if we had any recent updates on that because I did receive another complaint about it. MR. VOLDENBERG : We have not, Dr. Rothchild . I'll follow up. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, if we can -- once again, I know Miss Koloski has been asking about it for a very long time. And I just don't understand why we can't get that curb cut corrected so that someone could have access to it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. Their initial response was that it did not require 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 any work. But I will follow up for more specifics . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I mean, I was recently sent updated pictures of it. And it's a curb. There's no way someone with a wheelchair or walker or device would be able to access that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And I'll forward the pictures too. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Also, I had a previous paving request for the 500 block of Okell Court. And I wanted to check in on the status of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : That was submitted to the administration with the Council priority pave list. It will probably take place in the beginning of next year. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Are we expecting , like, an approval of our priority paving list or -- I'd like confirmation that it's going to be on the city's because just because we have it as a priority doesn't mean 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 that the city does. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that. And in the interim , I'll see if they will pothole patch Okell Court. Is it the 500 block? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. Okay. Thank you. And I had inquired about the status of a property on Harrison Avenue. I believe it's 231-233. And there was a porch on that property previously and that has been gone for quite some time now. It used to be condemned . But I haven't noticed a condemned sign on it. So I'm not sure if it was removed or what the issue is there so if we can find out. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a status on the property . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And one more thing that I just wanted to mention , the complaint regarding the fireworks at the festival . I'm very sorry to hear that your children were injured as a result of the fireworks . And I want to make sure that we have the proper information and that the right-to-know is being respond ed to appropriately and we -- that we should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 certainly have the permits for them prior to the fireworks going -- going off. So I'm hoping that we could find that information for you because I want to make sure that we have it. That's really important to have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. DR. ROTHCHILD : That's it. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : A few comments . Again, I apologize for what happened to your child or children with the fireworks . I know you want answers, guess what, so do I. And like earlier , I said, Mr. Voldenberg , please gather as much information as you can for us. And I appreciate it very much. The Home Rule Charter , last week we inquired about it may they put it back on the website . Obviously they didn't hear us. So may you -- would you please do that again? And if could you find -- dig up a copy, a clean copy for Mr. Coyne, give him one, if you don't mind. I appreciate it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 Also, the budget exchange between DPW and Parks, let's check into that too. Let's get an answer, you know, a clarification of what actually happened or why. Is it salary, it is money, is it for something that we're not aware of? I think we should find out. Also, I want an update about recycling discussions . I brought it up a couple weeks ago and we were told they're in discussion . So let's find out how that went and give us an update. The sidewalk thing, I agree with my colleagues here about -- and I think this gentleman here kind of zoned in on that the sidewalks might be the property of the U. And if that's the case, take care of them, fix them. I believe they could afford them. They don't need help from Neighbor Works to do that. If they are in disrepair , they're also a liability . So, you know, this can -- this is an issue that Code Enforcement can probably take a look at. There's something on the books for sidewalk s that are in disrepair . So let's take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 a look at that too, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could put it on the radar for code enforcement . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : So last week -- let me see what else -- so last week I brought up the possibility of a solution for 307 the Lookout at 307. And Mr. Voldenberg contact ed the administration . I said I don't want to step on any union jobs because that's not what we're trying to do, just trying to find a solution where the student s at the Career Technology Center Masonry Department offered to fix these -- not, you know, a short term which solution which is, you know, safety driven. And I agree we need more lighting up there. I think we're all in agreement with that. I think we were heard when we brought that up. But the response I got is the city engineer is looking into it. They're going to take a look at 307 -- make sure it's safe enough for students to be there. And I'm in agreement with that, so we'll see what happens with that and hopefully before snow starts flying because , you know, it does happen sometimes in October . So we'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 keep our eyes and ears open for that. And now this again bothered me last week and it continues to bother me. So Mr. Schuster asked two weeks in a row if the MOU that we had to rush through and vote quickly on because we had to do it or the MOA, actually it was a MOA was discussed with the DPW, police -- I mean the fire department that has it been ratified and is it in effect because we're hearing on the street that, that there might be -- something might happen to people that move out of the city. So my understand ing is the MOA was before we even voted on it because that was a concern of mine that everything was taken care of, right? And the answer again we get this week is we're still in discussion . The discussion already happened . We voted on it. What discussion , right? And then part C of that same question is, Mr. Schuster asked at this time are SPD, SFD, DPW and clerical employees allowed to move out of the city or is this factor still being negotiated with the labor attorneys . Again, the answer is response is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 forthcoming . The police won it in arbitration , right? So it looks like to me and this is what I was afraid of and this is what I was worried about, the only ones who are allowed to live out of the city are the cabinet members or new hires. But it looks like -- if we get an answer and the response is still forthcoming , that means it's not happening, the big MOU -- or MOA that we had to rush through and make sure we voted it on. It looks like maybe the legal attorney still has their hands in this for whatever reason and using in ways that may not be fair or that we agreed upon and voted on, but response forthcoming , in discussion . This already should have taken place. This is why I was worried about this and my suspicion s maybe were correct with this. So I agree. Let's find out what discussion s are being had. The contracts are ratified and settled. The MOU we -- or the MOA we voted on. What responses are we waiting for and why? And that's all I have. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 The city has begun with their operating budget. And I said I would update everyone on it as I met with the city. So yesterday I met with Eileen Cipriani and Matt Domines ' to go over the beginning of the operating budget for the City of Scranton . So, so far, all but Chief Judge has all of their information in for the budget. Chief Judge when he gets back from helping the people that were flooded and from that last storm, last I heard it would be about the 10th he would be home. And he will enter all of his information on there to move forward with the budget. Matt and Eileen went over with me the budget, explained pretty much everything from the $800,000 that we lost from the hospitals becoming a nonprofit and other things that we should be concerned about. And also, we went over, like, Payroll Prep Tax and we all talked about employee raises, having a real funded capital budget and what that does to our actual budget and how that -- everything is adjusted accordingly there. So we will be meeting again. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 will keep everybody updated on what's happening with their operating budget or according to what the information that I received from them. So the update from the code enforcement and the blight that we have been cleaning up, these are the response s that I got from Licensing and Inspection that we've been working on for the past few months. So this is since the last Council meeting . They have towed eight more cars. They have ticketed 300 block of Crown Avenue, a tractor with multiple flat tires. And it stated that if it's not removed it will be towed. The lot at 728 Alder Street, they contacted the owner and the owner actually cleared the lot and said they were going to be planting grass there. 930 Hickory Street, the noise complaint and the construction noise, that is the new building going up. And if there is any complaints , like, after 8 p.m. -- 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.; but that ordinance is enforced by the police department . So the Licensing and Inspection -- so if anybody hears noise, you could call the police and they could enforce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 that ordinance if you hear it after that time or if you hear it before that time in the morning and you're concerned about it. But that is the Scranton Police Department . 1520-1522 Pittston Avenue, the porch has been repaired. 723 River Street, the grass has been cut and the pool has been emptied below the site where the inspector can see it from outside the yard. You're not allowed to enter their yard unless we have a good reason. So it looks like it's been emptied . But they can't see it 100 percent . So 114-116 Crown Avenue, the citation s were all filed. And it's now with the magistrate 's office. 414 South Webster , all of those citations were all filed. And that is also at the magistrate 's office. 615-617 Beech Street, they received multiple stop work orders, multiple quality of life tickets. And that now is also at the magistrate 's office. So what happens there is once -- and we'll continue to get complaint s about it, but once it gets to the magistrate 's office, there is not much more we could do until we get further into looking into taking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 these properties . But right now if it's at the magistrate 's office there is not a lot we can actually do except go out and cite them again. But evidently , it doesn't mean anything to these people. So it would be just frugal to go out and do it again. 1616 Mulberry Street, again multiple issues. And that is also at the magistrate 's office. And this afternoon when I was speaking to the last code enforcement officer , they were in South Side. They towed two more abandoned vehicle s in South Scranton and one up on the Hill Section . And they were moved. Eight more vehicle s were moved from properties . If they are (inaudible ) on city people's yards, they will actually go knock on the door and inform the people that they are illegal to have. So the last eight that they encountered actually today, those people actually moved those. And the last thing I have is the traffic lights are currently being installed on Elm and Cedar and Maple and Cedar. They're the ones that we've been waiting for about a year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 and a half, two years. But they are being installed as we speak. That's all I have. MR. SCHUSTER : Before we move further , the properties that you were just talking about, were they general Council inquires about -- MR. SMURL: Whenever I do, I follow up on them. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, it's not part of the blight group that -- MR. SMURL: Not yet. These will be, but I'm trying to see what we could actually do to -- and the cars, the cars and the trailers -- the tractor -trailers , this one particular code officer makes a point to actually try to see the homeowner and explain to them really the code. Today they actually moved two tractors from a yard. They were parked on the side of the yard. And the people said, oh, we just didn't know. But they did remove them today. And they moved them. And then there was eight other cars that were abandon ed but the people did move them. They are also, he has a list of 110 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 cars between South Side and the Hill Section because that's where they are right now that are abandon ed or there's transmissions on the ground. I mean, it's a disaster . But they are working on that. There is some that the police department handle and there is some that code enforcement . So they are working together . It's actually moving forward . And I know to date there is about 92 vehicles moved or toward since the beginning of the year. So finally we are moving ahead on that. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And the budget piece, they wanted -- Matt and Eileen wanted to meet with individual Council members . But they're still going to be here for a caucus -- MR. SMURL: Absolute ly. Yeah, I said -- because I requested to go and to be kept up-to-date if they would allow that to happen. And they did agree to happen -- because I would rather not have a surprise the 29th of the month and say here's our new budget. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. After you said that I saw the e-mail that went out. So I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 just making sure we weren't doing individually . It was going to happen -- MR. SMURL: Yeah. No, I did think that all Council members should be invited if they wanted to go and discuss anything in the budget before they actually come here. But that was just an idea. MR. SCHUSTER : Thanks. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. SMURL: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , we discussed this in caucus. The one concern there is no funding in there for the study for the new firehouse up on East Mountain for replacement of Engine 10. We were assured -- we got legislation -- received legislation today from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 the administration for an LSA grant to actually do that study. The one thing that Council is going to request in that once they do decide to go out for the study is that the study is focused on replacement of a firehouse strictly on the East Mountain . That doesn't necessarily have to be in the exact spot but somewhere to remain on East Mountain . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so that is what I was going to bring up on the question as well. We did have a good discussion . We did hold up the capital budget this year because funding wasn't appropriate d for Engine 10. In the past, a study came up that had discussed moving Engine 10 off of East Mountain and Council wasn't in agreement . I think at this point in time I am pretty sure that we have a unanimous decision to keep Engine 10 on East Mountain . And we would like to make sure that moving forward with this we get a guarantee from the city that we're going to keep that fire station on the East Mountain . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? Roll call, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS.
