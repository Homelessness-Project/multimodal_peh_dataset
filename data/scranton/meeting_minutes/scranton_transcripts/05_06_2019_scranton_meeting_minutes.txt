Buttheothercitation intheadis themostegregious .Theadcitesastoryin thePhiladelphia Inquirer titled TaxBillSet ToIncrease AgainForHomeowners ,whichstates that75percent ofresidential properties in Philadelphia increase dby40percent following thelatest yearly reassessment . I'msurethatsoundsabsolutely terrifying totaxpayers across thecity.But itsimply isn'ttrue.Comparing reassessment inPhiladelphia toreassessment elsewherein1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Pennsylvania islikecomparing apples and oranges .AndtheInquirer article thatis citedsaysasmuch.Thearticle states unlike othercounties inthestate,Philadelphia is notrequire dtochange taxrateswhen assessments increase tomakethechanges revenue neutral . Everyothercounty inPennsylvania besides Philadelphia hastoreadjust taxrates tomakereassessmentrevenue neutral .The pointofperform ingareassessment istoensure afairandequitable taxsystem.ButIguess Mr.O'Malley ismoreinterested inmisleading voters forhisownpersonal gainwhile protect ingtheselect fewwhoarenotpaying theirfairsharethanheisinmaking sureour taxsystem isfairandequitable foreachand everytaxpayer inLackawanna County. Andnowjusttofollow upbriefly on request forinformation Isenttothe Administration regarding PSNRealty lastweek.

ATTY.MINORA:Iwill.AndI've address edthisoneinthepast.ButIwillbe gladtotalktoyouaboutit-- MR.DONAHUE :Okay.SoIthink that'ssomething thatwereally needtoexplore togettheinformation isjuststartissuing subpoena s,makepeople comehereandanswer questions because rightnowwe'rejustoutof options .Andthat'sallIhavetonight . MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Mr.Evans, anymotionsorcomment s? MR.EVANS:Afew,thankyou.I'm goingtoexpand alittle bitonPSNRealty again.Correspondence wassentfromCity Council inreference toenforcing thelaws currently existingundertheCity'sRental Registration Ordinance onproperties ownedby PSNRealty. Specifically Section 373-10,which describes arental escrow program thatallows theCitytocollect rentsatrental properties thathavenotpaidtheirtaxes,garbage fees, oranyotherliensandputthatmoneyintoan1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 escrow account untilthosetaxesandfeesare paid. AsIdiscussed lastweekaftera cursory reviewofallofPSNproperties , approximately sevenofthoseproperties appear tobeoccupied bytenants.Ofthoseseven, whicharemostly multifamily buildings ,there maybeasmanyas14unitsbeingrented byPSN. Soifyoutookanaverage of$600 permonth,thatwouldbeequal$100,800per yearbeingreceived byanout-of-towncompany whodoesn'tpaytheirtaxesorrefuse fees. I'dalsoliketosaythatifathorough investigation wasdonebytheCity,wecould verywellfindthatsamescenario isrepeated overandoveragainandmostlikelyapplytoa substantial number ofadditional rental properties citywide. Infact,we'reprobably leaving hundreds ofthousands ofdollars onthetable whileabsentee landlords arenotpaying their taxesandfeestotheCitybutarestill collect ingrenteachandeverymonth. Formanyoftheselandlord s,it's business asusual.Andquitehonestly that'sa1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 sadtestament towhathasbeenaclearsystemic breakdown within CityHallfordecade and decades . TheRental Registration Ordinance wasdraftedbythisCityCouncil ,notonlyto answer thisissue--andthereisneverone solution bytheway.Therearemanysolutions . Butthisisonethatisaddressing this particular problem . WehavegiventheAdministration thistool,onethatwethinkcouldbevery effective .Whytheyhaven'tusedit,wereally don'tknow.Butfornow,wehavemadeour position quiteclearandknown.Andnowwe justsitbackandwaittoseeiftheychoose to act. Onthetrashissueverybriefly , I'llbemeeting withtheBusiness Administration overthenextweektotalkabout someideasIhaveontrashandthe2020budget andhowtheyrelate.SoI'llbereportingback tomycolleague sonthat. I'malsogoingtotouchon reassessment .I'mgoingtofurther elaborate onCouncilman Donahue 'scomments onthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 reassessments .Andwhilesomeofmycomment s mayberepetitive towhathesaid,Ifeelit's thatimportant .Myviewsonreassessment have beenclearly established overmytimeonCity Council . IhavebeenupfrontasIcouldbeon thesubject .I'minfavorofacountywide reassessment asaCityCouncil .Andasa former Director theAssessment Office,Iknow firsthand thatthecitizens ofScranton andthe Cityitself willbenefit greatly froma reassessment thataddresses taxfairness for everyone . Withthatsaid,I'vealways hesitate dtodelveintopolitical sideof government during mytimeonCityCouncil .But whenIseethelevelofdistortion ofanissue asimportant asreassessment fromvarious political campaigns ,Ifeltcompelled to respond andsettherecord straight frommy perspective onseveral issues. Firstofall,asCouncilman Donahue noted,somecampaigns regular lyhavereferred toarecent reassessment inPhiladelphia city andcounty where75percent ofresidential1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 property owners hadtheirtaxesincrease dby40 percent . Whathasnotbeenproperly disclose d isthatthefollowing information thatwas include dinthesamePhiladelphia newspaper article thatwasusedasthebasisforthat argument .Thearticle goesontostatethe following : Unlike othercounties inthestate, Philadelphia isnotrequire dtochange tax rateswhenassessment sincrease tomakechanges revenue neutral .Thatmeanseveryincrease in assessment isataxrateinPhiladelphia .In otherwords,everycounty inthestateoutside ofPhiladelphia including Lackawanna County wouldhavetoadjust theirmillage rates downwardtocoincide withincrease sinthe assessed valuation . Sotherewouldbenoincrease in taxes.Clearly thatisnotthekindoffact thatcertain campaigns wantyoutoknow, especially whentheinformation istaken directly fromthesamenewspaper article . Secondly ,thefollowing wasalso stated aspartofthecontinuing misinformation1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 campaign onreassessment.AndIquote,"Ina survey donebythecityofWilkes-Barre,100 percent ofresidential property taxeswould haveincreased underacountywidereassessment. AndWilkes-Barreoptedoutofthe reassessment." Wow.Areyoukidding me?The source forthisinformation wasattribute dtoa 2018presentation toLackawanna County Commissioners fromTedWampole ofthecityof Wilkes-Barrewhoissupposedly theChiefof Staff. Well,firstofall,Iattendedthat presentation withCouncilman Roganandother members oftheCityAdministration .Andit wasn'tevenapresentation .Itwasameeting requested bythisCityCouncil todiscuss reassessment withtheCommissioners .Butasit turned out,itwasmorelikeanattempted blindsidebysomeofthecounty bybringing Mr.Wampole intoameetingtodiscuss Wilkes-BarreandLuzerne County reassessment , neither ofwhichatthetimehadanyrelevance atalltowhatwashappeninginLackawanna County.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 So,firstofall--andyoumaynot knowthis,butWilkes-Barremostlikelyopted outofreassessmentbecause unlike mostcities, Wilkes-Barredoestheirownproperty tax reassessment sandhastheirownassessment office. Somyviewpoint ,thatisprobably oneofthemainreasons theyoptedout.Plus, it'shighly likely therewaslackofpolitical willbythecurrent ortheexisting groupof leaders incharge atthetimetopursue a reassessment . Secondly ,Mr.Wampole 'sbrief presentation atthemeeting Iattended consisted ofhimcherry-picking approximately a dozenproperties toshowthateachofthose properties wouldhaveincreased underthe Luzerne County reassessment iftheystayed in. Thatisthe100percent reference in thesoundbiteIdescribed earlier .Nowthink aboutit.Ahand-picked dozenorsoproperties outofthousands andthousands ofproperties in thecityofWilkes-Barrewerethebasisfora comment madebyMr.Wampole andthenusedbya campaign .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Soletmereadthatagain.Ina survey donebythecityofWilkes-Barre,100 percent ofproperty taxeswouldhaveincreased underacountywidereassessment.Theysampled 12properties .That'stheirsurvey.Sothe citycontingent inattendance atthatmeeting quickly dismissed thislogicasfaulty and without meritandquickly movedonfromthat discussion .Itwasn'tevenworthdiscussing . Butapparently someatthatmeeting thatdaysavedthatsamefaultylogicforuse intheir2019political campaign .Soyouhave toaskyourself,aretheyreally serious about reassessment?Noway.Atopicasimportant as reassessment should notbethesubject of incorrect andbeyond misleading information . Butasthesaying goes,neverlet thetruthgetinthewayofagoodstoryora goodcampaign soundbite.Andwithallofthat said,attheendofthedayit'stotally unnecessary .Thedecision todoacountywide reassessment iscurrently inthehandsofthe courts. Andthecourtswillultimately decide andmakethatdecision ,notthesitting1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 commissioners andmostlikely notevenfuture commission ersbutthecourts. AndIfullyexpect basedonallof thecaselawavailable forreviewthatanybody wantstolookatthatareassessment willbe ordered .Soagain,Iapologize fordelving intotheworldofpolitic sfromthedais,but sometimes whenstatements aremadethatareso egregious yousimply havenochoice. Andfinally asmycustom,everyday isyourchance tomakeacityalittle better. Thankyou. MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Mr.Gaughan , anymotions orcomment s?

MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Justabrief comment onreassessment .Iknowmy colleagues --andagain,Ifeelthesamewayas Councilman Evans.Itendnottotalkabout politic sfromthesemeeting s.Butwhen misinformation isbeingspread bycandidates of bothparties ,Ithinkit'simportant thatis something thatneedstobeaddressed . Councilman Donahue andEvansspoke regarding Commissioner O'Malley'sad.AndI wasatthatmeeting withCouncilman Evans.And themeeting wasrequested byCityCouncil to talkwiththeCommission ersaboutreassessment . Andwhenwegottherefromthefirst minute ofthatmeeting untiltheveryend,it wasafarce.Itwasaforegoneconclusion . Therewerenotopenmindsonthepartsofsome ofthecommissioners ,particularly by1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Commissioner Cummings .Andfollowing that meeting Iknowmyself,Councilman Evansand others werecritical ofCommissioners Cummings ' stance. Andit'snotthat,youknow,we disagree withherposition whichwecertainly do.It'sthefactthatitwasconstant misinformation atthatmeeting .Andevenlast weekIsawsomething fromhercampaign aswell, taxbillstoincrease againforhomeowner sin Philadelphia astheyrelease newassessment s. SoIthinkthat'sthesameadthat youguyscited,thesamearticle .SoIsee thatCommissioner Cummings isrunning pretty muchthesamecampaign assomeoftheDemocrats are.Soit'scertainly notapartisan issue thismisinformation that'sbeingputoutthere. Andithastostop.It'sokaytobefor something oragainst something ,butdebate the issueonthemerits. Thefactthatthismisinformation keepsgoingout--andagain,whenwehadthe meeting withthecounty,fromthefirstsecond wewalked in,itwasabouttryingtospiniton howreassessment isbad.Andpeople could1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 certainly haveanopinion onewayortheother. Butusingarticles fromanother county that haveacompletely different policy thanevery othercounty inthestatecertainly isn'tthe waytodothat. SoIjustwantedtopointoutthat it'scertainly notonecandidate thatis pushingthat.It'sunfortunately byaDemocrat andaRepublican thatseemedtobeteamed up. Thatisall. MS.REED:5-B,nobusiness atthis time.
