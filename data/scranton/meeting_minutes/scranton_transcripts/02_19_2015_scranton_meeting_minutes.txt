MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Justafew comments fortonight regarding thepension issue.OnFebruary 1thefollowing letter wassenttoCityController Rosanne Novembrino ."Atthemeeting ofScranton CityCouncil heldFebruary 12,2015, Councilman PatRoganrequested aletter be senttoyourattention regarding thedouble pension sgiventoemployees whoretired December 31,2002,andwhodidnotmeetthe criteria tocollect thepension .Councilman Roganisrequesting areport onhowthis occurred andwhat,ifany,corrective measures areinplacetoensure thisdoes nothappen again." Mrs.Novembrino didreplytothis letter asfollows:"DearMr.Rogan,thisis inresponse toyourletter ofFebruary 13, 2015,regarding thedouble pensions .This matter isunderreview andallquestions1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 should beaddressed toAttorney Larry Durkin." Regarding thepension issue,Iam hopeful thatthePension Boardthrough their owninvestigation willprovide allofthe answers thatmyself,Iknowmycolleagues andthepublic arelooking for.Theseare someoftheconcerns thatIhave:Firstand foremost,iswhoauthorized thedoubling of thesepension payments forsomepensioners ? Itdidn'thappen outofthebluethatthese checks justdoubled outofnowhere. Somebody somewhere ,whether itbethrough thecityorthrough thecompany actually writing thechecks,doubled thosepayments . Ithinkthatishefirstandforemost question weneedtofindoutwaswhodidit. Thesecond question iswhydidthey authorize thedoubling ofthesepensions ? Didtheybelieve thattherewaslawinplace tothatthesepensions should havebeen doubled ?Wasitaclerical errororwasit something else?Ithinkthat'ssomething we needitlookinto,ananswer thatweneed fromthePension Boardaswell.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Next,Iwouldliketoknowifthe recipients ofthedouble pension sifthey werenotified thattheirpensions were increasing ornot,andIthinkthisissueor atleastformeitmakesabigdifference on whether Ibelieve themoneyshould bepaid backtothepension fundornot.If somebody receiving apension received an official notification fromthecitythat they'reentitlement haschanged andthat pension doubled Idon'tbelieve wecouldin goodconscience askthosepeople topaythe citybackbecause theywereunderthe assumption that'swhattheywereentitled to fromthecity. Ontheotherhand,ifthepensions doubled outofnowhereandnodocumentation ornotification wassentfromthecity,Ido believe thatthosefundsshould bepaid back.Assomebody whoisasalaried employee ,ifonemonthmycheckdoubled out oftheblueit'smyresponsibility toaska question whymysalary doubled .It'snot something thatshould befiledawayandsay, "Well,Ihopeit'snotcaught."1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Sothatformeisthedeciding factor onwhether thefundsshould bepaid backtothepension fundorwhether ittruly wasanerrorofthecityandinthiscase youcannot blamesomebody whobelieved they wereentitled tothatbenefit topayit back. Iwouldspecific allyliketoknow theroleofthecitycontroller andformer MayorDoherty inregard todoubling the pensions andwhyittooksolongtocatch thiserror,andIthinkoneofthespeakers madeapretty goodpointtonight ,when Councilman Loscombe wasappointed tocity council ittookamatterofweeksforitto comeoutthathewasn't--thathewasno longer entitled tohispension .Theprocess played outinatimely andefficient manner. Inthisscenario ,however ,many,manyyears wentbybefore thiscameoutandInormally amnotonetothankthemedia,butIdo thinkthattheScranton Timesdiddoagreat jobinvesting theseissues andbringing theseissues tolight. Finally ,Iwouldliketoknowwhat1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 actionsthecitycontrol lerthePension Boardandthecurrent administration willbe taking tomakesurethatthereare safeguards inplacethatthisneverhappens again.Ourcitypensions areinbadenough shapeontheirownwithout individuals receiving double thecompensation thatthey deserve . Sothesearetheissues thatIthink needtobeaddressed bythePension Board. Iftheyarenot,Idobelieve council should moveforwardwithinvesting thisonourown, butI'mhopeful thatthePension Boardwill doathorough investigation andbringallof thesequestions thatIhaveandIknowmy colleagues haveandthepublic hastolight. Andthatisalltonight . Councilman Evans,doyouhaveany motions orcomments ? MR.EVANS:Yes,thankyou.Onthe newsofthelatest pension fiasco,Iconcur withCouncil President McGoff let'sseeif thePension Boardcangetoutinfrontof this.Itismyunderstanding theyhavebeen holding hearings relating totheseissues1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 andweneedtogivethePension Boardan opportunity todotheirjob,togettothe bottom ofthis,andreport theirfinding s. Thepublic andourtaxpayers deserve toknow thatthoseentrusted withthosetypesof decisions didnotmisplace thattrust. Onatotally different subject ,I knowsomemembers ofcouncil mayhavethe answer tothis,thisisaproblem that's beenongoingfordecades without clear understanding ofwhoseresponsibility itis, butcananyone tellmewhoisultimately responsible forremoving thesnowfromthe sidewalks ofthebridges alloverScranton ? Havewehaveeverfigured thissituation out? Iknowthiscomesupalmost every yearandit'sconstant backandforth between thecityandPennDOT ,andit's almost sophomoric howitishandled andI don'tknowtothisdaywhoisresponsible forthesidewalks especially ,youknow,it's hazardous forpedestrians whogotothe downtown fromtheWestSideandSouthSide. Youknow,theseareourcitizens trying to1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 traverse oversnowandiceeverysingle day, forced towalkontoahighway ,onbusyroads orexpressway because thesidewalks ofthese bridges arenotcleared ,it'ssimply not right.Manyofthesecitizens areelderly , alotofthemareparents withchildren and, quitefrankly ,it'sdisgraceful .Somehow ,I don'tknowwhen,wedetermine dthat pedestrians arejustnotthatimportant anymore . Theonepersonal observation isthe sidewalks fromleading fromPittston Avenue toSouthSidetodowntownonSpruce Street, it'salmost ironic thatthereisaportion ofthesidewalk about50feetwidethat fronts theUniversity ofScranton soccer field.It'salways shoveled andalways clearofsnowandicewhiletherestofthe sidewalks onthebridge gounshoveled , untreated anduncaredfor.SoIthankyou theUniversity forthatpartofit,but, however ,itreally wouldbegreatIthinkif theUniversity wouldbecome anevenbetter neighbor anddosomething manyofour citizens wouldappreciate .Somaybethey1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 couldstepup,usetheirresources andclear andmaintainallofthesidewalks onthis expressway ,notjustthe50feetoftheir sidewalk .Iknowthehundreds of Scrantonians thatwalkbackandforthalong thatrouteeverysingledaywouldappreciate akindgesture justlikethat.That'sallI havefornow.

Iamextremely concerned and disturbed regarding therecent discovery thatcityemployees mayhaveimproperly received pension benefits .Itseemssofar asifeveryone involved doesn'teither remember anything orissaying thatit wasn'ttheirfault.Pleading ignorance is unacceptable .Wemustholdpeople accountable fortheiractions.Iagreewith mycolleagues thatapublic hearing is definitely warranted andIbelieve that therearetwoserious questions thatmustbe addressed :First,whatrecourse doesthe cityhavetoceasepayments andorrecover improper payments fromtherecipients ?That question willberaised nextWednesday when1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 thePension Boardvotestoappoint ahearing examinerwhowilldetermine iftheexcess payments should shopand/oriftheretiree willberequired topaybackanymoney.The Boardwillthendecide howtoproceed based onthefindings oftheexaminer . Second,whataretheproper protocols andprocedures forvetting and approving pension payments ,including payments tiedtoretirement incentives ?Who wasresponsible formaking thesedecisions ?
