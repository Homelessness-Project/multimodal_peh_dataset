OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED JULY 17, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have three comments . So when we're looking at 3-A, there was $1,041 to the BMI Music Group for Parks and Rec Professional Services . Mr. Voldenberg , if we could just ask the question as to what that money's going towards . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 When we're looking at 3-B, I know that some appointees from the fire department have been sent over to the pension board. Can we get an answer as to when they are going to appoint -- when that Mayor's going to appoint that individual to the board? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we haven't. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And then the last thing to point out, Item 3-G, 96 percent of the Parks and Rec overtime budget has been spent up until this point in time. And that's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . In collective bargaining agreements , the firefighters ' contract is now out 477 days, police 361 days. I saw that Mr. Ufberg picked up a nifty $44,000 last month. That was in the Controller 's Report. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 And the 7-T, the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Clerical Union, you may note that under financial impact the legislative cover sheet says none. And how many people are in the Clerical Union? Did you ever find out? MR. SMURL: Oh, they did tell me, 57. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yes, 57. So that's $114,000 to pay them for going back to January 1st of this year, which is not necessarily , you know, a terrible problem when you look at the Controller 's Report and you see that the contingency fund still has $600,000. But it's something that, you know, should have been in there in the legislative sheet. That was easy to put down, you know, because it's already affecting this year's budget. So to say financial impact, none, hey, I could do the math and so could they. So the residency requirement , did you have an executive session on that yet? MR. SMURL: Yes, we did. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And they have on their financial impact, none. Does 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that mean that anybody who lives outside of the city limits is going to pay the wage tax? MR. SMURL: I did not discuss that this evening . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, well, somebody should ask that because that would be a financial impact because those who currently have waivers , do they not pay wage tax? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, they do. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yes, they do. So I'd like some clarification on that. Tonight 's legislation has four MOUs, Lindy Creek, City Hall, stormwater improvements and the pedestrian crosswalk repairs for three intersection s which, you know, ARPA funding I understand . My only comment on that is, I do hope that somebody takes a look at long-term maintenance requirements that we don't invest in projects like this and then let them crumble over the years and not maintain them, kind of like the pedestrian buttons in the downtown , you know. They look fine on paper. But it takes a commitment on the part of the city to maintain them long-term. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 5-C, safety improvements for hearing and sight impaired at three intersection s. What's this business of the deadline that they have under other notes that the deadline was July 12th at 5 p.m. I got kind of lost at that point reading the backup. Does that mean we missed the deadline or this is urgent or what? So if you could explain that in Fifth Order. 5-D, the Stafford Meadow Brook Watershed Restoration , also in the notes there it says about the -- what is the total estimate . It is higher than the amount that can be requested . I got lost there too. Could you explain that on the legislative cover sheet? And exactly why are we removing the legislation under retaining wall, 5-B? MR. SMURL: The engineer -- our city engineer found something that wasn't correct in the bidding . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Okay, that makes sense. So you have one more session next week and then you're off for August. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Are we still on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 track with the audit? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : That's good. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . You know, it's a sad day in our city right now that a cowardly chicken Delawarean former nine-year-old Scranton ian walks away and we're being insulted . Biden insults us every day by saying Scranton . There are no cowards in Scranton . There are no politicians in this city that ever, ever quit. They'll stay in it until the day they die no matter what. He's disenfranchised for all of those that voted for him for the coward, both Republican and Democrats . Council 's duty is to respect our wishes. And our wishes are today that the Biden signs be removed from this city. From Intersection 81, the expressway we're being embarrassed by him even mentioning Scranton . We had presidents in wheelchairs, mentally or whatever , it still went to the end no matter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 what. They didn't quit. But a Delawarean , he quit and he mentions Scranton all the time. I'm disappoint ed with the Mayor that's praising him in front of his old house where he was born. Why doesn't she praise his record what he didn't do for the City of Scranton ? But he sure in hell did everything for Delaware . Joe Biden is not a Scrantonian . He's an absolute disgrace that he walked away what he's doing and keeps mentioning Scranton . And my message to him is, Joe, don't mention Scranton . We don't believe in you. We want nothing to do with you. We only want a leader. And you're not a leader. You chickened out and you ran. And that's not what we're about. Scranton ians -- and you guys have been around a long time. I'm here 81 years -- are fighters. No matter what it is, we always came to the aid to help whoever, whatever , wherever it was, including our legislator s that were here, good, bad, or indifferent . But they never quit. And for him to walk away sucks. I mean, the Mayor wanted to have my trailers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 towed out of here when I had them for Trump. She wasn't successful . Those trailers were here for a purpose . And when we had out in -- we're disgraced in Butler, the idiot cop climbs the roof without a weapon in his hand. That's the story of the Keystone cops. And then the Director says, oh, we didn't have enough people. What the hell was everybody else doing walking around there taking picture s of this guy? Trump could have been dead. But more important ly, the sad part is a fireman died saving his family and that's a tragedy . Two other people are wounded because of incompetence . Everyone that was there that allowed this to happen and disgraced all of us in the United States as Americans should be fired. Not this one or that one, clean sweep, because you are very incompetent . You didn't do your damn job. You're caring a gun and a badge. You're there to use it and none of them did. And they have plenty of time to do their job. I give credit to the Governor for having flags dropped to half mast in honor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 of the firefighter that died. That's what we're about. Joe Biden isn't about us. Joe Biden is about him. And now he wants Kamala in there so that she could pardon Hunter and possibly him. This is an absolute joke. But the thing about it is, Obama isn't supporting her because he owns and controls Joe Biden because it's been Obama's administrative policies that we've watched Biden utilize and put in place. This is what disgraced all of us. And I still didn't see the Ukraine flag or the Israeli flags. Are we that chicken , cowardly in this city we can't represent the people that are being butchered and murdered ? I paid for them. At least you guys could stand up for what's right and put the flags up where the hell they belong. Thank you. Honor us as Scranton ians because we are Scranton ians. We're not Joe Biden's breed. Remember that. MR. SMURL: Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I'd just like to bring the residents of this city up to date on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 actions that I filed in Federal Court. ECTV wanted to be excused from litigation . So I had to file an amended complaint with the Federal Court. I don't know if the Federal Court thought that I'd just walk away because my complaint was really on firm ground. But I don't know what Judge Bloom was thinking . So I amended my complaint . I don't think ECTV or the city or any of the parties here should be allowed to walk away. I think this is a very legitimate case. I think the judge is going to see that it's a legitimate case. I don't think people hire outside legal teams to deal with illegitimate claims. And I think they thought this was going to be just quickly brushed away, but that hasn't happened . And I think the Scrantonians need to realize that you have to be honest with yourself as Scrantonians . You've been quitters for a long time. I listened to Mr. Bolus stand here at the podium and speak. And I disagree with many things he said here today. The one thing I disagree with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 most is that for 30 years we were in distress . Chris Doherty torpedo ed this city and almost destroyed it. And yet, we build a park in the downtown Scranton to honor him. It's ridiculous . We have so many problems in this city and we're confronted with a Council that's unprepared to make the changes necessary to turn this city around. And they're not the first Council that hasn't been able to do that. There's been many. Some were elected as state reps, some went out and, you know, talked a good game. We had a former Councilman here that got elected Mayor and ended up going to jail for public corruption . But he didn't get charged with the crimes he really should have been charged with. So we really haven't been well represented by the courts or the district attorney or federal law enforcement . We've been just cut out to spin in the wind. And it's been a terrible tragic situation for this city as its population continues to decline . I remember when Chris Doherty was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Mayor, he put up all these silly little signs saying restore the pride. And you think that all the resident s in Scranton were drinking magic Kool-Aid as he built parking garages we couldn't pay for, looted the city's pension plan. I mean, the list goes on and on, millions and millions of dollars spent at Nay Aug Park, street sweeper and a paving machine , paving machine just left out to weather and scrap. And, you know, you take a look at the grant money that you're spreading around here and the laws you are creating . Now, I have a second federal lawsuit coming because I told Mr. Smurl and this Council that was I going to deal with the Department of Licensing and Inspections . So I filed something there. They're the next group that I'm going to deal with. And, you know, the tragic thing is, I don't think that your qualify of life ordinance s are constitutional . And I know for absolute fact that, you know, I had District Justice Farrell go out of her mind until my stenographer showed up and I explained to her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 what the city did with their ticket. And I'm going to be going to motion's court soon to get a hearing to deal with an appeal I have there. And I just find it so troubling with all the corruption that you had in Licensing and Inspections that the person who brought that issue to the city had to move outside the city and the Council members wouldn't deal with it and neither would the Mayor. And I just think that when that gets to Federal Court -- and, I mean, I see your thing here no handouts. I mean, I don't know, I think when I walk up there and serve you, I don't think that will be a problem . You know, what are you going to say to a federal judge when the judge says here's your Home Rule Charter and these are the rights and responsibilities of a Council member and you let all of this corruption here just fester and do nothing and get enraged when somebody will bring up that you aren't following the very laws you created . It's the most troubling thing. But that as Americans , we're used to political 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 corruption . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Amy Cusick. MS. CUSICK: Good evening , Council . My name is Amy Cusick. I am from West Scranton , President and a founder of Chris's Miracles From Heaven. As you guys know, we have been working tirelessly and endlessly at Washburn Street Cemetery . First and foremost , I want to give special thanks to Mr. McAndrew , Mr. Schuster , and President Smurl for all of your help during this time. I just want to give you guys an update. We are making very good progress . But we are getting into the tougher areas of the cemetery . We're getting into a lot higher grass areas. We're getting into the tougher brush part. There's a lot of trees that are down that we need to get cut up. We definitely need more equipment . So if anybody can give us a hand with more equipment , we will gladly take that. Trash removal is now becoming a problem because we are picking up the trash that just was left there in the high grass. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 And the trash dump is now getting overloaded. We are also looking since now the grass is being cut down, we are finding a lot of portion of the stones are now down. So we need to find some people to come in and hopefully up right these stones. Our goal is to also get some gravel for the roadway . There is really bad divots in the road. And if you don't watch it, especially if you are going through in a rain storm, you will bottom out your vehicle if it's not a truck. Also, we have encountered numerous sunken graves at the cemetery , numerous . And some of these are veterans . So we're also looking for some topsoil so we could fill in those graves so that it's not only just a safety hazard for those visiting their loved ones but also to give those buried in the cemetery the proper dignity that they deserve . While at the cemetery on Saturday , I drove around and was just taking a glance at where we stand. And I notice that the flag that is on the huge flag pole in the veteran 's section is now missing . I have no idea where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 that went to. It was there three weeks ago and now it's missing . So if we could get a flag to put back there, I would greatly appreciate that; and again, to honor those veterans who fought every day for you and I. While cleaning back some of the tough trees we also found stones that have graffiti on them. So that is very heartbreaking as well. So loved to see what we could do to try to remove the graffiti from some of those stones. I also want to give a shout out to the Scranton community . Without their support , their tirelessly hours of volunteer times, this would not be possible . We would not be able to get as far as we have and done as much as we can. Today there was a post on Facebook someone was telling us how great of a job that us and our volunteers are doing. And they commend ed my volunteers . They are working tirelessly . But they asked me why is it up to the volunteer s. What is the city doing? I encourage d them to come here and ask you that in person. But here I am asking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 you once again what is happening with the Washburn Street Cemetery . I will tell you this, Council , that as long as I am here and as long as Chris's Miracles are here From Heaven, the Washburn Street Cemetery will no long be abandon ed and will not -- no longer be forgotten . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. As far as the city, they were cited. It was cited. The citation if it's not paid then goes to the magistrate . And then from there we'll see what happens . As far as the city being involved , the actual employees of the City of Scranton equipment , that's private property . So without permission I don't see any city equipment going on there because of liability problems . MS. CUSICK: Understandable . I was just making it known for the resident s if they could help out, that would be great. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. CUSICK: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , today there was suppose d to be a followup inspection from Code Enforcement over at the cemetery . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 don't think we've gotten anything back yet. So could we just follow up on that to see what occurred or what actions were taken today and to let Code Enforcement know that a lot of work was done by the volunteers and none of that work was done by the owner of the cemetery . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll followup in the morning , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Scott Thomas. MR. THOMAS: It's a long walk up here when everybody 's looking at you. I'm Scott Thomas, CEO of the Scranton Public Library . I want to, first of all, thank you for the authority appointments you're giving. And I want to announce too that -- what time is it? In six minutes the Nancy K. Holmes branch in Green Ridge will be closing . Normally closing a branch is a bad thing. But it will be reopening in November because it's being renovated . And we're renovating it for accessibility . And for energy efficiency it's going to have a new entrance with a handicap ramp and new restroom that is ADA compliant and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 new flooring and new lighting and new windows. That is a $700,000 project that is paid for half of it from a Keystone grant for library facilities . That's a state grant. And the rest of it was matching that we got through fund-raising and grants. And I just want to let everyone know that while it's closed for these couple of months for good reasons , people could still get service at the Albright Memorial Library and the Lackawanna County Children 's Library right up there and even home delivery . We'll deliver -- we'll have materials sent to your home. And our staff is going to be in the community around Green Ridge with places like the YMCA and the Dunmore Community Center and some of the schools to provide services and programs there just to keep up the community there. So I just wanted to let you know about that and thank you for the authority appointments again. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all on our sign-in list. Anyone else wish to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Good evening , Council . Last week we talked about the weights and measures position . As far as I remember from past Council meetings the position was a state responsibility that Scranton accepted it as the state reimburse d Scranton for the employee under a memorandum of understanding . So we want to remove a job that is paid for by the state for a city resident and move it to a new job that is paid by the people. So you want to take a double loss. Changing over to the charter , the residency requirement , I mentioned prior by what right was the offer made or even arbitration to violate the City Charter . It seems to be referred to as unbreakable bond. We can't enforce residency because they have the unbreakable holy union meditation and we are powerless . In those contract s, there's something called a severability clause. If any part, term, or provision of the agreement is held to be illegal , in conflict with the law or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 otherwise invalid, the remaining portion of that agreement shall be considered in effect but that part is severable and is not affected by the termination . The rights and obligation of the parties shall be construed as enforce d as if the agreement did not contain the particular part, term, or provision held to be illegal or invalid. Is there a severability clause? Who knows, because we can't see the contract because it's not public. And we need to change it right now like loading the boards well in advance of expiration because there is no urgency . The false argument , well, it's okay if they pay city employee tax. But do any of you on Council shop in a supermarket in Pittston ? When you need hardware , do you drive to Home Depot in Wayne County? When you want a McDonald 's fries, do you drive to Clarks Summit? The idea of living in Scranton was not from a distressed city government but a distressed population . This requirement to work in Scranton , those granted the honor, benefits , retirement and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 increase wage that so many do not enjoy. Most city employees go well beyond the city standards of living. Residency was a concept of fairness by the people desiring that the people they employee should be required to support the community that pays them. The action seeks to remove people paying rent or property tax and promotes thanking of Gerrity 's generosity by helping government employees shop elsewhere. We have outsourced America and we seem damn well determined to outsource Scranton . Last, I had a comment last week about President Smurl. And it seems he forgot to pay the rental fees as -- and register the properties . I was going to leave it at that. A simple choice, he chose not to pay what was due or there was something wrong in the city as they did not bill, properly review, or ignored certain parties . But last week in Fifth Order came a hushed lament, oh, this petty thing. The President was sitting on papers to present . The issue came forth and he admitted both prior knowledge and communication with the Council 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 attorney months prior and eventually admitted to concealing the issue of hundred of other city constituents who had the same problem . Not once was it publically addressed , nor has anyone been called forth who is responsible for this action. It is startling when Council President when directly involved and impacted why he would seek to conceal this petty thing on multiple cases of administrative harm. If an event hundred s of other people have stated who caused it, what punishment has been handed out and why the intentional silence until you were dragged into the light. Good evening . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MARQUIS : Hey, listen, right, let me practice -- what's up Gerald. Let me practice my First Amendment right which is the freedom of speech, right? And I don't want to be cut off. Respect fully, I don't want to be told about my tone. Let me voice my frustration s with this community . I just fought off two men by myself at the pavilion while I have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 telling you guys to send police -- have a police presence there. If you pull up the videos, you'll see me saying this in a brown sweater . I was telling you to send police presence down there. Do yo understand ? I should not have to go down there and had to police these people myself or -- or -- MR. SMURL: Anthony , you can't scream though. You got to -- MR. MARQUIS : But I'm upset. I'm upset. MR. SMURL: Okay. I understand . MR. MARQUIS : Let me voice my frustrations , please. I'm not yelling at nobody. MR. SMURL: You're too loud. MR. KING: Excuse me, I learned myself the closer I get to this mic the more distorted I get. So when you get close and you're real loud like that, I can't understand it because it gets muffled . That's all I'm telling you. Go ahead. MR. MARQUIS : Okay. So I should not have to be down here fighting the community by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 myself. I get up here and I defend each and every one of you up there at the Council , each and every one you of you against the people in the crowd who have something to say about you. So if I could defend all of you guys, you guys should defend me on when I'm on the streets trying to clean up the community for our children . I'm out here literally putting my life on the line. There's people out here talking about robbing me, killing me, all of this -- excuse me, S-H-I-T, because I want to help the children ? If I have to go down there and fight again because our police, our police is not policing the community , God damn it, I'd do it again. MR. SMURL: All right. You're finished , Anthony . MR. MARQUIS : I will do it again. MR. SMURL: You're finished . MR. MARQUIS : I'm sorry. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxes paid. You know, I was on the Harrison Avenue bridge a couple of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 days ago. I go across it quite often. And if you look at the walls, the pedestrian walls, there's big cracks in it. There's cracks forming in it. So I think it's about time we look into that before they become a little more serious than just some cracks. They need to be sealed or whatever and that's a shame. That's a brand new bridge. So I don't know who did what, but not -- not good. DR. ROTHCHILD : Mr. Dobrzyn , last week I had asked that they get PennDOT over there because of the graffiti that was on there. I wasn't -- I asked for PennDOT to go over there because of the graffiti . But I wasn't aware of crack. So we could add that to my request for that. MR. DOBRZYN : There's some cracks right in the wall, the pedestrian wall. If it wasn't there you'd fall over the side. They're not real big cracks, but that bridge is, what, 10 years old maybe? Maybe it's not. I don't remember that far back, not dates anyway. And 6-A this residency , I have a little concern about that. I don't want a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 whole bunch of people from Moscow or Montdale or Waverly working in our town and taking the change home. That's a little much. I don't know what could be done about it. But, you know, it's -- and on pension losses, you know, two times we have recently within a year or so ago experienced some damage to the pension . And many years ago it was like 26 million dollars , the firemen and police. And the thing about it was, it was probably a couple weeks ago or months ago I picked up the paper and the Crypto Coin had returned all the money plus the profit but they didn't return anything to the pension plans. I mean, come on, you know, like who is in charge of it? It's really a shame. I hope that November works out pretty well because I'd like to thank all the people that pushed certain people. We had a recent -- Joe Biden was brought up this week. Well, you know, there were 28 lies or total mistruths in that debate and everybody just bounced on Joe Biden and bounced on Joe Biden. Even the liberal networks bounced on Joe Biden, CNN, MSNBC. They had four or five 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 editorials preaching about Joe, you know, he's losing it. He's not what he used to be. And I don't see how he could have been anything else with everybody in the country pouncing on him like that. So that being said, I'll run with what we have. But it gets to a point where you almost get tempted to go independent and let them think you are not going to vote for them just so they behave themselves for a change. Or you could switch back when the next year so you could vote for mayor or whatever . We have foundation s like the Heritage Foundation . They are a nonprofit , 501C3. They get a billion and half dollars donated from a billionaire just to make trouble . They pay our Supreme Court Justice 's wife Ginni Thomas a $125,000 every three months. They send them on half million dollar yacht cruises of Indonesia . So -- and sorry for the attempt , but don't beat up on the Democrats . Beat yourselves up. The guy was a registered Republican . Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. MARGAVITCH : Good evening , Council , Mark Margavitch . I have two ordinance s that I was looking for some clarity on. I don't know if you guys could access it there -- up there quick on your laptops or -- no? Could you guys look at the ordinances or do you want me to bring them up? I could bring them to Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Give them to Kathy and she'll give them to us. MR. MARGAVITCH : It's one part is from the rental registration and the other one is from the quality of life. So I was just wondering as you guys are looking over them and ladies, if you could give me any clarity what you believe the quality of life violation I had highlighted as well as some of the explanation on the family exemption . In the definition area it was not explained . So if you could tell me what qualifies for a family exemption as well. MR. SMURL: (Inaudible ) quality of life citation ? MR. MARGAVITCH : No, I wanted clarity on what quality of life, number 21 is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 and also the explanation of the family exemption . Who is that? MR. SMURL: (Inaudible .) MR. MARGAVITCH : Are we going to do that on the record or -- MR. SMURL: Pardon? MR. MARGAVITCH : Are we going to do that on the record? MR. SMURL: I'll have an answer for you next week. MR. MARGAVITCH : Next week, okay. All right. I'll just come back during Fourth Order. We could talk about it then if you want. And lastly, the investigation that was done to the Licensing and Inspection 's Department , when that investigation was done, was it just a questionnaire of the employees or was it actually the person actually doing the investigation ? MR. SMURL: I believe it was an investigation . ATTY. GILBRIDE : There was a complete investigation done by an attorney who spoke with all the individuals involved . MR. MARGAVITCH : So it was just a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 questionnaire though. ATTY. GILBRIDE : No, he met with them and had a conversation that lasted a period of time as long as he felt -- MR. MARGAVITCH : Just conversations though, okay. I just wanted to see if there was actually an investigation done. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Well, that's typically how an investigation is done. You ask questions . MR. MARGAVITCH : That's it. Okay. Okay. All right. MR. SMURL: (Inaudible .) MR. MARGAVITCH : No, no, no, I just wanted to show that. All right. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, what I -- Marie Schumacher , city person. What was going down was a picture of the -- a part of the lookout on the Scranton Pocono Highway . Mr. King talked about it not too long ago. And I don't know, maybe it just encouraged people to come out and destroy it. It's just as you could see -- and I'll stay and show the other two later. It is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 a mess and something needs to be done. I don't know what it is. But I would think there could be a television put there so it -- people -- so that they could -- somebody in the city could look at it and see who's doing it, what they're using to destroy it. And I just -- something has to be done. That is a really big thing for the city. And I hope next week you'll have something to tell us that -- how that can be I guess policed is a better word. MR. KING: Is it graffiti again, Marie, or is it just garbage ? MS. SCHUMACHER : No. It's -- somebody has taken something and taken the stones out around the top. MR. KING: Really. DR. ROTHCHILD : I believe we had DPW out there in the past. But, Mr. Voldenberg , can we get them over there again to see what needs to be done to clean it up? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : You know, maybe we could get it on a regular maintenance or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 monitored by Parks and Rec. MR. SMURL: (Inaudible .) DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, from the picture I could see the overgrown weeds too that were there. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, but the big thing is those stones that make -- that probably -- whatever they call it there. MR. SMURL: We have to make a request to the police chief. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'll ask that you send it over. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll make that request , sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. That's what I wanted to get that back. Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . We're the Electric City. We have a proud history , many historical buildings and an understanding of difference between right and wrong. Our Mayor doesn't get that. Her historical points are photo ops. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 She dims the lights to the Art Haus and then shows up like a poorly made bed in a coat that was better suited for a scarecrow on a farm in Oregon. She couldn't put herself into a car seat to show up at the opening at the Ritz Theater . Now come 301 days from now, May 20th, 2025, she's going to be begging for votes and begging for forgiveness . A week ago I asked my questions to be answered . None of them were. So I told this body, everybody watching it's going to liken the five of you to Turner Classic the Wizard of Oz. Apparently like those characters , the five of you in this room are fictitious . You raise your right hand. You take an oath for the people of the City of Scranton . But yet, two and a half to three of you check all of her boxes while the rest of us have an extra set of doors in the city. If we don't check the boxes, nothing gets done. Four hundred sixty-nine days until the general election , November 4th, 2025. Now, with this police testing there are officers in other cities, one that is Scranton strong, West 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Side tough, graduate of Scranton Prep; but yet he can't work here because of the test and the fact that it's set at 70 where most cities accept it at 55. Now, I'm getting good word that Civil Service Commission approved this with less than three people, all right. If that's true, the lawsuits are endless . I guess that's going to be more money going to Ufberg. He gets paid $942 a day on average . How about crosswalks for the schools, the parks, main thorough fares? She doesn't care about her city. She doesn't care about the safety. Last June, Wilkes-Barre set up a curfew. It seems to work, 10:00. And the ones that disobey it, they get sent to community service . It seems like Luzerne County and smaller cities are doing it better than us. We should be leading by example . Instead , we're the epitome of the area. We're number 185 in US news and world report for the worst looking cities in the country , not far behind Reading . We're not far behind Allentown . We're not far behind Philadelphia . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 When the railway system comes through it's going to make it much worse. When are the pools going to open, answer that question . Give us a date for each one. How about the residency requirement ? You know, we're just catering to an expansion team. Half of her people can't even vote for her. Like I said, Ufberg, $942 a day. You know, I told you how to fix the roads. You have two gentlemen right here excellent at their craft ready to chomp at the bit, but yet, the five of you remain ineffective . History will show you either do your job effectively or be worried about 301 and 469. Let the countdown begin. This city needs each and every one of you. These roads are horrible . I told each and every one of you how to fix them. If you don't want to fix them, million dollars out of the pocket for the City of Scranton on a yearly basis. A dollar saved is a dollar earned, 2 million dollars . All you have to do is address it. The utilities , it seems like each and every one of you are afraid of the utilities , 1.9 percent increase for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Sewer Authority , yet it's set at 6.4. All of you spoke in front of the public about this. And I'm telling you the rate increase is higher than that number. And yet, you do nothing about it. I'm not going away. Difference is, the five of you could be replaced. History will tell what you do next. The city is looking for change for the better. Be part of the solution or be part of the problem . Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just some comments . The speaker mentioned tonight that President Biden did nothing for the City of Scranton . I beg to differ to the tune of 67 million dollars in ARPA funds which 23 million of that will be used for stormwater remediation which has been greatly needed in the city and those projects are all in process . We're upgrading parks. We did Oakmont . We're doing Robinson Park. We're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 doing Nay Aug Park, which the first phase of that pool will open in September of 2025. Connell Park pool is being fixed, replaced. Weston Field, it's going to be a skate park and a new pool down there. Small business loans, grants have gone out throughout the city. We received money for revenue loss, street paving, City Hall improvements , upgraded technology , equipment for our fire and police department . So I think that President Biden did pretty well by us. That's all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? I'm sorry, Mr. King. MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. From last week some of the question s that were asked of the administration , one regarding 5-C, the removing of the Licensing and Inspection requirements for the commercial scales and gasoline service stations . So I want to make sure that we got absolute confirmation that the state's going to take over this duty and the administration said yes. As for Scranton being the only municipality in the state that completes the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 weight and measures , they said Scranton was the only individual municipality listed as (inaudible ) and all others were county based. And they stated that with our MOU Section 11, either party may terminate this MOA for reasons upon 60 days' written notice to either party. So they are assuring us that the weights and measures piece of the city operations will be taken over by the state. I asked about the pave cut inspector because the pave cut inspect or is going to move into the traffic division . I wasn't sure if the position was being removed altogether or if it was just changing department s. And they stated that the pave cut position has been moved to the traffic department and the city is currently revamping the pave cut process in consult ation with our city engineer . The online application form has been updated and formal sessions have been held with PA Water and with UGI. And they're going to develop the process but DPW manager is currently inspecting pave cuts. Two issues I think as a Council and I know we're going to be going into a break as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 of August. But I hope to have some conversations on our fire billing process . I got another bill from an individual who got a reply from his insurance company about why they're not going to cover the bill that was sent out by the city for a fire that had occurred . So I think it's something that we do need as a Council to address and the other issue is homelessness . Some -- the Supreme Court issued their -- where they stand on homelessness with municipalities . Wilkes-Barre has stated what their plan is going to be at least a start of their plan. I did notice that the Mayor said that the City of Scranton -- from what I gathered from the article isn't going to be doing anything at this point as far as I could see. So I would like Council to start to discuss what we're going to do in terms of our municipality and homelessness . Any other comments I'll reserve for on the question . And that's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a comment that, you know, it may have been brought up earlier but I just wanted to mention the passing of Richard Leonori . He was a friend who was 73 years old and a very talented architect and had worked in the past with Marywood University , the Lackawanna Historical Society . He was on HARB and the former chairman as was mentioned earlier in our caucus. And I just wanted to give my thought s and prayers with his husband , his long-time husband Eddy Smith and their family. That's all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : So last week I brought up because in 7-F where we -- the allocating funds for crosswalk s. And I asked for a schedule and a list. We had a lengthy list. The list doesn't mean it's going to get done. But it's -- the crosswalks , the amount we have in the city. So what we got was -- the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 city (inaudible ) a list of crosswalks in need of maintenance with an initial focus on heavy traffic roads near schools. So my understanding and I hope they are that schools are going to be a priority . So we'll keep our eye on that. And a maintenance process -- because I asked for a schedule , a maintenance schedule to be associated with that when they do them all for the DPW team to develop an internal crosswalk maintenance schedule going forward . Attached is a spreadsheet , like I said, that I received but it's huge. But I just want to make sure when they say that, you know, it's a priority that these crosswalks are done before school. Let's kind of hold them to it and make sure we get something in writing saying, okay, it's a priority so when are you going to start. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with that question , sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Because we're going to blink and the school year will be starting . What else do I have? So Mr. Mancini brought up about the pave cuts. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 And we have been talking about pave cuts and the process all summer, probably we started in the spring, you know, do we have a pave cut inspector , no, Reilly Associates are going to do it. Now DPW is doing it. But we also touched upon the utility companies and their responsibility and when don't -- when they don't commit or they don't, you know, do it in a responsible way, we're suppose d to go after them. It's written in the ordinance we're suppose d to get some type of money or we're suppose d to penalize them. I know you brought it up, Jess. And so I don't think we got an update on that if we're charging them or we should or the reasons why. And, you know, we talked about the revenue we normally receive from the utilities during that process pulling permits to do pave cuts. And we got different information every time. We heard that, well, no, we're not charging or maybe there's some type of litigation or maybe there's this. So can we get a followup on everything before we go on recess, just a clarification on them points 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 that we keep bringing up and we don't seem to get straight answers ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that's all. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm sorry, if I may add, I meant to mention before but was thrown off when honoring Richard . For the pave cuts, I did meet with administration yesterday about it because we all have some very valid concerns about them. And it, you know, it appears that the inspection s that were being done in the past, you know, wasn't a whole lot that was included in those inspection s that it was more about the size of the cuts and really was not fully inclusive and comprehensive like it should have been. And I think there are a lot changes that are needed and I believe they have the understanding of where the concerns are and what changes need to be made so that the pave cuts are being properly inspected . And then we can better hold utility companies accountable . But, you know, it truly does seem to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 be related to the streets that we're getting complaints on potholes on and those might be the same streets that where there were utility cuts. And so, you know, I believe with the revamping of it whether it has to be outsourced or what that I'm hopeful in the future we're be able to have better pave cut inspections and repair our roadways . MR. SCHUSTER : If I could offer some comment on this as well, sorry to jump in here. I've been talking about this going back to 2020. I met with Tom Preambo . I met with the pave cut inspector at the time. Some of my fears here are at the time they said they were starting to develop a process . That's the same answer we got today they're developing a process . At that point in time I was told one third had been restored , one third there may not be permits. One third are past the two year mark. The two year mark is what concerns me. After two years, the city is responsible for the restoration of these project s. And if we were develop ing a process three to four years ago and it hasn't been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 developed yet, what are we doing to ensure that we're tracking our pave cuts? That's one thing is tracking the pave cuts. And the other one is ensuring that they are being restored . And I don't think either of those two things are being done. So if we could ask as well, how are we tracking our pave cuts, are 100 percent of them being tracked and how are we ensuring that these project s are being restored ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank. DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree with Councilman Schuster that we need to stay on top of this issue to make sure that that process is put in place and that we're able to finally correct the issue. MR. SMURL: All right. I have just a few comments . The first one is 702 Crown Avenue again. I realize that Code Enforcement has been there many times. I know in the past eight weeks they have been cited six times. The place looks like a junkyard now. There's refrigerator s, appliances . There's garbage all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 over the place. And, Frank, again, I'm going to ask go up and cite again. It is really a terrible sight. And it looks like a landfill . So and I know it's an out-of-town landlord again. And I did see on the website there is a phone number there for a property maintenance person. Perhaps we could contact that person. I don't know if they are going to pay any of these, but maybe we could do something to make them get that place cleaned up. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. We reached out to Code Enforcement manager this morning . And he's about to follow up. I'll check on it tomorrow . MR. SMURL: I don't know how often we could cite them but as many times as possible , I guess. Attorney Gilbride , I had asked you to update not only my Council colleague s on the rental registration that was brought up but also the public. So if you have any response for that. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Yes, Mr. President , before I start though if I could just say to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 the public an executive session was held today in regard to employee matters and contract negotiations . Mr. President , in regard to the task that you ordered me to undertake last week in regard to the allegations made about your nonpayment of taxes on your properties , I did reach out without having any conversations with you and spoke with the legal office of the city, specifically to Katie Kennedy the First Assistant City Solicitor and asked her to provide me with information that the administration has in regard to the status and/or history of your bill payment . I was provided with an answer. The answer was such that in 2022 Mr. Smurl register ed and paid for his rental properties in the former system OpenGov on or about June 14th of 2023. Mr. Smurl attempt ed to register and pay for his properties for the 2023 year but the payment was stopped . The payment was stopped on Mr. Smurl's property because the city was transitioning to a new system slash platform Tolemi. In 2023 the city was formally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 transitioned to Tolemi for purposes of rental registration s. On or about April 24th, 2024, the city issued rental letters , one to Mr. Smurl as well as to other individuals who had also been affected by this transition . Within two days of you receiving that letter, you appeared at the City Hall here and made payment of your or at least went onto the computer to make payment s for the taxes and any fees that were required . As of my request , you do not have any outstanding bills or debts owed to the city. You have resolved all the matters that were brought up as a result of the transition of the city from OpenGov to Tolemi. By way of background , the letter as was stated by the city due to a right to know inquiry , those letters went out in April of 2024, which is the letter that you received and that within two days of receipt of that letter you had paid. So all of your taxes were paid. The delay according to the administration was as a result of the transitioning and that within two days of receiving notice that the transition 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 occurred and you were able to pay -- you did, in fact, show up and pay.

DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I was happy to see this come our way. I hope that we're successful in obtaining this grant and that the program is successful . It sounds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 like it's a pilot. And they've identified three intersection s to design and use some new technology in order to help those who are visually or hearing impaired . And I think we need more of that in the city. So I think that this is a good start and it will be interesting to see how successful the technology is. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so I remember I think Miss Hodowanitz brought this up about the hearing impaired or blind downtown with regard to, like, downtown the crosswalks because that, you know, the buttons to push the lights weren't working or not all of them were working . So, I mean, 700 grand is a lot of money. And it's only dedicated to three project s that really aren't downtown . So I hope there is enough money left to at least look at it down there or plan to incorporate , you know, this type of technology down there as well. MR.

VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 27, 2024 – AN ORDINANCE – REPEALING THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT FOR CITY EMPLOYEES . MR. SMURL: You've heard reading by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , there was much discussion raised about this last week. I was glad the Scranton Times covered this to get the word out there. They covered the fact that residency will be removed from all CBAs as those CBAs are negotiated . We had an executive session tonight which discussed some of this, some conversations that I didn't realize were happening . I'm going stick with my vote as last week and vote no to this. However , I think between now and Seventh Order there's going to be some more information coming out. Last week I mentioned the possibility of investing in our employees that invest in our city. I think there is a two-fold reason why we would have this, one, city funds are going to those employees and they are coming back to our city and they are remaining in our city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 And number two is that we have great city employees . We have police; we have fire; we have DPW members and employees that they are living on our blocks that are staying in our neighborhood and keeping a presence . I think two reasons why we want to keep these individual s in the city and what I brought up is residency points. The Scranton School District does it. Some other areas do it. And it's a way to invest in these employee s that want to buy a house in the city and remain in the city, something to be done at entrance exams, something to be done at promotion exams. And I think it's something that needs to be left on the table for discuss ion. That's all I have for tonight . MR. KING: On the question , the Scranton Police Department recently had a contract ratified and the arbitrator ruled in favor of Scranton Police that they don't have to live in the city. Since that has happened , we've had all unions approach us with concerns that -- something that's all disparate treatment so that if one class of employees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 isn't require d to live in the city, the other class of employee s should not be require d to live in the city, therefore , guaranteed , guaranteed it will be a loser if this went to -- if this went to a lawsuit . Therefore , I'll be supporting this. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So last week I voted no. I'm going to vote again no this week. And this in no way is not supporting the unions. But it's going to be negotiated anyways. All right. So what I thought last week was it's not fair to the unions that still have to negotiate and have to wait even though they're going to get it because passing this would give administration immediate -- the ability immediately to hire people without being residents . So there was some dialogue that took place during executive session . Are the I's and T's, they're not crossed and dotted yet. So until that happens, I'm going to remain a no. And I also brought up like Mr. Schuster said that, you know, if Joey or Mary live in Scranton and they always, you know, lifelong 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 dream is to be a firefighter or a police officer and they live here and they're going to stay here, they should be -- receive something in the way of points during the interview process or after they're scored when they go through their testing that they should be, you know, should get -- should get ranked higher or preference d because they want to live here. They want to work here. And so I was told in the back room that it's probably -- has to do with Civil Service . But I would still like to see that somewhere in this -- because this is a big decision that every one of us here have to make. And it's going to impact the residents . And I know the Mayor said there is no financial impact. But that's just -- she has data. That wasn't present ed to us today that supports that. So with that said, like I said, I'll remain a no until we get some more information next week. MR. SMURL: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. SMURL: The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

MR. SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of item 7-N. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , there's 17 appointments here tonight , most of which don't expire until at least November or December . Fifteen of these members are being reappointed and will return. Some of these members have even suggest ed how they should be placed on these boards and have been granted that. One 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 resignation has occurred within one year of the member's term which brings me to something I've said several times. We're replacing long term members , long time members of these boards with new individual s that stay for short periods of time. It's my opinion that Mr. Gallagher should not be removed from this board. And I will be voting no tonight for this appointment . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, as I stated last week, whatever happened to rewarding dedication , devotion , hard work and someone who wants to stay. Someone who wants to stay, they should be reappoint ed. This is -- I have nothing personal against Mrs. Schumacher . Like I said, if Mr. Gallagher didn't want to remain, I'd vote for her, simple. But, you know, a year ago it started . I was paying attention . And I'm still paying attention that there's almost like a designed takeover of the Housing Authority . If you look back and think what happened before, they tried remove him early, a year early. Then I don't know, maybe, you know, that was a mistake , tried to remove some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 other board members , a little tactical with -- and I don't know why. I mean, this is just another authority that does great work. But there is something going on here. Like I said, it's some type of -- something 's happening . I'll keep my eye on it. But also, you know, my disgust -- I'm still disgusted that he's not being reappointed. What even disgusts me even more is there's a lot of rumors flying around town that there's even bragging about removing Mr. Gallagher . That disgusts me even more. I hope it's not true like I hope, you know, there's not a pattern of replacing older people only. I hope that's not the case, but, you know, that only disgust s me more if it is true. So of course I'm voting no. MR. KING: On the question , last year when there was an attempt to remove Attorney Gallagher from this board we went back and researched it and realized that he deserved another year because it would have been eight five-year terms. And I fought for that and made sure that Attorney Gallagher got that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 fifth year. I'm not aware that a letter was submitted to the administration to continue in his position . I would say that if Attorney Gallagher 's name was present ed to us to serve in that position again, I would gladly vote for it. MR. SCHUSTER : With that being said, I'd like to make a motion to table. MR. MCANDREW : I'll second that. MR. SMURL: We have a motion to table and a second. MR. KING: On the question , what's the purpose for tabling ? MR. SCHUSTER : If a letter was to be submitted . His term is not up. It's not up until September 27th. MR. KING: Okay. So do we know whether a letter was submitted ? MR. SMURL: The Mayor -- I asked the Mayor if there was a letter submitted or if there was any interest shown by Magistrate Gallagher and I was told, no, there was no letter and nothing was submitted and they haven't spoken in over eight months.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. So I'd like to make a motion to table as the term is not up until September 27th. MR. MCANDREW : I seconded that already . ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , you have a motion and a second. MR. SMURL: So we'll do a roll call on tabling . MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS.

PREVIOUSLY TABLED - FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 61, 2024 - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE ON ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH WOODLAND DESIGN ASSOCIATES , INC. FOR CITY PLANNING AND ZONING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES . MR. SMURL: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-U. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , when this first came up I did have several questions about this. As I got the answers to those questions and I see the way that it's written , it seems it's to -- this is a consultant to help the zoning -- the city zoning officer complete their daily job function s. So we do have a city planner . We do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 have an assistan t city planner . We do have a zoning officer . Now, we're adding a contractor . I will be voting no to this piece of legislation . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So this is another consultant . We have a bunch. We have too many. And none of them or zero has -- they never fulfill their promise of revenue . We got Nossaman Group, all they do is make phone calls and pretend they latch onto some money that we get and claim -- Rubicon , which should be gone is in their third year. We were told million dollars savings first year. Zero savings. It was rolled out once two years ago in July for a week. The garbage was late everywhere . Then it was rolled out again the following year, same thing. Brought them in, they -- most of their employees left. They had all new employees that came in here. And they said, oh, yeah, we're going to roll it out in January , never happened . Then they were suppose d to roll it out in June, never happened . It's a waste of money because all they provide us once in a while they say, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 oh, we have tonnage that was -- tonnage data which we could get free from the landfill . So now I'm hearing they're going to be rolled out not until September . So that's another consultant that we had to deal with. They just don't produce the promised revenues and the zoning, they have -- there's three people that work there. And they were part of crafting the new ordinance . So I don't think they need help understanding it. I don't think they need help working through it. This is just another example of, you know, everybody gets an assistant and it's got to stop. And every year written in the budget, well, this one needs an assistant. This one needs an assistant. You know, Parks and Rec guy got an assistant . Now we have to put out to put the lights up. Like, every time you turn around, you know, we're requested to approve another consultant . No, I think we need to hire the people, you know, the residency waiver is going. We need to hire the right -- because we're always claiming we can't use a residency 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 waiver because we can't get quality people out of 70,000. But guess what, we have to hire the right people with the skill set to do the job and not keep adding consultant s and assistant s to get them through their day. So I'm definitely voting no. MR. SCHUSTER : I'd like to say on top of that the administration has come to us year after year, I think every year since they've been in place for raises and salary increases to adjust for that problem that Mr. McAndrew just stated that we get time and time again. In order to get quality people, we have to increase the salaries . These things have been done over the years and now we're adding another firm. MR. SMURL: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 MS.
