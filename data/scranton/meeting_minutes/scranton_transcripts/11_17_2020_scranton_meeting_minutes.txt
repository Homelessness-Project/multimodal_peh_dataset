MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for all those who have passed away in our community . And just as we have since the beginning of this pandemic , we'll take a moment of silence for all those people in our community and Lackawanna County and in Scranton and our country and around the globe who have passed away from the COVID-19. This pandemic as everyone knows has turned our world completely upside down. But we must remain hopeful and strong. The next few months are going to be extremely difficult . And we will continue to pray for the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they have protection and peace. Whether we are here home in Scranton or abroad, surround ed by many people suffering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together and in place of our anxiety , let us have hope and peace.

MEMORANDUM RECEIVED FROM COUNCIL SOLICITOR DATED NOVEMBER 10, 2020 REGARDING SUGGESTED AMENDMENT TO FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 31, 2020 300 BLOCK OF CENTER STREET ONE-WAY DESIGNATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I had three comment s on Third Order items. I asked them in caucus. But one was with 3-B and also 3-H with the CARES Act funding . I guess the comment on it would be, these seem to be new fees. We've already submitted for about $800,000 to the county. We've only been partially funded for about 500,000. And it seems that we have another 300,000 here related to that. And I think we need to be careful with how we're spending this money and keep a close eye on this. It really concerns me how much is being spent there. And then recycling I see was added to those COVID funds as well, which is something I think we need to get a little deeper into there. And then I did have a question with regards to the working draft and the finance statement s that Kohanski and Company they stated they were going to provide in their correspondence . It appears that we're still waiting on some -- they're still waiting on some outstanding items from administration and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I don't think any of us see where they received those items. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the Third Order items? Okay. I just have one in reference to Item 3-I, the term sheet for the Tax Anticipation Note. There was a typographical error regarding the paying agent. It was incorrectly stated on the term sheet and has now been corrected to reflect that Fidelity Bank is the paying agent so just to take note of that. If there are no other comments , they are received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I have a couple. Just a reminder that garbage pickup is on schedule this week. And also I believe City Hall and everything is closed on Thursday next week for Thanksgiving . So garbage will be picked up Friday and Saturday , pushed back next week. Also, there's -- Fall Leaf and Recycling Program , all leaves must be placed in biodegradable brown paper bags. The City's ran 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 out of bags. But they could still be purchased at your local hardware and home improvement stores. All collection s will be from the curbside of streets and avenues . No collection s in courts or alleys. No loose piles, no plastic bags, no household trash in leaf bags. The remaining weeks for that schedule are next week the week of November 24th and also the week of December 7th. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. So every year Catholic Social Services and Friends of the Poor have Christmas Gifts For Kids Program . This year they have to do it a little differently . What people need to do is either go to the Friends of the Poor's Facebook page and online they could register (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, you're freezing up. We can't hear you. MR. MCANDREW : -- address as well as insurance card, birth certificate or some proof of ID for each child. Those who do not have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 access to a computer or smartphone should call Mary at 570-207-2283, extension 2110. And this registration is started already . So it's Monday the 16th until Friday the 20th. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Mark, you were -- we got most of what you said but you were freezing up a little bit there just so you know. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : You're welcome . Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I have one. I want to mention there are free holiday meals being provided by the NAACP Lackawanna Organizing Committee . So if anyone is in need for this holiday , they could contact the NAACP. They have a Facebook page, NAACP Lackawanna County. Their phone number is 570-234-9794. Meals are being prepare d by three local restaurants and can be delivered or picked up between the hours of 10 a.m., and 3 p.m., on Thanksgiving Day. And in order to receive the meals, people need to RSVP by November 24th. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And I think the three restaurant s that are providing meals which are all very good restaurants include Paradise Soulfood , West Side Flava's and Papis Kitchen . So thanks to those restaurant s for donating their food and services to those in need. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Anyone else? I have two. Just to announce that this Thursday we will have a budget work session . Council will meet with the Mayor and the Business Administrator , Carl Deeley at 6 p.m. It will be live on YouTube as well as live on ECTV. So the plan is to go through the budget department by department . We'll start off with revenues and then we'll go into the expenditures by department . So I think Councilman Donahue mentioned about sending any questions in advance if you can do that if you have any major topics or questions . I think that will be helpful just so that the administration would come, you know, prepare d to have those answers if there are specific questions . The second -- I just want to take a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 moment. The second thing I would like to say is in honor of Bob McGoff, I just want to say a few words about Bob McGoff. So Bob McGoff as all of you know was the long-time President of Council , long-time Council member. It will be -- and I had the honor of serving with him for a number of years on Council when I first was elected back in 2014. And it will be five years this Thursday , November 19th that our friend and colleague , Bob McGoff lost his battle with cancer. And I want to take a second as Wayne Evans always did at our Council meetings by reading Bob McGoff's words that he spoke at a Council meeting about his struggle with cancer. And Bob McGoff said, "Just one thing I would like to mention . I would just like to say that I know all of us have been affected in some way by this insidious disease . And I would just encourage that anyone that knows someone who is fighting this or dealing with treatments involved with cancer to be a friend. One of the things that happens to cancer patients and those under treatment , depression is a very significant aspect of it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 And believe it or not, simply sitting down and talking with people, going watching a television show, bringing dinner and having something to eat with them goes a long way to helping people deal with that. And I would just encourage that if you know someone , please be a friend and be part of the helping process ." Those were Bob McGoff's words. Bob McGoff was someone who understood the importance of even the smallest gesture . Someone that we all will have great respect for and I will always personally admire and his words are worth mention ing once again in his honor and his memory. Bob McGoff was one of the strongest people that I have ever sat next to or seen. He went through his battle with cancer and I never heard him once complain about it. Still showed up to Council meeting s, still showed up to meetings with the administration and still led the Council without missing a beat. And he really was a true gentleman . That's the one thing that I will always remember about Bob McGoff. Even when things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 would get heated and people would be on opposite sides of the fence on an issue, he always kept his cool and always brought everybody back to the table and back to the middle and kept everyone really grounded and really kept the City together at a very, you know, perilous moment in terms of our finances . He was outstanding in that regard. And the one thing I will remember about him is, you know, in 2015 when my wife had our first son Jack, one of the first gifts I receive d was from Bob McGoff. He bought him a pair of his first sneakers. So that's the type of guy that he was. He was just very down to earth, very compassionate and a very, very kind person. So our thought s and our prayers are with Marita and the entire McGoff family on the five year anniversary of Bob's passing . And someone that this Council -- he made such an impact that this Council and future Councils will never forget. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 At this time, would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Patricia Nestor, Fay Franus, Dave Dobrzyn and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, could you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Patricia Nestor as follows : Can someone please elaborate on the mayor’s intentions to reduce guns & ammunition by over 50%? She posted it on Facebook under plans for 2021 budget with any further comments . If she goes after the second amendment , she might want to budget for some lawsuits . The second submission submitted by Fay Franus as follows : Council , I understand there will be no tax 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 increase this year in the city. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out. Following in Mayor Doherty 's footsteps I see. No Tax increase because the Mayor is running for election . Get ready folks for the taxes to skyrocket in 2022. How does the Mayor justify giving raises to city employees AND creating jobs when people are losing their small businesses all over this city and people don't have food? Can any of you please tell me how this is right? Any of you? Please express how each of you feel about this. Create jobs? My gosh don't we already have enough assistants to assistants ? The Mayor has a chief of staff then there is an assistant to the chief of staff --then an assistant to the city lawyer.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 The list is endless and yet the Mayor wants to create more jobs? Does Virginaia McGregor get paid for all of her advice? Past Scranton mayors had a secretary and one lawyer. Scranton is NOT Philadelphia . If you approve these budget items to create jobs and give raises when we are still a distressed city with people losing their homes then you need to resign. Are there still people furloughed ? If so who are they? This question has been asked and never answered yet. Why can't there we a list of who is laid off and who is already brought back to work? Why the secrecy ? What aren't we suppose to know that is such a secret? And why?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Also the garbage fee is set for $300 again. More than likely illegally because what comes in is more than what goes out to run the DPW department . Then you use the rest to pay your other bills which is against the city law. The garbage fee money coming in from residents is ONLY to be used to pay for running the Department of Public Works nothing else but every year this city has used that extra money we send in to pay all of your other bills! That is why there is a lawsuit pending . We caught you and you are continuing to do it again. ILLEGALLY ! And 75% of city residents are still paying for the 25% that are still NOT paying for over a decade. But you don't care-- what is the strategy I heard about? Or is that a secret as well that we shouldn 't know about?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 My neighbors still don't pay for their garbage pickup since 2011. Or longer. Are the people who pay soon this year going to get $30,00 off of their bill to$270 ? -- Is that mentioned in the budget? We need to know now. So tell us now. So here we go again I ask questions with undoubtedly no replies --but the people should know that you sit there and refuse to answer my questions because you definitely don't want us to know the answers . If by chance you answer one question that surely is not sufficient . If I were there in person I would stand there and say WELL YOU DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTION . But I don't have that opportunity . You get away with what you are doing sad to say.. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 How would you feel if you wanted answers and never got them? Not nice is it? WELL?? Start replying ! We pay you to do so. The third submission is from Dave Dobrzyn as follows : LAST WEEK I SENT AN E-MAIL ON RECYCLING AND OMITTED PLASTIC BOTTLES FROM CONSIDERATION . THE REVISED SCHEDULE IS AS FOLLOWS . 1 ST WEEK METAL CANS COULD BE SORTED WITH A MAGNETIC DEVICE CUTTING MANUAL COSTS 2 ND WEEK PAPER. 3 RD WEEK PLASTIC NOTE THROW UNSUITABLE CONTAMINATED INTO TRASH. 4 TH WEEK CARDBOARD . 4 MORE WEEKS LEFT OVER COULD BE USED FOR LAWN AS SMALL BONUS PER YEAR. LEAVES AND TWIGS ETC.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 ONCE AGAIN GLASS HAS NO RECYCLABLE VALUE AND CONFOUNDS SORTING USUALLY BREAKS BY COMPACTION AND CAUSES A SAFETY CONCERNS AND WHEN MINGLED MUST BE SORTED AT GREATER COST. STATE LAW MAY NEED CONSIDERATION FOR THIS IDEA. A NEW/OLD CONCERN IS THE CITY IS GOING AHEAD WITH A PLAN TO COLLECT TRASH FEE BY ADDRESS INSTEAD OF OCCUPANCY THIS MAY BECOME A BONANZA FOR REALESTATE INVESTORS AS THE FEE MAY BE LOWERED AND IN FACT RAISED FOR UNOCCUPIED LOTS OFTEN SOLD BY THE CITY FOR ADDED SPACE IF WE CHARGE A FLAT FEE PER ADRESS A FOUR UNIT COULD BE LOWERED TO 300 DOLLARS PER YEAR FROM $1200. A NON DEVELOPABLE LOT COULD INCREASE TO $300 PER ANUM MORE. WHAT A DEAL! MY TAX ON THIS LOT HAS INCREASED TO ABOUT $ 700 PER YEAR AS IT IS AND 40 BY 140 FOOT IS NOT DEVELOPABLE COULD BE INCREASED TO $1050! TRIPLING THE ORIGINAL ASSESMENT OF $333! A RENTAL HOUSE NEAR ME WENT FOR $950 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 PER MONTH MAINLY DUE TO SECTION 8 SUBSIDY AND NOT NOW KNOWN HOWEVER THE FORMER TENANTS WERE A NIGHTMARE AND FORTUNATLY THEY MOVED. THE NEW TENANTS ARE NICER FORTUNATELY . I WOULD HOPE AN APPEAL PROSSESS WOULD BE GRANTED FOR THESE SITUATIONS .THIS IDEA WAS CONTRIVED WITH SEVERAL REALATORS INVOLVED AND PARDON ME I DON’T NEED THEIR BILLS FALLING ON MY FINANCES . OUR HOME HAS A WOOD CHIPPER AND PLANT MATERIALS ARE MULCHED FOR GARDEN USE. ALSO A FRIEND TAKES WOOD FOR HIS FIREPLACE USE FOR IN THE COUNTRY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERY TIME THE TORCH IS PASSED TO A NEW GENERATION WE REINVENT GOVERNMENT EVEN THOUGH PAST PRACTICE DID NOT FAIL BUT ONLY TEPID ATTEMPTS WERE MADE AT MAKING THE OLD SYSTEM WORK.I NEVER CHALLENGED THE CURRENT SITUATION ON TRASH. SINCERELY YOURS THE ANTHRACITE HILLBILLY DAVID DOBRZYN The fourth submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows :1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 O 3E does not include the attachment mentioned in the one-pager. O Last week's Caucus stated Council would receive the next day, the Agenda was made available 11/16 but Third Order did not include the Budget; why? O Last week's HRG presentation was both bitter and sweet. Sweet because it finally arrived but bitter because it kicks the can down the road yet again as they want to await new regulations , County action, etc. No mention of the areas that are regularly flooded and need attention now. Not discussed was the opportunity to: (1) Address the regulations before they are adopted and (2) to lobby our under worked REpresentatives to ensure the new regulations are funded by the Federal Budget and not dumped on the property owner again. Also, one of my unanswered Capital Budget questions related to proper number of street sweepers is the CIty should select that has a sediment reduction . HRG reports that is a City selection so is the sweeper inventory sufficient ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 O I would like to know why the Mayor was allowed to sidestep the question of how many people furloughed are back to work. "The majority " is not a sufficient answer in my book and I'm sorry chose not to pursue a finite answer. O There have been some really nasty pave cuts. Could someone please brief us on pave cuts. I once thought an entire street would have to be paved if a utility made a certain number of oave cuts on that street. Now I hear those cuts have to be within a certain time frame. Is this true and, if so, what is that time frame? O As I have mentioned over the years, the Redevlopment Authority operates on a different (July though June, I believe ) Fiscal Year than the City so, if you ever want an Audit on time you must as them to go on a January through December year. O Closing , may I report it has been a very long time since any questions not answered during the Meeting have received answers . (This concludes public comment as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 submitted to Council .) MS. REED: That concludes the citizens participation portion . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the furloughs , I think we asked tonight for a list of the employee s that are still furloughed . So that will take care of that question . As for Miss Schumacher 's comment about the budget not being in Third Order, the budget is on the agenda tonight . The budget was received Monday afternoon . And then the agenda was posted Monday afternoon . And if anyone from the public would like to look at the budget, just go to Scrantonpa .gov under the Council page. Click on our agenda for today's meeting that was posted yesterday and you could find it. It is in there under Fifth Order. It won't be in Third Order. It will be in Fifth. As for some of the other questions , we'll pose these to the administration . I don't know some of the answers off the top of my head. Miss Schumacher 's last comment about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 questions not being answered during the meeting , Mrs. Reed, if you could -- I know we've sent any questions that have been posed to the administration . If you could ask for an update on when we might receive answers . And I did -- on some of the DPW items, I did send those answers to Miss Schumacher on the street sweeper and other things that she posed as well related to the capital budget. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s today? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. I might have a motion on the question with one of the grants later on but nothing at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And, Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : A couple. So, you know, I shared some of my concerns about the budget in caucus. We served them and expressed them again at the budget hearing on Thursday . I -- also in caucus I reached out to Attorney Hayes two months ago, maybe three, a concerned citizen who came to me and had question s about hiring process or a policy whereas, okay, is there -- does having a felony disclosed on an application -- if so, if not, okay, what happens if one surfaces ? So I requested from Solicitor Hayes to reach out to our HR Director and labor attorney twice and I haven't -- we haven't gotten anything back from them. Did you find anything yet, Solicitor Hayes? You're on mute, sorry. ATTY. HAYES: Mark, I had forwarded to you the memo that they provided in response to that. So if I didn't send it to you earlier that was my bad. But they did respond to me on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 October 20th, so -- which outlines for the various departments what the policy is and the applicable law. MR. MCANDREW : Thanks for the update. I'll take a look at it and thanks again. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : I'm just going to reserve my comment s for some agenda items. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have a few. The first thing I'd like to as I mention ed in the caucus tonight , I'd like to make a motion that Council send a letter to the Mayor and Business Administrator asking for a complete report on the pool at Nay Aug Park when the pool -- if the pool will be ready for opening in Summer of 2021 and why the funding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 has not been released to the Recreation Board to allow for the repair or replacement of the liner at Nay Aug pool. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion made and a second. On the question ? On the question , just to reiterate , I was taking a look at the minutes from the Recreation Authority Board that will be in Third Order next week. This meeting was held Thursday , November 5th. And at the end of the meeting minutes , one of the members asked the solicitor of the board if the City answered the Board's request regarding filling in the big pool. The meeting -- he replied that the meeting was cancelled . No date has been set to rescheduled . And then the members of the board expressed concerns with money that was allocated in this budget that was not used to repair the pool wants to know if the money is still there if it was transferred elsewhere and they are very concerned that the pool will not be repaired and the children will not have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 pool in 2021. So, you know, based on that and being up there this summer and looking at all the work that has to be done, I am concerned . I really think we need a full report from the Mayor and the administration on what's going on and if that pool is going to be ready. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , so I remember that Mayor Evans put money in the budget to take care of this. And it terrifies me knowing that the pool, the deeper pool with the diving board is not filled in yet. That to me is a huge liability , huge liability . That alone scares me. So, of course, I'd like an update on both of them questions . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. All right. There's been a motion, a second, on the question . All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 ayes have it and so moved and the motions passes. I'd also like to make a motion to invite the Pennsylvania Economy League representative s who are the City's Act 47 recovery coordinator to our Tuesday , November 24th caucus to discuss and take question s about the 2021 budget. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , as has been stated, one of the things I've always insisted on is that -- and they've always agreed and have come and answered questions and usually a letter accompanies the budget because I believe PEL has to certify the budget. But I think it's important to have a recovery coordinator at a caucus with Council to answer questions about the budget, about their thought s on the budget and what the financial situation of the City looks like moving forward . So I look forward to having those discussions . Anyone else on the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , I think as you say, Mr. Gaughan , I think it's a good idea to get their thought s on this budget and more specifically when we're looking at the borrowing from that trust fund, get what they had stated on that fund and get the parameters (inaudible ) from that fund. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor signify -- oh, sorry, Mark, go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : I totally agree having their presence and input. The City is in recovery for a reason. There's a recovery team here for a reason. I value their, you know, their input and I'd like to hear it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. The other thing I have is last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Thursday the Business Administrator said that there was a memo that Council has was suppose d to receive on the sale of receivables . It's a line item in this year's budget -- a revenue line item in this year's budget. They mentioned that they were going to release a memo. So, Lori, could you please request a copy of that memo or find out when they are going to release that? I have additional concerns there, but I'll mention them in Fifth Order when we talk about the budget. That's all I have. MR. SCHUSTER : President Gaughan , was there going to be a motion to send correspondence to the Mayor and the administration on the job descriptions ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: I already did that. And I asked that they be respond ed to by the end of the week by 3:30 that they submit them to Lori. And the Mayor already respond ed that they are working on them right now. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Very good. ATTY. HAYES: I don't know if you still want to do a motion or not. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. GAUGHAN : No. I think that's good. That works. Okay. Lori? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2021 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2021 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Who wants to go first? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. SCHUSTER : I guess on the question , do all new positions have salary amounts associated with them and do all line items have dollar amounts associated with them too? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Yes, they have to except for the ones where it says not funded as I mention ed in the caucus. I think we should take those out but -- yep. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All right. I have a few things I'd like to say. So I'll start with the good before I go into -- it's always good to start with the good things first. So the first thing I'd like to say is I've been through several budgets now since I've been on Council . And I have to give credit to Mayor Cognetti and her administration in this respect that they are not afraid to defend their budget. I have sat through many budgets where we couldn't get the Mayor to come -- in fact, I don't believe we ever had the previous Mayor before caucus. And we requested numerous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 times. So we already had the Mayor and the Business Administrator before us on Thursday . They are coming again this Thursday . In speaking with the Mayor, they're more than willing to answer any and all questions and exhaust all of our concerns before final passage . So I think any plan, any budget needs to be scrutinized . That's our job as Council people is to look at this thing line item by line item, scrutinize it, put it through the ringer and I just personal ly appreciate the Mayor and the Business Administrator coming before us answering questions and defending their plan even if we have concerns about it or we don't agree with. As I said, I haven't always been a part of a process that has been like that. So this is new to me, and I think it's the best way to do it. So I do appreciate that. And I think it's much more transparent . As I mentioned earlier , I received the budget yesterday afternoon as all of Council did. So it's a rather large document . So I will need time to continue to look through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 it. But my first kind of initial -- my initial review and my first blush reaction I have a few concerns . The first would be that the numbers that we received Thursday when the Mayor and the Business Administrator came to our work session compared to the numbers we receive d yesterday afternoon varied and in some cases significantly . So my first question that I'd like to know is what changed between Thursday and Monday? The projections changed in some instances drastically within a few days. For example , what we were given Thursday the delinquent real estate tax was at -- revenue was at $600,000. Tuesday the budget we have in front of us, the final document it's at 2.3 million . So for those numbers to change so significantly , you know, what happened between in those few days and maybe there is a good explanation and hopefully we'll find out Thursday . The landfill and refuse fees, Thursday it was 8 million 50 thousand dollars . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Tuesday it's 7 million 800 thousand dollars . And then obviously the borrowing -- the interfund transfers we had a 5 million dollar deficit Thursday and then we're down to a 4.4 million dollar deficit on Tuesday . My second concern is the plan that was presented to us Thursday and the plan that is presented to us again today, the budget is using roughly 4.4 million dollars from excess workers' compensation reserves. These were originally supposed to be used for OPEB Trust Fund. OPEB stands for Other Post Employment Benefits . This was supposed to assist with future allocation s for retiree benefits . The OPEB Trust Fund allocation was based on a major recommendation from the City's auditor a few years ago. The fund would be established for other post employment benefits which could include things like medicare reimbursement s. The Government Finance Officer 's Association recommend s as a best practice that governments prefund their obligations for post employment benefits other than pensions once it's determine d that the employer has incurred 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 a substantial long-term liability which, of course, is the case with the City of Scranton . I think our long-term liability is over 200 million dollars at this point. If funded properly -- so if funded with what was original ly -- what the original plan was, the City may make long-term investments to cover these obligation s through a separate trust fund which should theoretically over time result in a lower total cost for providing post employment benefit s and other -- obviously other examples of post employment benefit s would be healthcare or insurance premiums . During the weekend it was reported in the Scranton Times that the plan had changed after a conversation that the administration had with PFM who is the City's financial advisor . And at this point, the Mayor and the Business Administrator were considering utilizing cash collateral from sewer sale proceed s or according to the narrative original financing which would require restructuring . According to the budget document that we received , this option would be explored at any point during the year. And if the funds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 were either not necessary or less than the 4.4 million dollar revenue gap, the refinancing can be tailored to the needed amount. There's a few issues that I have with this on its face. The budget that is present ed to us today includes multiple options which may address the budget shortfall next year. I have a hard time approving a budget with so many options in it. I'm interested in -- more interested in how exactly we're going to do this. Either you're going to do it or you're not going to do it. And we need as a Council I think much more detail about how the administration plans on closing the budget shortfall next year. I am particularly concerned about using workers' compensation proceed s that were designate d to reduce costs and liabilities going forward . Taking these dollars to balance the budget next year at the expense of savings later on is risky in my opinion . One of the concerns I have is what that -- what kind of message that would send to the financial community because I remember a few years ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 that the City creating this OPEB Trust Fund, the negotiations that went on with Labor and Industry was looked favorably -- was looked upon favorably by the financial community . And historically , you know, this is what the City of Scranton does. We take something that's intended for another fund or to invest and we use it as a one-time revenue source. So I think before we do that, we need to exhaust every other avenue and option. And we should really research this and make sure it's the right thing to do because that money was not intended for this use. Before I would even consider approving this budget, I would need much more information on the cash collateral restructuring . There are way too many what ifs in this narrative . And it seems like to me any way that this was put together at the last minute which is concerning . We don't have a figure on how much money a restructuring or refinancing debt would bring in. And if this is an actual serious option that they are going to consider , then we need at least a ballpark of where those figures might be before we pass a final budget.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 The other concern that I have is I think my other Council colleagues brought this up. Earlier in the week the budget shortfall was a million and a half dollars . And then that changed drastically to 5 million dollars . Now we're down to 4.6 million dollars . So to me, the fact that the City administration did not know that they'd be nearly 4 and a half million dollars in the hole next year as little as a week ago is concerning to me. And the fact that, you know, the numbers are changing and the plan has changed within the last few days. And I think we need to clarify that on Thursday . I'd also like to know we did not get a clear answer on whether there is going to be projected deficit for the end of 2020. A major, major concern of mine is the fact that the administration did not follow through with the sale of refuse receivables . This was a unique method of financing that I believe could have brought in at least a million and a half dollars . That's what was budgeted in 2020. Council received a draft of a proposal with a company called MRS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 that was put together with the previous administration . And I'm not sure if there had to be a request for proposals . I think because of the method of financing they probably could have negotiated with MRS. I'm not sure about that. But I remember in 2015 this same type of financing was done. And I believe that they just negotiated with this specific company . So I think we need to look into that. Again, that could have -- if this was acted upon earlier because I know Councilman Donahue and I had brought this up several times, I think we might have been able to make headway there. And that could have been -- it's definitely a million and a half dollars that we could have used this year. We were also told there was a memo that was supposed to be issued on this topic. So I'd like to see that before we pass the budget. The other thing that was in the 2020 budget that was not acted upon that I think the administration should consider as a means of bringing in additional revenue next year is an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 amnesty program . This was something that was talked about in 2020. It was baked into the revenue numbers in the 2020 budget. And I think it's a way other cities do it across the country , a one time -- whether it's a refuse amnesty , real estate -- I don't know if that's possible but a one-time program where if you have outstanding refuse fees or real estate taxes or whatever , you have a one time opportunity to come in and pay and get on a payment plan. And other cities have -- you've seen a huge influx of revenue into their coffers . So I think we should really, really look at that as a way to raise revenue for next year. As I mention ed in the caucus, my other concern is the conversion from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to the Payroll Preparation Tax. It is stated in the narrative that that is being pushed off or won't be considered until 2022. To me, this could be the potential of a major missed opportunity . This is something that the people of the City voted overwhelmingly for. I think we studied it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 We analyzed it. And it's really time to act on it because we're going to lose our opportunity if we wait too long. I need to see job descriptions . With 12 new positions , I think these are the most positions -- most newly created positions that I've seen since I've been on Council . With those 12 positions obviously comes a hefty cost. I think total with the raises and the new positions it's over half a million dollars . So when you're looking at a potential 4 million dollar deficit next year, you want to be able to rational ize those type of increases . I know there was a discussion in the narrative . I think we need more discussion on Thursday . And we need job descriptions as well. One of the things that stuck out to me was the Parks and Recreation Department as something that needs further study or further discussion . On its face I just don't understand it and I don't agree with it. They're adding another director or another manager in this department . You're going to have two managers in the Parks and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 Recreation Department . And the way that I'm reading it -- and I could be wrong and we need to clarify this Thursday is that the groundskeepers , the workers in the Parks and Recreation Department will be transferred under the management of the DPW Director or the DPW. So like who are these -- who are the new people in here? Or who are the manager and the director going to supervise ? On its face, I think you're creating more bureaucracy . So that is something I'd like to discuss on Thursday . Also, one of the things I mentioned in the caucus that I think we really need to talk about is -- although it might be minor renaming the department , moving the employees , does this marry up with the Collective Bargaining Agreement with the DPW? I know we when we voted on the CBA with the DPW three years ago or two years ago, there was a line in there that specifically stated that the department is Parks and Recreation . Now we're adding a different name, moving employees . So we have to make sure that that marries up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Some of the other items that stuck out to me is we don't have the 2019 audit, which I've said this before it's unacceptable . Last year we waited and waited and waited for the audit. We got every excuse under the book. And again, I know, you know, we had the pandemic at the beginning of the year but are all set up with technology . We knew what needed to be done. I sat in on meeting s with the auditor and the Business Administrator 's office and yet we're probably not going to get this thing until December , maybe not until next year. In a City of our size, that is just unacceptable . And I really did think that all of the issues were going to be solved. And apparently they weren't. So again, it's hard to look at a budget when you don't have the 2019 audit. It would be very helpful . The other thing I think we need to talk about on Thursday is the midyear adjustment or update. And I know Solicitor Hayes has said that this probably -- we need more clarification on exactly what that is because under the Home Rule Charter you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 can't -- I don't think you can just -- you can't change the budget in the middle of the year. The new positions that are not funded as I mentioned in the caucus, I don't disagree with them if the Mayor wants to include that in the narrative to say that these may be position s that are funded in future years, that's fine. But putting them as a line item in the budget even though there is no funding with it, that doesn't make sense to me. We need to take those out. If it's in the budget and it's new, it should be funded. You know, we get the point where it's in the narrative . You don't have to put it in the line item. The other thing that stuck out to me was pilot letters , the -- where we get a contribution from our non-profits . Those letters apparently just went out within the last two weeks. I wonder when we'll get those or if those conversations have occurred and when we'll know how much of or if there is going to be an increase on what the non-profits contribute because we're going to be passing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 the budget in December . It would seem to me that those letters should have went out earlier so that we'd have a better sense when we're looking at revenue that's coming in. On the topic of overtime , overtime numbers in this budget are similar to last year. We've gone over this year. And I still have not gotten a good explanation as to why we are over in the fire department and the police department and why we have overtime in the Law Department . I think we need that explanation on Thursday . And also for this year, we spent overtime in the Law Department when there was no overtime budgeted . I don't -- I would like to -- actually , Kevin, if you could look into if that is even legal for the administration to do that when the Council and the previous administration clearly did not put any funding in for overtime and yet somehow some employee got overtime in the Law Department . Interns , interns are budgeted at $120,000 for next year. I question spending that much money on interns . I think the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 internship program is a good thing but not at the expense of $120,000. So I think we need to talk about that on Thursday . I would like just looking at it preliminary , I'd like to take that money and use it to fund ECTV. I've had conversations with the Mayor and the Business Administrator about this. They only put in $20,000. That's going to leave them -- according to my conversations with them unable to continue broadcasting . So, I mean, it's not going to work. So we need to fund that. There is a line item for a grant match. And there's money in the line item as an expenditure for a grant match. And I would like a breakdown of that figure. And I'm going put this all in a document and send it to the administration . Apparently there is no increase for the Clerical Union in the budget. So I'm assuming that they're going to ask for a pay freeze. But I haven't seen any agreement to that effect and do we know that for sure. And if not, you know, I just -- to me, I don't know how you can put that in there without knowing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 it for sure. Maybe they do. I don't know. But we need further clarification on that. I mentioned in the caucus too about the Keystone Landfill grant, a hundred thousand dollars . I don't believe that that's actual -- it's not actual revenue unless something has changed . That was equipment that was to be donated through the landfill . So I don't know why that's in there. We're probably going to have to take that out. And we need to talk about the Ethics Board funding was cut. I think they're down to 10 or $20,000. And there is some other minor items in here. Those are my initial concerns that I have. So again, I appreciate the Mayor and the Business Administrator coming on Thursday . I think we really need answers to these outstanding questions sooner than later, especially if I had to pin this down to, you know, the major items, it really would be the budget shortfall next year. And, you know, we need more clarification on all of these different options . I don't think you pass a budget with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 four different options . We have to get a way, way clearer picture on that before I'd be comfortable . So those are my comment s. I'm sure I'll have more next week and look forward to Thursday . Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, Mr. Gaughan , I think we covered a lot of that in caucus so I didn't get my list of concerns . But I think you did a very good job. I agree 100 percent on everything that you put out there. One of the things I would like to touch on is, I mean, in the pandemic what we're seeing large shortfalls in revenue , things that we can't control . And I think in other areas of business , these are areas that they do control for trainings , overtimes , new positions , and salary increases . These are definitely things that could be controlled and, I mean, when we're using the pandemic as justification for other things, I think with those revenue shortfalls it would be good justification for these items here. Especially with looking at some of the furloughs that were done in the beginning 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 and then going into these CBAs as you expressed , the Clerical Union, you know, that's being negotiated right now. And, I mean, if that's the case, I don't understand how justification could be given for salary increase s and new positions when that's what's occurring right now and going into those CBAs into next June.

On the question , I think it would probably -- well, we can discuss this on Thursday with the Mayor and the Business Administrator . As I mentioned though, I just want to make sure that these bills that would go out -- the real estate tax bills that would go out if they go out to a -- somebody that does not have a structure on their land, a vacant property that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 they're not going to get charged $300. Now, you know, I guess they could come back and say well they're exempt but then you have to go through a whole process . And I'd hate to put them people through that annoying process of having to go down, prove that they don't have a structure on their property . I just feel like it would be a huge mess. Maybe that's not the case, but I think we should definitely double-check on that before we pass this. And the other thing too we did see a -- I think everyone got a copy of it. We did get a copy of what a sample bill will look like. ATTY. HAYES: Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, so just as an example of what it would look like. Anyone else on the question ?

Has the City Solicitor stated that this is the fees here are comparable with any other transaction s? And do you, yourself, feel that it's in line with any comparable deals or transaction s of this size and nature? ATTY. HAYES: Councilman Schuster , earlier this afternoon the City Clerk circulated the project ed -- or the estimated costs -- closing costs, which I think are in the neighborhoods of -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I think we got this in our e-mail. ATTY. HAYES: About $45,000. I'm going to have to review that. And I will have certainly a report back to you prior to final passage to see whether they are fair and reasonable based on the amount of the TAN, which is I guess 12.2 million . But I don't know without looking more closely into it. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I got the e-mail maybe about 3:40 today. So I got a quick glance at it. But I didn't take a deep dive.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 ATTY. HAYES: Okay, but I will. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I know I'm almost positive -- well, it's definite ly lower than last year at least the bank fee is lower. But the total fees are a little bit lower than last year according to Business Administrator . And I know from what I remember from past hands that I think this is probably one of the lowest amounts because at one time back in I think 2014, 2015 this was much higher because of some of the financial issues we were having. But Lori could probably pull for you the last couple years' worth of pages of the sources and uses of funds if you wanted to look at that. But I'm almost positive this is probably the lowest that we've seen in a long time. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I want to thank Lori. Lori already did that a few days ago. But at that point in time I didn't have the new fees to compare with the old one. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, okay. ATTY. HAYES: And just the closing , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 it's just short of $45,000 in closing costs. So I have to look to see if, you know, whether that's comparable to what's been charged in the past. MR. GAUGHAN : And according to the Business Administrator as of this morning , this was circulated earlier today. The rates were 0.01 percent higher than the proposal on the proposal date. So it's gone up 0.01 percent . MR. SCHUSTER : I think they said they would be tracking that a little. Did he say how it was tracking or just that it was .01 higher? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that's all he said, 0.01 percent , which is normal. Okay. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR.

But I'm just glad that they reached out to the neighboring business , asked for their input and, you know, my understanding is they could live with this now. Prior to this they had some concerns . So before the changes , you know, they felt they weren't getting a fair shake with regards to issues that would affect their business because of the change, you know, the parking and one way.
