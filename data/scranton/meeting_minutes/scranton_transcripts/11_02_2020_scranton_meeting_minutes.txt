LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT EVALUATION REPORT REVIEWED OCTOBER 20, 2020. 3-B. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL DATED OCTOBER 26, 2020 REGARDING SCRANTON PARKING SYSTEM OPERATIONS UPDATE. 3-C. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT 2019-2020 YEAR TO DATE OCTOBER 31, 2020. 3-D. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY CONTROLLER DATED OCTOBER 22, 2020 REGARDING PAYROLL OVERTIME BY DEPARTMENT JANUARY TO OCTOBER , 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I just have one comment on 3-D payroll overtime report that was submitted by Controller John Murray. As I mentioned in the caucus, there I think was in speaking with the Mayor and Controller Murray, there may have been a discrepancy in the bottom line number, the total amount of overtime listed in the report. So they are working to correct that. I am personally concerned that we are over budget with police and fire overtime . We budgeted $700,000 overtime for the police department . We are overbudget about $62,398.46. That's concerning . Fire is very concerning . We budgeted $325,000 for overtime . We're already at $443,825.63. So we're overbudget by $118,825.63. The Law Department there was no overtime budgeted for 2020. It's not a large amount. But I still would like to know what, you know, how we -- why we had to spend overtime in the Law Department , $1,161.74. So what I'd like to ask from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 administration is in writing an explanation as to why in November we're that much over in the fire department and in the police department . In years past in the police department there have been a certain amount of dollars that were reimbursable . This is most likely the case again this year. So usually Chief Graziano would give us a breakdown on the costs to date that were reimbursable , whether a policeman were to cover an event or something like that. But, Mrs. Reed, if you could send something to the administration for an answer in writing as to the reasons why we're so over in these categories . Anyone else on the question -- or not on the question . Anyone else on the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. This Saturday , November 7th from 4 to 7 p.m., there will be a pot roast dinner fundraiser hosted by God's Peace at Parker and Main, which is 2506 North Main Avenue, take out only $12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 each. Advanced tickets need to be purchased . Tickets are available at the church office. And, you know, the Facebook page directs you to a website where you could actually purchase tickets. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I have one quick one. Just a reminder about the fall leaf program . All leaves must be placed in biodegradable brown paper bags. There's bags available for pickup at the DPW complex on Popular Street and at the Weston Field house on Providence Road. All collection s are from the curbside of streets and avenues . No collections will be in courts or alleys. No loose piles, no plastic bags, no household trash in leaf bags. The following weeks are the remaining weeks of the program : Next week, the week of November 9th; the week of November 24th; and the week of December 7th. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 thing to add. So I know last week we had -- we had them in the Scranton Tomorrow . And they were talking about the rally for restaurant s event that they host over at Lackawanna College . And I think there's one more event. It's going to be November 24th with reservations starting at 5:30 p.m. I think there is one also -- I'm sorry that one will be with Electronic City Bakehouse. And that's going to be a four course meal. And then there's another one Tuesday , November 10th. Reservation s starting at 5:30. And that's going to be with Posh at the Scranton Club. So all the information about the rally for restaurant events are on the Facebook page of 409 on Adams at Lackawanna College . And it's just a great way to be able to support our local restaurant and businesses and get a great meal out of it. So I'd just encourage people to check it out. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I have a few. Mary Mother of God Parish is going to have their annual roast beef dinner Sunday, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 November 8th, 2020, 12 noon to 4 p.m., at Stirna's Restaurant on West Market Street in North Scranton . This will be take out only due to the pandemic . Adults can pay $10 in advance or $12 at the door. We have a caucus scheduled with Herbert Rowland and Grubic for Tuesday , November 10th at 5:45 p.m., to discuss the City's approach to stormwater management and the progress that has occurred with this company working with the City on the pollution reduction plan and complying with the pollution reduction requirements by the EPA. We're also going to get an update on what has been accomplished in terms of best management practices the City should implement to maintain the MS4 permit and the expiration of the feasibility and benefits of managing stormwater on a regional basis. City Hall will be closed tomorrow Tuesday , November 3rd for Election Day holiday . The DPW will also be off tomorrow . Refuse and blue recycling will be one day behind starting on Wednesday of this week. Next week, Thursday , November 12th 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 at 6 p.m., Council will hold the first of two work sessions with the Mayor and Business Administrator for the purpose of discussing 2021 operating budget. This will be livestreamed and on ECTV for the public to view. I gave kind of a breakdown of the budget timeline in the caucus.

Mrs. Reed? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time, would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individual s, Abby Walsh, Marie Schumacher , and Fay Franus. MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Abby Walsh as follows : I was recently reading through the Act 47 legislation and had a question regarding our coordinator 's powers. In subchapter B, Section 221, one of the coordinator 's powers is as follows , to "investigate the tax-exempt status of any property . Within a distressed municipality . And advise the governing body of the municipality to appeal the assessment or exempt status of property within the distressed municipality ." 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 I was not alive when we first entered distressed status, so I am unaware if this was ever done. I am wondering if our coordinator Gerald Cross ever used this power to look into tax-exempt properties within the city and perhaps advised the city to appeal the status of any of them. If not, perhaps he could look into it now, or even if he has done it in the past, it may be worth investigating more properties in the near future so we can utilize his expertise and increase the tax base as we move to exit distressed status soon. MS. REED: Again, that was from Abby Walsh. The next submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O What progress , if any, has been made to expedite the 2019 AUDIT? O HR'S Internal Audit of employee 's currency on taxes and fees is scheduled to begin at the beginning of December giving any delinquent employees about six weeks to get current . When will this Audit complete and what, if anything , will happen to any remaining 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 delinquent employees ? O On October 20th the Capital Budget was taken from the table and placed in seventh order where it was approved with some change. The revised Budget was not included on the Agenda as it was taken from the table so my question is where on-line is the "official " Capital Budget available . Also, I do not believe several of my Capital Budget questions were answered ; those being: - an asphalt Paving and small roller is requested but I see no request for equipment to tar around pave patches ; without the tar water gets between the old and new asphalt and the pothole is back. - brush tractor and mower new or replacement ?. The roadside brush along East Mountain Road and Route 307 between Rt 81 and Lynwood Avenue was not trimmed back this year as it has been in years past. Also, Land Bank vacant properties need to be maintained . - I see two (separate line items I might add and question ) for Leaf Vacuum Trucks but no Street Sweepers . Is our street sweeper 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 inventory sufficient to keep sediment stormwater out of the stormwater drains.? - The DPW vehicle narrative states vehicles in need of replacement and fleet additions and then provides a list but fails to distinguish between which are replacement and which are additions . This was answered but included an Excel sheet that I do not believe has been made available to the public. - The Flood Control section states escrow accounts will be used for funding . Please identify the available escrow accounts and the balance in each.and answer why this available funding has not been used to fix the Dewey-Jackson St issue? The Dewey-Jackson St. Portion was answered but not the escrow account identification and balances . O Speaking of answers to questions ; it's been a significant length of time since the questions not answered during the Meeting have been answered . I am especially interested in questions relative to that large-orange sign saying NO PARKING at River St. And Prospect Avenue. O Will there be a presentation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 prior to receipt of the Budget that exposes the planned expenditures over the next five years at the former Serrenti building . It appears the concerns expressed by Council prior to permitting the acquisition are transitioning to reality at a time the CIty is financially distressed enough that the Act 47 exit had to be postponed for 18 months. O Finally , if you are still reluctant to use Council Chambers , may I sugggest you hold the Public Hearing on the City's 2021 Budget at the Cultural Center and provide each speaker at least 10 minutes and accept any questions over the ten minutes in writing for timely answers . MS. REED: The third submission is from Fay Franus and it is as follows : Council , You say you answer questions that the residents of Scranton ask. May I say--BARELY if at all--You make it sound like you do, but that is not true. Example Marie Schumacher has questions from weeks and weeks ago perhaps months that seriously needed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 answers to. And were never answered . You are counting on people not remembering these questions so you can get away without answering them ON PURPOSE ! I asked each council member directly last week to explain to the residents why they felt it was not good to fight for the 50 million the city took out in LST taxes illegally -NOT a sound out of you. Which reaffirms you are NOT representing the people but only the administration . Now you will continue to tax the people right out of their homes. BUT you do not care! You wouldn't even fight for the people-- you wanted to side with the administration . I've asked numerous time about the audit--why do you hire people that get paid lots pf money but yet never have it done on time. Time to find another company .Year after year we keep asking when is the audit going to be done. You never seem to correct your mistakes . Are the taxpayers going to have to pay $300.00 again for their garbage fee when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 25% of the people do not pay theirs-- So our $300.00 pays for those who don't pay!. The people in Scranton should know this city has a law in place for the DPW not to pick up the garbage of those homes who do NOT pay their garbage fee. BUT the city and council will not abide by their won law. In the meantime , the people who do pay will have to continue to pay for those who do NOT! I know I keep quoting this city law but maybe it needs repeating . Maybe just maybe it might matter to you to follow laws that are in place to help the resident . God Forbid that should happen! Last question . What exactly do each of you do for the $12,500.00 we pay you every year to help us. (This concludes letters as submitted to Council for public comment .) MS. REED: That concludes the citizens participation . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Reed. I just want to on the question start off by reading Mr. Cross's response into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 record. Miss Walsh who posed a question about Act 47 legislation and regarding coordinator 's powers in terms of investigating the tax exempt status of any property within a distressed municipal ity. It was a very good question . And I want to take a second to read the response that I received this afternoon from Mr. Cross. Mr. Cross said: Miss Walsh is correct in that the coordinator can review the status of exempt from taxation properties . The various recovery plans included initiative s for the City to review the status of these properties on a regular basis. The first review was conduct ed during the first recovery plan of 1992. More recently, the coordinator reviewed the status of various properties during preparation of the 2015 recovery plan revision. Also at that time a review was conducted as part of Amoroso plan at that same time. The City did attempt to review the properties as part of the 2015 recovery process . And I believe that some properties were identified at that time as subject to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 review. Additionally the disposition of several properties that were part of closed churches were also identified as potential change of use that could lead to a resumption of taxable status. The majority of exempt properties are owned by local government , city, county, and school district and education al and medical facilities . The sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority also led to some properties being reclassified as taxable. Also, the sale of the not-for-profit to a for profit entity allowed that property to be returned to the tax rolls. We believe that a regular review of the status of properties that are owned by not-for-profit entities but which uses are not directly related to their charitable function should occur to determine their taxable status. While the coordinator does not actually perform the analysis , the City has had initiatives and recovery plans to perform such an analysis . Please let me know if there are any followup questions regarding exempt from taxation properties . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 I do know for a fact that that is in our recovery plan. And it has been in several recovery plans since I've been on Council that initiative to analyze the tax exempt properties . And I have asked repeatedly , repeatedly for that to be done. And it has not yet been done. So, Mrs. Reed, if we can send correspondence to the Mayor -- and I'll bring this up the next time I talk with the Mayor -- on what their plans are or if they do have plans to perform that analysis . Again, this is not something that Council would be able to undertake. That would have to be the administration . But I do support that. I think it makes sense. As for Miss Schumacher 's comments on the capital budget that she claims is taken from the table and placed in Seventh Order where it was approve d with some change, the only change that was made there that I had requested was for the administration to show what funds they had already -- have already been allocated for capital program s and project s.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 And that -- they did include that. I can't remember if that was included in Third Order. If it wasn't, I will ask that that be included in Third Order that updated spreadsheet . But there was no material changes made to the capital budget. Otherwise , we would have had to make an amendment to that. So we will get Miss Schumacher that capital budget. And we'll put the revised spreadsheet in there. That was my mistake . If that wasn't include d, I apologize for that. As for the DPW questions , I was under the impression that all of them were answered . There are some here that Miss Schumacher is claiming weren't answered . We will get those to the DPW and make sure that those are answered . And let me see. Miss Schumacher also mentioned that it's been a significant length of -- since questions -- she had question s that were not answered. I actually did talk to Mrs. Reed today, our City Clerk about that. And I asked her if she would reach 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 out to the Mayor's office to get an update on the status of those questions . Every time a member of the public issues a -- asks a question of this Council , I make sure if I don't have the answer right at my disposal and I don't know off the top of my head and it's not something that's on the agenda that we get those question s to the administration . And we have asked them to answer those questions . So we are not in any way -- and I am not in any way ignoring anybody 's questions . I would not do that. That would be a dereliction of duty on my part. It would be ignorant as well. We have not received a response yet from the administration . So again, we did ask or I did ask Mrs. Reed today to ask the administration for an update on when we can expect the answers to these question s and including the no parking sign at River Street and Prospect Avenue. Miss Schumacher also asked a question about the Serrenti building . She asked for a -- planned expenditures over the next five years. We can ask for that. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 wasn't for that project a few years ago. I thought there was issues. I'm not going to rehash them all night. The problem is that, you know, you can't put toothpaste back in the tube. We have acquired that building . There's been significant amount of money that has been put in that building . We did receive a breakdown of how the money has been spent. Most of it has been grant money. But it just wouldn't make sense at this point since we already have acquired the building and we put money into it to just abandon the project . So while I didn't agree with it original ly, at this point it would not make sense to abandon it and to scrap it. But I will ask what the plans are for expenditures over the next five years. And finally , about the use of Council Chambers and Miss Schumacher 's suggestion about the 2021 budget at the Cultural Center, we are not going to do that. There would be a cost to that on using the Cultural Center, a user fee or host fee or whatever . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 So we're not going to do that. Speakers have five minutes to -- they have five minutes with their questions . They could put those in writing . We will take them. We will get them answered for the public when the budget comes up on our agenda. But we are going to continue to operate in Zoom due to the pandemic . And just to address finally Miss Franus's comment , I wasn't here last week about the City's court case that they won with the LST taxes. I said it before and I'll say it again. If the City lost that, then we would probably have gone bankrupt . So, you know, you're really -- I appreciate Miss Franus's comment s, but you're cutting off your nose to spite your face. If you are rooting for a victory there, then the City is going to be in horrible financial peril. And we'll probably end up going bankrupt when you don't have tens of millions of dollars of revenue to run the City. So that's my answer to that. And I think that was it. And again, if there is any -- any questions here that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 got like we do every week we will send those to the administration . And we'll ask them for an update and when we could expect the answers . Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I don't have a motion. But I have a quick comment . So a couple of weeks ago we talked about we passed some legislation we had some money to change out all the City signs and replace them which, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 you know, was great. A citizen approached me about it. His name is Derek Rains. He's from the Hill Section , Monroe Avenue. He experienced this and something like this when he worked at Tobyhanna Depot. So his suggestion which was a pretty good idea, you know, I don't know what we're going to do with the signs -- the old signs; but maybe people might want to buy them. I mean, he said he would love to buy the Monroe sign. I'd take a St. Ann Street sign in a minute. So maybe we pose this to the City and say, hey, you know, before you get rid of the signs, maybe we could get a couple bucks in revenue , you know, let's maybe throw it out there. It might be a couple dollars to sort them or whatever , but it might be an idea to throw it out there to see if anybody would like to buy this as a memento or, you know, a street sign that's been on their street. So, Mrs. Reed, would you just send maybe that correspondence over to the administration to see, you know, if maybe we can incorporate that in there, you know, if it's feasible . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MS. REED: Of course. MR. MCANDREW : All right. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No. I don't have any motions or comment s right now. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few comments . So a few weeks ago I had asked about questions about the intern program in the City. We did send another note to the Mayor's office. They did send us a breakdown which was in Third Order of the Pennsylvania State and Local Internship Program . And I do believe that the City should be a part of this program . I think it's a good thing. But there was a note here from the HR Director that there were three people that did not qualify for the program dollars but they were also paid interns . So I'm still waiting for an answer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 as to how we paid those interns and out of what account we paid them. So we're waiting for that answer. And then there was another question as to -- there was multiple interns being offered permanent employment opportunities . So I had asked for a list of those interns who were hired full time. Also in the caucus I had asked about the incident that occurred a few weeks ago with the police department and a political parade that was -- that the police department kind of chaperoned through the City. I did speak with the Mayor and the Chief of Police and was told that there was an investigation going on about that. And then I have not heard anything in about two weeks. So I did ask Mrs. Reed if she would send something to get an update on that. I'd like to know who authorize d it and the details. I think it's important . I also asked in the caucus when the City will know how much we're going to be reimbursed from the county for the COVID-19 expenditures and what the timeline looks like on that. I believe that we submitted at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 point nearly a million dollars . So I'm just not clear on what the process is and when we'll find out. Also, there was a transfer that was received for the workers ' comp account to unemployment insurance in the amount of $179,000. Mrs. Reed, if you could find out what the total amount that the City has spent this year in unemployment insurance , I'd like to know that prior to the next meeting . Also, we talked a little bit about and I brought up the audit. And I did have a chance this week to speak to the Business Administrator about it. I think we all expressed two weeks ago that it's just simply unacceptable to receive the audit in December of 2020 -- the 2019 audit in December of 2020. Last year we received the 2018 audit in January of 2019, which was unacceptable as well. And at that time we had asked for regular updates on the audit. We were told that it was going to be done on time and everybody was going have their act together . So I just want to go through really quick what Kelly Lindsey from the Kohanski 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Company had sent us that they agree that the December 31st, 2019 audit of financial statement s being received in midDecember , 2020 is not acceptable . And at the conclusion of the December 31st, 2018 audit they discussed with Council at length and agreed that a September 30th completion date was feasible and committed to adhering to this date as long as they receive d all of their requested financial information by July 1st which gave the City six months to prepare . Then she details the reports that were sent to Council and some of the information that was -- had still not been received . In a September 3rd update she reported that with the exception of the census status for the OPEB plan, no additional information had been received . On October 1st they received trial balances and some work papers for the general fund, special city's fund in OECD, a partial list of some items which are still outstanding they attached and additional items were going to be requested as they worked through the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 audit. They expressed to us that they're working diligently to accommodate the City audit in their schedule after receiving the information later than they had planned and will do everything possible to deliver the audit as soon as it is reasonably possible . She did offer up other items to consider . The City has a new business manager. The City was shut down for several months due to the COVID-19 pandemic . The City's accounting system was offline several weeks due to a cyber attack after the original July 1st deadline to receive all of this information . And OECD was closed until November 1st while the employees were under quarantine . So those were just other items to consider . But again, we went through the same thing last year. And I just find it unacceptable . It's, you know, very disappointing to go through a budget process without last year's audited financial -- the audited financial information . It's just not acceptable . So, Mrs. Reed, I have been talking with Mr. Deeley. But I think it's important 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 for this Council to get something in writing from the administration on what the plan is moving forward . It's now November 2nd. And I think we should have this audit, you know, before final passage of the budget in December -- December 15th. So if you could ask them what the plan of action is. Mr. Deeley told me that he's going to now meet weekly with Kohanski and Company to get further updates but very disappointing . The other thing we talked about in Third Order was the overtime cost. We're going to be sending something to the administration so that they could explain the reasons in detail in writing as to why we're over in the police and fire overtime budget. Also, we're going to ask for what the deal is on the DPW equipment donation from Keystone Landfill . This has been months now. We have not received anything official in writing even though we've asked several times. I would also like to ask Mrs. Reed for an update on the conversion of the garbage bill into the real estate tax bill also an update on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 how the wind down of the NRS contract is going. I think they'll be officially done at the end of December . So I'd like to know if all the data has been transferred over, how much, if anything , the City is going to owe this company and just a general update on where the City is at with that. Also, I haven't seen anything lately on the sale of receivables . This was a line item in the budget in terms of revenue for a million and a half dollars . I know the RFP was sent out. I don't know quite frankly if we've received anything back yet. But I'm a little concerned we haven't seen any legislation yet. And again, it's a substantial figure in the 2020 budget. And that's all I have for this week. MS. REED: 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to say that many people throughout the City know Mr. Santoli. He is our City forester . He does not get paid a salary by the City. He does everything just because he loves being the City forester . And he is one of the most knowledgeable people on -- in that aspect that I've ever met in my entire life. So if anybody ever wants to know anything about the trees in the City or anything related to forestry, Mr. Santoli is an encyclopedia on this type of stuff. And again, he's doing this as a volunteer . He does not get paid. He drives all over the City. On several occasions the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 last couple years I've called him because there's been a tree on someone 's property or a City property that's been coming down. And he will go out and at any point during the day. He is just a gentleman , very nice man. And I want to thank him on behalf of the City for doing such a great service , the things that he's done at Nay Aug Park and other parks throughout the City is really amazing . So, Mr. Santoli, thank you, not only as the City forester but as a member of the Shade Tree Commission . Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR.

FOR CONSIDERATION 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 87, 2020 - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA ALLIANCE , 1151 OAK ST. PITTSTON , PENNSYLVANIA 18640-3726 TO PROVIDE THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND OECD WITH UNDERWRITING SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR VARIOUS LOAN AND GRANT PROGRAMS . MR. GAUGHAN : And I'd ask at this point if someone could please make a motion to table agenda Item 7-C. DR. ROTHCHILD : I make a motion to table Item 7-C. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion to table agenda Item 7-C. Councilman Donahue seconded the motion. On the question ? On the question , I had noticed when I was going through the legislation that the disclosure forms were included but they were not filled out. So Mrs. Reed got in touch with OECD Director Cipriani and they are going to take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 care of that issue.

STAFFORD DISASTER RELIEF AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE ACT, AND AUTHORIZING CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE THE DESIGNATION OF AGENT AND THE PEMA PUBLIC DISASTER ASSISTANCE APPLICATION AND AGREEMENT FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final passage of 7-D. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? Yes, on the question , this just allows the City to enter into an agreement to apply for and enter into an agreement with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania through PEMA for the grant of diaster assistance funds related to the COVID-19 pandemic . So Al Lucas is just simply being an agent of the City and giving us the ability to go for these funds. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Just quickly , we mention ed in caucus my concern was, you know, was it a movement from, you know, the union to management , is there more money; and it was determined that there's not. So like it's just like you said. So I'll be voting yes then. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Roll call, please. MS.

CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-D legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-E. Previously tabled. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES FOR ADOPTION -- RESOLUTION NO. 79 2020 -- AUTHORIZ ING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIAL S TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH WILLIS TOWERS WATSON FOR CONSULT ING BENEFITS BROKER SERVICES FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , first of all, I have nothing against Willis Towers Watson. I'm all in favor of moving the City forward and realize some savings with this organization . But my problem is with the process . I don't have a dog in this fight. I don't have a horse in this race. But what I do have are concerns about the process , the selection process . So in '94, the judge determined that the unions had to have a health care committee . Okay, so it's there. It's imbedded in the CBA. They were supposed to be part of the selection process . They were not. The selection of this firm, like I said, nothing against them but the selection of this firm was solely done by the Mayor, the Business Administrator and the new HR Director . So they clearly violated the CBA. It's already being grieved . So I can't feel good about voting yes for this. And my -- my no is not no for the company . My no is no for the process because what's going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 happen is, if they win arbitration six, eight months from now, we're going to have to do this process again. So the money that, you know, they think we're going to save real quick getting this great firm in, we're going to lose money fighting this through arbitration and then losing and then possibly losing and going through this whole process again. So I'm a no because of that. I'm not a no for the company . I'm not a no for moving forward with a lot of realized savings, but I'm no for the simple fact it's a principle . We talk about, you know, past administration s and best practice s and horrible processes . So here's a process that is actually clear and defined that is in place that we're not following . For that I'm sorry, but I'm a no. MR. SCHUSTER : As well on the question , you know, when looking at the agreement for savings , I think there's an opportunity here to save. I'm glad that this was put out. But I did have some questions . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 I did speak with the Business Administrator and the answers I got I guess echo Mr. McAndrew 's response that it does seem it was part of the CBA. The health care committee wasn't advised . And it could be probably a simple remedy. But it hasn't been addressed at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? Yeah, just two things, number one, I would think that if there was any issues in that regard that the head of the union, whatever union -- I don't know what union whether it's the fire, police or clerical would have sent something to Council and attached their name to it so that we could solve that. I was told by the administration that the -- I think the union for -- the attorney for one of the unions was involved . But I don't think that is neither here nor there at this point. We're voting on the contract with Willis Towers Watson for the consultant benefits broker services . You know, whether someone was included or not included , I just don't think that's an area that the Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 should get involved or would get involved in. But I never received anything officially from the union so, you know, if they wanted to make Council aware of that they should have sent something officially in writing from their business agent or from an attorney or from someone . Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-E legally and lawfully adopted . If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting 's adjourned . See everybody next week. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 ATTY.
