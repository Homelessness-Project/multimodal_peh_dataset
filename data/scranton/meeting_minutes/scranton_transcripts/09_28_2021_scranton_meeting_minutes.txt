MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community . Let us also take a moment of silence for all of the people in our community and our country and around the world who have passed away and been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic . This pandemic has turned our world upside down. But we must remain hopeful and strong. We continue to pray for the doctors , nurses and researchers and all medical professionals who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they have protection and peace. Whether we are here at home or abroad, surrounded by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together and in place of our anxiety , let us have hope and peace. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR.

And so you can dress up or dress your children up as bees. And they will be walking from the tree house to the greenhouse . And I think they will also be passing by Geisinger to thank our essential workers or our worker bees. And that will be starting at 12 p.m. And then there will be music, food, games and just a lot fun. So you could join the greenhouse at Nay Aug Park on Saturday if you're interested in that. And then a couple Saturdays from now on October 16th, our Parks and Rec Department is going to be hosting an Arts in the Park event that's going to take place 11:00, 11 a.m. October 16th at Robinson Park. And kids will have the chance to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 make different Halloween arts and crafts. So if you're interested in that you could go to the Scranton Parks and Rec's Facebook page and sign up there. That's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I have one announcement tonight . Dr. Matthew Meyer, a member of the Ethics Board recently resigned his position as I mentioned last week. City Council is accepting letters of interest and resumes for the open seat which was announced last Tuesday . The deadline is tomorrow , Wednesday , September 29th at 4 p.m. You may e-mail our City Clerk Frank Voldenberg at Fvoldenberg -- that's F-V-O-L-D-E-N-B-E-R-G, at scrantonpa .gov with your letter of interest and your resume. This is a very important board in the City. They are actually very busy if you look at their minutes from the past few months. So there are a lot of things going on there. So we do need someone who will be committed to being on the board. So if you're interested in public service and you're interested in service to the City, please let us know and put in your letter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 of interest and resume. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Today is September 28th. Do you know where the 2020 audit is? MR. GAUGHAN : Still in process . We haven't gotten a final date unless Councilman Donahue -- MR. DONAHUE : I know the auditors were in the building today just working on their final edits. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Second verse same as the first. Next, I'm happy to say they're making progress on the City's website . Two more documents relating to the Firefighters ' Collective Bargaining Agreement were posted. Here's a current list of documents relating to the Firefighters ' Collective Bargaining Agreement , a basic agreement for the period January 1, 1996 through December 31st, 2002 signed by Mayor Connors on June 6th, 1998; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 a memorandum of understanding detailing amendments to the agreement for the period 2008 through 2017 signed by Mayor Courtright on January 30, 2015. However , I have not seen any document covering the period of January 1, 2003 to December 31, 2007; a memorandum of understanding detailing amendments to the agreement for the period January 1, 2008 through December 31st, 2021, signed by Mayor Courtright on November 27th, 2018. Now, when I buy a book that's in its fifth or sixth edition , I don't by the first edition and then five revisions as separate documents . I buy one book. And it contains all revisions . I expect that the best way to handle these revised agreements is to print one document which contains all the amendments and revisions . To me, that would support transparency and disclosure . So while we are making progress , hopefully we'll get the entire story before the end of year. Otherwise , you're going to have a problem when this legislation comes up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Next, with regard to a Times-Tribune article yesterday on the Pocket Park, you might want to take a look at Item 3-B, the Shade Tree Commission 's April minutes . They recommended placing a memorial for first responders , essential workers in this park rather than on courthouse square. According to the newspaper , there are plans for a monument in the park but no monument has yet been identified . So I think you should give serious consideration to the Shade Commission 's recommendation . Next, with regard to the latest review of overtime expenditures , the report covers a nine-month period through the end of September . And several departments have exceeded their overtime budgets by a significant margin including LIPS, 389 percent ; DPW admin, 546 percent ; and DPW engineering , 446 percent . I ignored police and fire because they might be getting reimbursements . But I suggest that when the proposed 2022 operating budget comes forward you take a hard look at overtime projection s in that budget. They may 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 not be realistic . And finally, do you have any date for public caucuses on the Serrenti Center's past and future funding , OECD's recap on its loan and grant programs and the caucus with the Mayor and her department heads? And I will listen for your answers in Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I could actually answer you right now really quick. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : On the Serrenti Center, we received a report of all of the activity that's gone on up there. We'll put that in Third Order. I just received that today. And then we are in the process -- I think Frank is meeting with the Chief of Police this Thursday to talk about a caucus date and information there. So that is number one. What was your second? MS. HODOWANITZ : OECD recap, its loans and grants. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, we received a response from Eileen Cipriani . That will be in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Third Order as well with details to all the questions that we asked on grants. MS. HODOWANITZ : And Mayor and her department heads? MR. GAUGHAN : We did not receive a response yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is Jack White. MR. WHITE: Hello, Council . I hope all your family and friends are well and safe and everybody else that you love and they love you back are safe and well. I've notice -- I'm sorry, Jack White, 500 Wheeler -- block of Wheeler . I noticed recently that the landfill trucks aren't barreling down Wheeler Avenue or back. They're not dropping all of that nasty leachate . And it's good to see. And the utility companies are keeping -- helped by the rain, of course, but keeping the dust down which is also nice to see. So the neighbors are wondering why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that happened . And my hunch is, there is some behind the scenes going on with Council and the other powers that be. So thank you if you're involved . I get downtown a lot. I'm sure I mentioned that. I have safety concerns on Lackawanna and Wyoming as the cars are coming entering onto Lackawanna from Wyoming . The green walk sign, I think it's suppose d to be about 20 seconds or 18 seconds or something like that. It turns out that the green light walking person is on for 18 or 20 seconds . But in 7 seconds the light turns green coming from Wyoming Avenue entering onto Lackawanna . That is an accident waiting to happen. Slow people, older people, wheelchair people get 7 seconds . I mean, you step off the curb, it takes about 7 seconds to walk across Lackawanna . I've seen it happen. I've seen brakes screech . I've seen people take a deep breath and panic. So that's going on. I hope something -- again, public safety -- and I hope nothing happens to anybody . But along these same lines, safety, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 I don't know who designed the intersection coming off of the -- well, where Jefferson meets at the University of Scranton coming off the bypass, the freeway -- the expressway -- coming off the expressway going into the Jefferson going straight to Linden, no one, no older person or person in a wheelchair , even a younger person is in danger at that intersection . There is no handicap crossing s. The traffic lights are crazy. There is no single time that all traffic is stopped . There is no little green man there. And everything is a curb. Everything is a curb. Again, I think it was designed I don't know how long ago. But the engineer , whomever , didn't have public safety in mind. It's pretty. It's a nice piece of architect ure, if you will, road architecture . It's very nice, you know, if you're looking at the sky view it's pretty. And it's well done. It's too well done. I don't think it's a -- I mean, it's dangerous . But it's more for (inaudible ) students are there all the time. They're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 hopping and skipping across to come downtown . There's a lot of Lackawanna Avenue traffic because of that from the students . And again, it's just unfortunate . I would hope something -- I'm very sorry about that. I'm not used to these kinds of things. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Thank you, Mr. White. Thank you. Have a good night. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. And, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could just take Mr. White's concerns and get them to the police department , please. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. Morgan? MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I didn't forget about the request for Council to put the Home Rule Charter on the ballot. I mean, it seemed to get lost somewhere before the pandemic actually struck. Tonight I wanted to come and talk about Dougher ty, Hayes and the litigation that's starting to form against naming the Central Scranton Expressway and Spruce Street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 after President Biden. And I'd like to ask this Council or you, Mr. Gaughan , as Council President to talk to the Mayor and withdraw naming anything after President Biden. And you could shake your head no. But it just goes to prove one very special thing. If the American people are watching the hearing s that are taking place in the Congress and the Senate, even Democratic Congress men and Senators are calling this president a liar, all right -- not Republicans but Democrats and Republicans , okay, over the withdrawal from Afghanistan and that he's a liar. This president is a liar. He's just -- he's got people getting killed on the ground, okay, former allies in Afghanistan , abandoned our allies in Europe. It's just a running and continual just a lack of respect for the American people all the way around coming to a podium, not answering one thing and walking away. And now they're complain ing that the President (inaudible ) asking him the right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 questions and now we find out that the Hunter Biden laptop was real. And the President of the United States was taking money from foreign governments . And we're naming streets after this man. Now in certain countries , in Afghanistan , okay, if you're a homosexual they kill you or just -- and that's the end of you, okay? I mean, if you work with the Americans they just kill you. They cut your head off or they do whatever and they kill you. He's abandoned everybody . And everything he said whether it has to do with the border -- even COVID, I mean, you sit up here and talked about COVID. Well, now they're finding out that all the things that went on during the Trump administration in regards to the things they said were plain silliness on Trump's part in regards to the virus turned out to be absolutely true that Obama and Biden through Fauci funded the COVID search in China. And this Council wants to name a street after a man who doesn't even know where he is and who comes to the podium as president and they say he says to the American people I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 shouldn 't be talking about this or he takes scripted questions off of reporter s so he could go one, two, three, four, five right down the line. I mean, is that somebody we should name a street after? Really, think about that. It's the most troubling thing. It just smacks only of politics . It really does. And you know something , if you have respect for the American people, I can't understand how anybody could even name anything after this man. Now I do understand that the Mayor worked in the Obama administration and the Biden administration in Washington before she came here as Mayor. But it's all politics and the Scrantonians deserve better than that. And there's just no way for this Council to defend this president and to force the resident s of the City of Scranton to endure his name on anything . If anything , should happen here, you should put this on the ballot and let the resident s of the City of Scranton decide whether they want his name on something or they don't. But since you can sit at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Council , you could try to force it down the residents ' throats that they're going to accept it because it's political and you said it. But that's not American , okay. I think that the Scrantonians have a right to self-determination on deciding what they want, the same thing with the Home Rule Charter . The people in this City are not servants to you. You are their servant . And you've forgotten that. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you for the lesson in foreign policy and science , Mr. Morgan. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: You guys can't see my pretty face with this mask on. Council , three, four people have asked why I haven't been coming to meeting s. It's simply because I'm so very discuss disgusted and repulsed that half a dozen City employees have been allowed to dictate their personal agenda over the wishes of the majority . This undeserving streets and (inaudible ) that we're going through . We have TV pictures of tens of thousands of illegals , uneducated , unvaccinated and so forth. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 know all that. The worst that the third world has to offer infesting our shores. This is -- this is terrible for our future. These are our future citizens . You know, they have already abolished America as we know it. You see that when you're asked if you want English anymore or Spanish . And these people want to make American like where they came from. It doesn't make sense to me. I've talked to so many people. Scranton is just worse than it was a year ago because of this administration 's coming down on us with everything and the pathetic excuse for a Governor that just won't use good judgment anymore. These people have changed it for the worse. You know, just walking the distance of this building I've talked to some people last month or two that they don't flush the toilet. They don't cook. They've been using microwaves doing everything they can to save up for winter heat money. This shouldn 't be. And it's not -- I'm talking -- I've talked to -- not like a single person, I've talked to several people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 that are just -- there's no way they're going to make it in the wintertime, you know, without help. On television the other day it showed Biden's busload of people getting off and having a buffet dinner. How many people out there have buffet three times a week? How many get free transportation across the country to go see other illegals . They have infested our schools . We have to have interpreters . The hospitals -- I tried to find out on my son's computer how many illegals are in beds because of COVID. Nobody will tell you. And there's got to be a figure. You know, I know all of you have seen on television ads pleading for donation s for veterans . This shouldn 't be. A veteran should never be in need of anything , especially some of that they show you that have been injured so severely , they and their families . And look what is being spent on illegals . Money that should go to people in this country is gone. I'll tell you, this is the man that you guys want to honor. He doesn't deserve 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 that at this time, you know? I know you won't like it but Joe Biden is no more than a successful failure . He is not my president . And I thank you for allowing me to finish. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is David Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening, Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . Okay, in my neighborhood and it would be nice to get it out before somebody gets a citation on it. Some of these adopting fire pits and they are kind of close to the houses. I couldn't lay out full length of me between my house and the next house on one side. And I don't think they realize the implications of a fire in the neighborhood . Usually we lose two other houses at best if one starts. So it would be interest ing trying to get word around, you know, be careful with fire. And I'll have to deal with it in my own way. But poor Joe Biden. It just gets -- he won the election and that's it. I didn't feel he was right in criticizing the Afghan 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 troops because the thieves that we put into power in the government of Afghanistan and they were -- a few were elected , stole a lot of money. There's like a 165 million dollars followed President Ghani. So, you know, I didn't really think the Spruce Street was the greatest idea. I thought the expressway was okay. And that's the way it is. Once again, COVID, the southern people -- our southern citizens are pretty good at spreading COVID all by themselves . They don't believe in vaccinations . They want to rebel against the vaccination s and many of the hospitals down south are in crisis care. That means that a doctor assesses your condition at the emergency room. And if he doesn't regard you or she as viable for survival , you get given comfort care. And if you make it, great. If you don't make it, oh well. Time to go to the hereafter, whatever that is. I was always a doubting Thomas. I haven't been to church in 49 years so, you know. And once again on voting, last week I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 mentioned that the Republicans are trying to confiscate or subpoena your name, your address , your -- part of your Social Security number, your driver's license number all over their imagine d fraud. And if you're out there watching in TV land, they plan to pass a constitutional amendment for the Pennsylvania Constitution . My advice is vote no because they always want to override the Governor . And they got it with the emergency declaration . So now we get to sit while there's a pandemic and while they argue and piddle back and forth in this state. And, if possible , some of you people were on the School Board. Are we -- I read about a lawsuit over certain school districts . And I lost the article . I think I could dig it up for further explanation . But are -- is Scranton any part of that? There was a half a dozen school districts mention ed and nobody else. This is serious with this town too. We're being shorted 40 million dollars a year. And just like PEL, we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 somebody to give us lots of advice and no money. Are we part of that? Can anybody answer that? MR. SCHUSTER : No, Scranton is not part of that. MR. DOBRZYN : We're not. It's a shame we aren't. We really deserve it. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes, Marie Schumacher would. Since Council President Bill Gaughan refuses to have e-mails and letters sent into Council read allowed for all viewers to hear, I have been asked by Fay Franus to ask a question . Fay Franus wants to know the answer to this question : Has Council considered researching how many firemen may be retiring in the next three years to cover the cost of the 10 firemen whose pay will end when the SAFER Grant expires in three years? This seems to be the only solution to this situation as how to continue paying for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 these 10 firemen . I need an answer. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : The grant would not be covered . MS SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry? MR. DONAHUE : The grant could not cover that scenario where you are just replacing retired firemen . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, no, but have you guys looked at how many people are going to be retiring in the next three years or are eligible to see if it's -- MR. DONAHUE : To accept the grant you still have to stay at that level. If we are at 144 now and we add 10, even if 10 retire, we still have to stay at 154. We can't be at 144. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. So -- okay, personally I believe the driver should be the efficiency of the current workforce and do we really need more firefighters . Now, onto mine, as by code you have until the 15th of December to act on the capital budget. And I ask that you table the capital budget until 14, December or the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 administration points -- puts a lot more meat on the bones of the current version whichever comes first. For example , the requested 2022 Park and Recreation budget is 1,525,000 dollars . But how will this be spent? The narrative provided says only the results of the McLane and Associates study will be used to determine needs and prioritization of projects . That is not complying with the requirements . The McLane contract runs through 2024. So when will we see this study? Will the lookout be funded in 2022? That is quite a historical place. Next year -- next week I'll bring you something on the WPA because you're all too young to know what that was. But they built it and it's going down fast. So how do we know? It needs help now. What is the funding split between the ARPA and the general budget? What is the general budget for that matter? Is it the operating budget? Lots more question s but time is short so let me just say, overall I don't believe the submittal -- that being capital 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 budget gets a passing grade. ARPA will be putting almost 70 million dollars into our coffers . 50 percent or 35 million dollars in year one is being used to fund about 40 percent of the capital budget. I'll leave it up to you to calculate the dollar percent that mine was on the line items. But further , why are we advertising also for proposal s for grant requirements , accounting , compliance and evaluation services for the ARP? Is there nothing that this City can't do inhouse? Does everything have to be put out for bid? It is imperative that before dollar one is spent there if the agreement between the Mayor and Council can have on this 35 million dollar windfall will be allocated . I don't worry but you and your grandchildren and children will repay this windfall with interest . I am providing this Treasury Department recommended guiding principles for your office. And can you tell me how much Portnoff has collected since they have been put under contract to collect the two year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 delinquencies ? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't have those figures tonight but we could certainly get them. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Oak Avenue, Minooka . I would like to request that this body consider by paragraph Resolution 7-C. Though it has been stated this way in prior documents , I'm request ing a correct ion moving forward . I'm addressing the fourth paragraph (inaudible ) whereas pursuant the election of option, the City elected to keep the current tipping fee of $43.25 per ton for the disposal of the City municipal waste for the remainder of the life of the landfill which was understood to be 30 years. This should be amended. The statement reflects which was understood to be 30 years. The correct and codified language states the expected life of 30 years or the life of the landfill . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 This statement should be moved and inserted after election of option and struck from the end. As it stands, the statement can be construed as to be used if the other party chooses to be litigious as a statement that it was intended only to be enforceable for 30 years. The original document reflected and expected a life of 30 years for the landfill but understood possible expansion and built in the term for the life of the landfill to reflect that. To not reflect that codified agreement in those terms, may cause future issues. It is also necessary to not impact the following section for the $100,000 a year donation by suggesting it was understood to be for 30 years. It was clear that it was expected to be enforced for the expected life of 30 years or the life of the landfill , whatever was greater . Now, onto ordinance 8-A for the strips. A noble idea, it is illegal and unlawful to adopt. Similar to use of medical marijuana , it was illegal by federal standards 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 but the states through mandate or decriminalization could order or request that it not be enforced , instruct the officer s to use discretion . As the broad intent of paraphernalia was not intended to prevent life saving measures . But until the state elects to decriminalize the use, the only tool available in this City is the City's Executive Branch requesting that the Chief of Police use broad discretion on this issue. I would also like to inquire if Dr. Rothchild has receive d a response about a request to the number of calls and citation s for the 4th of July fireworks which she had requested . Also, has she received a reply about changing the wording of the Police Department 's notice from the less aggressive and de-escalating terms in relation to the Civil Disturbance Unit being considered for renaming to the civil intervention unit and the Police Wireless Surveillance System to the police wireless public safety system. I would also request that memorandum 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 3-C be replied to in Fifth Order from all Council members rather than the public being require d to garner 5 percent of signatures . Would Council forward an ordinance allowing for the population to vote on the matter at large if they would like to have a government study commission impaneled ? Last, you asked for a report on the City employee 's vaccination rate and mandates . Have you had a chance response from the Mayor's Office? Thank you. I would take your (inaudible ) in Fifth Order. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any other speakers tonight ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have two comments . First off, last year in the budget process , Council put a line item in for the community centers . I spoke to Mr. Deeley back in February about getting this money allocated to community centers. He assured me that it would occur. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 It's been quite some time since then. And recently last week I reached out to Mrs. McMullin . I sent her an e-mail and I haven't heard anything back yet whether these funds would be disbursed to the community center. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we send communication to the proper administration to see when these funds could be allocated to the community centers ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : And then second, I got some calls in the last few days from the Bellevue section of Scranton . I'm sure Mr. McAndrew will be bringing up some too because I know he got some of the same calls. The City passed an ordinance in 1993 and the proper signage is from Lackawanna Avenue to Fourth to Broadway in that area in Bellevue . I think we need to send letters of correspondence to the administration and police department to see if we can get the enforcement of the 10,000 pounds restrictions in these areas. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 And I've also gotten some pictures today of some of the tractor -trailer s driving in that area currently . So if we can send correspondence to -- also to the Police Department and the administration about the enforcement of the 10,000 ton -- or the 10,000 weight limit in that area. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Actually it's the same as Mr. Schuster . But I could expand a little bit. So yesterday Andy Chomko, he's from the West Scranton Neighborhood Association reached out to me. He had concerns and complaints from residents of the Bellevue section . And the complaints are about large trucks. And they are not the salt trucks. That's always -- that's still a big problem on East Elm because of the bridge situation , you know, they're dealing with that which is terrible too but they understand that. These trucks are triaxials . They are big trucks that are driving up and down Railroad Avenue, Luzerne Street, and no one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 knows why. I mean, the ordinance that you speak of is right here. I have it. It's 1995. And this ordinance was written for Bellevue . It says prohibiting truck traffic having a registered gross weight of 10 tons or more on the three streets I just mention ed, namely 7th Avenue and its intersection with Lackawanna and its intersection with Railroad and from the intersection with 7th Avenue to the intersection with 4th Avenue, Broadway Street from its intersection with Railroad Avenue to the west end of the bridge over the Lackawanna River which being East Elm which you can't even cross now with these trucks because the salt trucks have to go somewhere else. But once again, these aren't the salt trucks. And signs are posted. You know, these signs are posted since the, you know, the ordinance was introduced. And it's -- and they're on Railroad Avenue. They're on the bridge near West Elm. There's one at Broadway and South Washington . There is one on Meridian . And there is one on the corner of Railroad and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Luzerne , 7th and Lackawanna . These are all four entrances into the Bellevue section of Scranton . So these signs are clearly posted. You know, this ordinance is, you know, being broken. So I also request that please send some correspondence to the Mayor and the Police Department to remind them that, you know, there's an ordinance in place and this -- there's a situation that's occurring because -- and some of the residents are concerned that, you know, because there's a lot of mines underneath most of Bellevue and their houses are being shaken by these big trucks and hence may be causing some of the water main breaks down there. So please send this correspondence . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few. First, just to respond to Mr. Coyne's questions regarding the responses I requested from the Scranton Police Department , I had back in July 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 received a response about the 4th of July fireworks and had said that there were -- that they responded to 105 calls regarding the fireworks but that no citations were issued. And I have not received any responses regarding my request last week in reference to the Civil Disturbance Unit. And next thing I wanted to bring up is to update people on OECD has put together a quality of life task force committee . And they had met last week. Council members Schuster and McAndrew had both been able to attend that. I was unable to due to my work schedule . But we did receive minutes and updates from them on that. And they'll be meeting again. But it looks like they have a good amount of people on that task force to bring a number of concerns on the quality of life tickets and how to make it a more effective process and just what we can do to fix that aspect of LIPS and how they operate . And there will be -- I expect that there will be some ordinance s that will come to our desk that we'll also be able to take action 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 on to help with that situation . And then lastly, I did receive an e-mail with a complaint about Vine Street. And I know we've had complaint s about this in the past. This person was complaining about the intersection s of Quincy, Clay and Webster at Vine Street. I believe we had sent something in the past. It might have been about Clay. And I know there was an accident there this year involving a pedestrian . But this person was complaining about the vehicles being too close to the intersections where they were parking and often times parking or blocking into the crosswalks . And they hadn't noticed any tickets being issued. So if we could contact SPD and ask them to complete a traffic study of those intersection s and to determine what we need to do to make them safer for pedestrians and drivers . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few comments tonight . One of the issues that was brought to my attention in North Scranton regarding the 1800 block of Ferdinand Street. There's really bad problems with water runoff and it's especially troublesome in the winter. People have lost time at work due to the -- being stuck in their driveway s. Mr. Preambo , the DPW Director did get back to me. There's a PEMA project in development for repair of the issues up there and the design is current ly underway with LaBelle and Associates . So I want to thank him for that. We've requested information on a number of different items and Mr. Voldenberg provided me a status report late this afternoon . In regard to the Green Ridge Plaza road marking s, the DPW advised NAI Summit Realty, the plaza owner to repair those. It's their responsibility to repair the road marking s there apparently according to their investigation . And there has been no response to date. And as I mentioned to Miss Hodowanitz 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 earlier this evening , the Serrenti Center, there was several questions regarding that. Council did receive an update from the administration . We will put that in Third Order for next week and then we are in the process of scheduling a caucus to get an update -- a further update for them to present that information . So we'll continue to update everyone . Also, in regards to one of the agenda items tonight , the DPW director did respond that in terms of the Keystone Sanitary Landfill , the money that we get -- not the money but the equipment in the amount of $100,000 that we get from them every year if you take -- if you subtract all of the money that's been spent so far, we have a remaining balance of $33,094.14 from the 2020 donation . No money has been spent on the 2021 donation program as of late. As I mentioned in the caucus, we did receive a proposal on the fixing the sound system in Council Chambers so we'll deliberate amongst our -- well, everyone will take a look at the proposal and then we'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 try to chart a path forward there. We received information from the OECD Director regarding questions posed last week. So we'll put that in Third Order. And then in terms of the caucuses with the department heads, we're still waiting on a response from the administration . I did speak briefly with the Mayor. And she did tell me that she's going to respond to my questions and my call last week for the City to take I think a more aggressive stance on the vaccination status of our employee . As I mentioned last week, back at the end of July I had requested information from the Mayor regarding the vaccination status of our City employees . After we sent -- Council sent a letter, the administration and the Mayor said that they were considering requiring any employee who chooses not to submit a proof of vaccination to get tested on a regular basis. So I had inquire d if that, in fact, ever happened . It's my belief that we -- the City needs to if they can mandates the vaccine for all City employees , fire, police, DPW, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 clerical , anyone that works for the City of Scranton should have their vaccine . If they don't, they should face termination or whether or not the Mayor -- they're going to do regular testing , I don't know. But I did ask. So whether or not that's within the law, the administration and the Mayor apparently are looking into that and we're expecting an answer by next week. Also, an update on the status of disability pensions , Mr. Voldenberg in the process as people who have been following Council for the last few years know we did have very severe issues with disability pensions within the Police and Fire Department . And there were efforts made to curb that. I would like an update on how that process is going and request a list also of how many employee s are out on compensation and disability . And we made that request already to the HR Director but have not heard back. And that's all I have. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

Resolution No. 222 of 2021 does not in any way amend any agreement between the City of Scranton and Keystone Sanitary Landfill .

All this resolution is doing is authorizing the acceptance of equipment that it was contemplated in an option provision in the settlement agreement . So I understand his concerns .

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE -- FOR ADOPTION -- FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 78, 2021 APPROVING AND ACCEPTING THE CITY OF SCRANTON CAPITAL BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2022 PURSUANT TO SECTION 904 OF THE CITY'S HOME RULE CHARTER . MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this capital budget is simply -- it's a wish list for the City on what we -- what projects the City may want to try to fund in the future, what things that we want to try to accomplish here, whether it's taking care of City Hall and the improvement s that need to be made here, whether it's with the park system, equipment at the DPW. In terms of the question that Miss Schumacher raised on the park study, that still is in development . It's still in process . But that will be done relatively soon.
