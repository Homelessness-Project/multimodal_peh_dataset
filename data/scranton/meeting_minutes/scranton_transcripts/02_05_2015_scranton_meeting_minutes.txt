It'spretty cleartomethatboth thepolice andthefirecontracts areanend runaround Act47andtherevisedrecovery plan.Wehaveessentially negotiated away theability forthecitytomakefuture decision saboutcostsavings ifneedbe.I believe it'sourjobaspublic servants to beawarethattheimportant decisions that wemaketodaywillhaveaneffect onthe future ofourcity.It'seasytothink abouttheeffect ofthedecision wemayhave onthecitytomorrow ,nextweek,oreven nextyear.It'simportant thatwethink abouttheeffect thatthedecision wemake1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 willhaveinthenextfiveortenyearsor evenlonger.Theeffect itwillhaveon future administration sandfuture council s andtheeffect thatitwillhaveonthe taxpayers ofScranton .It'smyfirmbelief thatextending contracts until2021, contradicting ourownrecovery planinmany instances ,andgiving outraises andother perksisnotthewaytodobusiness asa financially distressed city.Thankyou. MR.EVANS:Onthequestion ,my comments willbeshort,IwillsaythatIam impressed byunionnegotiated termsofthis MOU,particularly asarelates todisability pension language ,reemployment examinations , annual physical sanddrugscreening andall thewellnessprogram ,drugandalcohol testing ,lightdutyandrankelimination . Theunionleadership andthecitybargaining unitshould becongratulated onallofthose items. Withthatsaid,whiletherehasbeen somemovement onthelegacyitemsthatI posedintheFOPcontract,therehasnot beenenough change inretireehealth care,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 additional vacation timeandsickdaysalong withtheextended termofthiscontract to movethedoubtformefromanotoayes. AsIhavepreviously stated,itwaslessof aconcern withtweaking certain sections thanmystated goalofremoving certain sections altogether .Itisstillmyopinion thatwearetrading short-termgainforbad long-termfiscal policy,apattern thecity seemstohaverepeated manytimesbefore. WhileImaynotgoasfartosuggest itfeelslikegroundhogdayasoneofmy previous councilman haspreviously stated thereiscertainly afeeling ofdéjàvu. That'sallIhavefornow. MR.WECHSLER :Onthequestion ,I willbevoting forintroduction fortheMOU andthereason beingisforsomeofthe reasons thatCouncilman Evansjust mentioned .Therehasbeensomerevisions to pension contributions ,disability , flexibility andstaffing .Thoseareseveral ofthekeypoints thatwereinthevery original recovery planthatwasvotedonby thecitizens ofScranton byanoverwhelming1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 majority that,unfortunately ,theSupreme Courtdidnotallowustofollow.Inthat casethosebenefits original lycostus$40 million andrightnowtheyarestillcosting us$22million thatwehavenotpaidyet. Wearegetting theseimprovements thatwe havebeenseeking formanyyearsandnow theyareagreed uponbyboththe administration andtheunion. Theuniontookaveryactive rolein improving whattheysawasproblems within theirowndepartment ,people abusing sick time,people abusing disability andother matters likethat.I'malsoveryexcited thatifitworksoutthiswaythatthe retireeswillallowforthehiring ofnew firefighters .Thesenewfirefighters will comeinathalftheexisting gradeandfor several yearsbefore theymaketheirnew grade. Itisalsoveryimportant forme thatwemaintain thestaffing levelthat keepstheneighborhood firehouses opens.As everyone knows,I'mfromEastMountain where Engine 10isanintegral partofour1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 community .Afewyearsagoanincident in ourneighborhood wheretwoliveswerenearly lostwascaused byafirehousebeingclosed.

MR.MCGOFF:Iwouldjustliketo address acouple ofthings.Firstofall, asfarastherevisedrecovery planis concerned Ithinkthekeywordthereis revised .Wearelooking atthemandates thatwerecontained inthedraftproposalof therevisedrecovery planarethings that canberevised,that'sthewholeidea,and theyhavebeeninthepast.Whatthese, mandates aresupposed todoisprovide1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 guidelines forrecovery .Ifthecontract thatwehavebeen--whichwehavebeen presented ,howaboutthatforproper English ,iftheyhaveaccomplished thesame goalsasthemandates intheproposalthen thereisnoreason whyrevision can'tbe done,anditismybelief thatwhatweare doingwiththesecontracts ,yes,arewe extending thembeyond whattherevised recovery planwouldbe,yes,butIbelieve thatwhatwearedoingisthatwecanhelp achieve recovery through thesecontracts alongwithenhancing public safety. Ithinkthesecontacts achieve both ofthosegoalsandthosearegoalsthatI thinkareimportant tothecity. MR.ROGAN:Imadethemajority of mycomments onthisundermotions ,butjust afewbriefpoints.Many,andMr.McGoff is right,thenewspaper really pushed thisidea thatthisisonlyashort-termsavings. Whilethesavings are$6.5million inthis dealaregreat,thelarger savings isby avoiding arbitration ,andIdon'tthink thereisanyone outtherethatcouldsaythe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 unionwouldhavereceived --thecitywould havereceived abetter dealbygoingto arbitration thangoingthrough thisprocess , that'ssimply nottrue.Because ofthat process ,asCouncilman Wechsler mentioned , westillhavea$22million billowedtothe city'spolice andfirefighters andthat's growing byover$100,000ininterest every month,andthatwasbecause ofthefailure ofprevious administrations tonegotiate a goodfaith,andnottoputalloftheblame ontheformer mayorbuthewasleaddown thatpathbythePennsylvania Economy: LeagueandbyDCED. Thatis--arbitration ismybiggest concern .Thecityhastimeandtimeagain lostandlostbadatarbitration .By extending thiscontract outthatisavoided . IknowCouncilman Gaughan mentioned thatin 2017thatthiscan'tberenegotiated ,it certainly can,butitwouldtakeexactly what'sgoingonrightnow.Rightnowthere isacontract inplaceforanother three years.Thisdidn'thavetotakeplace.It wasapledge bytheadministration toreopen1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 contracts andtrytoreceive costsaving measures forthecity.Neither sidewas underanyobligation tonegotiate acontract atthispoint.Wecouldn'thavewaited untilthecontract 'ssunset,butthis administration choseadifferent paththan theprevious one.Now,whichpathdoyou prefer tochoseiscertainly uptoyou,but Ibelieve thepathofnegotiating goodfaith willobviously achieve better results than heading toarbitration ,andthat'sall. MR.EVANS:Onebriefcomment ,I thinkweareseeing somechanges onthe arbitration frontacross thestatesoI'm notsosurethearbitration boogiemanis something weshould beafraid ofallofthe time. Secondly ,mybiggest concern asI saidbefore arethelong-termeffects.We areadding toourlegacy costs.Retiree health careisnotfree.Therewillbe60 firemen inthispartofthiscontract and therewillbe99policementhatwillbepart ofthatthatwilleligible forretiree health carebenefits .It'snotgoingtogo1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 away.Thecanisbeingkicked downtheroad againanditwillstartin2020anditwill notenduntilall150ormoreareoffthe books,andthenitstarts againbecause new hireswillalsohaveretiree health care. MR.GAUGHAN :AndIwouldjust comment thatwiththearbitration process I understand thepoint,butatsomepoint-- atsome,youknow,pointyouhavetosayto yourself howmuchcanthecityafford,how muchcanwepay?Youknow,Mr.Roganwent through theraises before thatweregiven because ofthearbitration awards andweare giving raises againnow.Youknow,the$22 million isstillthebigelephant inthe room.Howdoweafford that?Whoisgoing topaythatbill?Idon'tknow.It'sjust, youknow,IagreewithMr.Evansinthefact thattherehasbeenashiftinthe arbitration awards thatIthinkpeople are starting totakeintoaccount whatcities andtheirtaxpayers canafford,sothat's allIhave.Thankyou. MR.MCGOFF:Anyone else? MR.ROGAN:Justonebriefcomment ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 Ihatetobelabor thispointanddisagree withmyfriend Councilman Evans,butinthe current police contract through theyears thiscontract hasbeenapproved thereare sevenpolice officers eligible forhealth care.Underthecurrent firecontract , thereisone.Now,whenthiscontract expires itwillthenbeuptothemayor,the council atthattimetonegotiate thatpart out,andsomemaysay,well,that'snever happen,butitalready didhappen once,and Ibelieve Mr.Councilman Wechsler brought thisuplastmonth. MR.WECHSLER :Ithas. MR.EVANS:InaCourtcaseit happenedonceandthejudgeruledinour favor,ironically enough,andnowweare putting himbackin.SoIagreewithwhat yousaid,it'salltrue,butthereality is thatoncethatisinthecontracts itwill neverbetakenoutagainbecause thenext timeacontract isup99people thatare goingtobevoting forthatcontractarethe onesthatwillbeeligible forretiree health carebenefits intheFOP.Halfof1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 their--halfofthefiredepartment willbe eligible .Thatmeanshalfthepeople potentially voting onthenextcontract will bevoting totakeoutretiree health care benefits .Idon'tseethathappening ,so callithumannature,callitahunch,butI justthinkthatonceweputitinthereit's inthereforever. MR.GAUGHAN :Andjusttofurther clarify ,Imean,itdoessayinregards to health careinthecurrent recovery plan thatweareunderandintherevisedone, thedraftthatthe2015revisedrecovery planshallnotprovide anyretiree health carebenefits toanycurrent orfuture city employee thatretires fromcityemployment fromtheperiod 2015to2018and indefinitely thereafterunless modified in thesubsequent revisedrecovery plan.It saysthesamethinginthe2012recovery plan.So,essentially ,weareviolating our ownrecovery plan.
