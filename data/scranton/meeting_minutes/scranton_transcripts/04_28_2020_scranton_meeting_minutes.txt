AGREEMENT BETWEEN KEYSTONE MISSION AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO OPERATE WESTON FIELDHOUSE AS AN EMERGENCY STAY-IN-PLACE HOMELESS SHELTER DURING THE Covid-19 PANDEMIC . 3-B. MINUTES OF THE ETHICS BOARD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MEETING HELD MARCH 12, 2020. 3-C. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON MUNICIPAL RECREATION AUTHORITY BOARD MEETING HELD MARCH 7, 2020. 3-D. MINUTES OF THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE REVIEW BOARD MEETING HELD MARCH 12, 2020. 3-E. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM MAYOR PAIGE G. COGNETTI DATED APRIL 21, 2020 REGARDING RECENT APPOINTMENT OF THE CITY'S FIRE CHIEF. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I have just a quick comment just to make a few points regarding 3-E, which is correspondence from the Mayor regarding the appointment of Al Lucas, Fire Chief. First off, Council 's vote of the appointment of this fire -- of the Fire Chief did not -- would not affect his ability to perform his job functions as either Fire Chief or Emergency Management Coordinator in any way whatsoever . And to suggest so in this time of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 crisis I think is disingenuous . Secondly , the only justification Council asked the administration for in terms of raising the Fire Chief's salary is simply provided in paragraphs four and five of the Mayor's letter. And lastly, while I agree with the Mayor's point that it does not makes sense that the Deputy Chief makes over $10,000 more than the Fire Chief, but this issue of director level salaries isn't anything new. In 2017, the Fire Chief salary was 67,228. So the City has made significant progress in raising the Fire Chief's salary. My main issue is I do not believe the administration went about addressing this issue in the right way. The Mayor's transition team could have gave the previous Council salary suggestions when the budget was being adopted . We could have waited until the 2021 budget process . Now might not be the best time to give out raises. Or the administration could have simply come to Council , justified their position and Council could have considered legislation amending the 2020 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 budget. I know I as well as the rest of this Council is more than willing to work with the Mayor to get through the difficult times we do have ahead. But being a rubber stamper I don't think is working together . Working together requires building consensus . And I look forward to working with the Mayor moving forward to address the issues that we have forthcoming . That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Also, I was going to give a response to 3-E as well. I'd just like to say that the correspondence today from the Mayor I think it addressed the original request from Council . And it, you know, put in writing how those funds were to be allocated . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Or not on question , I'm sorry. Any other comments for the Third Order items? No? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. It's not an announcement . It's an aftermath . Last Sunday, the FOP and the Scranton Police Department -- I announced it last week. But they did a free pasta dinner on Sunday which was great. My understanding it was a huge success . And, you know, it's tough during these times. So I just want to thank the ladies and gents that were involved with that. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. Yes, I have two announcements . First off, I'd like to say that I received my mail-in ballot today which I'm excited about so that I could vote in the primary election . And I just wanted to make people aware that they could apply for a mail-in ballot up until the deadline on May 26th. The primary election is officially on June 2nd. That's the date that it was moved to. But it's a really easy way to just apply online in order to receive that mail-in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 ballot. And then you could just vote from the comfort of your home and follow the instruction s so that you could send it back in. So if you're interested in doing that you can go online to votes, V-O-T-E-S PA dot com slash apply mail ballot. So I want to make people aware of that. And the other thing that I thought was important to announce , I know more and more people are using the parks with the weather starting to become nice. And so many people just being home and needing to get out, which is understandable . And they are there to be used. My wife and I, we live just a couple blocks from Nay Aug Park. So we use that park pretty frequently . And I know that the Recreation Authority Board is working to address this issue. But there has been an increase in the amount of litter. I see it all around when we're walking . And you could bring a bag with you and pick it up. But it's easier if people just don't litter and pick it up themselves and clean up after themselves when they are utilizing the parks.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 We should not be seeing gloves and disposable masks on the ground. That's a hazard at this time where we're trying to control the virus from being spread. People should be extra conscious of taking off those items. And I've also heard that people are not cleaning up after their dogs as much as they should be. And as a dog owner who always makes sure to carry extra bags, that's just a really courteous thing to do. So I would appreciate that if people who were utilizing the parks are just reminded to clean up after themselves . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Just my weekly reminder if you haven't filled out your census form to please do so. You could do so online at my2020census.gov. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have one. Late this afternoon I received an e-mail from the Mayor that the Mayor and her administration are extending the emergency declaration due to the coronavirus pandemic until May 15th. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I did not receive a copy of the actual declaration . I think that was going to be sent to Lori soon. And then we'll put it in Third Order on our agenda for next week. Also, as I have been mentioning for the last few weeks, if anybody would like to comment on any agenda items or any City business , you can -- members of the public can send those comments in writing to our City Clerk, Lori Reed by e-mailing LReed@scrantonpa .gov. Council will accept public comment until the day of our meeting , Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. Public comment is reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed on the official record and in the minutes of our meetings . Council 's agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . And our agenda and our minutes can be accessed by going to www.scranton pa.gov and clicking on the City Council page. Also, I want to note that Mr. Moretti 's audit -- the gas card audit is located for public inspection on the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Council 's page. There's a link to it. It was not -- there was not enough time to put it on our agenda tonight in Third Order. We received it on Saturday . The agenda was posted on Friday. Or we received it late Friday night and didn't have enough time to put it on the agenda. So it will be on the agenda for next Tuesday . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. At this time I'd ask if a member of Council could please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals to be placed into the record and on our official minutes of this meeting . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion and there's been a second. On the question ? There were four individuals who submitted public comment . They were Johanna Beck, Derek Raines, Marie Schumacher and Fay Franus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 As I had mentioned the past few weeks, I have been going through as all Council members have in reviewing the public's questions and their comments . I did receive some responses to the questions that the public had. I'll save those for Fifth Order tonight . Anybody else on the question ? There's been a motion. There's been a second. We've been on the question . All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (PUBLIC COMMENT ) (Johanna Beck) Would it be possible for our city of Scranton to post daily positive COVID 19 cases on a daily basis on your website ????? I, think this is important information the residents of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Scranton should be made aware of. This is not an unusual request as it, is, being done in other states. Some of, the cities in these states alert their residents by e-mail or text messages if they signed up for, it.. Please consider providing this important information by posting it on your website which would not be a complicated procedure . Please present this at the council meeting this week. Thank you very much for your consideration . Johanna Beck, 416 Alder St., Scranton , Pa. (Derek Raines) My name is Derek Raines, I live at 919 Monroe Ave. Scranton PA 18510. First I would like to say how happy I am with our new city administration . Each of the city council members and the mayor are doing a great job, and giving us pride once again in our city. I thank each member of our city government who has answered questions I have sent you. You know who you are. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 It is unfortunate our city has been left with not one but two black eyes. Fortunately each of you are doing your part to improve our image and our town. Thank you. I have three suggestions . Obviously I don't know if they would work but I would like to speak to them anyway. Item number one, during the last Mayor Cognetti streaming video Mayor Cognetti suggested paying your refuse fee as soon as possible . I looked online for how I could pay this and I was unable to come to any firm conclusion as to how I should pay it. I would be more than happy to pay it as soon as possible . My wife and I write very few checks each year. We need to come up with electronic transferring etc. I know this is something Mayor Cognetti is working on. That brings me to my next why don't we come up with a way for people to pay their garbage fee in advance for a discount ? For instance I own a double home. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 pay $600 per year for my two properties . Allow a $25-$50 per year discount for paying your refuse fee a year in advance . I know my wife and I would be more than happy to help the city by giving it money in advance for something that is truly needed. The next thing I thought of and how the city can make money is to sell copies of the nurse painting that is in the mayors office. Truly a piece of art. I would be glad to pay for a copy of the photograph /print. I've been married to my favorite nurse for over 35 years. My wife is proud to work as a operating room Registered Nurse at Geisinger Medical Center. It is a matter of convenience and quality of life. The city of Scranton needs to do more to attract it's healthcare professionals to the Hill section . I do not know what we as a city can do to incentivize high paid professionals to move into the Hill Section . On the coronavirus , as a retired occupational safety and health specialist , we need to practice all safeguards that have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 laid before us. We also need to provide a way to communicate with non-English -speaking neighbors about what is and is not supposed to be done during this crisis. From neighbors having parties , to groups of children playing outside together . The population needs to be made aware of the seriousness of this pandemic , and the consequences of their actions . We cannot afford to reduce our guard. Thank you, DEREK (Marie Schumacher ) On 21 March The Times-Tribune published "Scranton parking free during coronavirus ." It had much information such as the outside operator of the parking system had agreed to provide the first 30 minute of street parking free to help businesses that remain open to conduct retail operations and takeout 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 commerce ," and during a press conference the Mayor announced street parking will be free going forward , at least during the coronavirus crisis. My question (s) then is (are) is the operator of the parking system providing this at no expense to the City and, if not, is the City committed to reimburse the operator and, if so, would the funding come from the Operating Budget or the Parking Authority . If the City is compensating the Operator when was this approved by Council or the Authority ? I believe the Budget approved Plan was if put out to bid the collection of Delinquent Refuse Bill payments ; when will this RFP be issues? What is the status of migration of Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to a Payroll Preparation Tax negotiations with the Scranton School District ? When will the list of streets to be paved (other than those funded by OECD) be made public and when will the RFP/Q be published ? o What is the City's current Credit Rating? o Has the Other Post Employment Trust Fund been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 established and, if so, what is the balance ? If not, when will this occur? What is the status of the Utility Bill Audit and when will it be available to the public via Third Order of Council 's Agenda? Marie Schumacher (Fay Franus) I understand you may be speaking about sending out the garbage fee bills tonight . Have you ever taken into consideration that there is a lawsuit out there claiming the people may have paid too much every year and that if the city loses this lawsuit tax payers will have to be paid back? My point is why aren't you taking a more lenient approach and not charge the taxpayers as much as you have every year. I understand you get $30.00 off if you pay early. That has nothing to do with what I am talking about. Also if the city loses the city will probably appeal and there will be another legal bill the citizens mush ay for. To say nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 of the fact you as council will fight to keep the people from getting paid back because that is what you already did with the fifty million dollar law suit the city lost and now it is being appealed . YOU want the city to win that appeal. You as a council did NOT fighting for the people to get the money back that THEY overpaid . So I can see the pattern here. To say nothing of the fact these very people are still getting charged too much and you don't seem to care-- another $10 million this year and god knows how much in the garbage fee the people are paying more than they should. What is the story with the collection of delinquent garbage fee bills? Did that company start doing that yet? The law says as you well know but also ignore the DPW does NOT have to pick up the garbage of any property that does NOT pay their garbage fee. A law was also passed to state all residents must put lids on their garbage this preventing any bags being left out for animals to get at causing a health hazard -- therefore allowing DPW to stop picking up the garbage of people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 who do not pay. But you as council pick and choose which laws YOU want to follow. Whatever suits YOU not the people you are suppose to be representing . How about last weeks meeting --you broke all records The regular meetings was 16 minutes ! But you had no time to read questions and comments from the public. As Mark McAndrew very sarcastically said "We are doing things OUR WAY" Really? This is a photo of my neighbors garbage 2 weeks ago she has not paid since 2011 and there are five more people on my block alone who haven't paid in years. But those of us who do pay will be made to keep paying for them because YOU don't want to enforce laws. Look below--and there are bags on the side of her car you can't even see. Fay Franus (photo attached ) (END OF PUBLIC COMMENT ) MR. GAUGHAN : Now we do have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Mr. Moretti here. Mr. Moretti , thank you for sticking around. I know that Dr. Rothchild has a few questions for you to wrap the gas card discussion up. I have a few additional questions as well. So, we'll utilize our time now to do that. So, Dr. Rothchild , do you want to pick up with your questions ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Sure. It was more of a comment . But I wanted to thank Mr. Moretti and his hard work in putting together this audit and being very thorough with it. We do appreciate the information . It seems like my understanding of the audit and what Mr. Moretti explained is that it's difficult to hold any particular people accountable because it just happened . And this problem occurred so widely with misuse of the gas cards. So I am still like a little unclear on what we do in terms of taxes and how we get that money back if that's something that we were to proceed with. But other than that I think, you know, I'm not surprised by what was in the audit based on the information we had previously .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I would also like to just thank Mr. Moretti for the job he did. Going back to when, you know, to the fall when we asked that an audit be done, you know, the point of it wasn't for an I gotcha moment. It was to better develop policies going forward so that we wouldn't get into that situation again. And I think this is a pretty solid blueprint on where to begin moving forward and developing a policy and hopefully we could, you know, work with the administration to have that policy developed and implemented . So, Mr. Moretti , thank you for this. I appreciate it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay, Mr. Moretti , I have a just a few additional questions . So the City -- did the City provide you with employee attendance reports ? Did you use that in your -- to complete your audit? MR. MORETTI : Bill, the -- during the first part -- first phase of the audit when it came to Fire Chief DeSarno , I needed to look because I wanted to see -- I couldn't figure out when the incident that was reported in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 newspaper had happened . So I had data. I had data. It was here, here, and here. So I had asked for attendance controller s to see when was this issued the newspaper was drumming up it happened . When I received it, I was able to kind of back into when it happened . It was over a weekend I recall. Don't hold me to it. I don't have his report in front of me. But I want to say it was like a, you know, Friday to Monday or maybe a Thursday to Tuesday , something like that. When I went back to the attendance controller , he hadn't taken his time off. And so it suggested to me what the heck is going on here? The paper is claiming he was on vacation . He wasn't. When I tracked through the detail of his activity , clearly he could never have been in the City of Scranton because if you're hypothetically on a Monday in New Jersey and a Tuesday in Maryland , on a Wednesday -- you know, it's hard to believe that what you're doing is driving back to Scranton . So that got my antennas up. Then I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 started asking and looking through some of the other attendance controllers . And it occurred to me he didn't work a full year or he didn't take a vacation a full year. I think we're all -- I think we're all very good workers . And I think we're very dedicated to our rules. But to think that I don't take a vacation or you don't take a vacation or a sick day is odd. And when I looked over several years, I realized there was very little to no time taken. Now what -- MR. GAUGHAN : Did you get an employee attendance for -- okay, so that's for former Fire Chief DeSarno . MR. MORETTI : Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Did you get them for other employees as well that -- how did that work? MR. MORETTI : I think I asked for other employees . I did not ask for every employee because it would be well beyond the scope of what I was engaged to do. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. MR. MORETTI : I did ask for a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 key people. And, you know, and I found on a few people that, yes, they used it during times they were sick. One of them that comes to mind if you wanted to refer to -- but there's others. And again, I always -- I feel like if I single one person out, all of a sudden, I'm making it about them. But, yes, I came across a few people who were sick at the time. It was on their attendance controller s and yet they still used a gas card. So the question I have for you is, if you're sick, you're down. You're not on call. You shouldn 't be on call. That would be -- that would be kind of outrageous for even the City or anybody else, private employer including -- ask that you be available. But yet you're filling your gas card. So, yes, I did come across that. It is noted. Although I have to tell you I didn't open up a can of worms with it since it really had nothing to do with the fuel usage other than the fact that I put it down as a very regular item. If you go through the detail of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 people that I did look at, I looked at your biggies . I looked at -- the Mayor by the way keeps absolutely no records , which surprises me because -- MR. GAUGHAN : You mean Mayor Courtright, correct ? MR. MORETTI : Correct . Every position , you know, should keep time even if they are salaried people they should keep time because when it goes to your payroll department , how do they deduct it from their accrued benefit time? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I noticed -- I noticed that in your report and not to go off on tangent here because I realize that it's beyond the scope. But that is something that I think needs -- now the second part of this that really should be looked into because that's a major concern , you know, employees -- certain employees when they leave employment and they are done with their employment with the City, they many times get paid out for that unused time. MR. MORETTI : Because they get paid that time out. And if they are not entitled to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 it, what is the City paying for? MR. GAUGHAN : Right. Another thing that stuck out to me if you could expand on this a little bit is Car 22, which actually according to your report and according to the fire department officials is not an actual car. So you had stated in your report that receipts of this Car 22 are retained by one of fire captains in the department . Did you review those receipts and are they available for public inspection ? MR. MORETTI : I did not review the receipts . Are they available ? I don't know. MR. GAUGHAN : I mean, do they exist, I guess? MR. MORETTI : I don't know. MR. GAUGHAN : Do you know if they exist? MR. MORETTI : Well, I'd say to you probably they'll be sketchy because they're several years back. Again, in all due respect to the fire captain, his primary role is not a bookkeeper keeping receipts . What I was concern ed about was that he had access to both the card and the receipts . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 So the obvious question I asked, well, what if the fire captain , you know, gave it to his college son to go down to Florida and hang out for a weekend , who would know? And the answer that came back -- and I appreciate the honesty and the forthcomingness of the folks that I did interview was, we wouldn't know. So here's the reality . Your DPW Director who gets the first -- he's the first line -- he's on your front line when it comes to the invoice. He's not going to know if it was inappropriately used, nor will anybody above him. Your Fire Chief is not going to know if it was inappropriately used. He's not looking at that, nor does he get his activity for the department . So it was a huge red flag in terms of internal control . And it should be immediately ceased. And I think they probably have already taken steps to cease that because , you know, having the card possession and the receipt s is ludicrous . MR. GAUGHAN : Now, on some of the -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I notice in going through some of the transactions you have next to some of them new vehicle or different vehicle with a question mark. Can you explain that? MR. MORETTI : If you look -- and it's so hard to make out. The mileage clearly was not being input properly . It was actually a conversation I had with Fire Chief Lucas today. It was -- I said, Chief, your mileage , you know, you're saying you only used it this -- your mileage goes from almost a hundred thousand miles to three thousand miles and back to a hundred thousand , 98, 96. Who would know that unless you're sharing your card to which case that's what I believe was the proper answer. But he wasn't alone. Lots of folks shared their card. But here's the thing. If I'm looking at an voice, okay, if you're looking at an invoice and the first thing you open up to is mileage , you look 99999, 00000, 99999, you're immediately going to go, whoa, I've got to ask a couple questions . Are they doing this right? Am I missing something ? Am I looking at it wrong? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I put new car in because those were in my notes as to whether there was a question of is this a new vehicle . But if you look at the reports that I did if you go down just the mileage line, you're going to wonder to yourself , this is one car. What the hell is happening ? You can't go from 90,000 miles to 200 miles to 3,000 miles. And that's I think where the -- one of the concerns was that doesn't take a lot to look at. You know, maybe you look at and you don't know every car, every department . When you see the millage listed, you know, you could take a 12 year old and they probably could take a look at that in about two minutes and say, hey, this is -- something 's wrong here. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. MR. MCANDREW : Can I rewind back a little bit to Car 22? So you just established and I had this question in caucus. I never got to ask it. I'm glad we brought it up. So Car 22 is not a car. It's a card. MR. MORETTI : Yes. MR. MCANDREW : What, that just got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 passed out to anybody and nobody -- like -- MR. MORETTI : Well, I think in fairness they thought they were actually control ling it pretty well by giving it to the fire captain . It doesn't get passed to everybody . But the fire captain has possession . Now, let's say you're a new recruit. And you have to go for a training somewhere . Maybe they give it to you and you put gas in your personal vehicle , which has happened . Or maybe they give you a vehicle that's available and they give you that card in case you need to fill it. That card gets used very often. If you look at the final summary , you'll see that the unassigned cards are used more often than almost every other card combined. So if you started -- if you said, you know what, we don't want to fix the whole thing. We just want to fix a little bit, that's where you start. Get rid of those unassigned cards and you've got at least a good building block to correct your issues. Does that make any sense? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. GAUGHAN : My last question and kind of comment here, Mr. Moretti , is -- now I didn't -- I know that Fire Chief Lucas had been sending multiple pieces of information today to back up some of the transactions that you had noted in your report. I haven't had a chance to go through all of them because we just got them today. But I would appreciate if you could go back and amend your report to include that only for -- and in terms of just fairness because when I first read that report and I saw -- I forget what the one line in there was. It did raise a red flag because it does say in there that, you know, he didn't provide any other documentation to kind of back up some of the items that were on there. So if you wouldn't mind doing that I think -- and only because this is going to go into the official record. And I would like that to be included if you don't mind. MR. MORETTI : That's not a problem . I'd be happy to. Again, I didn't read through everything . But I will tell you that it's probably going to change very little. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. MORETTI : So far as let's take at one point I did review this. He gave me his personal calendar . And as I said, some of it didn't match the fill-up dates. But it's a one sided checkbook . It tells you what he claims he was doing on certain days. However , in the columns of who he was with there is nobody noted. Second thing is, even the instance which I probably agree with him I think as I said anecdotally the one trip that was made out of state was filled by a diesel vehicle . However , I need to see the approval of the trip, the people who were on the trip to make it where it was a no-brainer . And I'm not so sure he'll be able to present that. So what I will do is, I will go through -- now, what I would like to say on his behalf is sharing of the card was something that was cultural . It was not just him. Do you follow what I'm saying? And I think that to some degree even though it won't change my opinion , in my opinion he was working for someone else at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 time that most of these trips happened . It was shared cards and pins across the board. And I'm not so sure it's fair to single him out and say, boy, you know, you're a bad guy. But I don't know that what he gave to me is going to be sufficient enough to change much. However , Bill, I will do that because I think in fairness to the Council , to everybody else, I would like to set the record straight . So let me look at it. I didn't have a chance to review everything. Let me look at it. I'll come back to you and I'll -- I'll come back to the full Council . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. I appreciate that. And last question , we had a former Licensing and Inspections Director , Pat Hinton. I didn't see any information on his usage of his vehicle . Was that -- I know it wasn't included in the report. But did you look at any milage or gas usage? MR. MORETTI : It was the permits director . I just want to be clear. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, and the only reason I ask that is just another , you know, fairness . Everyone else was kind of -- their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 gas usage was examined here. And I did not see his name. MR. MORETTI : We did do one for the permits director . I think I attached it. I didn't look -- when I look, I look at the card. And I look at the vehicle . And I look at the position . MR. GAUGHAN : I could have missed that too. Maybe it was in there and I just missed it. MR. MORETTI : How about this? In the interest of time since I'm already going to review Fire Chief Lucas and the stuff that he sent this afternoon , let me take a look for you. And if need be, I'll find where he left. Do you know what year he left and where the new person picked up? MR. GAUGHAN : You know what, I'm actually -- I apologize . It is actually in here. Although it says -- I'll have to go back and look. Maybe that's my mistake . I think he left 2019 I want to say at some point. MR. MORETTI : Okay. So he probably left after the scope of what I did. MR. GAUGHAN : No, actually so I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 seeing that you have here Tom Oleski the deputy director . But I don't see anything for -- I don't see anything for Pat Hinton. MR. MORETTI : Okay. Let me take a look. And as I said, I will give you an update on Pat Hinton as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, great. I don't have any other questions , Mr. Moretti . I want to thank you for sticking around and taking time out. Does anybody else have any comment s or questions ? MR. SCHUSTER : I had one more. It was -- I think it was stated that the individual in question said that the card wasn't his or he didn't make those purchases . And it seemed to cover a gap in time of about a year. Were we able to identify what was occurring there? MR. MORETTI : You know it was funny. Let me tell you my instinct s and then let me tell you reality and see whether you could draw your conclusion accordingly . My instincts tell me it's very hard to -- for you to use my card I'd have to give you physical possession of the card and my pin number. And that sounds 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 unreasonable , right? Who the heck does that? If you want, you could give me your pin for your bank account . You know, you're not going to do that. Nobody does that. But in this environment when it was culturally , the fact that the Chief was his boss -- if I'm your boss and I ask you can I have your cards and your pin? I need it. Or if I take over your vehicle and you leave your card in the vehicle , and I say to you, hey, I got your card. I don't need a new one. Can I get your pin? I guess my thing is, you can't rule anything out. It's not conclusive . And because of the abundance of sharing of pins and cards, I didn't want to surmise a conclusion . But my intuition tells me that that's probably not realistic . It probably -- for me to -- for you to be using my pin and my card, doesn't sound right in most cases. I don't know if I'm being clear. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Any other questions from anyone? All right, Mr. Moretti , I want to thank you again so much. Stay safe. Stay healthy . And again, we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 appreciate your time. MR. MORETTI : Thank you. I appreciate it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Bye-bye. MR. MORETTI : Bye-bye now. MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed, Fifth Order, please. MS. REED: Thank you. FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : For Fifth Order, yeah, I do have a few and then some might be just a request for information . So when we're looking back at last week in Third Order we got the Composite Pension Board minutes . And there was discussion on the 18th over the investments there and how volatile the markets were. Do we have any idea, type of update on how the pension fund is fairing right now in this situation ? MR. GAUGHAN : That would be -- we can ask Larry Durkin that. I know it goes, you know, because of the coronavirus pandemic , it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 ebbing and flowing . It's changing probably every day. But, yeah -- MR. DONAHUE : Sorry to interrupt . But I believe there was a pension meeting two weeks ago. So I believe when they approved their minutes from the previous meeting that's when they come to us when they appear on the agenda. So we probably, once they have the next meeting , you know, we might be able to get an update from them. But I think that's the process in which it usually works in which they send it down. We're usually a month late on getting them just because they have to approve them before they send them down to us. MR. GAUGHAN : And they have a financial report I think baked in there that would be in the backup of the minutes . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. The other thing that also came out of Third Order last week was according to the emergency declaration and it's cited Section 614 E1 of the Code, purchasing , leasing , maintenance and renting of goods, properties and services and supplies could be waived during the emergency .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 I was wondering -- and I think there was a -- would have been around $21,000 was the cap. I was just wondering , have we made any of these purchases ? Have we procured any services or goods using this emergency declaration ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I don't know that off the top of my head, Mr. Schuster . That's a good question . But, Mrs. Reed, maybe if we could ask Controller Murray. He might know that information . MR. SCHUSTER : And then the last thing was -- it was an announcement . Maybe I should have done it a little bit earlier . There was a notice given to us that there will be a public hearing by DCED. It's going to be advertised in the paper tomorrow for Sunshine . And it says there's a notice hereby given that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development has schedule d a public hearing to receive testimony presented on behalf of the City of Scranton , Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania with respect to the recommendation of Act 47 to consider whether the City's Act 47 determination 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 pursuant to the municipality 's Financial Recovery Act of 87. The hearing is going to be held on April 30th, 2020 at 1 p.m. It's going to be a Zoom meeting . And prior to the start of the hearing the department will accept comment s from the public via e-mail. And let's see what the e-mail is -- so with this e-mail, I'm not sure what e-mail the public can send in comments to. But there will be an advertisement in the paper. Does anyone else have that e-mail or where public comment could be sent? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't have it. I was actually going to make that announcement in Fifth Order as well. I don't have that e-mail in front of me. I think you're right. It will be in the newspaper tomorrow . I was notified I believe Friday of last week that as Council President they're requesting me to make comment -- public comment on, you know, the City's situation in Act 47. We -- I don't believe that we were provided enough notice. I mean, I literal ly found out about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 this last week which I think is so unprofession al that the Council President and the Council was not given enough notice, Mr. Schuster . But I think I'm required to give comment . And then, of course, if any other Council member would like to comment you could do so as well. I can't make the actual meeting because I'll be at work. And I have to teach that day. So I'll probably provide my comments in writing . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, sorry for jumping the gun on that. I didn't want -- MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I didn't want to miss it tonight . But, yeah, I was also going to say like, you know, I think the administration as well as Council would like DCED to give us a little bit more time. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I talked to the Mayor, Councilman Schuster , last week. And she was, you know, even caught off guard a little bit in terms of not having enough time to -- not having enough notice. So thank you for bringing that up. Anything else, Mr. Schuster ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. SCHUSTER : No. That's all at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : No? Okay. Great. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do, a couple. So after last week's executive session with the Ufberg firm, you know, we found out that the acting HR Director even though we don't believe that she was part of the scope of the, you know, the contract or the bidding process or part of it; but we learned that she was getting $89 an hour. I mean, I don't know any HR Director from 100 miles in any direction making that. So I would like Mrs. Reed if she would do me a favor and reach out to John Murray and ask how many hours a day does she work. How many hours has she works since she's been appointed the acting HR Director . So the gas card audit, very disturbing . I'm sure we all agree. I want to thank Mr. Moretti for, you know, providing us with some more information today and answering our questions . But what's next? I hope the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 administration takes a look at this. And I know after the last audit with regards to Chief DeSarno , you know, it's like well, we're going to move forward . And I know we are. And I know we're going to change some procedures and create policy, which is fantastic . But, you know, you can't justify something right when it's done wrong. So I hope administration takes a better look at this. I'm going to take a better look at it. And it's unfortunate that the taxpayers will probably not know the magnitude of this audit until a year from now so we can do a comparison . And it might be shocking . So I just hope -- you know, I know the new parameters will be put in place. I hope this is looked at by administration a little deeper then, you know, and we get a chance to maybe have some more dialogue on this. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No motions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 comments at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you. Just a few things I wanted to go over here tonight . First of all, we received a question from a member of the public regarding costs associated with the acquisition and rehabilitation of the Serrenti Center. I had asked I don't know maybe two years ago or a year ago for a breakdown of the cost. I don't know where I put it. I went back and looked through my e-mail. I had additional questions about it. And I don't believe they were ever answered . So, Mrs. Reed, if you can at some point this week just request from the administration a breakdown of the cost of the Serrenti Center, the rehabilitation . There was several , you know, project s that went out -- on up there. I think they replaced the roof, so on and so forth.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 So I would like that information because I requested it before and I know a member of the public is also curious as well. Also -- MR. DONAHUE : And sorry, Bill, not to -- Bill, not to interrupt . But I believe I made just a general request for an update on just the status of Serrenti a few weeks ago too. So, Miss Reed, if you'd be able just to follow up on that one too. I don't think I got a response on that. MR. GAUGHAN : The other item -- MR. DONAHUE : Sorry to interrupt . MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. The other item was the status of the contract with Northeast Revenue Services . I did send a note to Solicitor Hayes to touch base with Solicitor Eskra just to update the Council on what the plan is moving forward in terms of, you know, either -- I believe it was to get out of contract with NRS. And I think we're approaching the exit clause in the contract . I would like an update on that. I also received a call this afternoon about the blighted condition of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 900 block of Quincy Avenue. The resident who called me, you know, gave several examples of some of the issues up in the 900 block there. I've been to that block on a number of occasions myself over the last few years. It is severely blighted . And there's several issues. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could please send a note to Mr. Oleski asking him when the department is at full strength again. I realize that we're in the middle of a crisis here. But when they are at full strength and they are able, if they could just keep an eye on that block and maybe do a run through and look out for any violations . We did receive a response which I appreciate from the administration regarding the number of employees who were furloughed due to the Co-void 19 pandemic. And it now stands at 43 employees . And they also did provide a breakdown by department . Based on what Mr. Moretti had said tonight and our previous interest in the attendance reports from the department heads from the last few years, I did request once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 again to receive the attendance reports for the last few years. So I know the administration is working on that request and I appreciate that. In terms of public comment , so there's a few things -- questions that the public had asked that I want to address here for a minute. So there was one question about does overtime affect the pensions ? The overtime does not affect pension payments . Fire and Police pensions are calculated on base pay and longevity . Nonuniform is a set amount depending on years of service . And overtime is not part of either uniform or nonuniform pensions . There was also several questions posed about stormwater management and stormwater management plan. I did reach out to Don King our City Planner . He respond ed just to give us a general update that Herbert Rowland and Grubic who is the company that the City had contracted with a few years ago to complete a report on stormwater management within the City and to help the City with our pollution reduction plan, he reported that they did complete a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 draft of our require d pollution reduction plan. It's actually located on the City of Scranton 's website under the Licensing and Inspection 's Department portion of the webpage. The City actually advertised it for public comment . And they had it scheduled for public comment at Planning Commission Meeting on March 25th. Mr. King provided me with that agenda as well. That meeting never happened , of course, due to the coronavirus pandemic . Mr. King explained that he reached out to DEP for guidance on how to complete the public review in light of the crisis. And he was told by them to touch base again in early May. He was checking with Herbert Rowland and Grubic on the operation s end of the study. And he was going to get back with us on that. So that's a general update on the stormwater management end of things. Also we did receive a question about -- from a resident about the City of Scranton posting the daily positive coronavirus cases on a daily basis on the website. This woman explained that she thought that that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 important information that resident s of Scranton should be aware of. And the Mayor did get back to me quickly because I had forwarded this e-mail to them to see if there is anything that they can do. They are moving I think in that direction to post information on the City's website . I know that the Pennsylvania Department of Health, if you go on their website you could get information on confirmed coronavirus cases by zip code. It's not really precise because some of the zip codes are Dunmore , Dickson City, so on and so forth. But they are working along with Chief Lucas to get those updates posted. There was some other question s that we just received that I will send to the appropriate departments and try to get an answer to. I did -- I want to make an announcement too. The Mayor is holding a virtual fundraiser to help our neighbors fund our food banks in Scranton . This is a fundraising event addressing food and security in partnership with the Scranton Area Community 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Foundation . Donations up to $100,000 will be matched thanks to some very generous philanthropic partners . This will be held Thursday , April 30th at 7 p.m. Donations will be accepted from 12 p.m., Thursday , April 30th to 12 p.m., Friday, May 1st at SAFDN dot ORF slash heart dash of dash Scranton or you could mail a check to Scranton Area Community Foundation at 615 Jefferson Avenue, Suite 102, Scranton , PA 18510. So that's for a good cause. And finally , just to touch on the gas card audit, I want to thank Mr. Moretti for coming in this afternoon to present the gas card audit and take questions from Council . I want to point out a few things here. Number one, if City Council back in the summer of 2019 had never pushed for an audit, many of these issues would never have been brought to light. What the audit ended up exposing is something that was not really a surprise to me. And I don't think it was a surprise to many other people. And, that is, it was a lack of management , a lack of controls and a complete 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 absence of any sort of oversight under the Courtright Administration . To me, when I read through it, it exposed really a downright disregard for the taxpayers of our City. And it is disappointing but again, not surprising based on everything that we now know that went on during the Courtright Administration . The fact that -- one thing that really sticks out to me and that is really concerning is that once Council requested the audit, once Council spoke up on the audit, once the Scranton Times really kind of had broke the whole thing open and had done their investigation as well, gas card usage dropped off substantially . That's concerning , very concerning . What Mr. Moretti had told us tonight was very concerning . And it once again proves to me that this is a cultural issue that we have here in the City where people honestly believe that City Hall exists for perks and extras, taking City vehicles on vacation to the shore, sharing pin numbers , handing out gas cards like they're candy. You know, just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 because everybody does it, doesn't mean it's right. Just because there's not a policy doesn't mean it's right. You know, signing off on gas card usage reports but not looking at them, processing them for payment but not looking at them, if you or I, anyone who is watching tonight , anybody who's here in the meeting , if we ran our house like this we'd be bankrupt . If I got my report from my bank in and I, you know, just ripped it up and didn't look at it, it defies any sort of logic. And we're talking about a City where we have over a hundred million dollar budget. What's very clear to me is moving forward there has to be significant internal controls , a process which I actually have had numerous conversations with the Mayor and her administration . I know that that process is currently ongoing. I know that there is already -- there already have been steps that have been taken to get this thing under control . What I do think that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 administration should do or what I would recommend is now take the time to test all internal controls even outside of the gas card usage. We should work with the City auditors to accomplish this. Because if there was a lack of controls , lack of policies , lack of procedures on the gas card usage, you know, if I was a betting man I would bet that there are other or were other areas that the City was deficient in as well. And as a City that struggles every year with finances , we need to watch every single penny. So I think now that we have a new administration who is actually , you know, paying attention to these things and taking them seriously , I think that we are in a good position to make sure that these types of things don't happen again. I think having several conversations with our City Controller , I think that now they're equipped to, you know, to take this seriously and watch every single penny that comes in. One of the things that I would like to point out is that I believe within our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 budget this year there is money set aside for a potential GPS system, which I really think -- and I've said this since last summer is really the way to go. Not in terms of following employees around or tracking every movement that an employee makes, but in terms of efficien cy. If you look at what the state does and what other agencies do, they track their gas usage. They're efficient . They have the ability to save money. In terms of the salt that we use on our streets during snowstorms , there are different -- there's different technology now where you can track that and save money on salt. It will help with our stormwater management. I know that that's something that I think DEP is looking at is tracking the salt usage and so on and so forth. So I think in speaking with the Mayor and her administration , the GPS part of it is something that they're moving aggressively towards . I know there has to be a cost benefit analysis done. But I do think that that's important . I think Mr. Moretti 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 summarized this whole issue with two words: Dumpster fire. You know, it's not the most eloquent way to say it. But that's what it was. I think now at this point, you know, we're done going back. We can now move forward in terms of the gas card usage to make sure that this doesn't happen again and make sure that there are controls in place. The days of, you know, trusting someone 's word within City government -- you know, trust but you have to verify things. You have to look at them before you sign off on them. That's just basic common sense. And I think as terrible and as disturbing as this was, I think the public should know that we are taking this very seriously . That's why we asked for an audit. As Councilman Donahue said, it wasn't a gotcha thing where, you know, we're going to crucify somebody for doing something when there was obviously no controls . However , moving forward we can't continue to let this happen. We're asking people in the City to pay increasing property 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 taxes, to pay fees, to pay fines. Then we're turning around, they're opening up the front page of the paper and they're seeing people take City vehicles to the shore. It's awful. I mean, if you were to go around and talk to people, they're disgusted with type of thing. So again, as disturbing as it was, I think now we do have a game plan. We have recommendations here from Mr. Moretti . We're going to follow these -- the administration is going to follow these recommendation s. We're going to go I think above and beyond that. And I think we'll be in a better position . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: 5-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Solicitor Hayes, could you just take a second to run through and explain this legislation and what the administration is hoping to accomplish here? ATTY. HAYES: Bill, what the administration is proposing to do is to push back the deadlines for the garbage fee. The garbage fee will remain at $300. But what they're doing is essentially (inaudible ). Prior to June 15th, you will get a 10 percent discount . If you pay June 15 and September 30th, you will pay face value. After September 30th, you will have a -- there will be a penalty . So it's essentially pushing back the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 deadlines for purposes of addressing , you know, the emergency situation ,, the financial hardship that people are facing and that is essentially what they are doing here. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I'd just like to say I know that since I've been on Council we didn't really have time to address the fee. And this is something that's been discussed for quite a while. And there's some confusion. And we thought that it was going to change this year and be lowered and, you know, put into the property taxes. Obviously , that's not what we're doing. But I do hope that with the following year that this could be addressed and that we could talk -- discuss more what we should do regarding the garbage fee because I don't feel that should stay the way that it is. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction , signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR.
