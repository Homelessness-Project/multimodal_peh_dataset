MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Mrs. Reed our City Clerk would like to make an announcement at this time. MS. REED: Thank you, Council man Gaughan , and thank you Council for the opportunity address you this evening . As you are aware, I will be retiring from the City of Scranton from my position as City Clerk on April 30th. It has been an honor to serve the City for the past 18 years and to serve as City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Clerk for almost eight of those years. I have truly enjoyed serving as the City Clerk and my professional dealing s with the current and past Council . I appreciate this current Council 's patience and resilience as we were confronted with the unprecedented challenges due to the COVID pandemic . I am very proud of the fact that we continued to fully operate during this pandemic and to meet the needs of city government despite these challenges . The decision to enter retirement was not an easy one. I have given considerable thought to this decision . However , if we've learned anything over the course of this past year, it is that we shouldn 't take anything for granted . Although serving as City Clerk has been very fulfill ing, it did occupy most of my time and take me away from time that I could be spending with my family and grandchildren . I'm committed to assisting this Council and its transition to a new clerk. We have made tremendous progress in streamlining the legislative process and I will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 do everything I can to maintain these operation s for the betterment of Council and the City. I would like to thank the Mayor, her administration and this Council for their friendship and support . It has been my sincerest honor and pleasure to serve the City and this Council . Thank you, Councilman Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Lori. And I just want to take a second and say a few things. Lori and I have been working together for the last eight years and even before that when we were in OECD. And just so everybody in the public knows, the job of being a City Clerk is much more than just being a clerk or a secretary . It's actually a really, really important job. And I've often said in the past that the clerk is really the sixth Council person. Very few people know what goes in and making this Council and our office operating effectively and officially on a day-to-day basis. The preparation for the meeting s, the behind the scene's work that must 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 be done, the attention to detail, putting out fires every hour of the day, working with city, county, state and federal officials . And Lori has done a phenomenal job the past eight years at making it all work and doing it in such a selfless way on behalf of this Council and the people of the City. I am really happy for Lori that she's retiring and she could spend more time with her beautiful grandchildren and her family. But I have to be honest, I'm going to be lost without her in this position . It's going to be a big adjustment especially for me. We've been working together the past eight years. She's been by my side and been my sidekick through it all. So as I mentioned earlier , I got to know Lori during my time working with each other years ago in OECD. And I was just thinking this this morning , you know, Lori has been, like I said, by my side through when I got married , when I had all of my children , every big event in my life Lori has been there in the picture . So I'm going to miss her a lot in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 this position . She is one of the most respect ed public servant s in city government . And I have seen firsthand the passion that she has for the City which is why she's been so successful as a City Clerk. She has had a unique ability to put people at ease with her steady and very calm demeanor . She's trustworthy. She's kind. And she knows how to get things done. So, Lori, I want to thank you very much for the work you have done, for all the help you have given me. I know that I have been sometimes very frustrating to deal with. I have that type of personality at times. But you've given me so much help and so much guidance over the years. And all the work that you have done for the Council and for the people of the City. I really appreciated working with you on behalf of the citizens of Scranton and you have been a very, very good friend to me. So thank you. And I wish you the best of luck. And you're going to be missed. And I'm not sure yet how we're going to replace you. Thank you. Okay. Anyone else like to say anything ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. Lori, I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 know what to say. First of all, I'm not going to say good-bye. I'm going to say best of luck. I don't know what we're going to do without you. But I wish you all the best in all your endeavors and enjoy your retirement . You deserve it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I'll just add to all of that. I mean, Councilman Gaughan , you really said it perfectly . She's a really integral part of our team here at Council . And I really appreciate d having her over the past, you know, year and a half or so that I've been serving on Council . You could go to her for anything . And she's always happy to find the answers or to contact whoever we need to reach out to and our jobs would be a lot more difficult without her. And I wish her a happy retirement . I know I have a couple more meeting s left with her, but it will definitely be hard to replace her and, you know, wish her the best of luck. MR. SCHUSTER : I also would like to wish Lori the best of luck and a happy retirement . I did know Lori prior to coming onto Council . When I had made my switch to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 come over to Council , I was happy to be working with her. She was a familiar face and someone that I could go to. Since the start of the pandemic , I've been telling her that I can't wait to see her in person. And I guess that might not occur. But best of luck, Lori, and I'll keep in touch. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Do any Council members have any announcement s at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So Nay Aug Park is going to have a Mother's Day drive for St. Joseph's Baby Pantry. This is fantastic . It's going to be Mother's Day weekend May 8th and May 9th, 9 a.m. and 3 p.m., Saturday and Sunday. What they wish is to help us stock their pantry so no child has to do without diapers , formula , wipes, lotions , baby powder, sippy cups, baby food and baby cereals . But please at this time no clothing or furniture will be accepted . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 one. We have very good news to announce tonight , a big congratulations is in order for our colleague Councilman Donahue . His wife Mary Kate had a beautiful baby girl Margaret Mary Donahue clocking in at 6 pounds and 10 ounces. So congratulations to Kyle and best of luck to him and his wife and his newborn . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, congratulations big daddy Donahue. DR. ROTHCHILD : Congratulations , Kyle. I did have a few other announcements -- MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, sure. DR. ROTHCHILD : -- I wanted to do real quick here. First off, for the -- I know I mentioned it previously the Porch Fest that happened a few weeks ago was really successful . And so there are some neighbors in the Hill Section that are putting together live music on Saturday , April 17th. And that will be a, you know, free event but donation s are welcome and that will go to the musicians that will be performing . There will be social distancing , of course. And it's a great way to be able to meet your neighbor s or even if you're not in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 neighborhood , anyone can attend. It's a good way to support the arts as well. And so it's going to be running from 12 to 5 p.m., Saturday , April 17th. And it's going to be at a few different locations along Ash Street, Taylor Avenue, North Irving and Crotti's on Ash at 5 p.m. So I believe Kristen Powers posted the details at least in the Hill Neighborhood Facebook groups. But I have some more details if anyone is interested . And then the other announcement that I wanted to make was that there is going to be a COVID-19 vaccination clinic. It's going to be the Pfizer vaccine . And the Scranton Fringe Festival just announced it today they're going to be hosting it. They're very limited on how many vaccinations and vaccines they have. So you'll want to get registered right away. The first day of it is going to be Thursday , April 22nd. That's going to be held at the Afa Gallery downtown on Lackawanna Avenue. And that's from 10 to 5 p.m. And so like I said, you'll need to register . The information for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that can be found at the Scranton Fringe Festival or I have it posted to my Council Facebook page as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, thank you. Any other announcements ? Okay. Very good, Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Albert Young. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept public comment . MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comment into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The submission is as follows : Members of Scranton Council , This is ironic, councilman Donahue stated that is was discussed within that the possibility of making some improvement to our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 back yards.--- GREAT--- Absolutely nothing has happened YET, Then after talking to a member of the contracted firm late last week it was mentioned that and again I quote " THE CITY DOES NOT WANT TO DIG TWICE' unquote . I guess the city thinks I was born yesterday . IF and WHEN -- DEP -- does decide to come in and finish their LONG overdue process they may skip over the TEMPORARY REPAIR that was done two years ago, and we will still be left with a mess. There has been damage to the driveway along with leaving a messed up yard in disarray , this is OK with the city. They only want the tax money but it is OK if things are left so we live in a PIG STY. It is funny to me that it is ok for the city to spend the tax payers dollars like drunken sailers on other things, but can not complete contracted work. It is known that the city has out spent the jury awarded monies by far, a short list is noted here. Solicitor retainer fees for FOUR (4) attornies Overpriced engineering plans1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Contractors Fee for TEMPORY REPAIR to the storm water culvert on Wyoming Avenue. Plus the BILL for excessive hours used for court appearances to the tune of more than 150,000.00. And still there is hold out for the regrading and paving, and of course to fact The city still holds us hostage --- or is it HOLD HARMLESS (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question ? On the question , if we can send something to the administration to see if there is a way that -- did I freeze for a second there? MR. SCHUSTER : You're good. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. If we can send a letter to the -- sorry, I think I froze again. Am I okay now? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Sorry. What I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 was going to say is, I'd like to send a letter to the administration asking if there is any way possible to at least make the yards there liveable until the project is started and completed . I've been a part of the Young story for -- since I've been on Council and the whole thing is very unfortunate . I think the least if the City if there is any way that they could just at least go out and make it so that they don't have a mess all over the place because we're -- as Solicitor O'Brien said, it could be a little while until they get out and start and finish the project . So if we can do that and see if anything could be done, I'd appreciate it. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , thank you, Mr. Gaughan , for bringing that up. I know we raised it a couple weeks ago. And we did ask the administration to take a look at that piece. I don't have any response back as of yet. But, yeah, I'll agree let's send that over and see what they have to say. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, please, God, let's plant some grass for Mr. Young for this summer. I mean, we have Parks and Recs that plant grass. Just go over and -- I know there's litigation . I don't want to hear about litigation anymore . This man deserves a summer with some grass, please. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd just like to send out condolences to the Sekelsky family. I'm very sorry for your loss. And also say that me and Councilman Donahue had a chance to go out to Oram Street and Main Avenue to take a look at the planned work from PennDOT . We're just waiting on some changes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to that plan. So we'll see that when it comes. That's all -- oh, sorry, one more thing. We did get an e-mail from Mr. Howells on Clearview Street thanking us for identifying that there were some concerns -- some issues with signs. The tractor -trailer is using that street and going down to the dead end. So I'm happy to see hear that something was done about that. There were some signs put up and they're saying that there is tractor -trailers entering the streets down there off of Euclid and Clearview. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I would like to also offer my condolence s of the tragedy to the Sekelsky family that happened here in West Side earlier this week. You know, our hearts and prayers go out to this poor family. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I had just a couple quick things. First off, I wanted to thank Director Cipriani for coming in to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 explain the application for the funding and, you know, I'm really happy to see, you know, that we're receiving . I hope that there will be even more that comes through . I think that will be really helpful for the City. And the other thing that I wanted to -- sorry, I was just looking at my notes. I spoke with the administration yesterday and Mayor Cognetti about some issues along Harrison Avenue, particularly the safety issues with pedestrian crossings and the speed of traffic . So we're inquiring about possible traffic study to see what we could do about that. And that's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. I just have a couple comments . As I mentioned in caucus, Director Preambo of the DPW had updated us on the replacement of signs throughout the City. So if anyone is interested , he attached an Excel spreadsheet showing the signs that have been replaced this year to March -- I think the middle or the end of March. So if anyone is interested in that, I could forward 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 that along or if anyone in the public is interested they are keeping track of that now which is a good thing. He provided a summary of the three type of signs that should be at the top of the replacement list by priority . So those were stop signs throughout the City. There is 700 approximately that still need to be replaced because they are faded or damaged . Speed limit signs, there's is 278 that still have to be replaced. And then the biggest item there would be street name signs. And that's 1,525 that still need to be replaced. So they're working on attacking those issues and replacing those signs. So I want to thank them for doing that. The second thing I had was, I had asked for -- a resident had asked me what the plan was for demolition in 2021. Director Cipriani respond ed that there is going to be two phases of demolition in 2021 and possibly a third if the City is award a DCED grant that they applied for. Phase one is currently out for bid. Phase two, the list is being compiled . The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 list is always subject to change if a property is sold or something ends up happening . There is a list of properties 15 -- actually 14 total and then the 15th would be the Nay Aug pools and the Weston Park bathhouse. That list is here if anybody would like to see it. I'll run through it really quick, 710-712 North Bromley ; 525 North Bromley ; 209-211 St. Francis Cabrini ; 313-315 St. Francis Cabrini ; 813 Hampton Street; 336 South Hyde Park Avenue, 607 North Hyde Park Ave.; 1129 Swetland Street; 1210 Swetland Street; 620-622 Pine; 1635 Sanderson , 505 12th Avenue; 616 Cedar Avenue; 1025 Bergen Court. So those are for 14 that's at least for phase one. So I'm sure people in those neighborhood s will be happy. These properties are definitely an eyesore . And that's all I have this week. Thank you.
