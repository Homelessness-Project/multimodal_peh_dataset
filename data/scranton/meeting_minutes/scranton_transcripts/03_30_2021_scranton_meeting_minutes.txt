MR. GAUGHAN : Would everyone please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community . Let us also take a moment of silence for all of the people in our community , in our country and throughout our world who have passed away from the COVID-19 pandemic . This pandemic has turned our world upside down. But we must remain hopeful and strong. We continue to pray for the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process , may they have protection and peace. Whether we are home or abroad, surrounded by many people suffering from this illness or only a few, let us stick together , endure together , mourn together and in place of our anxiety let us have hope and peace. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS CARRERA : Mr. Schuster .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Here. An executive session was held prior to our meeting tonight to discuss potential litigation and personnel issues. MR. DONAHUE : I'd like to make a motion to take from the table Resolution No. 134 of 2021. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table Resolution No. 134, 2021 and place it in Seventh Order for a final vote. This resolution pertain s to the appointment of police superintendent . On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MS. REED: THIRD ORDER. 3-A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM KREDER, BROOKS, HAILSTONE , LLP DATED MARCH 25, 2021 REGARDING GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER. MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comment s on the Third Order item? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd like to make one comment on it. Taking a look back to 2014, I'm not sure -- I see one of the quotes there is that GCMC must have room to grow. And I know there's a lot of property there that have been purchased by the hospital . Are these properties taxable once they take them? I know that hospitals pay taxes in some ways but certain types of buildings fall under different categories . And I feel like back in 2014 when they first acquired the Audubon School, this wasn't the same thing that they were saying at that point 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 in time. So I feel possibly their position has changed unless my memory isn't correct . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm sorry, I just want to make a comment as well. I believe Councilman Schuster is correct because that's the way that I remember things too that, you know, this wasn't their plan initially . I mean, I'm glad to have this update on, you know, what they're looking to do with the properties . But I'll definitely be looking for more information on this and what their plans are as it can affect the neighborhood , the Hill Section . That seems like a large space to me. And I want to make sure that the neighbor s aren't negatively impacted or affected . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So now that the Scranton School District , their instruction al delivery model is switching to hybrid, okay? The food distribution that's normally taking place is going to change now. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 So for the Scranton School District , the food distribution will be on Wednesday s at 10:00 and 1:00 at West Scranton High School and at the elementary schools at the same time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I have one, City Hall is going to be closed this Friday, April 2nd in observance of Good Friday. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Dave Dobrzyn and Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Mr. Dave Dobrzyn as follows : THIS AFTERNOON I PAID MY PROPERTY 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 TAXES AT THE SINGLE TAX OFFICE AND STOPPED TO PAY TO PARKING . THE KIOSK WAS OBSCURED BY THE SUN AND ONE NUMBER WAS INCORRECT . WHEN I RETURNED I FOUND A TICKET FOR THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS ON MY CAR, I IMMEDIATELY CALLED FROM MY CELL AND WAS NOT ANSWERED BUSY OF COURSE. I WENT OVER TO THE AUTHORITY AND WAS TURNED AWAY TOLD TO REPLY ONLINE AGAIN NO ANSWER ON THE PHONE. THIS IS NO MORE THAN AN EXTORTION RACKET SET UP BY SHYSTERS AND VOTED IN BY INCOMPETENT COUNCIL MEMBERS WITH THEIR ILL ADVISED AGENDA. THE AUTHORITY COULD HAVE CORRECTED IT THERE BUT BY THEIR RULES EVASIVE AT BEST I MUST TOLERATE MORE OF THEIR OBFUSCATIONS AND COULD INCURR FURTHES EXPENSE THIS MAKES ME VERY ANGRY I HATE BEING HAD. FURTHERMORE WITH THESE DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS BEING CONVERTED TO RESIDENTIAL THE TOWN IS ALL PARKED UP AFTER 5 PM. MAKING PICKING UP ORDERED FOOD A CONUNDRUM I THINK ITS HIGH TIME THAT IF THIS IS TO CONTINUE IT WILL PROBABLY AFFECT THEIR ACCESS TO BUISINESS AND DEVELOPERS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO ADD PARKING GARAGE FEES AND TENANTS REQUIRED TO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 PARK THERE.BUONA PIZZA HAS BEEN TREATED CRUELLY IN THE PAST DESPITE A 50 TH ANIVERSARY SIGN IN THEIR DISPLAY DURING THE 500 BLOCK RENOVATION . I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT MOST ARE STILL EMPTY.EMINENTT DOMAIN ABUSE IS MY OPINION AND THEY PROBABLY PAY THEIR TAXES NOT LIKE MOST SO CALLED DEVELOPERS . TAX FREE COUNT THEM IN. IN MY LAST COMMUNICATION I ASKED FOR AN E-Mail ON TRASH FEES ORDINANCE I AM NOT CONCERNED WITH TIMELY PAYMENT I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN NOT HAVING THE FEE ATTATCHED TO LTS WITH NO DWELLING BEING ATTATCHED ADDING A $300 FEE ATATCHED TO MY UNOCUPIED PROPERTY .THE MORTAGE HOLDER REFUSED TO OFFER CONSOLIDATION AND I WOULD BE STUCK WITH ADDITIONAL TAX ON A NON DEVELOPABLE PROPERTY TRASH FEE. MS. REED: The second submission by Marie Schumacher as follows : I again request the same monthly report of how many LERTAs have been requested and approved The 5B Emergeny Certificate states 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 the necessity is required to ensure compliance with the Grant deadline of March 30. My question to you is when was this Grant awarded as it seems an certificate should not have been necessary . As to 6B I believe this is Governmnt over reached and should not even be on the Agenda, let alone an Ordinance . Parents have rights you know, The photo of the Municipal Building entrance stained glass windows removal brings back the question , long overdue I may add, of when will it be decided what will be done with this Building . When will this decision be forthcoming . (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? On the question , I want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 thank Mr. Dobrzyn and Miss Schumacher for their comments and questions . Miss Schumacher posed a few questions regarding the monthly report of how many LERTAs have been requested and approved which we will ask for. But I know as of February of this year, it's been a total of six that have been requested and approved . As for the emergency certificate agenda Item 5-B, the multimodal -- or GCMC project , I asked why that had come down with an emergency certificate . As everyone knows it's -- I don't like emergency certificates unless it's truly an emergency because , you know, I know that we all like to take our time and review things. The solicitor -- one of the solicitors for the City, Jessica Eskra replied that they received the propose d plans from GCMC late last month. After that time, the City Planner , the City Engineer and DPW all had to review and sign off on the plans before proceeding . So she requested that legislation be expedited . But they were up against the March 30th deadline . The grant that GCMC received 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 was in the amount of $300,000. We did not get an answer yet as to when exactly that grant was rewarded. As for City Hall and what's going to be done with the building when will that decision be forthcoming , I don't have the answer to that question . There's a lot of variables that go into that. One of the issues that we talked about Miss Schumacher months and months ago well into last year was the fact that it was going to be hard for the City to come with up additional funding for all of the items that were identified in the report, you know, detailing the issues with City Hall because it is a very old building and needs some upgrades . That conversation now obviously has changed with the funding that we are going to receive from the federal government , the American Rescue Plan. So we have to see if we could use some of -- potentially use some of that funding for infrastructure and, you know, I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that we may want to invest some of those dollars as a match to a grant in some other ways to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 improve the building so that it lasts another 150 years. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Okay. We have -- MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS -- oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. Pardon me, Councilman . MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay, Lori. We have a few guests tonight . So we do have MKSD. They were here about a month ago. They were the firm that was doing the analysis on the Nay Aug Pool. We learned a month ago that obviously there were some issues at Nay Aug Pool. So they were looking over the last 30 days at different options , which they're going to present tonight on how the City should move forward . So we have represent atives from MKSD. I know we have Director Cipriani from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 the Office of Economic and Community Development . We have Tom McLane who is doing our park study for the City. And we also have Bob Gattens who is the Chairman of the Recreation Authority and Paul Kelly who is the Solicitor for the Recreation Authority . So I'll turn it over to all of you. And if you want to share your screen and we'll go through this presentation . Thank you. MR. CHAMBERS : Thank you, Councilman . We appreciate having the opportunity to present the study to you tonight . In order to be efficient with everyone 's time, we're going to turn it over directly to George Deines from Counsilman -Hunsaker . MR. DEINES: Good evening everyone . It's a pleasure to be with you tonight as we progress through our study on Nay Aug Park swim pool. As we, you know, mentioned a few weeks back, we did our initial assessment on the existing pool and found that, you know, due to its physical condition we would recommend a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 complete replacement . We did put together a budget, you know, for renovation , you know, just to get you through I know a few seasons to open up safely. But what we're looking and focusing on tonight is, you know, what are some different options for the replacement of the pool. And so, you know, we're right here in the middle of our study. We pretty much finished the needs assessment . And now we're looking at the facility program and space requirements , you know, what is the right sized pool for this park, what type of amenities and the correspond ing costs that come with that. Since the time that we last met, we have launched a community survey via the City, sent it out through multiple channels . We had, you know, a little over 200 responses to date. And we captured some information just to see who was responding to the survey. We found about 70 percent lived in one of these two zip codes surrounding Nay Aug Park either the 18510 or 18505. We also found out about 60 percent of the respondents had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 children under the age of 18. And so that, you know, tells us that we had a high level of response s from people who actually used the pool. Summer recreational facilities like this are typically for, you know, families with young children . You know, we had about 60 percent of the responders say that they had visited Nay Aug Park pool within the past couple of summers . Most of them had done that for recreational purposes . We also found that, you know, people -- the survey respondents as you see here, this top graph wanted, you know, shallow water, deep water, locker rooms, community aquatic programs , changing tables ranked five which is this orange line that most (audio interruption ) competitive pools actually ranked fairly low. You know, Nay Aug Park pool has not been used, you know, for competitions in some time. So that did not necessarily surprise us. And so we also had an open-ended comment box. And I pulled just a snapshot of some of the comments that we received , you know, I live 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 within walking distance of the park. My kids used to spend all summer there at the pool with their friends . We truly miss it. It needs to be affordable and accessible for the average middle class family. Keep it simple. Please save our pool. So we did have a lot of strong support for, you know, a facility staying within the park. And then the other thing that we're doing right now which is looking forward to our next phase which is the operations plan as we move through the study as we're looking at not only the demographics , you know, age distribution , market area income, population within the City. But then we're also looking at, you know, what other pools does the City of Scranton have but then what other surrounding communities have and how will those affect, you know, the visitation rates for renovated or replaced Nay Aug Park pool. And so you could see that there is some density of facilities here. But some of these are indoor facilities that don't necessarily compete , you know, with an outdoor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 seasonal facility . And so as we started to look at the options , we had been working with the City's project team and, you know, using the survey results and using our experience and MKSD's experience throughout the State of Pennsylvania to come up with a couple of different options for consideration . And so the first one I wanted to provide is mainly just a baseline , you know, what if we just replaced the slide pool. You know, we had that number last time about 1.6 million dollars that would be for the renovation of the pool. What if we actually replaced the pool, demolished it and replaced it, reuse the existing water slide tower, reuse the existing support building , build a new mechanical building . We could see that in the 5.7 million dollar range. So that just gives you a baseline of, you know, to keep the existing size poor. But again, no real functionality change with that. You know, the City and Rec Authority have long talked about incorporating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 a spray pad where the existing deep pool is. And so we wanted to look at that as an option as well as a standalone option. So this would include not only, you know, a nice sized spray pad like you see here within a renovation of the bath house, you know, addition of shade, a new pool mechanical building . And we see that budget in that 4.9 million dollar range. If we just wanted to do the spray pad and keep the existing building , you know, we probably want to budget about 2 and a half to 2.8 million dollars for that spray pad. But a lot of the cost with the spray pad, it's not just the size of the pad itself but these vertical element s and this, you know, little multilevel, I don't know, play structure that you see. And so spray pad cost can vary wildly just based upon, you know, what size footprint you use but then also the different types of vertical element s that you would incorporate . And so then we also looked at what if we replaced it with a more modern family aquatic center. And so we did a couple different 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 things here. The first is that we had a roughly 6800 square foot main leisure pool where we could hopefully tie in the existing water slides into a sectioned off catch area. We have zero depth entry. We have a small current channel slash lazy river. We have a 3,000 square foot spray pad. And then we also have a -- well, deep water was one of the things that ranked highly on the survey. And so this has a small slide. It's got a climbing wall as well as a diving board. And so when we add this together , this is about the size -- a little bit larger than the existing slide pool. So, you know, it's in that 12,000 square foot range. We're showing -- actually right around 12,000 square feet so just about the same size. But, you know, we see that there's different zones. So it's a little more multigeneration al. It's got easy access with the zero depth entry. It's got the spray element for the younger kids. But then it also has some amenities for, you know, that 10 to 15 age range with the deep water pool. And then when we cost this out we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 look at not only the construction cost for the building for the shade for the deck but then obviously the pool components and all of the amenities . We also add in some development factors for, you know, a year of escalation project fees from design team surveys permitting. And then we also carry a contingency allowance . And so when we start to add all of those together , that comes out to about 8.8 million dollars for a facility of this size. MR. GAUGHAN : George, this is Bill Gaughan . Quick question on that, within that -- I might be getting ahead of myself. But within that number does that -- are you also accounting for if the City were to go with like, for example , this option, does that account for ongoing maintenance costs? Like, how much -- let's say that, you know, this was built; how much would this cost to maintain and run every year? MR. DEINES: So that is actually the next step in our process is to develop those annual budgets , you know, the personnel for lifeguards , for chemical usage, utility cost 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 for pumps and motors as well as annual maintenance as well as long-term deferred maintenance as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : George, when it comes to operations , what is more efficient or cheaper to run, a regular pool or the splash pad area? MR. DEINES: Typically it's going to be the splash pad area is going to be much more efficient . Number one is that this is a wet deck. And so it doesn't necessarily have to be life guarded if it's just out in a park and it's free and available . We typically see that those are not life guarded . But if it's contained inside a facility , we usually see that, you know, you would at least have one lifeguard that, you know, is walking around the perimeter of the spray pad just to make sure that the kids don't run or they're there in case something happens. But, you know, you take this body of water and it could be, you know, 200,000 plus gallons , whereas the spray pad might only be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 16 to 30,000 gallons . And so it would be more -- it's more cost effective to run the spray pad than the pool. MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick question . I got this presentation late via e-mail so I didn't get a chance to look at it a lot. I'm glad you're going through it. So when you look at option one, 8.8 million dollars , you said you're going to propose or actually provide an annual budgetary expense be it, you know, be it staffing and everything else. So -- and I know the survey was a great idea. But did anybody survey the parents and say how much are you willing (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I think Mark froze. MR. MCANDREW : -- what the costs are? MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, you froze there for a minute. So we lost you. MR. MCANDREW : All right. I don't know where you lost me. But I just don't understand how this would be affordable to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 average child in the City. This isn't like a water park we're looking for. We're looking for a pool. I know every year kids can't even afford to come without vouchers that are given out. So how is this sustained financially ? That's a concern of mine. And how is it affordable to the average child in the City? MR. DEINES: And, yeah, so with our next step we'll come up with some proposed rates. What I will say is that we always account for a certain level of free admissions . And that's typically , you know, based on maybe its levels of income or if Parks and Rec or the, you know, the Rec Authority has the ability to do that, then we always recommend having, you know, the reduced admission for those who can't afford or the vouchers . Like you mentioned , we also have seen partnering with local businesses to do sponsorships for swimming lessons and for, you know, at risk children because we know, you know, according to drowning statistics that, you know, if a family -- I think it's USA swimming , states that 79 percent of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 children that are under -- that live in homes through the age of 18 that the family makes less than the, you know, median household income of 53,000 that they are less likely to ever learn how to swim. And so we want to be sure that we do make it affordable to those kids. And then also, a lot of it comes down to the philosophical vision of the City about, you know, what is the right subsidy level. And so, you know, in terms of percent age or in terms of annual dollars . And so we can -- we could look at that and, you know, we can shrink these options down to make them more cost effective long-term. We'll just look at other ways to help, you know, make the facilities sustainable for the city. MR. GATTENS : If I could just jump in for a second, one of the things the Rec Authority is looking at is somewhat with what the school district with sponsor ships for the score board and stuff like that. But we're negotiating with one or two right now to see if they'll sponsor the splash pad to offset the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 cost. And hopefully , you know, with the grace of God we could make it to where it's free at least to City residents . Outside of the City or people come to visit from out of state or anything would probably have to pay a small fee. But it would be no more than the $5 they're already -- to get into the pool complex . MR. MCANDREW : That's a good idea, Bob. Thank you. MR. DEINES: And then some, you know, representative images just to give you an idea of what some of these spaces could look like, you know, we have a zero depth entry and open water area. We have a small current channel like over in Chambers burg. You know, there's a different -- a couple different types of deep water amenities from the diving boards, the climbing wall and a couple different types of water slides. And then the spray pad, you know, as you can see has different types of vertical elements and tipping buckets and (inaudible .) Those are some representative images to, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 know, show you what those spaces look like in other facilities that we've designed . The second thing that we looked at in terms of, you know, a completely (audio interruption ) would be to increase the size of the splash pad and then decrease the size of the pool so making sure that we allow for the reuse of those existing water slides into a catch area and still maintain some, you know, open water area, a zero depth entry. This is a lilly pad floatable walk. And then we have that larger -- larger spray pad. And so the tradeoff was a little bit larger spray pad but then less water surface area for the pool. And when we costed this out, it came to about 7.6 million dollars . And then the third option in talking with the project team over the past couple of weeks was to have that large signature spray pad and, you know, do our best to reuse those existing slides and just provide a catch pool for the existing water slides. And so this you have, you know, two amenities at the pool you have existing water slides into a catch pool and then you would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 have the new spray pad. So this one is obviously the least amount of surface area for water. So it would have the least amount of cost and that came in about 5.5 million dollars . MR. HEWES: George, if I can interrupt for a second, George? This is Nick from MKSD. Just I also want to point out that all of these budget numbers and images that you are seeing, they also include an enlarge d bathhouse, a pump house. And also, we're showing a pavilion , you know, for some shade possibly so that could be rented out as a -- or potential for income for the facility if that's something that the, you know, City would desire. But these budget numbers do include those support facilities as well not just the spray pad and the pools. MR. GAUGHAN : And we're just looking at where the slide is. We're not talking about the other pool that's going to be filled in, correct ? MR. DEINES: That is correct . We've placed all these concepts , you know, obviously 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 on the existing site, you know, primarily for size and scale. We were using that existing water slide tower. It's really the one thing that had to stay. So we had to design the pools around that. You know, we could obviously come out this way a little bit more. We could push this way some too. But, yeah, overall it's using about half of the existing insides of the pool complex , you know. By the time you would measure this out it's going to be, you know, about one and a half times the size of the existing slide pool, maybe two times. So to give you a -- you know, a feel for the size and scale of the concepts that we're showing . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : George, this was a question I asked last week. The more objects , if you will, that are on the splash pad and around the pool, the more maintenance there is there with those items, you know what I mean, the more things there are to break as opposed to just having a pool. Who would -- who plans on maintaining all of this? Is that going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 on the City? Is that going to be the Rec Authority ? Are we using certain companies to replace these items when broken? And then when we're looking at that cost of yearly operations , is there a percentage added in there for, you know, broken pieces and replacement parts? MR. DEINES: Correct . Yeah, so when we do develop our budgets here over the next, you know, week and a half, we'll have those allocations for the number of -- you know, based on the number of amenities and the size of the overall facility . And at this point, yeah, I think I'll defer maybe to Eileen about, you know, if it's the City or the Rec Authority who would, you know, be the actual order and maintain er of the facility . MR. GAUGHAN : Can I just say one thing real quick? I just know from going to different splash pads and things that they're relatively maintenance free in terms of, you know, you take your kids there and they get wet. I mean, there's -- I've never seen, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 you know, I guess you could damage them if there's things that are sticking up. But relatively speaking they're pretty much maintenance free in terms of, you know, there's just water that comes out of the holes and things like that. So it's not -- am I correct ? MR. DEINES: That is correct , yeah. There's a lot of maintenance that goes on obviously behind the scenes. But for the most part, you know, those spray pad elements are very durable and have a really good lifespan, you know, because they're built and constructed to face the elements and face the kids, right, that are running and having a good time on the spray pad elements . MS. CIPRIANI : And, George, just a quick question in regards to chemicals for the spray pad, are there chemicals used to keep the water clean in the spray pad and obviously if there were (audio interruption ) less. MR. DEINES: Right (audio interruption ) on spray pads, you could do a passthrough system which is essentially , you know, like a water hose. It goes up and it comes down and it goes away. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 But the way that we design them, they're all on their own, you know, recirculation systems with ultraviolet light technology that kills any type of recreation al water illness es. And so it's essentially a miniature pool. The pool is just underground and then, you know, the feature (inaudible ) pool of water from underground and then spray it up and then there's a gutter in the middle and along the edges that would collect water and send it back to be treated and then spray it up. DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a quick question . I was wondering what age groups usually would utilize a splash pad and in the survey of -- that the residents did, did it ask what age the children of the household were? MR. DEINES: We did ask that on the survey. Let me get back to the bullet points there. So close to 60 percent of the respond ents had children under the age of 18 living in their household. And we typically find that a spray pad will cater anywhere from ages 1 up to, you know, 10, 11 or 12. And a lot of time if it's a larger 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 spray pad like that, we might even try to zone it so you have more little kid amenities and then some larger kid amenities just to keep them, you know, a little bit separated so the 11 years olds aren't getting too excited around the 3 year olds. But we would see having that 1 to 10 to 12 year old, you know, that age range of children . MR. MCLANE: If I could ask a quick question , the above ground amenities, the towers, the palm trees, you know, all of those crazy good looking stuff that you have there, do they get taken out in the winter time or do they get covered ? We have some pretty harsh condition s here in some winters . I'm just wondering , that would be a level of maintenance that the City would have to take if they needed to be taken down and stored inside or something . MR. DEINES: I think that it varies on region. You know, we have some folks that will take those down just to avoid, you know, the UV rays over the course of that, you know, September 30th to April 1st timeline . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 then, you know, so they're not affected by the weather . Others leave them in. So it's typically the discretion of the operator whether they do that. I would say with the size of the spray pad, you know, that we're showing that, you know, I think it would be a tall task to remove all of those elements . So you probably would leave them up and then, you know, just winterize the system, blow all the lines out so you don't have any water freeze and crack the pipes here in the wintertime . MR. MCLANE: And last question , I think at some point someone is going to ask what the life expectancy of this is of the improvements . MR. DEINES: Sure. And so we would see the lifespan of the new outdoor aquatic facility , you know, being in that 25 to 30 year range. And so we design our facilities , you know, with that expectation in mind. MR. SCHUSTER : And thanks, Mr. McLane, because I was going to ask that next. With taking these items in and out, does that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 increase the lifespan of these objects and these items? MR. DEINES: You know, that could actually go one way or the other. You know, the more times you pull something out and put it back, you know, we can see that it could, you know, possibly damage the threads or, you know, however they're put back together . So we probably defer to the manufacturer 's recommendation s and, you know, look for some other comparable facilities , you know, within the area to see what their best practice s are. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that's kind of what I was including in that damage of these things, you know, regular average wear and tear and motors on things and then, you know what I mean, possibly taking them in and taking them out. And back to the maintenance question , so you deferred over to Miss Cipriani . So who would be in charge of maintenance of the equipment ? MS. CIPRIANI : Well, I'm assuming typically , Bob, correct me if I'm wrong, that the City has been performing maintenance up at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Nay Aug Park historically . MR. GATTENS : Yes, for the most part, yeah. In the last couple years before the pool was closed, we worked hand in hand with the costs and stuff. I mean, naturally it was an exorbitant -- I mean, the City did it. But I could see this being more of a partnership this time going through . And going back -- let's take a back step. I reached out to the different water pads across the country . In the Northeast and we'll say the upper midwest and everything , a lot of these places have tarps specially made to cover the equipment so it is covered in the winter months. And it proves effective to stop the fading and everything . So, I mean, it's something we -- if this is the route we're going and everything , I think we should look at doing. It wasn't an exorbitant cost to have these things made, but they felt it did extend the colorization of the items for a longer period. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, thank you. That would make sense. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. GAUGHAN : Is there more to the presentation , George? MR. DEINES: The only other thing I had here -- let me see at the end -- was a quick, you know, summary chart that showed the range of cost for the various options that we looked at so far, you know, five of the six would include new construction . Two of them would include zero depth inch pool. Five of the six would have the -- either the existing water slide tower or a new water slide tower. And then I have the capacity here listed at the bottom. You know, that's one of the big question s that we get is how many people could we expect which is our next step is to project that out. But then how many people can the facility actually hold, and so, you know, with the existing pool, just that slide pool would have a capacity of, you know, close to 500. And, you know, option 1 and 2A that have the pool and the spray pad combined would have capacity of a little over 400, while just the spray pad and then the smaller pool would be in that, you know, essentially 250 people so just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 to give you an idea of the capacity levels at one time. You know, and this is based on the water surface area. And it's meant to be a holding capacity , not a sardine capacity , right? We want to make sure that we, you know, it meets all of the codes and regulations . But we typically like to be a little bit more conservative . And we could push -- you know, put in one person for every 15 square feet of water. But we typically like to plan on one for every 25 square feet of water. That way, you know, it's more of a operational capacity , not a technical capacity . MR. GAUGHAN : I have just a comment and then a few questions . You know, first of all, thanks for the presentation . I thought it was great. To me this isn't -- this is not just a pool, Nay Aug Pool. This is a landmark in our city. This is the -- one of the biggest if not the biggest asset that we have in the City of Scranton . As I mentioned to you last month, I'm up here with my children all the time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 walking around the park. And it is used. It's got to be one of the most used parks in our city. And I don't think that we should cut corners here. I think this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to make our mark and make this not just a pool but a destination for the people of our City. And quite frankly , I think our children deserve it. I used to work at Shooky's that was next to the pool when I was in high school and college . And there was hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of kids up there every day and parents and families . And, you know, they would eat. They would go on the rides. They would go in the pool. And it was nice to see. And we've seen that since then over the last few years. So Nay Aug Park to me is someplace that you might look at that price and it is a sticker shock 8.8 million. It's a lot of money. But -- or whatever amount -- option the City ends up going with. But I don't think we should choose an option just because let's put a pool in there and fill it with water. To 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 me, this is let's look at the big picture because I know that we're trying to attract people to our City. And any family -- any young family -- I have four little children . If you're looking to go someplace or you're looking to relocate , you're looking at the parks. You're looking at what kind pools do they have, what kind of amenities do they have among other things. But that's to me is very, very important . So I really don't think we can shortchange ourselves. Again, I know it's a sticker shock with the 8.8 million and it is a lot of money. But this to me needs a complete overhaul . As we mentioned 30 years ago, Mayor Walsh had a vision and, you know, put a lot of work and there was a lot of thought put into it. And that was the premier destination which it remained for a long period of time. I just think this is an opportunity for the City to make an investment . And I really think we should. And we should think long and hard, you know, at all of these options . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 But I would tend to go with, you know, making a splash, no pun intended . So that's my feeling on it. So I just have three questions . And this will probably go for Eileen or anyone else that is here from the administration . Have you formulated a plan yet on how the City will fund these improvements ? We all know that something has to happen up here to make the facility operational . So is there a plan in place yet or a plan being formulated to fund these improvements ? MS. CIPRIANI : Councilman , we are talking about that and working on that. So there's really three parts to this. One would be the demolition cost. And we're waiting to hear back from the prospective bidders. We have a bid out for demolition . So we'll know those numbers shortly . And George has included design in his costs already . So there is really three components . There's demolition , design and then construction . So now that we have this information , we could sit down -- and especially with your input, the citizens ' input 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 and try and formulate a plan about what we could do. Looking at this, this does give us a lot of opportunities , right, because , you know, these prices 8.8 million is big. But we could reduce the size of pools, change out amenities however we best see fit. So we want to take this, digest it and go back to the administration and talk about it. MR. GAUGHAN : Great. And in terms -- I don't know if you will be able to answer this. But in terms of a timeline , do you think that the pool or do you think there's an opportunity that we'll have a pool at Nay Aug Park next year all things considered ? MS. CIPRIANI : Well, that's another part we have to discuss because we also, you know, with the design part, design has to be accomplished before construction . It would be a matter of how we were able to line up our funding to do this going forward . It would be a tight timeline though. I do have to say that. I mean, maybe George or Nick or Todd could weigh in on generally on a timeline of projects such as this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. CHAMBERS : Yeah, I will say that having a pool open for summer of '22 looks unlikely or a new pool I'll say. You know, we have design time. Permitting will come into play. There's a significant environmental permit that will probably be required depending on the amount of disturbance of land in the park. And then, of course, construction , you know, is probably the better part of the year. The fastest you could get it done is probably nine months for just the construction period. So probably more realistically the inaugural season for a new pool at Nay Aug complex would be 2023. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. My last comment on this as Eileen said, to me this is a huge opportunity . I mean, for -- I think really and I know we'll go for federal funding , for state funding . Everyone in this area knows how important Nay Aug Park is to the City of Scranton . So if we're going to invest dollars, you know, we should really go hard at federal government and the state government for grant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 funding which I know we will. And I personally am more than happy to help in any way and be involved in these conversations because like I said, I don't think we should shortchange ourselves here. I think that we really should try to make the biggest difference because ultimately our children in the Hill Section , Minooka , South Side, North Scranton , all over the city, they deserve it. They deserve a premier place to go and enjoy themselves . And I look at this in the context too of the pandemic . You know, our children and our families have gone through the worst year in recent memory. So to me, this would be something really, really nice to do for the people in our City. And again, it's an investment in the park which I think we have to make. So that's all I have. Anyone else have any question s or comment s? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one thing after the discussion about the pool when that's over, can Mrs. Cipriani stick around for -- I just had a question on some grants.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. Anyone else on the Nay Aug Pool? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just had a couple quick comments . I, you know, I have to agree. I mean, this is in my neighborhood . And I just had a baby. So she's too young I think to take to the pool just yet. You know, I look forward to eventually taking her there. And I have really fond memories of when I was a child I didn't grow up in Scranton . But where I did grow up I, you know, we had a great pool. There were several pools. There was a diving pool. There was a pool where you could do laps. There was a, you know, a shallow area for very young children . And, you know, I learned to swim there. And I would certainly want the same thing for our kids in Scranton . And, you know, I just think if we're going to spend almost 6 million dollars anyway, you know, I think it really should be accessible to a lot more than just children , you know, say younger than 10 to 12 years old because , you know, I think it could be utilize d like with the aquatic classes throughout the years, you know, people in their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 60s, 70s I'm sure would enjoy using the pool too. So I really hope that we would make this, you know, as good as we can. But I realize that is a lot of money. So, yeah, I'd agree with Mr. Gaughan 's comments on that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : You know, I want to piggyback on one thing that you said. And I think Bob Gattens will agree with me as the Chairman of the Recreation Authority . The one thing I can't stand -- and I'm sure there will be some people who say, you know, you're going to put these new things up here and someone is going to ruin them or destroy them or whatever . I hate when people look at it that way. Like, you know, we should be able to have nice things in the City. We have a park across the street from my house that the City invested a ton of money in through CDBG grant funds. I don't see any wear and tear on that park. There's no -- no one has vandalized it because all the neighbors have bought in over here. So we are able to have nice things. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 And again, that's one thing that you do hear when anybody in the City wants to do something nice for a park. I've seen that over my tenure on Council , why you would do that, someone 's going to ruin it. Well, let's -- we're putting the cart before the horse. And I think that Bob will agree with me that there's been so many great things done up at Nay Aug Park. So let's again, not shortchange ourselves here. Let's go big with this I think. MR. GATTENS : I wholeheartedly agree because I'll just give you an example of this past year, January 1st to December 31st, we had zero vandalism in Nay Aug Park, no graffiti , no breakage , natural wear and tear but not vandalism . And part of that is because there's 10-fold people using that park now. Part of it because of the pandemic , but part of it because it's become a little bit of a destination for walkers or joggers because it's clean and it's safe. And that is due largely to the neighbors and the people utilizing the park, not as much as the board or the city workers . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 So it goes back to what you say, I think if we put something that's upscale and everything and the people use it will appreciate it, it will be taken care of up there. So I do agree with what you're saying there. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? Okay. All right. Thank you very much. We appreciate the presentation . And, Eileen and members of the administration , we look forward to working with you on this and, you know, being really aggressive to get this done and it's an exciting time for the City. MR. GATTENS : Thank you. MR. HEWES: Thank you everyone . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And I know, Councilman Schuster , you had -- Eileen, do you mind answering a question about grants? MS. CIPRIANI : Sure, if I can. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I know we were -- the City was looking to the county. We were applying for a lot of grants and the county was in charge of dispersing that money. But one thing I was trying to find out and I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 because of the timeline involved with it, I felt I needed to hold you up for a minute to talk about it is PEMA funds. I know that PEMA and FEMA have given the COVID disaster a disaster relief number DR-4506. Have we applied for any of those funds or do we plan on applying for any of those PEMA or FEMA funds? MS. CIPRIANI : Yes, actually Chief Lucas had been working on that. The problem came in is what PEMA is willing to fund and reimburse for is exact same items that the county was reimbursing for. And obviously we can't take money from two different tracks. So I could check back with the Chief to see what we did -- were able to get from them. But I don't think we were overly successful just because of those factors . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Yeah, I know with the -- I think with the PEMA, the only thing was I think the municipality had to spend more than $3,300, which I know we've definitely done that. Would it have been -- MS. CIPRIANI : Everyone wanted to fund for PP or protective equipment . So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 everyone wanted to reimburse for that. And you could only reimburse from one source. MR. SCHUSTER : So would that have been something we could have applied to both sources and whoever covered it we could have maybe reallocated some of the monies or -- MS. CIPRIANI : Right, so what we did was, any of the receipt s that we did not get covered from the county, I gave those to Chief Lucas and he turned them into PEMA. So I'll check with the Chief to see if there was success . But as I said, the county basically covered many of the items that would have been acceptable under PEMA's funding too. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And I know recently we got word that Mr. Lucas would no longer be our -- I don't know what the term is, emergency manager or emergency coordinator . Have we updated as to who that is and is Council -- did Council appoint that position as of yet? MS. CIPRIANI : I'm not certain of the answer to that question . But I could check with the Mayor. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that would be -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I know the answer to that. That is John Judge. The emergency management coordinator the way that it was set up was automatically the Fire Chief. Al Lucas just stayed on in that role I think kind of a transition until -- a transitionary period because he had already been doing it for so long. But I know John Judge is now in that role. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that's correct . I didn't know if we had to -- if Council had to make a move on that or if that was something that was -- MR. GAUGHAN : No. No, I don't think we have to do anything there. MR. SCHUSTER : So, yeah, at this point in time I think the first step is switching over to Mr. Judge on the PEMA portal and see what we could apply for there. I know there's funds there that, you know what I mean, it would be a shame to leave them on the table. MS. CIPRIANI : Sure. We'll check with the Chief. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MS. CIPRIANI : Any other questions ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. SCHUSTER : That was all from me. MS. CIPRIANI : Okay. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Eileen, thank you very much. As always, we appreciate it. Thank you. Bye-bye. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I think the only thing I'd like to do is possibly Mr. Deeley spoke about, you know, taking a look at the reopening plan for City Hall. Maybe we could send correspond ence over to the Mayor and the administration and see where they are with that just to get a timeline and see what their plans are for the future. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I think he said that they were going by the state -- whatever the state guidelines were. So, I mean -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, he also said they were -- they were running their own checklist I think to see if they were ready. I forget what terminology he used. I felt like they were running through their own process of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 reopening as well that would coincide with that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anything else? MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. So about two weeks ago on top of Rockwell Avenue someone dumped a bunch of mattresses , chairs, garbage . I reached out to the first shift dispatcher and he politely said I will forward this information onto Mr. Jenkins , the head of -- or the supervisor of DPW. What I would like to do is have, Mrs. Reed, please if you would do this for me actually send a letter because I haven't heard from anybody yet or nothing has been done. It's at the top of Rockwell Avenue right across from the entrance to Career Technology Center. There's a bunch of stuff illegally dumped there. So if we could please have them follow up on that and get me some type of answer because initially I wasn't sure who was responsible . I know it's garbage so that's why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 I called the dispatch er. He said, no, we take care of that but the supervisor has to either take a look or approve it. I'm just waiting on that. Hopefully he needs a reminder that he didn't get the message . All right, Mrs. Reed? Thank you. And secondly , so as Chairman of the Committee on Public Safety, I would like to recognize the Scranton Police Department and the Fire Department for their valiant efforts this week. The first one being the police we saw today that the Street Crimes Unit apprehended a person with a gun, took another gun off the street. The serial numbers were filed off so great job by them. Also, the fire department for rescuing a cat that was in a tree for four days. I don't know about you guys how old you are, but when I was young I remember hearing that the police and the firemen , you know, they rescue cats out of a tree. And I actually got to see it this week, which I thought was pretty cool. So I'd like to commend them on their great work as always. And that is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just one quick comment . Miss Reed, would you be able to send correspondence to the DPW Director and the Police Chief regarding the issue with trucks continuously hitting bridges throughout the City? I know the one on Main at the bottom of Euclid for the Central Expressway, I think that's been hit like four times in the past week. So we need to figure out something to do to stop that from happening again. I know the one on South Washington Avenue has been hit multiple times too. So maybe we could set up a meeting to try to see what we could do to, you know, get this to stop happening . And that's all I have under Fifth Order for right now. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Two quick things, just for the resident s on Third Avenue I know I mentioned this last week or the week before. There is legislation that's coming to make Third Avenue a one way from Elm Street down to Broadway which should lessen some of the problems there and also no parking on the one side of Third Avenue from Luzerne Street to Broadway so that should also help. So the -- I've been in touch with the neighbors out there. And I know that should be coming soon. Also, I received a message from a resident with two questions , Mrs. Reed, if you could just find out and get an update on the Street Sign Program in the City. I know there's been a lot of progress made over the last two years on that. There are still a lot of street signs that are faded and need to be replaced. I do know the City was going for a grant funding to replace all of those signs. And they've been identified through the Street Sign Program that Council had passed a few years ago. But if you could just get a general 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 update on that for the resident . And then this resident also wanted to know the list of properties that are going to be demolished so far in 2021 if there was a list already or a strategy by neighborhood . And that's all I have. MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER TO UNDERTAKE A STREET, SIDEWALK AND CURB IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AND GRANTING A TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION EASEMENT . (EMERGENCY CERTIFICATE ATTACHED .) MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this is just to approve a temporary construction easement so that the City gives the rights to the hospital up there to do this project . This is $300,000 that's going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 invested in that area. This actually is going to also I think help Nay Aug Park. It's that whole corridor up there. So there's going to be improvements to the sidewalks , some of the street signs. It will improve public safety, the crosswalks . So it's a great project . And I'll be in favor of this legislation . Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to suspend the rules to move 5-B to Sixth and Seventh Orders based on the attached emergency certificate . MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor and a second to move Item 5-B to Sixth and Seventh Orders. On the question ? MR.

But, I mean, this was brought to us I think it was over two years ago. I don't know if Councilman Gaughan remembers where they came in and presented this idea to us. So someone dropped the ball here for this, you know, this to be done by emergency certificate . And I just wanted to make that point. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 31, 2020 (AS AMENDED ), AN ORDINANCE “AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO APPROVE THE DESIGNATION OF THE 300 BLOCK OF CENTER STREET AS A ONE-WAY STREET FROM PENN AVENUE TOWARDS WYOMING AVENUE WITH THE SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE THE DESIGNATIONS AS REFLECTED IN THE ATTACHED DRAWING , C-4 CENTER STREET PARKING ” TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE ONE-WAY TRAVEL FROM WYOMING AVENUE TO PENN AVENUE. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , Kevin, I meant to bring this up with you before but I just remembered . Shouldn 't we be repealing the last designation before we -- and then creating a new designation or a new ordinance in terms of when you codify 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 everything , you know, so it's less confusing? ATTY. HAYES: This would replace it. I can understand it being more -- it being cleaner if we repealed it. This was really the suggest ed -- and correct me if I'm wrong, Lori, but this was the suggestion of our engineer on how to proceed with this, correct , Lori? MS. REED: To repeal, Attorney Hayes, yes. ATTY. HAYES: Right. So -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I think -- ATTY. HAYES: I mean, this essentially repeals it. What's your -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. So it does. It repeals it and then we're -- no -- ATTY. HAYES: No, I'm sorry. This amends it essentially . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, then there's another amendment then to a maintenance agreement . The maintenance agreement could be amended . But in terms of codifying it so when you're, you know, in five years when you're going to search for what this, you know, what legislation gives the right for a one way on Center Street, you know, you're not doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 circles around trying to figure out, you know, exactly what the legislation says. ATTY. HAYES: Right. Well, this would be the most -- this will be the final amendment , yeah. This would be the final -- you know, you look -- the last amendment , this would be the last amendment to it. Your thought would be to repeal it and do an entire new ordinance ? MR. DONAHUE : I mean, that would make it easier in terms of, you know, when you do the actual code. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. All right. Well, let me look into it and see if we could change it that way. We can amend -- we could change the language and allow this to proceed forward and just amended it at the time it's at Seventh Order. MR. DONAHUE : Okay, just because it has it going both ways. So if you amend it, the original language would be there and then the amendment would be under it, right, basically so -- ATTY. HAYES: Yes. MR. DONAHUE : It could be confusing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 if you look down the road in terms of that being, you know, an ordinance on the books. ATTY. HAYES: Okay. All right. I'll look into it. We can talk again and see if that's the best way to go just do a repeal and replace essentially with a new ordinance . MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : And it's a waste of time. We're doing this again. But that's a different point. ATTY. HAYES: Yeah. Okay. Why don't you, me, and Lori get together and figure out the best plan on that. MR. SCHUSTER : So with that being said, this corrects all the issues that the county is having with this -- this road? ATTY. HAYES: Basically , Councilman Schuster , is my understanding is after they asked -- the problem was that there was congestion on Center Street. And it was making -- it was causing difficulties with -- especial ly deliveries to service the Government Center. And so they came to us. They asked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 for us to make it one way. They propose d a one way of flowing from Penn to Wyoming . Now they are seeing issues in terms of people exiting onto a two-way street and thought it would be more efficient to reverse it and have them exit onto Penn Avenue. So this is that -- that's their request . This originated all from the county and what they're asking to make deliveries there be -- and the traffic flow better in that area. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, this should be the final adjustment . ATTY. HAYES: I would assume, yeah. There's only two ways to go. They've gone both. DR. ROTHCHILD : They're not going to come back and say we got to switch it back? ATTY. HAYES: I would hope not. MR. MCANDREW : How many more parking spots do they get out of this with the one way? I have another question . Okay, this is advantageous for their deliveries . But what about the rest of the vendors ? I mean, last time we heard from vendors . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 Is this going to affect other vendors and their deliver ies because -- I don't know. I mean, I know we got to vote on it. But I'm going to take a drive by. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, we probably should reach out to those that reached out to us the last time just to make sure that the changes, you know, the change of direction is okay with -- MR. MCANDREW : I'm sure they don't even know it's coming so maybe we should provide that courtesy . ATTY. HAYES: Okay. The big issue last time was the loss -- the biggest consideration was loss of parking spaces I think. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah. So as long as they're still good there. ATTY. HAYES: To me this flow makes more sense to be honest instead of trying to flow -- exit onto Wyoming Avenue and make a left-hand turn or to block the sidewalks there as opposed to just exiting making a right-hand turn on -- or left-hand turn onto Penn Avenue. This seems like it makes more sense from a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 traffic flow perspective . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else?

MCANDREW : All right. So on the question , so I'm still not sold on this because I posed a couple questions . I'm waiting to hear from PennDOT . You know, I drive by this every day this intersection every day. I drive up Oram quite a bit. And I'm still not sold on this. So I'm voting yes tonight to move it forward so in case I have to vote no, it will be there to vote no. But I want to piggyback on what Councilman Donahue said. So a block -- so there's all of this concern about safety and -- for this intersection and, you know, I don't think buses even go up it anymore. I could be wrong. But I'm hearing they're not. But all this concern about intersection safety where I see there's no problems . All right? I live here my whole life. I've never seen a problem there. But a block away, guess what's a block away, a bridge where trucks are getting under as like Council man Donahue brought up. So why don't we take a look at the bridge more so than the intersection ? It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 2021. I use GPS even instead of a map to drive. Maybe somewhere in there it should be, you know, bridges should be, you know, red flagged about the height versus your truck and for your truck driver. I don't know if there is -- if an app was developed it would make a lot of money. But I just think I should be more focused (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Anyone else on the question ? Kyle? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, so we did set up a call with the representative from PennDOT for Thursday afternoon . So if anyone else has any additional question s just let me know and we'll make sure we get answers to those before final, you know, before we consider final passage next week or, you know, future weeks because I do think there will need to be, you know, from my perspective at least some changes to this because like Mark said, some of them are just a little ridiculous , but, you know -- MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Donahue , I'll contact you to get on that call. I wouldn't mind being on that call as well. I mean, my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 concern with this is, like I said last week, I was down on one intersection not similar to this but on the corner of Putnum and Main in North Scranton . And once some of that parking got pushed back. It displaces a lot of residents . And in this area we're talking about, there are a lot of apartments and mobile homes in there that it think is going to displace a lot of those cars further up that block and down onto Hyde Park Avenue. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?

PREVIOUSLY TABLED. NO. 134, 2021 – APPOINTMENT OF LEONARD NAMIOTKA , 1130 PHILO STREET, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18508, TO THE POSITION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 17, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend a final vote of Item 7-D. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , I'm sorry. So on the question , I know we played a little volleyball with interim and acting, the terminology , they mean the same to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 me. All right, the Administrative Code in my mind was violated . And I feel bad for Chief Namiotka . I'm voting yes for him. And he deserves that vote because not only did it go past 35 days, it's over 150 now. And he was in some type of limbo waiting for the appointment . But I'm always, you know, a Council person of process and procedure . And it wasn't followed this time. I'm sorry, I disagree with the administration . And, you know, and one of the reasons where it took so long to appoint because of great turmoil in police department s throughout the country . That doesn't make any sense to me. There should have been a sense of urgency to appoint . So I'm happy to appoint Chief Namoitka tonight . I wish him well and best of luck. And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? On the question , just a few things. So this has been something that had been as Councilman McAndrew said volleyed back and forth between the Council and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 administration . It's an issue that had been raised several times with the administration . And we did not receive really any clear answer on it. So Council and our Solicitor Kevin Hayes has drafted a letter that will be sent to the Mayor tomorrow morning just detailing our position on this. And I'm not going to read the whole letter into the record. But I'll just touch on some -- what I think are some important points. There is no allowance as we've said now for this third designation of interim under the City's code. There's either acting or permanent . And that was the hang up from the very beginning on this whole thing. The -- Council really strives to take a very careful and deliberate approach to fulfilling our legislative and oversight functions . We want to make sure that the Administrative Code is being followed when we're asked to exercise our appointment powers under the code. So it's for that reason that Council raised the -- that the issue of acting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 and interim . It says clearly that the City's department head serving in an acting capacity in excess of the 35-day period would be a violation of administrative code. You either have to be appoint ed permanently or dismissed which didn't happen in this case. We all agree and have agreed from the beginning that Chief Namiotka is qualified for the position . That was never in question . But we -- and I'm going to vote for this tonight because we don't want to have our police department or the public suffer as a result of what amounted to a procedural error on the part of the administration . So in this instance to ensure the public safety, that outweighs in our minds the procedural missteps relating to the appointment . And I think it probably could have been cleared up earlier on. But there were several instances where we didn't get any sort of response , you know, so that was an issue. We do make very clear in this letter that moving forward when an appointment comes in front of us across our desks, we are going to hold all acting and interim appointment s to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 35-days of service which is in the Administra tive Code. Now, the Mayor has made the point that 35 days isn't enough. And we've stated on more than one occasion that Council will be open to considering more than 35 days. But there would have to be legislation to amend the Administrative Code. So for those reasons , I'm going to vote yes on this. And then we'll send this letter tomorrow to the Mayor again stating our case and our reasons why and we'll put that in Third Order for the public to take a look at next week. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So I don't have to say too much. I echo what both Mr. McAndrew and Mr. Gaughan are saying. I agree with the letter wholeheartedly . I just didn't want to duplicate what we're saying too much. But just I'll support this but -- because of the fact that we don't want the public and we don't want the police department to suffer for those procedural missteps. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR.
