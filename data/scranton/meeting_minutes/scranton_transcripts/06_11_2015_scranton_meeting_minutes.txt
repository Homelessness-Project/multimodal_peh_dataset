Inregards tothecomments andthe storyinthepaperthisweekaboutBoscov's, I'mnotreally goingtospeakgenerally aboutthat,Iwasdisappointed thatwewere notasacouncil involved withknowing about thatpriortothat,butIamlooking atthis andI'mtrying toalways findapositive in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 thesetypeofthings.Tothebestofmy knowledge thisisthefirsttimein18 months thattherehasactually hasbeensome discussions abouteconomic development within thecity.Forthemostpart,the administration andcouncil hasbeentiedup withpensions andbudgets andrecovery plans andhaven'treally focused toomuchon economic development sothatwasagood thingaboutit.Forme,Iwouldremember seeusinvest ourtimeandefforts inthis withifwearegoingtodoanyloansortax relief,whichIdon'tknowhowwecanfor thestatethatwearein,Iwouldrather see thecitypursue companies thatarealready within thecity,forexample ,something like DeltaMedix,lookingatthemweshould pursue themwithtaxcredits andloansto encourage themtostayinthecityand expand. Andintermsofwhatwasdiscussed , Iagreewithalotofthespeakers thatthe mallasitstands hastobereworked,and suchI'mnotsurethatIagreewithputting moremoneyintoitasitstood.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 ThisweekIwasapproached bya constituent whohadarather novelideaand Iamgoingtopursue itfurther ,thisperson mentioned tomethattheDPWworkers , especially thegarbage collectors ,areon everystreet inthecityatleastoncea weekandthisperson thought itwouldbea goodideaiftheywouldbethepeople who kindofgenerated theideasaboutwhat vacant properties orproblems orwhich streets inthecityhavesevere potholes ,so Iamgoingtopursue thatalittle moreto seewhatwecoulddowithreporting fromthe DPWandalsofromthepolice department to generate ideasonwhatproblems needstobe fixedinthecity,andthat'sallIhave rightnow,Mr.McGoff. MR.ROGAN:Thankyou.Acouple of briefitemsandthensomething I'mgoingto talkatlength foralittle longer.Two quickitems,first,I'dliketocongratulate DaveGervasi .Todayheretired after29 yearsasaScranton firefighter .Ihave knownDaveverywell,hehasbeenaregular speakeratcitycouncil meetings throughout1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 theyearsandIknowwithout him,Iknow muchofwhatIknowabouttheScranton Fire Department Ilearned through talking with Daveandcurrent unionpresident JohnJudge soIwishhimahappyretirement andIhope heenjoys histimeoff. Secondly ,Iwascontacted bya resident onEastMountain thatwasconcerned aboutgypsymoths.Iknowthisissomething thatwasonthenewsinLuzerne Countyand theHanover Township areahasbeeninundated withthesemoths.Theyeattrees,theykill trees,ifpeople getthemonthemtheycould causeverybadrashes.Oneofmycoworkers actually wasathisson'sbaseball gameand gotaterrible rashfromthesemoths. Iknowtheprocess onlybecause of talking withofficials inLuzerne County aboutitisthecounty needstorequest the statetodospraying ifthatareahasa problem .Soifit'sagreeable withmy colleagues ifwecouldsendaletter tothe county asking iftheyhavetakenanyaction regarding thisproblem .Obviously ,it's muchworseinLuzerne County thanitishere1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 currently andwedon'twantthattohappen inScranton oranywhere within Lackawanna County because it'snotonlyaproblem to individuals butfromwhatIunderstand it willkillthetrees,soitwilleatallof theleaves offthetreesandwillkillthe treessoifwecoulddothatjusttomake surethecounty isawareofitsowecan stayaheadofitunlike Luzerne Countywho fellbehind andthenwasneverabletoget caught uptotheproblem . Next,regarding thearticle thatwas inthepaperregarding themalland Mr.Boscov,Ihavespoken quiteabitabout thisissuethrough theyears,I'mgoingto speakalittle bitmoreaboutittonight . Todaywereceived aletter fromthemayor, itwasactually wewerecopied onaletter fromthemayortoAlBoscov,andI'mnot goingtoreadthewholeletter because itis overthreepageslong,butthereweresome things intherethatIwashappytosee. TheoneImentioned thatMr.Boscov's company currently owes$18million tothe CityofScranton andthatnothing further1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 wouldcomefromtheCityofScranton until thatissatisfied .That'ssomething I completely agreewith.Thatamount is staggering ,that$18million ofeconomic development moneythrough various loanshave goneto,Idon'twanttosayMr.Boscov,to Steamtown MallAssociates whotheprincipal investor wasMr.Boscov. Moving onwiththeletter,itsays, "Iwanttobeperfectly cleartoensure therearenomisunderstandings between you andthecity.Wewillnotmoveforward on thegrantloanapplication fornewfinancing forthemalluntilwehavesufficient assurances thatalloutstanding issues you havewiththeCityofScranton areresolved inthecity's.Restassured ,ifyoudonot resolve theseissues,myadministration will notsupport anyadditional funding foryou onyourproject .Iwouldstrongly suggest youcomeupwithaplantoaddress allof theseissueinadvance ofanyrequest for funding." Anditmentions thatthiswas discussed somemonths agoatameeting that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 themayorhadwithMr.Boscov.LikeIsaid, I'mnotgoingtoreadthewholeletter.I don'thaveaproblem withthe--eventhough Idisagreewiththeinitial letter thatwas senttoDCED,Iunderstand howletters of support work,generally governmental officials bodies areaskedtosendthemout andtheysendthemoutforanyeconomic development projects within theircity. Iknowwejustrecently didonefor agrantaswell.SoIdon'thaveissues withtheletter beingsentout,butIdo haveanissuewithMr.Boscov andhowhe doesbusiness .Ididalittle research, actually alotofresearch thisweek.Last weekImentioned whenIwasreferring tothe article thatwasintheTimes-Tribune regarding "Donor'sBrother GetsJob,"why theScranton Times,andnotMr.Lockwoodin particular ,because hewasnotthereporter during thistime,didn'tinvestigate other campaign contributors thatreceived jobsor different perksfromthecity. SoIstarted looking intothatandI actually woundupgoinginacomplete ly1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 different direction thanwhereIplanned on because ofthismallissue.Idiscovered a website andforthoseofyououttherethat wanttocheckitoutit'swww.AlBoscov .com. Sounds pretty simple.Ifigured itmight havebeenMr.Boscov'swebsite,butit's certainly not.Whatthiswebsite says across theheader,"AlBoscov.Exposing the Pennsylvania 'sNumberOneTaxPimp."Andit goesontostateallofhispolitical donations topolitical candidates throughout thestate,andtheyarenumerous . MayorDoherty ,formerMayorDoherty , received atotalof$17,500fromMr.Boscov. Now,thatisn'tsurprising considering Mr.Boscov hasdonated overthecourse -- sincehewasbailed outbytheStateof Pennsylvania intotalMr.Boscov hasdonated topolitical candidates $549,893.15.That's overhalfamillion dollars thatMr.Boscov donated tovarious political candidates throughout theStateofPennsylvania including ,asImentioned ,$17,500toMayor Doherty ,$31,000toStateSenator Blake, another $2,000toformer StateRepKevin1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Haggerty .TheyweretheonlyonesInoticed inourregion.Former Governor Corbett , hundreds ofthousands ofdollars,andformer Governor EdRendell ,hundreds ofthousands ofdollars ,andyouhavetoquestion whatis Mr.Boscov receiving because ofthese donations ? SoIdidalittle moredigging ,and nottomention thefactthattheStateof Pennsylvania hasbailed himout,Mr.Boscov, underEdRendell ,tomulti-millions of dollars ,andallofthesepolitical donations wereafterthestatebailout.So goingbackto2009,now,Iwasnotoncity council atthistime,"Boscov tocity, Guaranteed LoantoKeepStoreOpen.Retail ChainOwnerSeeksCityApproval for$3 Million and$47Million HUDLoan." Thefirstlineofthearticle from theTimesLeader,"Ipromise wewillpayyou back."Thefirstlineinthearticle .$3 million .Wehavenotbeenpaidback.It goesonandonaboutit,but,again,thisis Mr.Boscov usinghispolitical influence to receive favors.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 InJulyof2011Iwasoncity council atthattime,another article , "Council Extends MallLoanRepayment Schedule .Witha4to1vote,Council amended the2003Section 108loanagreement before theCityandSteamtown MallPartners , LLPfortherefinancing oftheLackawanna Avenue mallproject byextending the agreement until2013."

MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Evans? MS.EVANS:Thankyou.IguessI'll continue onwithcomments aboutMr.Boscov andthemall.Mr.Boscov haseffectively cleared thedeckforbidding inafewweeks forthepurchase oftheSteamtown Mall. Unless thereisasurprise bidder outthere hewillgainsoleownershipofthemallata1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 dramatically reduced price.Itreally isa bizarre scenario whereapartner inthe company thatownedthemallandthat defaulted onthemortgage allowed togointo foreclosure wouldnowhavetheopportunity andtheinside tracktobecome thenew owner.TosaythatMr.Boscov isashrewd businessman wouldbeanunderstatement ,but withthatsaidwithout acommitment fromhim afterheisthenewownertototally reinvent themallandtopaythemillions of dollars stillowedtothetaxpayers itwould notevenbeclosetobeasoundinvestment bytheCityofScranton tospendone taxpayer dimeontheBoscov-ownedSteamtown Mall. AsImentioned earlier ,because Mr.Boscov willmostlikely ownthemallat aseverely discounted pricethereisnoneed tocommit anymore taxdollars tothemall. Itistimeforthisproject tofinally stand onitsownandstopbeingpropped upby otherpeople'smoney,particularly whenthat moneyisforthetaxpayers . Onanother topic,HP-316itisno1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 secret thatIhavebeendiscussing theneed forpension reform foralmost ayear,soI wasextremely happytolearnthisweekthat HP-316passed inthestategovernment committee andmaybeheadedtoafullvote onthefloorofthehousesoon.

Thiscitycouncil sentletters dated April15,2015,toStateRepresentatives FlynnandFarina asking fortheirsupport as well.Ifhehasn'tdonesoalready ,Iwould askMayorCourtright topublically statehis support forthisbillandtopersonally lobbyourstaterepresentatives tosupport thisimportant legislation .Iwouldalso liketomention thatCarbondale MayorJustin Taylor whoshowed hissupport forthebill bypersonally visiting thecapital onthe dateofthecommittee vote.Thismessage fromthesemayors --orthosemayors andthe citycouncil should beloudandclear. Municipal pension reform should neverbea partisan issues andforcities likeScranton miredinpension obligations ,itmaysimply beamatter ofsurvival .ThatisallIhave atthistime.Thankyou.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 MR.GAUGHAN :Thankyou.Iwould justagreewithCouncilman Evans,Idothink thatweshould sendcorrespondence toMayor Courtright tohavehimpublically support thisbill,Ithinkit'simportant ,aswe know,aswe'vetalked aboutforthepast yearandahalfpension reform iscritical tothecity'ssuccess moving forward financially . Ihadthepleasure ofattending a booklaunch eventattheLackawanna Historical Society todayat5:30justbefore ourcaucus.Thebookiscalled "Scranton 's HillSection ."Itisatextural and pictorial celebration ofthehistory of Scranton 'sHillSection neighborhood .The bookwaswritten byJackSheen,anative and resident oftheHillSection .Ihadthe pleasure ofhaving Jackasastudent whenI didmystudent teaching atHolyCrossHigh School.Jackwrotethebookduring his senior yearofhighschool andwillbe attending PennStateinthefall.Heisan unbelievable student andagreatperson.I wouldencourage everyone topurchase this1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 bookandyoucanbuyitonlineat www.arcadiapublishing .comfor$21.99and thisisthebookthatIhaverighthere.So Iwouldencourage everyone tobuythatand support Mr.Sheen.

Sowediddiscuss thatasacouncil inourcaucus tonight andweareplanning on having Mr.Koladjeski inforourcaucus to giveusmoreinformation aboutthat.I thinkit'sveryinteresting . Inregards tothenewspaper article , manyofcolleagues havetouched onabout Boscov'sapplying foraRACPgrantinthe amount of$10million anda$50million loan,asmycolleagues havealready said, council wasneverapproached orconsulted by MayorCourtright regarding aletter he submitted pledging unanimous support for thisproject .Council wasreferenced inthe letter yetknownusknewanything aboutit. IspoketoMayorCourtright Wednesday morning byphonetogetanexplanation and hedidapologize ,butthisisjustanother example inmyopinion ofatotallackof1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 communication andtransparency forMayor Courtright .Atbest,thisisanother sloppy display bythemayorand,quitefrankly ,bad government . Andasitpertains toMr.Boscov,I thinkonapersonal levelwhenyoutalkto youraverage person onthestreet whatthey understand ishowcansomebody getaloanor agrantoranytypeofmoneywhentheystill haveoutstanding debt.SoIthinkIwould agreewithmycolleagues thatthedebthas tobepaidbefore thatcouldevenbe considered .AndthatisallIhave.Thank you. MR.MCGOFF:Justacouple of responses topeople thatspokeatthe podium.Firstofall,inregard tothe parking garages report thatwasinthepaper thismorning ,thatwasanengineering report provided byDesmond .Itwaspartofthe monetization process andit'srequired as partofthemonetization process fromthe bidders .Thereport wasprepared forthe bidders specifically ,notnecessarily for theCityofScranton .TheCityofScranton1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 didnotgoouttoDesmond andsay,"Wewant todemolish thegarages ,howmuchisit goingtocost?" Desmond simply gaveorprovided a report thatincluded anumber ofthe different scenarios sothatthebidders wouldthenproperly evaluate thebidthat theymightprovide tothecityinthis monetization process .Thecityatnotime wasnecessarily considering thedemolition ofthegarage.Itwassimply something that wasapartoforrequired report forthe bidders inthismonetization process . Asfarasthemallandtheideaofa casino foramall,thishascomeup repeatedly fromMr.Bolus.Firstofall,we donotownthemall.Rightnowthemallis inreceivership andlikely tobeownedby Mr.Boscov sincehewastheonlybidder.We cannot forceMr.Boscov toputacasino in themall. Secondly ,acasino needsan applicant ,thecitycannot applyfora license foracasino.IfMr.Boluswantsto applyandthenlookforsupport fromthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 citysobeit,butthereisnoapplicant for thecasino license .Mr.Bolusissimply asking thecitytodothings thatitcannot do. Last,theScranton planwasbrought up,theScranton Planwasagreatideaand itworked untilallthejobsstarted tomove southandthentoAsia.Iwouldlike,you know,Mr.Ellman gaveanumber ofthe businesses thatcameinundertheScranton Plan,Iwouldliketoknowhowmanyofthose businesses stillexist. Yes,theScranton Planwasagreat ideaandmaybeweneedsomething likethat, butwhattypesofbusinesses canweattract tothecity,totheareaatthistimeand howmanycanwekeepinthearea. Lastly,asIthinkit'salmost unanimous inourdisfavor withtheletter thatwassentinsupport ofaloanto Mr.Boscov.Ihadtwoproblems withthat andIspoketothemayoronWednesday , morning ,Mr.Gaughan waspartofa conference callatthetime.Isaidthat thereweretwothings thatIthought were1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 wrongaboutthatletter.First,wehadno knowledge oftheletter.Wehadbeentrying tobuildarapport between council andthe administration .Wehadbeen,youknow, doingourbesttousethatrapport with people inthebanking community ,youknow, business community ,andthings likethis simply aren'tgoodaswemoveforward .How dowetellpeople thatthereisa communication between theadministration and thecouncil andaworking relationship when thistypeofthingappears inthepaper?
