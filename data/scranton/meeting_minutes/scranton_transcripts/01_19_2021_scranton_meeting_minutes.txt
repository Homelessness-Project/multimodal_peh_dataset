CONTROLLER 'S REPORT FOR THE MONTH ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, Mr. Gaughan , in regard to Item 3-B, the correspondence was sent over to the Mayor to ask questions about the bond counsel fee for the transaction . I did receive -- we did receive this -- the response to that. But looking at the response , it doesn't answer any of the questions that were asked. So I did send and e-mail to Lori earlier in the day. I'm going to ask that she resend this letter that the administration can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 actually address the question s that were asked. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other comments on the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I have a nice announcement . This announcement is -- it's a fundraiser. It's from Cosmo's Cheesesteaks over in South Side. Their announcement or their fundraiser is in loving memory of Steven Sunday, Scranton Firefighter who recently passed away. Starting today which was yesterday , Cosmo's Cheesesteaks will be offering a choice between their three best selling cheesesteaks , the Rodeo, Mozzarella Bomb and then chicken , bacon and ranch. A portion of the proceeds from each of these hoagies sold will go towards the purchase of equipment and/or materials needed at the Scranton City Firehouse in Steven's honor. This is great. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 else have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. I have two. I'm just trying to find information on the one that I wanted to bring up. So for the first time there's -- there are a couple of organizations , nonprofits that are putting together a Scranton Ice Festival . And they're looking to hold this the first week of February , February 5th, 6th and 7th in downtown Scranton . And they're trying to get like our local businesses involved in a, you know, they're going to have ice sculptures down there. And it sounds like it will be a pretty fun event to attend. And it will be outdoor s so COVID safe. And if anyone is interested in participating in it or any small businesses that want to be a part of it, they have a Facebook page called Scranton Ice Festival with the event information and contact information up there. And maybe we can provide some more of that too. But I thought that was something that was pretty neat and different for our area. And I hope it's helpful in getting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 people out a little bit and in the community and supporting our local businesses . And then the other announcement I had it's been around the news a lot today, you know, the national news. I just wanted to congratulate Dr. Rachael Levine on her nomination . So incoming President Joe Biden is going to nominate her as the Assistant Health Secretary . She's currently serving as our State Health Secretary . And I feel that she's done a really incredible job in that position given what we've gone through this past year with the pandemic . I think a lot of people look up to her. But the nomination also is going to be very historic . She will be the highest ranking transgender official in our country . So it's really unprecedent ed to -- well, I think the Obama Administration had -- did have some transgender individuals as part of his administration but not as high ranking as this. So it's really a big moment for the LGBTQ community . And I just wanted to recognize that. And I also had the pleasure of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 personally knowing Dr. Levine for about 10 years now. And it's just been great to watch her successes and to see her now in this federal level helping us out nationally . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Does anyone have any announcements ? Okay. Very good. Mrs. Reed? We lost Lori. Lori, are you there? MS. REED: Oh, I apologize . I'm sorry. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Marie Schumacher and Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O When I access the City website I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 get a Chrome notice the site is "Dangerous Not secure or Dangerous " Why is the City's website not secure? O On the good news side, there were only eighteen total properties in Lackawanna County, two of which were in Scranton , listed for the February 5 2021 Sheriff ' sale. O When may we expect collection of delinquent trash fees to product revenue . O When will the 2019 Audit be available to the public. O How much revenue do we expect from 5E? Is there a separate account for this revenue ? O Has Council ever considered asking Departments to develop metrics for the year? I believe it would be good for the employee and the taxpayers . Perhaps each Councilman could give a report on progress at Meetings . O Will HUD funded road paving (low and moderate -income zones) be the only paving done again this year. O When is a final Report expected from HRG. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MS. REED: The second submission is from Dave Dobrzyn as follows : I would like to suggest council support for mayor the current holder of the office PAIGE COGNETTI . Scranton has not in my opinion had a suitable mayor since JAMES CONNER, Reforms have been tried time and again and the results have been poor at best, Debts have increased and became stranded ; promises have been made during campaigns ie no sale of sewer plant parking is an atrocity in central city; needless to mention the last administration although I feel the sentence was quite excessive . Moving on I would appreciate better information on trash policies on both billing and collections , Over the years I have witnessed speakers advocating per bag and later pining over families ability to pay for volume; advocating non removal ; the facts are most of the fee is probably used up by the time your haulers are at your door for equipment wages fuel insurance and facilities , Recycling is poor at best and we need more attention to percentage , Please give more attention to last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 suggestions of scrapping glass and separating plastic and cans, currently there is a lawsuit against the county men were held in slave like conditions for a whole year over a 2500 dollar arrears in child support at a cost to taxpayers of $22500 figure for incarceration until paid, My suggestion would be to pay the support from state funds and place a lien against the owing parties and save the remainder similar to student loan collections ie for life until paid. It makes little sense to subsidize a recycling center with even job loss or medical issues and leave the taxpayers on the hook for both jailing and possible court settlements if we lose. Any questions on this issue could be answered by BRIAN FULTON archives at TIMES TRIBUNE . Finally I am requesting the ordinances and the and collection policies currently governing trash and hopefully I will not see huge breaks for landlords at my expanded liability , Our bill has been paid for 18 years with time to spare and some other trash or bill is not welcome here, I will send an e-mail to the county with my opinion in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 near future with these same suggestions , please note prior suggestions on recycling mail response to address above. (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? On the question , just a few things. So first, I just want to respond to Miss Schumacher 's questions related to the legislation from last week. And these questions were regarding the legislation that had to do with the OECD Act. So let me just take a minute and respond to those. And this comes from the Director of OECD, Eileen Cipriani . She stated that St. Joseph's does provide income verification . Historically , the City has not been able to fully fund St. Joseph's request except for 2020. St. Joseph's is very effective and efficient in spending the down the CDBG funding and provides an important service to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 community . While St. Joseph's as a nonprofit is open to a larger portion , OECD-HUD funding can only be used for low to moderate income individuals . In response to the father question , only women and children are housed at St. Joseph's. However , counseling and case management are available to a broader population including fathers as part of the program and aid with developing healthy relationships . So hopefully that answers Miss Schumacher 's questions about St. Joseph's. She also asks how many loan to grant loans have there been or loan to grant items. Mrs. Cipriani said there have been eight business loan to grants. Six have been convert ed to grants and closed; two are in the process . Miss Schumacher also questioned why the City passed legislation -- it was 7-C last week working with a company as kind of a passthrough for some of these grants or for some of this money that's going out to small businesses . Eileen respond ed that neither OECD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 nor the City has the technology , capacity to receive and track a high volume of documents simultaneous ly. By the nature of these grants, most applications are submitted in a very small way. So I want to thank Mrs. Cipriani for responding to those questions . I want to thank Mr. Dobrzyn for his comments . And then I know Miss Schumacher asked quite a few questions . So I just want to check through some of the ones I think I know the answers off the top of my head. The first one was a comment about the City's website about it being dangerous and not secure, some kind of popup. Mrs. Reed, if you could just forward that along to the IT Department and make them aware of that. I'm not sure if it's an issue on the City's end or potentially on Miss Schumacher 's end. Miss Schumacher also asked when may we expect collection of delinquent trash fees to produce revenue ? Council was reported extensively in the month of December received legislation from the administration to hire a delinquent refuse collector . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 We went through a process in doing our due diligence . And in reviewing the contract we made several changes to it or suggestions -- suggested changes . Those are now with the City Law Department and the Mayor. And we have not received anything to date although last week I believe the Mayor said that we should be expecting legislation soon from her administration in choosing a delinquent refuse collector . So I'm expecting that within the next week or two. When will the 2019 audit be available to the public? The last update that we received from Kohanski and Company was on the agenda in Third Order. And, Mrs. Reed, if you could check again with the Business Administrator and Kohanski . I was under the impression that it would be very soon. There was one outstanding item that needed to be checked off the list. How much revenue can we expect from agenda Item 5-E and is there a separate account for this revenue ? I did send an e-mail to Mrs. Reed earlier when I got Miss Schumacher 's comment s. And we will have that information 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 before final passage . I don't know off the top of my head how much revenue comes in -- work has come from this item of 5-E in the past. And I don't know if it's a separate account the revenue goes into or if it just gets rolled into the Fire Department budget. Will HUD-funded road paving be the only paving done again this year? No. It's my understanding that there will be two paving projects , one which I think I reported on last week or the week before in the amount of 700-and some thousand dollars . That will be the HUD paving project . And then there will also be a DPW led paving project as well. We will have those two going on. I don't know if they'll be at the same time, but they'll be in the spring and summer months. And I know that the DPW Director is working on the paving project with DPW. And finally , when is the final report expected from HRG? And that will be the company that was assisting the City in stormwater management . I will have to go back and look at what they had told us a few months 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 ago when we had them in to give us an update. I believe they told us this spring. I can't remember off the top of my head. So I'll have to go back and look at that and I'll get that answer to Miss Schumacher . And I think that should cover it. Anyone else on the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. An issue's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 been brought to my attention by a bunch of concerned residents , all right. They reside on Rundle Street and Watson Street in West Scranton . Of course, you know, before I even start, they realize that they don't own the road or the street with regards to parking . But there's a car lot on 1218 South Main Avenue, right, it's called Affordable Luxury Auto. I'm familiar with this car lot. I grew up in this neighborhood . You know, they used to have eight or nine cars on it for sale. And they also rent a service garage which is two doors down on 1350 South Main Avenue. There's no visible sign. So I don't know what the name of it is. But there are cars everywhere . You know, they're parked on the car lot itself, three or four deep. You can't even pull it out to take it for a test drive. So it's very -- it's very concerning to me. And also they park three doors down where the service garage is but there's cars on top of cars on top of cars, right? And the biggest concern of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 residents is like they said, you known, they don't own the street. But in front of their houses this extends to in front of their houses on both Rundle and Watson, multiple cars, out of state plates in every disarray or -- the cars are inoperable . I don't know if they are illegal . So they're parked everywhere . What else? They are all in disrepair . All I would like, Mrs. Reed, if you could please just, you know, send this correspondence down to the LIPS Department and check it out because it doesn't look right. I drove by today. And even the alley between Watson -- no, I'm sorry, between Rundle and this garage, there's just cars sticking out everywhere . Behind the garage there is probably 40 cars that shouldn 't even be there. I think it's a safety issue. I think it needs to be looked at. Like I said, these cars are from various stages of disrepair from different states with different (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, we lost you. Unless you're trying to fake out us -- no, I think he froze. Mark, I'm sorry we lost you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the last couple seconds of your -- ATTY. HAYES: Hacked again. MR. MCANDREW : Of course you did. Miss Schumacher , I know what you mean with this -- with the internet and the technology here. I hope you heard everything . If not, Mrs. Reed, I will, you know, I'll summarize it in an e-mail. But please send some correspondence to check this situation out. It doesn't look good. I drove by. I don't know all the ordinance s. I don't know what is legal and what's not. But it just doesn't look right. And usually when it doesn't look like, it might not be. So that is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments today? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any motions or comments . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have a few things. So last week I did make a request for the City administration to respond to several Act 47 recommendation s that were in our Recovery Plan. So we are going to send those out if they haven't been sent out already . And I hope to get a response , you know, prior to the end of the month. These are all things that had been in the Recovery Plan now for quite a few years. And I'm hoping that we can get them done before we exit Act 47. You know, most of the ones that have not been completed yet are ones that I think are very important to the City like a debt management policy and some other things that we've been harping on now for the last few years. The second thing is I mention ed this in the caucus. I just want to mention again in the regular meeting is the -- if we can ask just for an update and when we might receive the results of the employee tax and fee status. A few months ago the Mayor and her administration announced that they were doing -- or giving employees a chance to come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 forward and pay anything that was outstanding in terms of garbage fees and real estate taxes and things like that. And Miss Schumacher had asked for an update. So if we could just find out when we might receive that. And also on top of that maybe I think there -- I believe there was going to be a residency audit that was going to be performed with City employees . So if we could check on that as well. And finally , I'd like to make a motion at this time to have Solicitor Hayes draft a resolution in support of renaming Wyoming Avenue to Joseph R. Biden Boulevard after our native son and the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden and also forming a committee to aid in the process . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , as we all know, it's been reported widely that president -elect who's going to be sworn in tomorrow was raised in Scranton for the first 10 or so years of his life. And tomorrow he's going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States and, you know, the most powerful person in the world. And the way that he handles himself and conducts himself with grace, kindness and compassion I think is a great reflection on our city, not only on our city but on our people as well. He's really turned the attention of this whole nation and really in some respects the world on the City of Scranton . And it has been tremendously positive for us. So whether you are -- no matter where you fall in the political spectrum , just the fact that we have an individual who was born here, who never forgot where he came from, who has a lot friends that are still here and who had such an impact on the City of Scranton , the fact that he's going to be sworn in tomorrow as President of the United States is a really, really great thing for our City. And it's great thing for our nation. So I think, you know, this will go a long way in honoring that. And I think it makes a lot of sense. And as I mentioned in the caucus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 tonight when we were talking about this, I do think we need to form a committee to work through the details, post office changes and other things that would most likely come along with this. And as I said, the rational e behind Wyoming Avenue, I think it's a natural choice just because it's not currently named after a president . And I don't believe there's any major significance that anyone would object to as far as I know. So Kevin is going to research that. And I just want to thank everybody for supporting it. And anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. I also just wanted to thank again Shamus Weir who is the Chairperson of the Ballina Council who was here tonight in our caucus if anybody who's watching 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 now missed that. He was here not only to celebrate the sister city that we have between -- sister city arrangement that we have between Ballina and the City of Scranton , but also the fact that Joe Biden has his roots as well, not only in Scranton but in Ballina a small town called Knockmore. So, you know, in the City of Scranton as I mentioned when we were speaking with that gentleman earlier tonight , you can't walk too far in the City without bumping into someone who is -- has Irish ancestry and can trace their roots back to County Mayo and back to Ballina . My own family included , my great-grandparents on both sides are from County Mayo. And as I mentioned , immigrants built the City, the Irish, the Polish, the Germans, the Italians and so on. And that attitude of getting knocked down and getting back up and the fact that they continue to have hope which we need right now in the midst of this pandemic , I think it speaks a lot about not only our city, not only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 County Mayo in Ireland but about that connection that has endured for a very long time and really was kind of set in stone by Mayor Connors back in 1991. So again, I want to thank Mr. Weir for coming to our caucus tonight . And I am hoping that that connection between Scranton and County Mayo can stay alive for generations to come because as I said earlier in doing that, we remember those that came before us, those that fought very hard for our city, those who built our city to gain a better life for themselves and their children . And that's all I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 78, 2019, AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET 2020” BY TRANSFERRING $34,000.00 FROM ACCOUNT NO. 01.401.13090.4299 NON-DEPARTMENTAL EXPENDITURES TO CONTINGENCY TO THE ACCOUNT NUMBERS LISTED BELOW TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR PAYMENT OF FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS THROUGH THE 2020 BUDGET PERIOD. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this was discussed in caucus but just to make sure it gets on the official record, Mrs. Reed provided an explanation to us earlier in the caucus and generally I think what it boiled downed to was there was the increased costs due to the pandemic and due to Council trying to be as transparent as possible and making sure the public was aware of our meetings and advertising that in the newspaper . So those costs did go up this year. And we're simply transfer ring money from the contingency account to cover those costs. Anyone else on the question ?

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm going to be in favor of this legislation . I think anyone who's been following along with the last year and a half of this nightmare with the pandemic has understood that people are really, really suffering . People have lost their jobs. They're not getting the same amount of income that they once had. Children are out of school and at home. People are trying to work from home. It's just been a real mess and a real hardship on people. So this legislation allows people who would have been delinquent on refuse bills in 2020 to pay that by February 28th of this year and to, you know, avoid the penalty which would have been -- usually be 12 percent of the outstanding balance . And I think that's fair. I really do. I think that's fair. This would also reimburse the penalty to those who paid after September 30th and that will be up to February 28th. Now, I do have one question and that is, Mrs. Reed, if you could check with the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Treasurer if anyone has been hired yet in that constituent services position in the Treasurer 's Office. It's my understanding that right now I believe there is only one employee besides the Treasurer herself . And I'm sorry, that's March 31st, not February 28th. But so if we could find out about the -- if anyone has filled in that position yet, number one. And number two, I think this -- we can maybe talk about the discussion that we were having back in December about the grace period. I want to see a larger grace period when we're talking about the delinquent refuse fees. But that's a conversation I think when we get to the refuse -- the delinquent refuse collector , which hopefully will be coming up in the next week or two. But all in all, I do support this legislation . I think it's fair for people. And I think it will help people who have been affected negatively by the pandemic . Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, while we're on the question with this, I know we got some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 e-mails from the Single Tax Office regarding the City and the communications there. Do we know if there was any updates that the City was communicating with the Tax Office? MR. GAUGHAN : What do you mean? MR. SCHUSTER : Wasn't there an e-mail out that the Tax Office had reached out to the City but they hadn't heard back yet? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know off the top of my head. I'd have to go back and look. There might have been. I don't have it in front of me though. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Yeah, I don't have it in front of me either. It was just something I remembered . I'll have to take a look too and maybe I'll send an e-mail over to see if we can get an update as to whether they're communicating with each other. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Very good. Anyone else on the question ? All right. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 47, 2000, AN ORDINANCE , AS AMENDED BY FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 8, 1999 ENTITLED “AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING FEES TO BE IMPOSED FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON FIRE DEPARTMENT ; AUTHORIZING THE ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF SAID FEES; AND PRESCRIBING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS ,” BY UPDATING THE FEE SCHEDULE CONTAINED IN SECTION 4 THEREOF . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , all this legislation is doing is really just updating a billing structure that's about 20 years old. This is a recommendation from the Fire Department and Fire Chief Judge, which I agree with. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 The one thing I mentioned this is in the caucus but just to get it on the record again, this -- all of this is kind of managed by a vendor company called Pennsylvania Fire Recovery . The insurance is billed only and the City accepts the insurance payment . If there's a balance , the company attempts to recover from the responsible party. If the City -- if the person is a City resident , the billing company does not bill the balance . So nothing is changing on the billing end other than the fee structure . So everything that was previously approved will stay intact. And that comes from Fire Chief Judge. So anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.
