CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM UFBERG & ASSOCIATES LLP DATED FEBRUARY 25, 2020 REGARDING CITY OF SCRANTON CONTRACT FOR SERVICES LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT LAW. 3-B. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY CONTROLLER JOHN MURRAY DATED MARCH 2, 2020 REGARDING MORETTI CPA REVIEW OF 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 RETIRED CHIEF DESARNO GAS CARD. MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have one on the Moretti report. Yesterday morning Council received a report from a Arthur Moretti on former Fire Chief Pat DeSarno 's self-audit of all gas card usage for the period of June, 2014 through November , 2019. The review was to determine whether Mr. DeSarno 's self-audit was complete and sufficient for identification of his personal use of the City-issued gas card. As I said last summer when these reports first surfaced , the very idea of a self-audit of this situation was absurd. But here we are. Mr. DeSarno 's self-audit concluded that he only owed the City $559.91 for his personal use of the City vehicle over the span of several years. Mr. Moretti 's finding s indicate that he, in fact, should owe $5,373.61. Imagine what would -- imagine if this Council did not push for a forensic audit. The days of taking people's words for things in City government should be over. The report that's present ed to Council that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 placed on our Third Order agenda tonight presents several addition al concerns . During the examination by Mr. Moretti , it was noted that Fire Chief DeSarno receive d a new vehicle frequently . According to the former fleet manager , the Fire Chief needed no approval to receive a new vehicle . That is unbelievable . It was also observed that the days which Fire Chief DeSarno disclosed as personal on his self-audit including the July 18th, 2019 alleged vacation at the Jersey Shore were not listed on the annual attendance controller . And there were no corresponding signed absence report forms. Mr. Moretti noted in his report, "It is important to note that in 2018 the attendance controller was blank indicating that the Fire Chief -- former Fire Chief DeSarno took no time off during the year and only five days in 2017. It is likely that any vacation , personal or sick days not included on his attendance controller were not deducted from his accrued benefit time balance which is generally paid out to the employee upon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 separation from employment . This would result in an overstatement of unused benefit time and a significant amount of unentitled payout." Mr. Moretti goes on to state that, "For the purpose of this engagement I did not quantify the amount. However , I recommend that the City of Scranton inquire with the former Fire Chief as to why these days are not included in the annual attendance controller . I further recommend that the City of Scranton review policies , procedure s and controls surrounding the use and approval of accrued benefit time to ensure that all employees have the utilized time off properly deducted." Based on these findings , there are some important questions that I am going to make a motion to pose in Fifth Order tonight in writing to the administration and they are as follows : Has Fire Chief DeSarno receive d any payout from unused benefit time and, if so, how much and how was this calculated ? Based on the Mayor's -- the Mayor came to our -- stopped by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 our caucus earlier tonight . It's my understanding and they reported that he has not. But I would like this confirmed in writing . My second question is what steps will the administration take to recoup the $5,373.61 that Mr. Moretti reports former Fire Chief DeSarno owes the City? We were told tonight by the Mayor and her team that they are going to take steps to recoup that money. I'm also going to ask the administration provide the attendance controllers or the attendance reports for cabinet members who served under former Mayor Bill Courtright for the year 2014 through 2019. I'm also going to ask what are the current policies , procedures , and controls for the use and approval of accrued benefit time to ensure that all employees have the utilize d time off properly deducted. What are the current policies , if any, for asset procurement in the City? I did ask about the funding for the fleet coordinator position which was budgeted in the -- in this year's budget. That has not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 been filled yet, but they are working with the labor Council to sort that out. Also, I brought this up last week, a GPS system that I think would help a lot in terms of transparency , accountability and efficiency . And the Mayor assured us again tonight that they are taking steps -- the steps necessary to institute that policy. The report presented to Council that is in Third Order tonight represent s gross incompetence and complete mismanagement from the previous administration . To say that the former Mayor and others were asleep at the wheel is the understatement of the century . It highlight s a mindset in the City that City exists to serve -- that the City exists to serve employees rather than taxpayers . And this needs to stop. This specific issue that was reported in Mr. Moretti 's finding s related to vacation and sick days needs to be investigated further . In addition to requesting this additional information from the administration , I'm also request ing that Mr. Moretti come before the Council to present his finding s on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 this specific report and answer any and all questions that the Council has. Are there any other comments on the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? I have a few. First, I'd like to acknowledge the retirement of Captain Dave Schreiber who last week worked his last shift following more than a 31 year career with the Scranton Fire Department . Congratulations and best wishes for a well-deserved retirement . I wish to personal ly thank you for your service and dedication to the City of Scranton and its residents . And I would also like to extend my deepest sympathies on the passing of your father. As I mention ed at the beginning of the meeting, Mr. Fred Schreiber was also a retired Scranton fireman. This Sunday, March 8th begins Daylight Saving Time. As you turn your clocks ahead one hour, please remember to test and change the batteries in your smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors . It is a simple but life-saving step that we should all be reminded 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 of. Due to the many road closures in the area surrounding the 300 and 400 blocks of North Washington Avenue as a result of the presidential visit this Thursday , March 5th, City Hall will close to the public at 1 p.m. Due to a lack of a quorum on March 17th, Council will reschedule that meeting to Monday, March 16th at 6:30 p.m., and we will have a caucus as usual at 5:45 p.m. And I would just request that speakers state their name when they get up to speak for the record. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident and recovering property taxpayer . I sold my apartment . Free at last, free at last, thank God, I'm free at last. The LST, I saw that four citizens including our friend Marie filed objections to the tripling of the tax. And I'm not sure when a decision 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 will be made but I do hope that the administration is considering a Plan B if they happen to lose that argument . With regard to Chief DeSarno , you know, it's not that I don't trust the man. I trust him as far as I could throw him. So I decided I'm going to do to Chief DeSarno what I did to Mayor Courtright . This is IRS Form 3949A. It's an information referral . And its purpose is to report allegations of tax law violations by an individual which could include public or political corruption by a public official . So I'm going to take the Moretti report and a few of the articles from the newspaper and attach this form, and tomorrow I'm going to be mailing this into the IRS. I'm not quite sure whether I need to do a similar one for other department heads during the Courtright era because I get the impression that, you know, that was a general tenour of the way things were done. We'll see whether there's any reason to go down that road. The article on Mr. Kyle Armbruster who pled guilty to felony DUI, I understand 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 he's not yet been sentenced . And apparently he's still employed by the City according to Acting Chief Al Lucas. If that, in fact, is true, that just irritates the blank out of me. I am really unhappy with that. Now, the only thing I could imagine is that we're waiting for him to be sentenced just in case he decides to pull back his guilty plea and, you know, throw himself -- I didn't do it. But apparently he pled guilty to crashing head-on into another car which carried a family of four including two children . And if this man is sitting home on the taxpayer 's dime with full benefits until he gets sentenced , not right. So I'll also be crafting a letter to the editor tomorrow just to vent on that. You know, I mean, if that's the way our system works, our system is broken and we need to fix it. I just -- not right. I saw -- I read the article on Mayor Cognetti 's press conference on the 27th. I kind of like the way she's heading and her transparency and openness to the public. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 But I was intrigued by what she said about ethics or this is what the paper wrote, "The administration is reviewing the City's new ethics code adopted last year and its policies and procedures as well as what works in other cities and what's needed in Scranton . I got to tell you, okay, there's a time to poop and get off the pot. This ethics code is over a year old. If there is anything wrong with it -- and it's only 28 pages long. It's not that hard to digest. It's written in English , you know. Then propose amended changes and get it over with. If not -- if you're not going to do that, comply with the provisions of the code including the statements of financial interest that need to be submitted to the City Clerk and made available for inspection and published on the City's website. What about the adjusted political campaign contribution limits? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, so I got -- we did receive a response from the Business Administrator and the administration . They -- the Business Administrator has calculated the adjustment . He sent it to the Law Department 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 for review and we should be receiving that soon. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And there are other things that need to go on the website. Nothing is on the website, plain English explanation of the provisions of Sections 12 and 7. I wrote that when I was on the board. It's not on the website. The contribution limits need to be published on the website. So you need to get them on. But like I said, poop or get off the pot. I'm tired of waiting . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. MR. GAUGHAN : Good evening . MR. MORGAN: Today I dropped a request off to Council and the Mayor's office and I requested a response from the Council and the Mayor's office. And I requested to place questions on the ballot in November , 2020. And the letter reads: I, Lee Morgan, request the City of Scranton to place on the ballot the following 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 two questions to be placed before the voters in the November , 2020 election . Question one, abolish the Home Rule Charter in the City of Scranton . Question two, reclassify the City of Scranton from a Class 2A city to a Class 3 city. And I continue by saying I, Lee Morgan, have only created a bare outline of these two question s that I would ask to be placed on the ballot. And I'm looking to see if the Administration and the Council would be willing to place the question s of this type on the ballot for the benefits of residents of this City. Or if the Administration and the Council refuse, then it would be -- it would force a petition drive. I await your response in writing at your earliest convenience . Please direct any correspondence in regard to these questions at my address below. Now, I think that for too long we played silly little games in this City. And I would like to ask the residents of the City to go to the Scranton Public Library and read the recovery plan that Mayor Dougherty submitted to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 the City. And then also keep in your mind that the PEL said the City could have filed bankruptcy in 2012. And we have an administration that has filed an appeal to the Court to try to collect taxes off resident s in the City when they've been told that they're million s and millions of dollars over the caps. And then they're using their own -- our own money against us. And the City has just been so mismanaged for so long that even the public school system has collapse d. And, you know, when you look at kids not getting preschool and the condition of the Scranton School District and the City, I mean, we're standing here and we're talking about a former chief of the fire department . But you know the thing we're not talking about is, allegedly when the Mayor was arrested for his corruption , we're not talking about the sale of the Scranton parking garages to a nonprofit and moving debt around. We're not talking about any of the real issues resolving around this City. Nothing , it's all just smoke and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 mirrors . And you know something , the sale of the Sewer Authority , the pensions underfunded, I'm going to do a lot more requests . I was thinking about doing a Right To Know but, you know, that would be a waste of time. So I found somebody that has the ability to audit the City. And I'm going to request from the Mayor all the financial records of this City for the last 40 years. I'm going to retire next year. And I'm thinking that I want to take some attorneys downtown and see what they have and if the American people have to put up with this corruption forever because the two party political system is broken in this country . And the founders never wanted us to live the way we do under this kind of tyranny because that's exactly what this is. People can't afford their property taxes. They can't. The City is blighted from one side right to the other. And we're talking about a former chief when the Mayor was playing fast and loose selling all of our assets and the Council was ramming it through and just giving everything away. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 The pool in -- the pool on Capouse Avenue has been closed for decades , never fixed. Where's all the -- where's all the grant money going? You spoke about ECTV being funded by the City. You should bring the documentation into this chamber and tell the residents of this City how much money they received from that franchise fee. And let people really know what's taking place here because , you know something , this isn't a, you know, a little game and a show. These people in this City are so beaten down and so overtaxed and then the Mayor brings out and hires a law firm to say, hey, this is a home rule community . We could tax people until they -- it doesn't even matter. We can just keep taking off them. It's beyond ridiculous and it's time for something to change. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . First of all, 7-B this woman Marie Banicky -- I hope I'm pronouncing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 her name right. She presented $500 to the police K-9 Unit. That's a great cause. It was a wonderful thing she did. I'm a dog lover so these dogs are a great asset to the City. Every year at the National Night Out I go all the time just to see those dogs do their thing. They do a great job. And it's a wonderful thing this woman did. Next thing, last week we talked about dangerous dog legislation which I've been talking about for years. Councilman Gaughan , I want to thank you for asking the Solicitor to look into different cities that have it. It's been a long time. So hopefully something could be done with this. And do you know if he has found anything out yet? MR. GAUGHAN : He did issue a memo to Council regarding that topic today. I haven't had the chance, nor do I think any of the Council had the chance to review it. But I will put that in the Third Order next week so that it's available to the public. MR. SPINDLER : Since the big topic tonight is the Fire Chief and I saw it was the headline in the paper today -- and I agree with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 what some of the other speakers said. I don't think the chief should have to pay a penny back. There's no policy in place when he did what he did. He had permission from the Mayor. That was in the past. I don't think that the new administration should be able to do anything about it. If there was a policy in place, I'd say all well and good. Nothing saying he couldn't do what he did. So I hope he hires a good attorney . I think the City will be in for another lawsuit . Next thing, this parking downtown , every week I hear more and more complaints about it. And now I have one. They took every darn free parking spot away from the whole City. You can't drive into town and stop and run into a place for five minutes without fear of getting a ticket. I drive to town every month to pay my Times-Tribune bill. There used to be three or four parking spots there to pay your bill or do whatever you want. Those spots are gone. In front of restaurants , Pappas Pizza down the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 block here, free spots gone. Buona Pizza on Lackawanna Avenue, free spots gone. Something 's got to be -- whoever did that deal, there should have been an amendment in there that all the free parking spots in the City are kept. It's ridiculous . And they are hurting business in the City. Nobody wants to come to down and try to go into a place without fear of getting a ticket. You know what, if I ever do, I'll take my chances in front of the magistrate and just tell the magistrate what I'm saying to you people because I think I would -- I know I would win. I've gotten tickets in the past and I've never lost a case in front of the magistrate . So anybody 's listening, go in and get your pizza, whatever . If you get a ticket, go to the magistrate and tell them what this parking authority did or whatever their name is. I don't even know what their name is. But I think Council should look into it legally and see if we can change that contract to get our free parking spaces back. Like I said, it's hurting businesses downtown . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 And it's not what we wanted. We want people to come downtown and spend their money, not be afraid of getting a ticket. So I hope Council if there is a contract , look and maybe we can since it happened during prior administration , maybe we can get it changed . Thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council . Before I get started with what I really wanted to say tonight , I just wanted to share with everyone I attended the Saturday is Mayor's Day of Service . And I am officially a 2020 census ambassador . So I've been in different blocks that I've been assigned and I've been talking to the resident s of those blocks where I'm assigned to. But one of the things I wanted to share and I share with everybody is the money. The money, there is 675 billion with a "B" dollars that are at stake. So, like, I was talking to a group today. Fill out that census when it comes. It's just so very, very important . And you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 could do the census online or fill out the paper. So, you know, April 1st is census day. And I'll be talking with everybody . And I'm just hoping that everybody will jump on that so that we can help our schools . We can help our street. And we can help our highways . So that's the first thing I wanted to say. It was a great day on Saturday . But I also wanted to continue talking about KS Engineering . And I thank you, Bill, for following up on the grant money because that is a nice piece of money if we can get that grant and find out where that is. But, you know, as I read that letter I kept getting more and more questions . And the one question I -- I don't think you answered for me was the $2,600 that was supposed to be for a database management system that was supposed to start on January of 2020 this year. So I'm hoping that that's not really going into placement. And if it is, what's that $2,600 a month for? MR. GAUGHAN : That's a maintenance fee for the system. So that's a maintenance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 fee to maintain the system, keep the system up. So you're paying monthly for the technology . MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. And that's what I kind of thought . But then I thought and I said, okay, I hate to keep going back when I worked, but, you know, that stuff sticks with you when you work. When we worked on project s, the project person would come back to us and they would say here's the product . And he would sit around a table like this and the K & S Engineering would show us what they did. And we would talk and say did it fit our needs -- did this project fit our needs. Okay, and then the vendor would give us the details, give us the manual with all the instructions and everything on how to work this new product . We would say, oh, yes. Okay, that's good. We got what we wanted. So I'm thinking , well, did K & S come here and do that? Who was on the team? When the bill was turned over to pay this two thousand -- two hundred and seventy -eight thousand dollars to K & S, they gave us a bill. They gave us a product . That 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 product now that we're paying $2,600 a month to maintain . So I just want -- I'm saying this because I just don't understand what we're maintain ing it for because I understand that we're short on people in that organization . There is only 1.5 people working that. So I said, okay. So then I went to the budget. So on my kitchen table I started looking at the budget to see if there was any allotment in the 2020 budget to add personnel to that organization . So far I haven't been able to find it. The only thing I did find in the budget was something that referred to the professional services budget. I guess the professional service budget group deals with these kinds of things. It says, "The profession al services budget will decrease with the completion and partial payment for the Traffic Sign Management System. The budget will continue to be expansive because of this collective nature for many related costs associated both current and propose d capital projects -- I have no idea what that is -- general ly, these costs support 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 related engineering and design services for professional contracts , not specifically imbedded into the various departmental budgets." So I said, okay. So then I started looking in the budget to see who is this professional services budget. Is there a line item in the budget for that? I didn't get all the way through it. There's a hundred and some-odd pages of the budget. So I haven't gotten finished with that. So that's where that letter led me to this because I wanted to know then if that budget has been decreased , why couldn't that money be used for addition al personnel ? And then who -- I got four seconds . And then who puts the wheels in motion to get the addition al personnel because there is no sense in having this management database if it's just sitting there if we don't have the personnel . MR. GAUGHAN : Right. I could answer your question . So I would put it in terms of so -- I think one of your question s is regarding , like, the platform , the technology . So I look at it this way. The Granicus 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 platform that we have here that we upload all the legislation so that the public can look at online, we pay a service fee for that technology . I think it's $10,000 a year roughly . So we pay for that technology every year. If for some reason it goes down they will help us with it. They provide a training to us, same thing happened with the Sign Management Program . So we pay a fee to use that program and that database . Now, within the DPW, the sign department , there's only two employees . I agree with you that there should be more. Unfortunately , in the environment that we're in with the budget, it's difficult to add position s like that. But I know that's one of the goals moving forward is that when we can add to that department we should because I think that's important . But we've been told by the DPW Director is that they're working very diligently to move through each section of the City. That company identified signs you couldn't see at night, signs that were in poor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 condition . And they're, you know, methodically moving through the City to change those and to replace them. MS. JEFFRIES : You know, no fault against the City workers because you said there's only 1.5 of them and there is 26.11 miles in the City of Scranton -- MR. GAUGHAN : Right. MS. JEFFRIES : -- they have to cover. So it's nothing against them. It's just that I just hope that maybe in 2021 budget, we can add to the head count and get another person in there to help those two that are there. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, and at one time there used to be multiple employees in the Sign Department . But over time like I said through different administrations over the past few decades , they've had to cut those position s because of the budgetary concerns . But hopefully that answers your question . MS. JEFFRIES : That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Norma. Next speaker is Bob Bolus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. BOLUS: Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . Mr. Gaughan , I have a lot of questions here tonight . One is, why did you call Chief DeSarno a disgrace over the discrepancies in the figure he calculated under one policy? You have Arthur Moretti , a private accountant hired by the City being paid by taxpayer dollars . How much is that costing us and why is it necessary when the account was told to follow different guideline s for appropriate use of the numbers that were different . You got to remember something . Mr. DeSarno followed the guideline s given to him by the former Mayor. No other Mayor stepping in can go retroactive . He wasn't account able to anybody in any way, shape, or form. And the fact that he's being disgraced and humiliated publically -- as a fellow firefighter I think is an absolute injustice that's being done by this Council , especial ly by you. There's a binding contract . It's oral. You have an attorney there. He'll tell 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 you what an oral contract stands for. What the Mayor told him he could do wasn't for private use. He was on a 24-hour call as a servant of the City and needed to be where he needed to be. And that was what was given for that service . You owe Chief DeSarno his backpay . You don't have a judgment . You have no type of litigation here that said you could take his money. You have to pay him. Write him his check out. And if you don't like it that way then file a lawsuit against him and go to court. But you cannot take an escrow money from anybody no matter who you guys think you are. If you intend to do that and this legal matter pursues , I'm personal ly funding his litigation against you and the City, okay? You could bet on it. Was Armbruster a disgrace? That was a personal matter. Look at what that firefighter did, three DUIs, hit and run, everything else that went on. But yet Chief DeSarno isn't a personal matter? You want to make it public, yet Armbruster isn't. And look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 what we're doing here. He's still on the fire department . It's -- (inaudible .) You know, why don't you call him a disgrace , Armbruster ? Why aren't you calling him a disgrace? He disgraced our firefighters in uniform , the fire department in Scranton and yet he's still around. Yet, I don't see you doing that. What about Pat Hinton? You were about ethics. Yet, you let him get away with what he's doing at the Nay Aug Parking Authority -- or Recreational Authority with the coffee shop. You turned around and you allowed him to put in for containers being called structures . You put it in order. Yet, I haven't seen you enforce removing the containers in the City of Scranton . Yet, you want to make laws. I'm involved in litigation in Nay Aug Park. I brought it before Council . You want to allow Geisinger , a bully with money to take 280 parking spaces in Nay Aug for a dollar a day, 100,000 a year when they should be paying 6 or 700,000 a year. The kiosks up there are $2 an hour. They get two hours. Yet, I don't see you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 saying a word about that or moving to disband the Recreation Authority and take care of the people. You voted for $500,000 increase to the City resident s and crucify our senior citizens , yet, you won't do anything to get the money back from Geisinger . That's appalling as far as I'm concerned . You know, put the Rec Authority under the umbrella of the City of Scranton . Let the Mayor handle it. You know, it just turns to a point that it just turns my stomach . You got Mr. Rothchild here who is professing to be a doctor. I'd like to know what type of doctor she is or he is, okay? Can -- prescribe medication , do surgery or is it just because it's a physical therapist and misrepresenting to the people? They're pro-choice her and Mayor went to a pro-choice rally in Wilkes-Barre. I'm pro-life. And I'm offended by them going there saying they represent the City of Scranton . What they want to do with their own personal name is their personal business . But when you say you're a Councilman or a Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 of the City of Scranton at a pro-choice, you're representing the people in the City and that's not going to be tolerated . I'm against murdering and butchering babies, number one. And number two, you were supposed to get a letter from the authority , the Parking Authority which you lied about sending . I'd like to know when you're going to get that letter and tell us where our 500 parking spaces are. Got it? And this isn't over. I'll be back. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Yep. Welcome back. Next speaker is Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, Keyser Valley resident . Well, Kyle, you were out. You looked around. And you seen what the neighborhood is dealing with. Thanks for coming out. Got anything to tell me? MR. DONAHUE : I haven't gotten an update yet. But as soon as I do I'll -- I'm hoping in the next week or so. MR. SREBRO: Okay. Let me ask you, how about this grant money? I don't understand . I'm sorry I'm kind of dumb about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 how everything goes on. But isn't there money available from the grant to take care of the flooding problem or to help the flooding problem ? MR. GAUGHAN : I sent you an e-mail. Did you get -- I don't know if you got it. MR. SREBRO: I'm sorry. Say that again? MR. GAUGHAN : I sent you an e-mail. MR. SREBRO: I did get it. That's right. You know, see, this is -- the way that I see it, you know, it's the same old, okay, we see there is a problem and we're looking into it and five years now, Bill -- MR. GAUGHAN : I know. MR. SREBRO: -- you know, I've been coming up here, okay. All right. You know, I have a suggestion . I saw it. It was only one time, a commercial on TV or -- I mean, an article about how Wilkes-Barre or Luzerne County is going after the construction companies when they dig up a road, you know, they want them to make it, you know, a good job, you know, to patch the road back up. I'm sure we've all been where they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 dug up the road and left it a mess. You know, why can't Scranton do the same thing, you know, make the construction companies do a good job of patching it up instead of -- some of what I see, you know, cars break things, you know, from going over these patch jobs. Or, you know, when I see something really rough, you're darn right I slow down and if I could, I go around that patch. And if there is traffic coming the other way, you know, it could result in a problem . But I know that it's Wilkes-Barre or Luzerne County is insisting now that they want a decent job of patching . I mean, all my life I worked on cars. If I did a job like that and handed you back your car that it's falling apart, you would say something or you'd refuse it. So it's something to think about. Okay. And I'd like to say that I'm an example of what Mr. Lee Morgan was talking about, you know, that I feel like I'm being taxed to death. You know, a couple years ago when my home burned, you know, I was undecided whether I wanted to rebuild in the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Scranton because the taxes are so high. Well, my taxes went up by $4,000. You know, I'm 66. I'm retired. That's my only income. How am I going to afford this? Now, I do have an appeal coming up, you know, but I know it's still going to be a really big increase . And then I live in a flood zone to add $4,000 to my tax bill and the new house is built on the same platform , the same footprint as the old house. So, you know, yeah, I feel like I'm getting screwed , like I said, you know, for all of these taxes I got to pay. Okay, well, since we don't know nothing about the flooding problem except today my garage got flooded . So if you are not in a flood zone, count your blessings . Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. There are no other speakers listed on the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne. Just to refer to the last statement there coming down Pittston Avenue right in front of the old Sunoco gas station right where Pittston Avenue hits South Side, we have a nice little pothole 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 digging out there. What's it from? It's from a utility patch that sunk. I mean, I've had to dodge it about six or seven times on that roadway in the past month. MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry, which one are you -- MR. COYNE: Pittston Avenue in front of the Sunoco -- where the old Sunoco station used to be, which is -- MR. DONAHUE : I know exactly where you're talking about. And I actually put one in because I hit it every day too. So I put -- MR. COYNE: -- all of a sudden, it's like I'm there again for it. MR. DONAHUE : When they're in that area they are going to put some cold patch down for the time being. MR. COYNE: -- it is a utility patch. Same with the -- because the trucks up near the post office, the corner up near around the post office is like going over a rumble track. I asked last week about the -- I had a question last week about the trash. I'm not sure that you got back to me on that. It was on whether or not the other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 recycling companies in the City had been contact ed because any recycling that they do for material can be put into a grant fund as well. I'm not sure if you reached out to them yet. MR. DONAHUE : We have. So there's a recycling committee . I'm trying to dig into and figure it out exactly how -- what kind of contract we have with them. And it's a municipal agreement between municipalities all throughout Lackawanna County. So Lackawanna County runs it. But then there is a municipal agreement with each municipality . MR. COYNE: I'm talking about there's up on the Morgan Highway there's a recycling company , a private company . There's a number of private companies out there that if you recycling inside the City of Scranton and if you could get their figures , that could also put in towards the grant. MR. DONAHUE : I'm looking into seeing at what -- yes. Yes, you are right there. Yes. MR. COYNE: Is it possible to get a contract of the trash agreement , the landfill 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 trash agreement because I believe Jimmy Connors it was signed under, the last one that we're stilling running under. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, we should be able to get that for you. MR. COYNE: That would be lovely. And as of this current Fire Chief, I do beg to differ. If there is -- in looking at the documentation , I understand if the Mayor said you're working 24/7. You're on call all the time. You have used up all your time that is allotted to you by personal and vacation and sick, therefore , we're going to extend you extra days as you need it because you're working 24/7, that's a different situation . But being able to bank all of your time without using it, without claiming it is an issue. And if it is pattern and practice that time is being taken off and not reported as payable to the City's payroll reduced off their benefits , then they should not be here. It should be taken -- I would actually tell them not to come in here and talk because the City should go after them for theft by deception because they have stolen from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 City taxpayers and the City coffers by intentionally defrauding the government by falsifying their timesheet and time record. It's not an accident if you could prove that it's pattern and practice . If it was done for a number of years where they did not take days off, you know, on the books that they were off and they are collecting from that afterwards . That is a rigged system to defraud the City of money by collecting funds that they are not legally entitled to. It's fraud. And at that point it shouldn 't be come and explain yourself. It should be enjoy the handcuffs and we'll recoup it through a criminal procedure because that's what it is. Unless you put teeth behind this, unless you say when you steal from our government by deception , we are not going to say, bad boys. You shouldn 't do that. You're going to have to give us the money back. And we go, you're going to go in jail and you're going to risk your pension . At that point people stop stealing from the City because the few dollars that they may be able to stuff in their pocket isn't worth the jail 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 time and isn't worth the loss of a pension . That's the best teeth you have to stopping people from robbing the City. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , 7-A, do we know when -- what the termination date is of this project that you are going to be voting on tonight ? MR. GAUGHAN : Termination date of the project in terms of the remediation ? Is that what you are referring to? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : So Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow came in along with Josh Mast from Scranton Tomorrow and Charlie Jefferson , the developer . And Leslie Collins reported to us that there is no exact timeline yet. That will be developed once the contract is executed and they are able to get on site. You're looking at me like I have ten heads. But that's the answer I was given. MS. SCHUMACHER : That just doesn't -- MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, it makes sense.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MS. SCHUMACHER : It's not the way to do business to me. MR. GAUGHAN : No, that is usually how they do it. They couldn't give an exact timeline . They have to come in and be on site. They have a lot of review periods to go through with the state. So they can't give an exact timeline . MR. DONAHUE : And, of course, that is weather permitting too. MR. GAUGHAN : And the weather has to do with it as well. MS. SCHUMACHER : A lot of that has been done and then that should have been preceding the submittal of the proposal . MR. GAUGHAN : No. MS. SCHUMACHER : Everybody that wanted to vote on that should have been afforded an opportunity to come in and survey the site. MR. GAUGHAN : No, when I say review periods, there are specific review periods from DEP and other governmental entities that any bidder would have to go through . So it's hard to give a timeline -- like I said with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 weather and these other reviews that you have to go through . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Because -- and I think my understanding is as the work's being done, DEP has to come in and review the work being done. So they can't give DEP a schedule until they get the work done. And then that's when they invite them in and that's all weather permitting . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, we know how well they do too. Mr. McAndrew , you have the public safety, right? MR. MCANDREW : Right. MS. SCHUMACHER : Have you had a change to review the contracts yet? MR. MCANDREW : No, I have not. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Mr. Perry is not here anymore. I would really like to know if the contracts say public safety personnel have to live within the boundaries of the City. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, Solicitor Hayes, that would be in the Home Rule Charter , correct ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Is it in the Home 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Rule Charter ? MR. GAUGHAN : It is in the Home Rule Charter , yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Then why do we have a firefighter who lives in Throop? Now, this was brought up -- ATTY. HAYES: They have six months to obtain residency . MS. SCHUMACHER : He's only been a firefighter for less than six months? This -- MR. GAUGHAN : Who are you referring to? MS. SCHUMACHER : Let's see -- April 10th of last year was the offense committ ed. So he was already on duty then. That's longer than six months. MR. GAUGHAN : And, Solicitor Hayes, can you address this? I think she's referring to Kyle Armbruster , article in the paper. ATTY. HAYES: Oh, they have six months to obtain residency . So if that -- that's the requirement . MS. SCHUMACHER : But it's been longer than six months. MR. GAUGHAN : So then that would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 the job of the City Controller . And right now it's my understanding that this is a personnel issue. I've asked about this before if you're referring to the fireman that -- Kyle Armbruster , is that what you're referring to? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, well -- yes. How -- who's responsible for doing this? Is he the only one? MR. DONAHUE : So it is the county -- or it is City Controller . And I know he's going through a process now. And he's already identified ones where he's sent out request for them to prove that they do live in the City. And a part of that process now is if you rent, your landlord has to sign a notarized document . If you buy -- if you own a house, your lender has to sign a notarize d document . And if you don't have a lender, that's on the deed. MS. SCHUMACHER : And that isn't a policy? MR. DONAHUE : That was a policy that was just establish ed by the new City Controller moving forward . And he's going through the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 process now of reviewing all those. I know that for a fact because I had a long discussion with him about that about two weeks ago. MS. SCHUMACHER : And is Human Resources in charge of the policies and procedures ? MR. DONAHUE : -- it's up to the City Controller . ATTY. HAYES: That's right. The City Controller -- Mr. Donahue , the City Controller is responsible for enforcing the residency requirement . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : So there are steps being taken. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Who holds the policies and procedures for the City? Are they develop ed by Human Resources and all -- I mean, every place I've ever worked they are all in a 3-ring binder, 3 inch, 3-ring binder. ATTY. HAYES: Which specific policy? There are policies for every department . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, policies for every department how they're supposed to operate , job descriptions .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. DONAHUE : That was actually touched on in our caucus with Mayor Cognetti when she came in. And if they are not all in one specific place -- and I know that they are working on that to get that all into an employee handbook like you're talking about so that it's all out there. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . In two more days our fine president will be in town. And a little word to the wise, he probably hasn't compensated more than 100 cities and possibly 200 cities for the additional police protection . Last week there was a mention about animal control . Try to do for these animals what you can. And one of the things that Billy Courtright did do right was he came up with St. Cats and helped these people get started . They're up at the zoo. It costs $35 for neutering and a rabies shot. And it's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 really good thing -- and Griffin Pond has some economic problems aggravated by no kill. So that's something else to keep in mind. I would hope that we continue to support them. Hopefully we can afford it. And last week I made mention of school lunch. Well, I was very pleased to hear that in Scranton School District they're given breakfast and lunch free. And that should be for all students , by the way. And in other school districts , there's school lunch shaming . And I hope that people would not support that. Every kid should be taken care of in school. And that's all there is to it. They can't possibly learn on an empty stomach . Now, for instance , in New York we see a lot of ads by Mr. Bloomburg about what kind of politician he was and he got medical care for people and he did all of this. Well, he was only Mayor of New York. And by the way, there is 55,000 kids that attend school in New York City from a homeless shelter . So that's how bad things have gotten. And on these 511 taxes, Plan B, go ahead. Raise my property taxes over LST losses 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 and thanks to all that are responsible for challenging them. We have 36 percent tax exempt building s, another 10 percent that pay -- don't pay their taxes. Either they're unable or they just don't feel like it like Mr. Bond. And that means that 54 percent of the people in this town, properties and businesses pay for the rest. And it's not acceptable . And it's not right. So -- and the biggest reason we lost in court was, of course, somebody had to pay $156 out of $150,000 salary or 175 living in Abington , a judge. And it's they don't have the right to vote, well, that's okay. I don't have the right to vote out 36 percent tax exempt buildings no matter how poor of a reason they're here. It's just shameful . Once again, that lot -- I think we're just going to have to see each other in court. My second property , it's next door. I'm going have to challenge it and hire a lawyer and probably all I'll get out of it is my taxes after the 511 tax is tossed out. And we have to enact Plan B. Well, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Plan B will be to raise the taxes back to what they were. But at least it won't be what they would possibly be if I didn't challenge it. So one of the things that kind of bothers me about that is we came up with that land bank. And we're handing these lots away for a song and a dance. And they're paying taxes on them accordingly . And, you know, the guy that's been around for 15 years -- and by the way, that property did not pay 10 cents in property taxes from 1962 to 2002. So that's something to think about. Have a good night. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a nice night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Rogan, do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. ROGAN: Yes, just one item I want to comment on. A few months back Council introduced legislation regarding an emergency certificate to appoint Stevens and Lee to handle on a no bid basis the 511 appeal. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 At the time I voiced my concern about that and my opposition . I was also a bit surprised that legislation was sent from the administration to Council because frankly, Council -- although I don't agree with it has no say in the emergency certificate process . It's signed off by the Mayor. And it's signed off by the City Controller which it had been in this case. So we did introduce legislation . And it was tabled for the past I think three, four weeks now. Again, I was anticipating that we would be voting on it at least to give our opinions . But now I'm being told it's not going to come up for a vote. So I do want to address it briefly and bring up my opinion . We did receive a summary budget from Stevens and Lee, a couple different scenarios . And it looks like it's going to be between 200 and $400,000 awarded on a no bid basis. Again, I strongly oppose the way that this was handled . I know that former Mayor Evans had the appeal ready to be filed. I agree that we should pursue outside counsel . This case is extremely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 important . And I think outside counsel is the way to go. But I firmly believe that this could have been filed and then the bidding process could have been carried out. I know there's a ton of talk about $5,000 from Chief DeSarno which again, that's also a lot of money. But we're talking about $400,000 here on a no bid basis. And the results of this case as Mr. Dobrzyn and others mentioned is going to affect everyone . So I just want to state I'm disappoint ed we're not going to have a vote. I knew it was strictly symbolic . But I do want to state my opposition to the process that was used for Stevens and Lee to obtain this contract . Again, it was entirely legal. But I don't think it's the right way to do business especially for an issue this large. I do also want to mention on the 511 taxes and also on some of the filings that were put in this week as far as opposing some of the other taxes that are currently in place, and everyone loves to say, oh, the City shouldn 't be taxing this or taxing that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 But at the end of the day it costs a certain amount of money to run the City of Scranton . Should it be less? It should. Our budget cannot be cut magically by 30 percent . I wish it could be. But that's not the case. And as one of the speakers correctly just mentioned , if the City were to lose these cases that appeals have been filed and objections have been filed in, the result unfortunately is going to be a large property tax increase for residents . For instance , the LST tax that is rightfully partially paid by people who live outside of Scranton but work in the City who use our services when they're here daily provide s a significant amount of income to the City. If that tax were not in place, that revenue would have to be made up again from property taxes. So for anyone who thinks that if the City loses these cases they're going to see a net benefit , that's not the case. If you live in the City and you own a property , your taxes are going to go up. If you're a renter when your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 landlord 's taxes go up, you know when your lease renewal comes up what he's going to do. Your lease payment is going to go up. So I did want to just point those out that the outcome of these cases are very important to everyone , whether you own a property , whether you don't own a property . At the end of the day, it's the property owners and the renters that are going to be paying the bill. But again, I just want to state my opposition to how the Stevens and Lee contract was obtained . And that's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have two comments . First of all, last week we wished the Lady Invaders luck. I'd like to now congratulate the Lady Invaders of West Scranton on their district champion ship win. And I would also as Chairman of Public Safety, I would also like to congratulate and send best wishes to Captain David Schreiber of the Scranton Fire Department on his retirement of 31 years of service to our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 City. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly . Mrs. Reed, before I forget, would you be able to send a request to the recycling coordinator and the recycling consultant asking if they've reached out to the independent recycler s to add their number into our recycling number? Also, would we be able to send a request to the administration for an update on the Serrenti project ? Also one of the request s I'd like to send to the administration , I talked about this with the Mayor before is a -- since we're into a campaign season this year, a reimbursement policy. It's a problem on both sides of the aisle. There were six rallies held in the City of Scranton in 2016. And we got zero dollars reimbursed . So one of the things I would like to add in that reimbursement policy is to try to see if we can get campaigns to be require d to sign a contract before the City provide s any assistance to make sure that they actually , you know, are forced then to pay up. And that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . A few things, first of all, Bob Bolus got up tonight and said so many things that were false or misrepresent ed that it would take me a long time to go through each one of them. And I don't think that's the purpose of the Council meeting . And it's one of the reasons I didn't respond to him when he was standing there. But one thing that he did say I do want to reply to that I said Pat DeSarno was a disgrace . I did not say that. I said the situation was a disgrace . And it is a disgrace . Any -- raise your hand if you worked for a company in your lifetime and you were allowed to use your personal vehicle to take it to a trip to the shore. Anybody ? Raise your hand. I don't see any hands raised. I certainly for the company and the school I work for cannot take a company vehicle and drive it to the Jersey Shore or take it for my own personal use and then do a self-audit and say I only owe 500 and some dollars . It is absolutely ridiculous . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 it's wrong. I don't care if it was Pat DeSarno , Joe Smith, Bob Jones from Main Avenue. It doesn't matter to me. Take Pat DeSarno out of the equation . It's a person that was in a position of public trust under the Courtright administration who took a personal vehicle and took it to the shore and used it for his own personal use. That is wrong. Councilman Rogan mentioned $5,000. To a lot of people $5,000 is a lot of money. And I bet you every person in the City of Scranton wishes that their company gave them a car so they could drive it around whenever they wanted to and pay for the gas without paying the gas tax. I'm sure that would be great. As I mentioned at the start of the meeting , this is a mentality that exists in this City that this building and this government works for the employee and not for the taxpayers . And unfortunately , for the first five -- or six years that I was on Council under the Courtright administration , it was a zoo. Apparently people were allowed to do whatever they wanted, gross incompetence , gross 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 mismanagement . And I have no problem pointing it out when I see it because that is my job. And unfortunately for the first few years, I was one of the only people on Council who was asking questions of the former administration and was repeatedly stonewalled. And look at where we are today, unfortunately . So I just think that when no one in an administration is watching the store, this is what happens . And if it wasn't Pat DeSarno , it would be -- maybe be somebody else. And I think any cabinet official under the Courtright administration or any employee for that matter who abused a gas card or abused vacation or sick time if that was the case, there should be appropriate measures taken. So with that being said, I would like to make a motion that this Council send correspondence to the administration asking the following questions : Number one, has Fire Chief DeSarno receive d any payout from unused benefit time and, if so, how much? And how is this calculated ? And this was a question that the administration -- the Mayor who was in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 caucus had answered . They said that there was no payout. And I did relate to the Mayor that I would like that in writing and she said that would not be a problem . Number two, what steps will the administration take to recoup the $5,373.61 that Mr. Moretti reports former Fire Chief DeSarno owes the City. Number three, please provide the attendance controllers or reports for cabinet members who served under Bill Courtright for the year 2014 through 2019. Reason I make that is, if one cabinet member, you know, didn't put a vacation or a sick day apparently down for a whole year, was there any other cabinet members that did that as well? I'd like to take a look and compare the documents . Number four, what are the current policies , procedures and controls for the use and approval of accrued benefit time to ensure that all employees have the utilize d time off properly deducted? What are the current policies for asset procurement in the City? And the last two questions I did have here were answered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 about the fleet coordinator position and the GPS system. So there's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. The ayes have it and so moved. The other thing I wanted to mention in terms of the Stevens and Lee budget that we received , so Stevens and Lee was selected as has been reported through an emergency procurement process permitted under the Code by the Mayor and her administration . It was one of the first acts that Mayor Cognetti took when she took office. The Mayor determined that an emergency existed . And Council had no say in the selection of Stevens and Lee. However , upon our request we asked for a budget because this -- and I personally was concerned . I know my Council members were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 concerned about giving a law firm a blank check. Stevens and Lee complied with our request . And they did provide a detailed breakdown and different scenarios with the budget which will be placed in Third Order for public review next week. So this is obviously a tremendous expense . But the City must do everything in its power to exhaust all potential appeals to ensure that this disastrous ruling does not remain in place. And in terms of, you know, no bid contracts , no one up here is in favor of no bid contract s. We had no say in that as I mentioned . But what is the alternative here, a 50 million dollar judgment ? Show me the tree where -- the money tree where you could find that amount. I don't see it. Show me where you could cut in the budget to come up with that amount. I don't see it. The City has no choice but to fight this case. And I believe that Stevens and Lee based on the executive session that we had last week has the team in place to do that and to fight on the City's behalf. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 In terms of the way it was handled , I can't speak for the administration . But I know from being on here -- from being on Council for six years how long the process takes for an RFP. It takes a month, two months, a bid opening. There's a process . So I don't know how that could have been done in that short amount of time. And I think that's why it was relayed that the emergency existed . The other thing I wanted to mention was John Basalyga did respond to Council 's request for information . We just received that. And I have not had a chance to fully go through it yet. But that will also be placed in Third Order for next week. And I do want to thank the Mayor for coming to our caucus tonight in regards to the whole gas card issue. The Mayor and her Chief of Staff made it very clear to Council that they are taking this whole thing seriously . They are going to continue to develop policies . And they are going to start holding employees account able. One of the things that was brought up tonight about the Human 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 Resources Department and an employee handbook and it was also brought up in the caucus, this is something that was -- is in the Recovery Plan. For six years it was an item. And I sat at PEL meeting s when it was brought up that we needed to retool the HR Department and come up with a comprehensive handbook and look at the policies and procedures . It was never done. Again, when someone 's not minding the store and is off doing other things and we all know what that was, this is how things become mismanaged. And I'm sorry, but it's wrong. And until you have more than one person holding people accountable , this is what you end up with unfortunate ly. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
