The following speakers offered public comment on agenda items and matters of general concern : Charles Charles worth Joan Hodowanitz . Les Spindler Bob Bolus Ron Ellman Dave Dobrzyn Marie Schumacher Norma Jefferies ATTY. MINORA: 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly . Miss Schumacher , just on the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue, I don't have an answer for you on Keyser, but I will get one. But on the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue I was updated on Friday. The design work is done for, you know, farther down from Mr. Young's property . What the City is waiting on now is there's a million dollars in an account that's supposed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 to go towards the City's match on the eventual long-term fix that the state is going to do that the City has to provide a percentage match. So we're requesting that the state allow us to use the money to make that fix now. And then we'll replenish that money in the next five years for the, you know, permanent fix for us to have our grant so that's where that -- we're attempt ing to get that money from. A couple, you know, complaints I got from, you know, that I'll be sending along to DPW is patching , one at Blickens Court and Linden Street; and the other at the 3000 block of Hamm Court at Davis Street in front of the hoagie shop there. It's pretty well torn out there. Also, there's a left lane turn only sign that's down at the corner of South Main Avenue and St. Ann's Street. Also, a resident of Oram Street reached out. They were -- DPW removed trees but they didn't have enough to take -- enough room in the truck to take all the remnant s of the trees. And there's still some left. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And the resident s are just worried that they're not going to come back. So I'll be sending that along. And also, I got a complaint over the weekend . There's a storm drain that's blocked at the intersection of Forest Glen Drive and Overbrook Circle in Fawnwood that is resulted in what was describ ed to me as a river between two houses going down the hill. So I'm going to pass that along to DPW as well. Also I've gotten over the past few weeks and again today, I've gotten complaints about the railroad crossing on South Washington Avenue. So I'll be sending along a request to the railroad to try to take care of that. And I'll save the rest of my comments for agenda items. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Last week I made a motion that was approve d by all Council members present to ask the City Council to send official correspondence to the Scranton Sewer Authority to ask them to invite the Auditor General of Pennsylvania in to audit the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 sale of the Authority to Pennsylvania American Water. That was approved . That letter did go out to the Chairman of the Board. I had the opportunity to talk this afternoon to Mayor Tim Burke of Dunmore and City Councilman of Dunmore Vince Amico. Mr. Amico, the City Councilman from Dunmore explained to me that he is going to bring up the same motion that this Council did last week. So he's going to ask his colleague s to also send correspondence to the Sewer Authority asking them to invite the Auditor General in to audit the sale of the Authority to Pennsylvania American Water. I also discussed the same with the Mayor of Dunmore who is on board 100 percent with that motion and thinks it's important . And in my conversation with both of those gentlemen this afternoon similar to what I mentioned last week, we all came to the same conclusion and we have for the past two and a half years since last vote was taken by the Authority that it literally makes no sense at this point with all the questions and all of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the black cloud that I think is still hanging over the sale of the Authority to not ask the Auditor General to come in and take a look. So if everything was done above board, if everything was done correctly then why not ask him to come in and look at it. And by the way, as I mentioned last week, he is more than willing to do that which I think is important . And he's made that statement now on several occasions . We did have Solicitor Shrive in for an executive session to discuss some of the question s about the easement s. I did ask Mr. Shrive in the executive session if he was going to answer or if he did answer the question s that this Council had posed last week. His response was that he would not because he did not want to compromise the ongoing litigation . Again, I think it's important that if everything was done above board, all of these question s surrounding both the easements and everything else that went on with the Sewer Authority deal and then all of the corruption that has come to light over the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 last year, why not ask the Auditor General ? Put this thing to bed once and for all. And I think the people of this City, the people of Dunmore should put as much pressure as you can on every single board member of the Scranton Sewer Authority . Go to the next meeting . Demand that they invite the Auditor General in. The last time they blew it. They wanted -- they did not want transparency which I still cannot understand . This time we're giving them another chance to do the right thing. On the gas card issue, last week City Council had sent a letter to the Mayor, the Business Administrator , the DPW Director and the City Controller . We did receive a response to our questions from the City Controller which I would ask to be made part of the record for the next Council meeting . I won't go through the whole response from the City Controller . But basically what she is describing is the fact that at one point prior to 2011 there was a position in the office called Records Coordinator that specifically reviewed all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 expenses related to City vehicles and that position was eliminated . She did attach the job description of the Records Coordinator and she's suggest ing that the Mayor and City Council restore that position for the new City Controller . She also explain ed that her office received no information and was not aware that gas cards were used for personal usage except relating to the article in the Scranton Times with the Fire Chief Pat DeSarno . We also received a response from Mayor Evans in which he gave us -- sent us the new gas card use policy which I appreciate . He also answered several of the question s that were posed to him which I also appreciate . The Business Administrator and the DPW Director did not respond . Or the Business Administrator did respond , not to my satisfaction because he did not answer all of the questions . And the DPW Director did not respond at all. Late Friday I had the opportunity to speak to the Mayor who when I expressed my displeasure with the fact that those questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 I did not think were answered sufficiently , he told me that they will be answered this week. So I'm going to hold the Administration to that. As part of the letter, Council put in there that if the question s were not answered, we would look at using our subpoena power which we do have according to the Home Rule Charter . I still stand by my comment s last week that if we do not get the questions answered to our satisfaction that we should consider using our subpoena power. I know there's been comment s made that this happened in the past and, you know, there's nothing you could do about it. But there are in my mind outstanding question s that should be answered in writing by the department heads that were there when some of these activities went on. So if there is a sufficient explanation for some of the charges that were detailed in the investigative report by the Times, then shows should be delineated and explained in writing . As Mrs. Schumacher had noted about more transparency in Council operations , one of the things -- and I was actually going to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 a motion tonight but I didn't get a chance because the executive session ran long and I didn't get a chance to discuss it with my colleague s. But I do plan on making it next week. If you look at Third Order it says Reports and Communications from the Mayor and Heads of Departments and Interested Parties and City Clerk's notes. It's by been my belief now that any communication from the Mayor, any communication from the department heads, any interested parties that send Council anything that's relevant to City business or the agenda, any reports that we receive should be put in Third Order. So last week I made a motion, for example , to put a report that we received that I requested from Mrs. Novembrino about the overtime into Third Order. I think we should just do a one for all here instead of having to make a motion every week that we just get into the practice of when we receive something , put it on the agenda so that everyone who looks at the agenda could see it as well because often times -- and I'm guilty of this myself. We're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 talking about letters that none of you could see because it's not part of the agenda. So that should be done. As it relates to the website, Mrs. Jefferies brought up the website. And I think I could speak for all of Council who's talked about this now ad nauseam over the last few years. The website needs to be updated and changed . If you're talking about transparency and keeping people informed , it's really not the best website. It's kind of a mishmash of a lot of different things. I do think it can be done better. So hopefully that will be done. I know Mayor Evans when he was on Council was a big proponent of that. And I know he's interested in that. Whether or not that could be accomplished in the next two or three months, I don't know. But hopefully in January we could start to take another look at that. As it relates to overtime as I talked about last week and is on the agenda tonight , the City is over budget in overtime for the Police Department so far. I did ask Chief Graziano if he would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 be able to delineate and give us the difference between regular overtime and what's reimbursable to the City. I do appreciate his quick response . He said he does expect to be over budget this year due to increase department wide training which resulted in backfilled overtime shifts as well as having a high number of officers out, injured and sick. And he is going to provide the report to show what is reimbursable and what is not. Mrs. Schumacher brought up a point that I had brought up last week which is the budget. This is something that I have talked about now for the last few years. I did have a conversation with Mayor Evans on Friday about it about work sessions . I have felt as you have explained and described in your comments tonight that we get the budget on November 15th. And then it's to me, it's a rush job. The Business Administrator in the past has come. He's given a presentation . We've been limited to 30 or 45 minutes which is not enough for a budget that's a 110 or 112 million dollars . I certainly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 don't have all the information which is why last year I submitted question s in writing . Some of it which as you know were not answered . So Mayor Evans and I had a really good discussion about this year not having a caucus on a Council meeting night but having it at another point during the week where we're not constrained by a half hour or 45 minutes if we're going to sit down there around the table with the cameras on and have a discussion for as long as we need to about the budget so we're all on the same page and move forward that way which I think makes total sense. So we'll see how that pans out and how we set that up. But I would personally appreciate that because in years past I so far have not voted for a budget in the City for various reasons . But one of which is I think it's never explained to my satisfaction and we leave with questions that are unanswered . One of the things I also mentioned last week was a letter sent to the Mayor regarding recommendation s made by the Pennsylvania Economy League in our Act 47 Exit Plan. In the summer, the Pennsylvania Economy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 League came before Council with Mayor Evans. I had asked specific questions to them related to there are recommendations in the Exit Plan. Give us an update and a status on each one of those recommendation s. So PEL responded not to my satisfaction . It was one word answers which didn't give anybody any information at all. The Mayor did respond to us. I won't read through this whole thing. Hopefully we can put it on the agenda for next week. But he gave several examples , one, they have petitioned the courts to allow for the payroll tax to be implemented which is one of the things that they had to do for that to potentially go through . Their plan at this point in time is to incorporate that as part of the 2020 budget. So they're moving forward with the idea that that is going to go through . Additionally , they expect to create an OPEB Trust through a Workers ' Comp Agreement with Labor and Industry through the State of Pennsylvania . Another critical component that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 had brought up in the past is the creation of the debt policy and a fund balance policy which are recommendations that are made in the Recovery Plan. Mayor Evans explain ed that that is in process now and will be ready for review and possible Council approval sometime after the budget is submitted . If our legislative session does not allow for introduction in 2019, then it will be drafted and ready for submission by the new Mayor in 2020. Other key areas that he mentions is that they feel they could resolve or at least start the process of is in the area of refuse fee delinquencies and tax delinquencies . Tax delinquencies will be turned over to the Lackawanna County Tax Claim Bureau effective January 1, 2020. Legislation according to the Mayor will be coming on that very soon. The refuse fee delinquencies are being addressed through the RFP process that will include the ability to enact an amnesty program as well as the packaging and selling of any unpaid delinquencies after an amnesty program has been completed if the new Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 and the new Mayor choose to. And he says these are the major initiatives of the Act 47 Exit Plan that will either be completed this year or will be ready to go in January 2020. So I appreciate the response to that letter. The one other thing that I wanted to mention , last week I asked for a copy or a list of all contract s that the City is engaged in. And the reason I asked for that and Mr. Bulzoni actually jogged my memory and I brought this up before but I found it either a year or two ago very alarming that in 2014 when Bob McGoff was the Council President , all contracts in the City were sent to Council for approval . Every single contract was sent and we voted on it. That request was made by Bob McGoff. And Mayor Courtright at that time agreed to that. Mr. Bulzoni said that some delays in legislation occurred but the dissemination of information had value, which I agree because we voted on everything . Now, at some point and I cannot remember exactly when the exact date but that -- when Bob McGoff after he had left 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Council and passed away, that process had stopped and Council then was not receiving any of the contracts . The informational value that we received from voting on that had merits and I think was important . Why it stopped I don't know. You could make your own assumption s on that based on everything that has gone on. But I don't know the answer to that. Mr. Bulzoni is going to provide a list. He said the Law Office keeps a manual record of contract s and Miss Carrera had provided me with a spreadsheet that she had kept of all contracts that were submitted for approval and anything else that came into the office. So he's suggest ing that the Law Office communicate with our office so that the City Clerk might be able to incorporate those nonlegislative contracts into the spreadsheet . I would ask that -- I don't know if it's worthwhile to do it now, but whoever the new administration is; I would request immediately in January that we go back to the way that it was done in 2014. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I think transparency is a good thing. And there's less chance for any wrongdoing to occur if all contract s are put before Council . And that is all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple items. The first this was brought up last week by a speaker at our meeting and I know Mr. Spindler brought it up again. The property on Harrison Avenue and where a resident came they're having an issue with permits . I do want to thank Kathy Carrera and Tom Oleski and Mayor Evans for their quick action on this. We did send this to the Administration following our meeting . I spoke with the Mayor personal ly about it. And he -- Tom Oleski did reach out both to the contractor and to the homeowner to let them know if they could reapply for the permit so this issue can be resolved . I do agree with the sentiment that Mr. Spindler mentioned when he spoke that there are unfortunately many times too many hoops to jump through within City Government . But the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Rental Registration Waiver does need to be filled out. If you own a property and it's a rental property and you live in it, you do not have to pay the fee. But filing the waiver and submitting it into the City is just a good practice so it's on file that you are on as a waiver. But it's not somebody that just didn't pay their bill or forgot to submit the paperwork . But I am happy that this was taken care of swiftly . So I want to thank everyone who was involved . I know Councilman Gaughan mention ed this letter from Roseann Novembrino 's Office regarding the job of a Records Coordinator . Unfortunate ly every time Council or anyone asks for anything out of the Controller 's Office, the response is always the same that there have been job cuts through the years. And, yes, there have been in every department . I wish we could go back to when we had a hundred more firefighters and a hundred more police officers on the street. But that's not practical . Unfortunately every single request that we put in has a reply that this job was cut or this salary was cut. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 And unfortunately it seems the City gets very little out of the Controller 's Office current ly. So I hope that that will be changing next year. But I would encourage Mayor Evans not to create additional positions to utilize that office in a better manner. We have technology now that we didn't have 30, 40 years ago for this type of paperwork . It shouldn 't be that difficult . So I would strongly urge him not to go putting in additional positions into that office that aren't warranted . And finally , I just want to mention on a bit of a somber note. I did mention this at the top of the meeting . Unfortunately we did have a tragedy in the City in the past week where a young individual lost his life. But it was not for the fault of anyone within our City. We have great City employees . Our City firefighters do a tremendous job. I know they don't hear this enough. All of our City employees that were active during that incident , our police, our fire especial ly, even our DPW. I know one member of the DPW had to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 clear a catch basin because of all the water coming down and went in the catch basin with -- got soaked. It wasn't a pleasant day that day either. So I want to thank everyone for all of their efforts and our thought s and prayers are with the family of the victim. That's all. Thank you. ATTY.

DONAHUE : Yes, on the question . This is an actually very interesting project that's being taken up in what's describe d as a food desert where -- an area where there's, you know, you're not -- fresh fruits and vegetables aren't readily available . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 So I just want to read a part of this project outline . This project will enhance the Cedar Avenue community and the surrounding area which is home to diverse urban mix of recent industrious immigrants as well as longtime residents through the development and sustainment of a community garden park in a densely populate d area currently designated as a food desert. Garden plots will be provide d for resident s of the Cedar Avenue community will be encourage d to showcase culturally significant vegetables and fruits. In addition , a specific plot will be allocated to Lackawanna College for cultivation of crops beneficial to the culinary degree program offered by the college . I also believe this is a good example of, you know, I know we go after nonprofits a lot. But this is a good example of nonprofits all coming together and taking up specific things within a project . For example , every local college and university will be involved in the Garden Cedar Project . Johnson College student s, faculty and administration have been involved in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 architect ural design. Penn State Scranton and Penn State Extension will be involved in planting design and onsite education programs . A garden plot will be allocated to Lackawanna College for vegetables and fruit for the college 's culinary program . Marywood University School of Architectural Design will assist with the visual design of the garden structures . Keystone College will assist in seeking funding through corporate grants and donations and an alignment will be made with the University of Scranton 's community garden as well as the University 's entrepreneur al programs .

This one is extremely important because I think if they don't get this grant money, the building could potentially close. They're looking for money to fix hoist mechanisms in the elevators that due to the age I think it's 90 years old and unavailability of some of the parts, if one of the two elevators goes down, they're not going to be -- they will probably be inoperable . So I hope that they will get this grant. I think there's so many great programs that go on at the Scranton Cultural Center. And I fully support this local share account application . MR.

Just interesting to note I also support this grant application . But in the backup it says that due to the significant increase in residential housing in the downtown area including those occupied by the University of Scranton students , an increase in security provisions associated with those garages is a priority . One of the interesting statistic s that is mention ed in this backup is that throughout the United States, parking facilities are the third most frequent place in which violent crime happens with nearly 1400 attacks occurring each day. I think ABM has made a lot of progress in upgrading our parking facilities and also NDC. I think this is just another step in the right direction to make sure that while they're upgraded they're also safe. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (“DCED”) FOR A LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT GRANT (GAMING FUNDS-MONROE COUNTY) IN THE AMOUNT OF $75,000.00 FOR THE PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION OF A NEW LINER (MEMBRANE ) FOR THE POOL AT THE NAY AUG PARK SWIM COMPLEX . MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I believe this is, you know, I'm fully in support of this application . This would actually be a perfect candidate for a Community Development Block Grant. But because of the strict 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 requirements in the Community Development Block Grant Program it doesn't qualify because it's not considered in a low to moderate income area even though it services a lot of low to moderate income families . So I'm fully in support of this application . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I think that Nay Aug Park is so important to the City of Scranton for so many different reasons . Number one, it is literally a staple of our community . I actually happen to think that the Recreation Authority is doing a really great job up at Nay Aug Park. If you actually go up there and walk around they made several improvements already . And a lot of it is done by their own volunteer work, you know, a lot of the board members themselves are up there many hours of the day doing different things. I know over the last few months they made several improvements . One of the things that I think is important and I know some people are upset about it but I think big picture wise it's the right move is filling in the big pool and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 replacing it eventually with a splash pad. And again, I know some people are upset about that. But if you look at the world that we live in today, look at the splash pads that are in our region. And as somebody with small kids, I will take my children to the one up in Clarks Summit. I'll take them to the one in Dunmore . It's safe. It's easy to get at. And I think it just brings more families into the fold, not that the big pool at one time wasn't really popular even up until a few years ago. I just think the maintenance cost of it, the constant issues that we've had with it, it's time to move now in a different direction . And I think splash pad is the way to go if they could find the grant funding for it and get that up and running . I applaud the Administration and the Recreation Authority for I think moving in the right direction and recognizing once again that Nay Aug Park is one of the great assets that we have in the City. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ?

I want to thank all the members including Miss Hodowanitz who's here tonight for all the work that they have done so far. Again, as I said months ago when we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 passed this legislation revamping the Ethics Board, this is another step in the right direction . It's not going to solve all of the problems . But I do think that having another level of oversight which we did have in the past but was never utilized and I don't think was taken seriously . This board now gives me hope that these measures -- new measures will be implement ed and people are finally taking ethics seriously in the City. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Just to add to that, Joan had mentioned that their next meeting will be next week. So if all goes as planned , you will have a full complement for your board members for your next meeting .

GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . This is a very important application . And I support it a hundred percent . I hope that we do get the funds from the State of Pennsylvania . The sufficiency rating on this bridge out of 100 is 15.5. So that just gives you the idea of the immediacy of the fact that we have to replace this bridge.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 The bridge was built in 1958. My only question is if the City gets the grant according to this legislation , we have to provide a 30 percent match which comes out to $475,800. So I would like, Miss Carrera , if we could ask Mr. Bulzoni unless I missed it, I didn't see it in the backup where -- what the plan is to meet that financial commitment . That is an awful lot of money. And then according to the backup, this project if everything goes as expected and we get the grant funding , it's to begin next year and be completed in 2020.
