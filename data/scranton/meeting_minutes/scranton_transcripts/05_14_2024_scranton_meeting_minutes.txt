And it's a five hour event. It's $12, and children under 12 will be $6, beautiful place up there. I've been there. It's really nice. And then secondly, I have announcement , meet us on the mountain for our annual brunch. This is benefitting the Deutsch Institute honoring Sean McHale. It's Sunday, May 19 from 10 to 1 at the Waldorf Park Social Club. All proceed s will benefit the Robinson Park revitalization . The brunch is $30. And that's all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have another one. The Northeast Pennsylvania Armed Forces Day Parade will be held on May 18th, 2024 downtown Scranton beginning at 12 at the Gino Merli Veterans Center located at 401 Penn Avenue. That would be this Saturday . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? All right. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : John Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I would like to ask if you would put that PFM document that you had during the caucus in Third Order for next week? MR. SMURL: Yes, we will. MS. HODOWANITZ : That's great that we're down to a 3.27 interest rate. So that's very good news. With regard to the union contracts , I heard Eileen Cipriani 's comments about 26 years of document s that were never retyped into a document . That's fine and well. When you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 inherit someone else's mess, you know, you understand that it's going to take time and effort to clean up the mess. What I have objected to all along was not getting any answers . So, Mr. Smurl, thank you for your assistance in getting some information on this. Nevertheless , you need to understand that police and fire constitute 62 percent of the city's employees . And personnel costs are the single largest item in the operational budget. So things like having a publically disclosed collective bargaining agreement , they are important . They're important not only to taxpayers , they're important to the individual s who depend on them, namely, the police and firefighters . By the way, I was trying to check something in the Nonuniform Clerical Union Collective Bargaining Agreement and I went on their website . Guess what, the union contract on the website expired December 31st, 2023. I talked to Matt Domines . And he says it's currently being negotiated . So of the five unions, the only two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that are current are DPW and the Single Tax Office. The Clerical Union, police and fire, they're in progress -- works in progress , okay. Keep that in mind because , you know, you're going to turn around twice and you start working on the budget for next year. And you need to know things like, you know, what do the union contracts call for in terms of salaries and wages and other benefits . And hopefully we'll have the clerical union contract wrapped up and publically available by then. Spoke briefly with Tom before the meeting began. I understand he's not received any apology from the city from the way he was treated . That's a shame. Reflects badly on the administration . The other question is, has the administration identified the personnel whose records that were put at risk? I understand that perhaps Tom and the policeman were the only two people who saw those documents , but we can't be sure of that. And the city has an obligation , a fiduciary responsibility to those people to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 identify them, contact them, and if it turns out that anyone other than Tom and the policeman had access to those records , you need to provide them some protective cover. And God forbid that they let that drop through the cracks. That could come back to bite them in their little heinies; and, well, it should if that happens. MR. SMURL: Joan, I was told our insurance carrier , they had contacted them. And they have given them a procedure to follow. MS. HODOWANITZ : They better be doing that. MR. SMURL: I don't know if they have, but I will ask. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I'm just saying they had better be doing that. That is not something to drop. I am though going to compliment the city on one item. And that's Item 5-B on your agenda tonight . That's the Cleanup the Code ordinance . I read through that thing and I laughed so hard I almost wet my pants. A lot of the stuff that dates back to the 1800s and 1906, I think it's a good thing that somebody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 took the time and effort to, you know, update those -- all of that nonsense and get it out of the code. The next thing that needs to be updated, the Home Rule Charter . There's a whole lot of stuff in that document that's obsolete or impractical . For example , remember your annual audit? That's due on May 31st, not September 30th. That's something that needs to be adjusted and changed. It's only one item in a number of items that need to be adopted . Oh, by the way, it was great the mics you had for the caucus, you could hear everything you were saying. That was great. And I wish everybody a happy Armed Forces Day Parade. I'll see you at high noon on Saturday . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. On the charter , that's when ECTV locked me out of the station because I was talking about revising the charter and rewriting it. So, you know, I think the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 residents need to understand that we just have a terrible government . And we have a Mayor that is bringing illegals here. And we have a Council that has just refused to do its job for a very long time. But, you know, I want to share with the city that I had a status conference today with District Justice Farrell with -- over the quality of life ordinance that the city, these corrupt public officials have created . And the city withdrew . But it's not really possible for the city to withdraw because this is an issue that's in the Court of Common Pleas which is a step over the District Court. The city had the ticket and decided like the city's Law Department said to me that they could do whatever they wanted with the ticket even though it was on the appeal in the Court of Common Pleas because they could. And then when they found out that I named the five Council members in my subpoena and the department heads and I brought people in that could give testimony on the public corruption here because I was going to pierce your immunity and sue you each as individuals .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And that's my hope in the future. I hope to get a hearing in either Federal Court or in a court where you could be held accountable for the legislation you've passed because it offers the residents not one drop of protection when an inspector comes out and writes a ticket. And the city, well, they did withdraw . And when I -- and I've got this in a transcript so I think the district justice is a little twisted up and bent because when I told her the actions that had taken place previously , she didn't know what to do. She needs to be removed because what she was trying to do was give cover to the city just like District Justice Corbett did and just like the District Justice in Dickson City did. What we've done in this city is, we've created a very corrupt government that's been run by Democrats over an extended period of time. And they roughshod over the residents by bribing neighborhood groups with grant money and utter silliness as the city continues to lose its population . And then, of course, we have some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 City Council members who say that they aren't corrupt . Well, I can't understand how a city can collect 1.6 million dollars in a franchise fee and not have a public access channel . And then when you read the legislation that led to the creation of public access channel s, they were to give the residents in these towns and cities a voice over the top of the politician s -- that's you, in our communities . And when you look at the population decline from 140,000 people down to 75 and you have Council members who take down water slides to get appoint ed to a public seat, in my opinion , it's just terrible . And then the Council coming up with the money to do such and stealing assets, not just from the community but the children in the community . That's what happened in this city. And it's gone on for a long time. And you know, to switch gears a little bit, you know, during the World War II there were such things as capos. They were Jews that were lining people into the ovens and killing them during the second World War in the concentration camps. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Now, we've got a President of the United States who is withholding weapons from the Israelis that are trying to free the Palestinians from terrorists . We've had a country that was in -- that had its space violated and tons of its citizens murdered . You know, it's time to realize that this President that's in the White House is out of his mind and world leaders are calling him out. I just wonder will the people ever really realize what collective stupidity is and if it's not time for a change in our country in leadership . There's time for a change in leadership of this city and it should happen in the next election . But I can't seem to get the Republicans to form a city committee and flush the toilet in this building . But I hope they do. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Roger Leonard . MR. LEONARD : Good evening , Council , Roger Leonard , 23 year employee City of Scranton DPW, President of Local 2305. I'm coming back here to have a conversation about the blight grounds keeper mediation bids that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 were suppose d to go up at the DPW. I have a little information that I want to share that I actually spoke to management . And we agreed upon with one of the managers , we agreed upon a -- that the bid as it should be posted and that we couldn't say yes to. So I went up to HR. And I want to ask you guys. I know that, Councilman McAndrew , you asked City Hall to get back to you, the administration . Have they spoken anything about this? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I asked for the rational e for placing them in the different union. And the only response I got was the clerical contract is current ly in negotiations . My question wasn't regarding the clerical contract obviously . So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you clarify and resend my question , the rational e may they provide that to us why they would put these grounds keeper positions in a clerical union versus a union that already does that type of work? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. LEONARD : I just want to state here again that current ly we do have groundskeepers in the Parks Department . And we do blighted properties in the city with the Highway Department . So it's a little different when they are combining them and doing what they had to do. So it was a little challenging to try to make it fit as far as how the job description had to go. So we did come to an agreement on that. We're hoping that it could go up soon. We know that the city needs these blight positions to get done. We know that there's blight all over the city. And we really want to get to it as soon as possible . So I'm hoping that is something that could be done. On another note, I do want to say regarding the Clerical Union, without the Clerical Union the city cannot run. They are extremely important to the city. They are extremely important to us, their union brother s and sisters . And if I made light of anything that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 they do, that wasn't my intention . My intention was to show the difference of the work they do compare d to us. It's kind of like telling a payroll clerk or somebody like that that they have to be able to lift 50 to 100 pounds repeatedly . It shouldn 't be in their job descriptions . That shouldn 't be part of clerical . So I just want to make that distinction that I'm not saying that clerical is less or more important than anybody else in the city. I'm just saying that they do completely different jobs. We do want to do these jobs. We care about the city. We live in the city. We want to see these places cleaned up. We want these positions . But I wanted to make sure that these bids were right and that there wasn't ways around to hurt our employees . So I'm hoping that this comes to an end. I'm hoping that these blight bids go up as soon as possible here and we could get out to clean the streets up. Thank you, Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Leonard . Ron Ellman. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. ELLMAN: Hello, good people. First off, I'd like to thank Mr. Donahue and Mr. Flynn for their support against the higher -- another increase in taxes. All right. Next, I usually shy away from federal issues. But we cannot allow -- I'm trying not to use any hurtful conversation and get everybody mad at me. But we can't allow this moronic segment of our society fueled by all these radical s that are -- like George Soros Foundation and Bill Gates of all people supporting this chaos on the streets , the Rockefeller Foundation , celebrities in Hollywood , these people are destroying our country . Whoever experienced what's going on now in this country , it's a disgrace to all the taxpayers and working people. Then we have these psychotic letters to the newspaper one after another in support of Hamas and the Gazian support Hamas and things have turned around. Now they're the victims . Even Hamas -- people feel sorry for Hamas. It's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 murderous group like that. That's what this world is coming -- that's what this country has come to with I guess the younger segment . And when I was in California , I hung around with some misfits , I'll tell you, my age. But never, never in my life have I seen and heard what's going on in the past 8 or 10 years. You know the White House brought over thousands from Afghanistan . They're in a town Dearborn , Michigan , part of Detroit like where Dickson City is to Scranton . On television , those people on the rooftops shouting death to America , death to Israel, death to Jews, burn our flag. That's the thanks they get for bringing them over here. And that town has a real high unemployment rate that taxpayers are paying for. I guess the President believes that trusting him and everything will be all right and he'll carry us off to the moon, maybe. I don't know. To change the subject a little bit, I was wondering if there's so many pets out there that -- and so many people abandoning them because they can't care for them, couldn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 some of this grant money be spent with Johnson Tech on the veterinarian program ? I once phoned them and they said no. That's why the kennels are being full. Cats are on the street. It's because of the expense . I don't mean this as a braggart . My dog got a -- little French bulldog got an ear infection . It cost me $3,400 at the Old Forge clinic. We took the collar off of him today. That was to save him. What if that animal belonged to one of these people that you see standing there asking for donation s and it would have died painfully . We had a baby kitten from the backyard . Rose brought it in and it was $1,300 just a couple months ago. I can't afford this. I haven't paid my house taxes yet. I'm just saying, can't some kind of program with all of this money that's wasted like the walkability deal and so forth, couldn't something be worked with Johnson Tech because I certainly support them. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Bev DeBarros . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MS. DEBARROS : It's good to be here among friends. I'm Bev DeBarros , citizen of Scranton and also of the county, of course. And I have come in the past from time to time. I'm a volunteer at our county jail. And I either ask for help or tell you how things are going there. As I often say, even though the jail is for the whole county, it's located within our city right on the same street, Washington Avenue. And I feel as a citizen concern and responsibility for how things go there. So one issue that I would like to bring before you in case anybody agrees with me that they would maybe add their voice. Tomorrow is the prison board meeting at 12:30 on the 5th floor of the county office building . And you could speak there if you want to or come and listen to what the other speakers have to say. There are a lot of issues, for instance , that we don't have GED there. The medical care, you'll hear speakers talk about that, a lot of issues. But the one I'm here today the -- for about the recreation for the inmates. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I'm -- Center City Printing made this poster for me that I don't know -- to help because it's hard to imagine what I'm going to say. This is an aerial view of our jail. Here's Washington Avenue. Here's the old prison. And, of course, these are the tops of the buildings . These four triangles is what I'm going to talk about. These -- it's hard to tell from this, but they're really on the ground floor. They are triangles made up of the sides of the buildings that are brought together in that configuration about the size of your platform there. It would be one side of the triangle and then the two other sides would come in. Now, it's hard to imagine that there are about 800 inmates in there who -- for recreation . In the winter they could go in the gym, not much to do in there. But we'll be -- we ask yoga classes or something like that. But anyway, back to the outdoor recreation . Outdoor recreation consists of going into one of these four yards with the cement floor and these three sides of the building . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 have in February of the Commissioner 's meeting -- the Prison Board meeting I should say, I asked that we put benches in there so that people don't have to stand or sit on cement during their fresh air time. At the same time at that meeting the administration asked for two, like, pull-up bars and like that exercise equipment like that one big piece in two of the yards and that costs $5,000. And what I'm asking I don't even think costs that. But in any case, it's the commissary fund that pays for it, not the county. That's the proceeds from what people buy in the commissary . So I asked for these benches to be made of recycled material s and have backs on them so people could sit down, you know, when they're there. Okay, so in five minutes the exercise thing was passed. And when I asked for the benches they said, oh, we'll talk about it next month. That was in February . And I brought it up and brought it up. So now here we are May. And I still think it's a worthy ask and anybody that could support this, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 would appreciate it. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mrs. DeBarros . I did contact the deputy -- I'm sorry, not the deputy -- Mr. McAndrew -- Sheriff McAndrew and had asked him about that when you sent us the e-mail. And they are aware of it. He said that would have to go through the board. They naturally have to research to make sure these benches and stuff were okay, you know, to use that type of product . But they are aware of it. And he said that would be up to the board and the warden. But they are aware of it. He said they didn't forget about it. MS. DEBARROS : I know they're aware of it. But I want the benches in there. MR. SMURL: Okay, well, I did what I can. MS. DEBARROS : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Rik Little. MR. LITTLE: Hi. I'm Rik Little from Scranton . And there's too much bureaucracy . It's too confusing, hard to figure out where to go to even start. So I'd 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 like to -- God bless the library system in Scranton and that goes across Pennsylvania . It's the -- I would be dead without the library since I moved here. You know, there's a technological boom and especially after Covid with the phones and everything . People after Covid, they want to keep it going on Covid and all of these bureaucracies and they depend on the phone. And I think it's a sort of an abusive system. It's not a quality that you expect everybody to keep up with the technology of the phone. And I see lawyers , you know, doing mischief with it. I see every agency doing mischief with it because there's a lot of people that just want to keep Covid going. And today, this brochure at the library , Let's Save Scranton , I mean, it was very curious to me -- I'm wondering if you know a difference between -- it talks about lead poisoning and what you could do about it. But it seems to all be based on, you know, calling some authority , you know, like OSHA sort of authority to come in and fine somebody . You know, we've known about lead 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 paint sense my childhood . It's the water that's bad. And you argue about, you know, changing water companies and, you know, you got to buy the pipes from Scranton . You got to make everything local, local. That's how things will grow. And I'm wondering -- I have a question for you. There's an Office of Community Development and all three of these things are in this program . The city -- the Scranton City Planning Commission and the Scranton Redevelopment Authority . Is this the same agency, these three agencies ? MR. SMURL: No, they are three different . MR. LITTLE: Well, they sound like they do the same thing, you know, and it's really frustrating trying to, you know, find these agencies , talk to these agencies especially when they are doing stuff through the phone and e-mails and stuff. And it's just -- it's not fair. And the biggest problem , the two main agencies , you know, in my mind is the SHA and the housing agency and the Health and Human 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Services Agency. And that is where most of the federal money comes into the area. But it doesn't go to the people in the area, I could tell you that. And the media and justice s are the two biggest problems . And I fully support what Lee Morgan was saying. There's not enough information out there. And there should be more so people could get involved in the process , especially since Scranton has become a sanctuary city. We're flying in the through the Avoca Airport and Scranton through Health and Human Services somehow has to support them through the Catholic charities or whatever . When I was a little kid, my father always -- I built all the electronic stuff. And you have a circuit board. And you could look at the circuit board. You see where it goes and it was like a plan. It was like a constitution . It wasn't like an on-off switch to me. It was a radio. We built a radio. We built a hi fly. We built the walkie-talkies , everything , you know, since I could hold the soldering iron. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 And that was a great lesson. But you can't look at the circuit board of how this Scranton government goes to the county government because there's all these agencies . You don't know what they do. And they have the Courts involved. And the Courts -- there has to be a reset in the courts. People have to take notice of details and notice of the rulings that certain judges make. And that's why in this upcoming election , you know, in the national election , the most of important thing for Trump is not the Vice President . It's the Attorney General because what we're seeing across the board from top to bottom is this lawfare going on from -- and using the Courts and noticing the patterns and the details and doing your own research . And buy clearly filtered water because that is the only filter that gets rid of the fluoride , arsenic , chlorine . And the stores they send you to through the government is Wal-Mart where all they have is coal -- charcoal filters . And that will make you sick. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. SMURL: That's all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council -- I'm sorry, Laura Augustini . MS. AUGUSTINI : Laura Augustini from Green Ridge. I'm actually here because I'm disappointed . I was last here about a month ago with regards to an ordinance to turn Deacon Street into a two-way street. And we requested that there be additional stop signs put on Sanderson . I'm told -- and I realize d last week that the resolution was passed without the additional stop signs. And I assume that it was because of the traffic study that was done or supposed to be done to accommodate those additional stop signs. All of you have my e-mail. And if you don't, Mr. Voldenberg does or you have the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association e-mail. I didn't receive any comment or any communication with regards to the request that we made. I watched the video of last week's Council meeting . And there was no comment with regards to why you were voting yes to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 resolution as it stood. Every single one of you said that you were in favor of the four-way stop. And I understand if the traffic study came back negative . But I would have appreciated some kind of a heads up. I'm e-mailing Mr. Voldenberg on a regular basis to find out what's happening on a couple different items. I didn't get anything from him. I was told that it was going to be done at the -- that the traffic study had come in and you were going to review it. Traffic study wasn't attached to anything . I didn't see anything where I could get it to find out what was going on. And I have a lot going on in my life. So being here every single week isn't something that's possible . And I didn't think that I needed to do that because you all know who I am. You know where we -- where I live. You know how to get in touch with me. But I guarantee you that come election time, every single one of you will be in touch with the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . So can I ask what happened ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. SMURL: The study came back and the recommendation from the traffic study was to install no parking signs, okay. And it gave the places and the reasoning why. And then it also went onto say that if we weren't satisfied with the -- whatever came out of that if there were still problems , then the final solution would be four-way stop signs. We did not remove that. All we did was go on their recommendation , move the street forward instead of holding it up anymore . And then if we feel that we should go with the no parking signs, that would be the first approach . MS. AUGUSTINI : No parking signs where? MR. SMURL: I will give that. It's -- there was a lot of information on it -- MR. KING: I believe the no parking was on Deacon next to Mickey Gannons . And the recommendation was to not -- they didn't recommend four stop signs. Otherwise , you know, we -- we held it off to wait for the recommendation . And if they recommended four stop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 signs I would have voted for the resolution with the four stop signs. They didn't recommend that. However , what they did say is that the resolution going through they recommended just some no parking , you know, near the corners for safety and that should over time, over the next few weeks or months if it's determined that there are issues that would result in maybe four stop signs would be required that we could possibly revisit it. So that's kind of what we got. We had discuss ed it during caucus. And then that's probably why there was no comment because it was discuss ed at the public comment -- or public caucus and then we voted on it. I apologize for that. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so a lot of the discussion happened prior to last week. That's why there was none last week. Mr. Voldenberg , can we get Miss Augustini a copy of the traffic study? MR. VOLDENBERG : I asked for a copy of the actual traffic study, but what they did in this case is they sent it in an e-mail format and they copied in all the pertinent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 parties . ATTY. GILBRIDE : I could enlighten Miss Augustini if you'd like as to what the recommendation was. I have the language -- MR. SCHUSTER : That would be great. MR. MCANDREW : So, Laura, I know you watch the meeting but caucus wasn't taped. During caucus, I mean, I was in favor also of the four stop signs on the behalf of the residents that wanted them. We should listen to resident s. So the traffic study came back and what they pretty much said is, you know, of course, we would like to follow the city engineers with their recommendation s. But the reason why I voted because the caveat being if -- and we talked about it in caucus if this doesn't pan out for you guys -- and I said you'd be the first to tell us. So I'm taking the lead on that and following that lead, but with the idea that after this is completed , you come back to us and say, hey, Mark, we really do need the four signs even though the city engineer doesn't think so. But I thought this would just maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 eventually work itself out. That's a discussion we had. MR. SMURL: We do not have to go back to another traffic study. MR. MCANDREW : Just amend, yeah. MR. SMURL: We just have to amend it. They did give permission at the end that if we felt it necessary after the signs, then we could order the four-way stop signs put in. So that's the course we took. MS. AUGUSTINI : Right. So how was I suppose to find that out if I didn't come here tonight ? MR. SMURL: Well, it's difficult . We all just don't deal with one item each week. There are many items. And I apologize I didn't, but, you know, there's a lot of things to do. MS. AUGUSTINI : I understand you have a lot of things on your plate. MR. SMURL: My goal was to move it forward so the street could be changed to a two way. That sat tabled very long. MS. AUGUSTINI : It was a month. MR. SMURL: The whole goal was to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 move forward , okay? MS. AUGUSTINI : And my beef isn't with the resolution . My beef is with the fact that no one told me. And I wouldn't have known any of what was discussed unless I came here. And I work a full-time job. I'm president of a couple of different organizations . So coming to the caucus and coming to Council every single week is just not possible for me. And I tried -- and as I said, I watched the Council meeting . But caucus isn't taped, so there was no way that I would have known that except for me to come here. And that's what my beef is. And if there's a different way for me to find things out, if there's another avenue that I should take, then please enlighten me and let me know because I'm all about communication . That's been -- that's what I do. It's part of how I treat my employees . It's part of how I treat my family. It's all about two-way communication . MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. MS. AUGUSTINI: And that's my issue. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . You know, I read a lot of things on the county jail. And there's a lot of room for improvement . Those guys aren't allowed to have books. And it's just kind of ridiculous . I mean, if it's a serious crime they deserve to be punished for it. And a lot of times there's so many crimes being committed that the county jail becomes a housing for more serious crimes. But there's a lot of things that are really disturbing . So maybe you should consider sending a letter over to the county commission and try and get some help for those people. I mean, you know, if they're just treated brutally when they get inside and fed lousy food and everything else, there is in -- you know, they might come out with more of an attitude of revenge instead of rehabilitation . And, okay, utility bills, well, my transportation cost or delivery costs are equal once again to my -- on the gas. They are roughly equal. And I'm going to be studying it over the summer. But it looks like once again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 we've been had. I got a bunch of package s from PUC and, I'm sorry, but when people get a three or four or five percent increase , they shouldn 't be confronted with everybody raising the rates 20 and 30 percent over one year. That includes taxes. You know, I kept hearing years back that 5 percent a year with property tax. Well, you know, the average Social Security recipient might get 3 percent . And so add it up over the years and you have somebody losing their home to some landlord scooping it up for income property . And they don't do much with it. They just milk it and charge $1,200 a month. Okay, back on my last three weeks raising alarm on pregnancy care. Now, the reason that the states -- women in these states are being turned away is because of the fear. A lot of these laws state, okay, if it's a miscarriage or something to do with the mother's health, it's proper to perform a final abortion . It's not going to survive anyway, the baby. And what happens is they're afraid of some zealot DA twisting things around into, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 oh, well, this was a convince abortion . They just said this. And they have to go out and sit in their car with the windows up and mimic growing a fever and sepsis or go through all types of things. And sometime s they even wind up in critical medical care because they were left so long. And it's a classic combination of 501C3s and C4s. They are tax exempt. They are tax exempt. They could do wonderful things. I mean, a hospital might be a 501C3 or, you know, a ministry that hands out a food bank, things like that. And they're all good things. But some of them are just more obsessed with ruling over people and lording over people and telling them how to live. Now, when they kicked Planned Parenthood out of Scranton , I mean, there is not anything that Planned Parenthood was passing out that wasn't abort efficient . And that's all there is to it. So they are actually -- they're bearing false witness against their neighbor . And also we don't need 501C3s and C4s deciding how much taxes we have to dump into a spew box downtown. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Attorney Gilbride , did you say you were going to prepare an answer for Laura Augustini from the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association on the information we received on the study? ATTY. GILBRIDE : I was prepare d to read it to her but she left the meeting early. MR. SMURL: Can you prepare a letter and have Mr. Voldenberg forward it? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Okay. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . Good evening , Council . This week is National Police Week. God bless and protect our police officer heros for protect ing us from what we fear. Today I received a call from a close friend about a tag on an elderly family member's property . We're all familiar with the flooding of September , 2023 in Keyser Valley, the loss and devastation some residents are still experiencing . Their homes were destroyed and properties were condemned . Some lost everything . Just when you think it can't get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 any worse, today at 10:55 comes Code Enforcement inspector number 14 with bright lime green tags posting several condemned properties in the 100 and 200 of South Merrifield Avenue giving them three days to address high grass, weeds, and plant growth. Can we agree there are more worse properties in the city that Code Enforcement could have been tagging? When leaving a tag on a condemned property that's inhabitable to live in, who do you think would be complying ? This tag was noticed due to a relative driving by. Will these Scranton resident s ever get any relief or help from the City of Scranton ? To add insult to injury, after talking with one neighbor who has an affected property , he says he has been trying for four weeks calling and leaving message s for a person named Morgan, last initial "F" looking for help, guidance , and a return call. Morgan just so happens to be the point person for the city in regards to purchasing these properties . Residents who must wait for weeks and not have a phone call returned is unacceptable from city government . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 You Council members allow it to happen to you on a weekly basis from this administration . That does not mean city residents should have to accept that treatment . We pay taxes and we deserve better. Another issue is regarding the entry level examination for police officers , patrolmen for the Scranton Police Department . Over the last year the City of Scranton switched from LEAB, which is the Law Enforcement Aptitude Battery testing that most police department s in the county including Pennsylvania use to a third party, National Testing Network, NTN, which is out of the state of Washington . Does anybody know if there was a reason for the change of testing that we are aware of? Was that testing put out for bid? Has the amount of test takers increased since the new testing was in place? Can we get an accounting of failed and passed candidate s since the change in testing ? Has the city made more test fees from the LEAB, which is Law Enforcement Aptitude Battery versus NTN, which is the National Testing Network ? Is there a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 difference in applicant s taking tests from LEAB versus NTN? The new test is open for two months. Anyone who fails this test cannot retake this test -- the cycle due to the test is only given for two months and you could take the test after two months. The applicant must wait until another test is given. And God knows when that test is going to be given. So my question is, are we better with the NTN, National Testing Network than we were with the LEAB Law Enforcement Aptitude Battery test that is used by the Pennsylvania State Police? Any info on this matter would be greatly appreciated . And one other thing while I have a few minutes . School is almost out. Is there any development on the curfew law? And is anybody working on that and do we find that as an important tool to keep the youth off the street? Thank you, Council . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , could we reach out to the administration and see if there's been an increase in applicants or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 officer s that are ready for duty that are coming out of that test if we could get a comparison possibly with the LEAB compared to the NTN? MR. VOLDENBERG : I made note of all Mr. Argenta 's question s and I'll ask them tomorrow . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. MR. MANCINI : Ready for me? MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Are you ready? Tonight we're going to talk about quite a few things, a few things that have gone through Council here, 57 applicants that have lost their jobs for whatever reason. Most of these people were from out of town, right, now two of you on Council have been against out-of-town hires, right? Now here we are again with the administration looking for help, right? Where is the help? It comes from out of town. We're talking about a city engineer from out of town, talking about a four-way stop 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 sign for an intersection that he probably never even travelled through . And where is the common understanding of making a good decision when you are out of town? Our city administrator is from out of town. Our DPW Director -- so-called DPW Director if you want to call it that is out of town. We have out-of-town people making out-of-town decisions , you have out-of-town problems . To turn central Scranton -- downtown Scranton into four-way stop signs might work somewhere else. But it's not going to work here. What else isn't going to work here is the corruption . I'm sick of the corruption . I've asked about the sale of the Sewer Authority for months. Part of those documents included a 2 percent increase per year for 10 years with the water mitigation . But yet, it's much higher than that. So I took it upon myself to file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB. I also filed one on behalf of all the employees from the five unions from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 City of Scranton regarding the breach of documents , personal and private , privileged information . I'm done with the corruption . I'm done with the disrespect . I'm done with the nonsense . I'm done with a chain out front deterring people from not coming into this building . There was 140,000 people in the City of Scranton . We never had doors to stop them. We never had a phone to pick and choose who the Mayor and her stuck on stupid administration wants to talk to. I'm done with the box for the right to knows where it says you don't have enough time to work on it -- sick of it. You know, we're going to do better. We have to do better because , you know, when the Mayor simply ignores the things that are very important to us like our roads, like our safety, it's gone beyond the good taste and reason both. It's not going to be tolerated . You know what else? This is something very near and dear to me. Hometown Heros. My son is one of them. Did you know that in Green Ridge they're not going to have their Hometown Heros up in time for Memorial Day? How about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 that? How about the flags that are flying all across Main Avenue, well, the lack of them or whatever 's left of them torn, tattered in the middle of the streets . It's disgusting . You know, these cars that we have for these city inspectors , God forbid if one of them hits a pothole . We have one of the most fragile city inspectors Mike Gowarty . Imagine if he chipped a tooth. How long is he going to out on disability ? My God, this is horrible . You know, I had to talk about the Christmas lights until Wednesday before St. Patrick 's Day for them to be taken down. Oh, by the way, for the Sewer Authority , here what's I did. I filed a complaint with the State Supreme Court Disciplinary Board. The Law Department , anybody that has a law degree and everybody that got paid, I'm done with the corruption -- sick of it. We're going to do better. The city is going to be better. And we're going to give the city back to the people of Scranton where it belongs . Find somewhere else because you don't belong here. Good evening , City Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. SMURL: Mr. Mancini, please don't strike the podium. Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . Mr. Voldenberg , can we send Code Enforcement to 632-634 Harrison Avenue? I know they were there on May 6th. But we just receive d an e-mail from a resident with concerns there of high grass and as mentioned earlier , feral cats if we could get that checked out. Also, a citizen reached out to me concerning Crowley Park in Green Ridge, speeders possibly running stop signs and some possible drug activity over in the early evening at Crowley Park if we could have the police look into that or if the police could maybe plant a car around the corner near that final stop sign before you get to Crowley Park. It sounds like some people are flying through that. It's very dangerous in that neighborhood . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Also, the benches at the prison, I know the one concern -- I don't know much about the benches at the prison. This is the first I was hearing about it. The only thing that I would hope is that the benches would actually be mounted , like, not loose benches because that I could see where that could be an issue. But other than that if they were properly mounted , I don't see why we wouldn't want to see that happen. So and finally , some people reached out over on the East Mountain Facebook page concerning the trees that have been eliminated . Some of the trees have been eliminat ed at Robinson Park as part of that upgrade . When we had the opportunity to meet, I know the President and Vice President of East Mountain Residents Association were there. I was there and several other residents to hear from Tom McLane. And they showed the plans for all the work that's being done. If you recall last week we approved Chilewski -- the ones that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 just did Oakmont Park. They started their work on Robinson Park and some trees did, in fact, come down as part of that. And it was indicated at the meeting that that was going to happen. I believe that they worked through Tony Santoli or the tree inspector and I believe that that was all approved through our Tony Santoli . But I think once that park is completed , people are going to be very pleased with the results , granted, you know, a few trees that have to be removed as a result. But I think you're going to see a beautiful -- a beautiful park once it's all completed . And believe me, there is going to be plenty of trees on that property and beautiful trails and new playground equipment for children , a new basketball court all paved. And there is even going to be a handicap ramp that will go out into Mountain Lake so that the handicap can go out onto a little dock. So I'm expecting that project to progress pretty quickly this summer. And that's all I have at this time. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. Mr. Voldenberg , we got an e-mail about a crushed culvert at Jackson Street and South Sherman if we could send that over to who's responsible for that. I know that some of that area is going to be paved. So it might be part of that. But in that e-mail, there was some concern about the spring rains and flooding in that area being that the water comes down into there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Also, I got a call about 915 Euclid Avenue if we could have Code Enforcement go out and check on the property . It seems to me abandoned at this point in time. I don't know who the owner is. But the fences are falling . The grass is high. There's a lot of issues going on there that we can check out. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I got a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 call earlier today about Dorothy Street. There was about a 1 foot hole that was near some of the new basins that went in there. But I think we got a call prior to the meeting that said that -- MR. VOLDENBERG : We did this afternoon . That hole's been filled. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you, just making sure on that. Any -- did you get any information on 317 North Sumner Avenue, the restoration work that was there? I wasn't sure if it was gas or water but -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I reached out and the Pennsylvania Water Company Sewer Division said it's a water issue and they forward ed it to them and they have yet to advise. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. MR. VOLDENBERG : But the pave cut is a water. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I got some answers from last week or the week before's question s. I asked some questions regarding ARPA Department budget transfer s. There were several budget transfers . One being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 transfer ring money from the Pittston Avenue Streetscape Project over to Wyoming and Cedar. So the answer I got was additional funding will be added to both the Cedar Avenue and Wyoming Avenue Streetscape Project which are currently in the design phase. So that's the money coming from Pittston over to Cedar and Wyoming . The Pittston Avenue funding was allocated as matching funds for a grant that the city wasn't awarded . So they were matching funds. Engineering design on Pittston Avenue has not started and, therefore , the project cannot be obligated prior to the ARPA deadline . So the Pittston Avenue Streetscape Project won't be able to make it in time for the ARPA deadline . I was asked if they were going to abandon the Pittston project all together and they said they're going to continue to apply for grant funding to complete the Pittston Avenue Project . The other question I had regarding the ARPA budget transfers was that they were transferring $49,000 of funds for the Keyser Valley flood and North Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 flooding . They were transferring that funding to City Hall improvement s. So I asked for an explanation on why we were switching that over. The answer I got was the Keyser Valley grant match is being funded through city grant matches . The ARPA dollars are being repurposed to fund repairs for Council Clerk and County Controller offices. So with that question , I had asked why the funds were being transfer red and this is what was occurring with those funds. So if we could just ask them why the funds were being transferred . I don't know why we would be taking money away from the areas that were affect by flooding . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. I also asked for comparisons for the pave cut receivable s for 2021 to 2024. I did get them today. Happy to get them today. Today is the 14th. When I put that in for a right to know, the 15th was deadline I received . So I receive d it a day before my deadline. So I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 go through those document s and see what I'll find. That's all for tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do. I have a few things here. First, last week I had asked about if the administration can consider hiring a company like Iron Mountain to be able to collect shredding material through the city. And I know that we did receive information on their new process . But that wasn't include d. But we did get a separate response on it that said the city has and does use venders such as Iron Mountain for shredding larger quantities of materials . The city can investigate venders for routine paper shredding . But in the meantime , staff will shred officer papers daily. So that is what we received so far. But I'll look forward to their response after they've investigated into using Iron Mountain for other shredding and what those costs might be. Also, I received a complaint 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 regarding a property on Prescott Avenue, the old Prescott bingo hall. And I think that it had recently been sold and they are renovating the property . There's been some work they're doing on it. But the complain t was that it was -- the building was unsecured and there are open doors they had noticed. So if we could have perhaps Code Enforcement or even SPD to visit the property and make sure that it's secured and there's -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. Also, I receive d a complaint that I just forward ed to you, Mr. Voldenberg , regarding a sewage issue with -- it's East Market Street; but the (inaudible ) from the City's Lights Church which is on Main Avenue there in North Scranton . And there is some debate about the issue and who's going to pay for it if it's American Water or the city. But they some sewerage that was going out into the street. And they were initially told it was from them. And they have both American Water out there and the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 But they're still waiting on hearing back regarding the issue because I think there's a problem with their pipe on their end that they're saying the city might pay for. So I just want clarity on that. I'm assuming it was DPW that they spoke to if you could contact them about the issue. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll clarify that for you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And I received an update earlier today on Monroe Avenue. Mr. Raines has come in here before with regards to his street and the work that American Water was suppose d to do on it. We were told that they are going to be starting work in early June and that there should be the paving completed by September . So that's a timeline we have been given so far on that. Also, we received an updated demolition list from the city. And I know I've been asking about one of the properties , 1047 Cottage Avenue is included on that list. But we still didn't receive a timeline on the demolition of that property . So if we could inquire again about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 if there's a date set for that one because it's supposed to be the spring list. And we're getting closer to summer. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that date, Doctor. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And last month I asked about 714 Marion Street. The resident was requesting a no parking sign to be issued there. They still are having issues with people parking in front of their driveway . But I don't think I received a response from DPW about whether or not they were going to place the sign there if it's been completed . MR. VOLDENBERG : No response from the police department or DPW. I'll follow up. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, check in again about that, please. And I just wanted to respond to Miss Augustini about the Deacon Street legislation that we passed last week. I think we probably could have done a better job relaying what we had discuss ed in caucus during our vote. So I do apologize for that. I think, you know, I'll make sure better in the future to remember that, you know, everything that we're talking about in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 caucus isn't televise d. So we need to relay that when it comes to our votes on the legislation to make it clear as to why we're voting on that piece. But I was in agreement with colleague s. I felt like we were all on the same page about the legislation that we were okay with it being a two-way street. But the recommend ations were there for -- were not there for it to be a four-way stop at that one intersection . And one other thing that I just wanted to bring up, last week on Friday I had the privilege to go to Isaac Tripp Elementary School where I was able to read to a first grade classroom . It was part of the Keystone classroom initiatives from the 250 PA Organization . So that was the organization that was created by Governor Wolff for the upcoming 250th anniversary of our country . And the Keystone Classroom Initiative is making sure that there are students throughout the state being read to you and the book was K for Keystone which was just a really neat way to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 able to discuss all that we have to offer in our state in Pennsylvania with first grade children . And it was really fun to see their excitement as we were reading the book and hearing about things that they know that we have in Scranton and why they love Pennsylvania . So I just wanted to mention that was something cool that I was able to do last week. And that is everything I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, yeah, I have a couple. So I also want to apologize to Mrs. Augustini and promise to be more cognizant with regards to communication . I thought maybe she saw it and figured our way through it watching our meeting , but not all of our caucuses are televised . I would also like to recognize and pay homage to National Police Week for the brave men and women that gave it their all in their communities . And I would also like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 thank our brave men and women in blue of the Scranton Police Department . So I have a couple other things blight related . So 409 Fig Street, it's an empty lot, hedges and grass. It's getting heavily overgrown, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could put that on the radar for Code Enforcement . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Also, a resident came up to me and I know -- she realized , you know, I know there's being work done on Washburn Street by the water company . But she lives near the corner of Washburn and Hyde Park. She says there's a storm -- there's two drains within the block there, one near her house. She wanted to know if it's the responsibility of the water company . Are they going to take care of it while they are doing this work or is it a city drain? To be quite honest with you I didn't know. So I said I would look into that for her if you could please -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I would like to also 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 revisit -- so I brought this up a couple months ago. It's on Archbald and South 5th. If you are driving down Landis and you turn onto Archbald and 5th, you could turn left or right. Right you would turn where the school buses are. Left you turn towards Clover Field. The issue that was there months ago was there's a truck with a trailer on the left. And there's a truck with a trailer on the right blocking view. So I know that I think highways went out and said, you know, it's not that bad. One of the trucks and the trailer moved, but the one that remains , I think it's closer now to the stop sign. It's on the right. And literally I got maybe five complaints since the first one months ago. We have to inch out. And what comes out of there are for the most part, school buses. I believe it's very -- it's a safety issue that needs to be looked at again or revisited. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have them revisit it. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 what else do I have? I have one more thing. So some of the biggest -- one of the biggest issues that we face all the time on Main Avenue in Scranton is that bridge going towards North Scranton . Trucks get stuck under it constantly . I've talked to people since I'm here four plus years in almost every department . And they said we increase d some signage , you know, and I'm like, you know, it's 2024. There's got to be some type of app or GPS that would navigate these trucks away from it. But apparently there's not. But like I always say, some of the resident s have the best ideas. And I spoke with this lady. She likes to put everything in writing and send it to me. It's a great idea and it makes sense. When you're coming up Lackawanna Avenue, the major road leading to North Main Avenue there is no signage regarding the bridge when you are coming up it. But as soon as you make the right towards the bridge, there is a little sign near Rite Aid but it's obscured . So the truck already made the right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 so they're stuck, right? If a truck does not turn right there to avoid the bridge, I'm not sure they could even make that turn so they continue . There are several signs after that warning with the bridge height but now there is nowhere to go. They are stuck. They do turn up Oram sometimes . But Oram leads into the cemetery . Maybe they're thinking or their GPS says you could get to Keyser or wherever they are going so they arrive, you know, at the bridge. Or they turn onto Euclid, drive 1.5 miles through the development , then turn left on Clearview and now they cannot go anywhere but backward. It takes a long time for 16-wheelers to back up onto Euclid. So this lady's experienced this most of her life. So she sees this and witness es. And then having to drive then onto Court Street is an issue. There are no truck signs at the entrance of Euclid from Main Avenue. However , there is one on the left side of the entrance to Euclid. If you're coming down the hill and make a left, you tend to look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 to your right. The city could put some better signs regarding the bridge at the top of Lackawanna . And this makes a lot of sense -- indicating the height of the bridge that there is no other access that might help. Also, if they could move no truck signs to the right side of the street to the entrance of Euclid, it would be more noticeable . As for now, no one is looking into the no truck sign on the left. So I'm going to forward this. I know I read a lot. But I think it's a fantastic idea, put the sign at the top of Lackawanna before they turn and see the sign and it's too late. So I will forward you all of this information , Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please send it over to highway and so they could take a look at it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : These are great points. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Last week I had asked that Colfax Avenue and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 Olive Street and also Colfax Avenue and East Gibson Street that the handicap curbs be cut in an area and asked if it could be rolled into the project going on on Cedar Avenue. Unfortunately , that project is funded with ARPA money and it could not be. So we did send it to the city engineer for review. And we are looking for an alternate way fund this. But I believe it is going to be done. Also, the Wheeler Avenue and Olive Street, the basins that have been problem s there for years that have been flooding , the water company has been requested to clear them. And they are reviewing them. So hopefully they will straighten them out. The South Scranton Neighborhood Association meeting is tomorrow evening . It's at 509 Cedar Avenue. And one last thing I have is being National Police Week, I'm just going to read this. In 1962 President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation which designate d May 15th as Peace Officers Memorial Day. And the weekend which of that date falls as police week. The City of Scranton , City Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 wishes to honorable to those who gave their lives in the line of duty especially the 11 officers of the City of Scranton who gave their lives in the line of duty. And they were Patrolman John James Wilding , Patrolman William W. Harmer, Captain Albert Gleason ; Patrolman Thomas O'Malley; Detective Lieutenant Louis Roberts ; Patrolman Alvin Earl Brant; Patrolman John Loftus; Patrolman Louis William James; Patrolman Charles Berry; Patrol wagon driver George D. Kent; and Patrolman Ellis John Ellis. That is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
