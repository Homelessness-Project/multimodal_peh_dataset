Next Monday, June 24th, there will be a public caucus at 5:15 with NDC to discuss 5-B and 5-C on tonight 's agenda. Both of those pieces are related to parking meter zone and downtown residential parking program . Also, there will be a public hearing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 held at 5:45 for Item 5-D which is amending a portion of the OECD's home funding for a project with Scranton Lackawanna Human Development Agency for housing . Note again, Council will hold daytime meetings for the month of July. We'll meet weekly at 12:30 p.m., and hold caucus at noon in the Clerk's Office or in Council Chambers , if necessary . The weekly meetings in July will be held Wednesday s due to work schedule s that conflict with meetings on Mondays . Our daytime meeting will begin on Wednesday , July 3rd at 12:30 and will continue with that schedule for the four remaining Wednesday s that follow. Also a change -- a slight change with Fourth Order. We will be implement ing a program where we'll still be honoring , of course, the five-minute time limit. But there will be a 30 second bell prior to your five minutes just to -- you can wrap up your thought at that time. Once your five minutes is up, we will ask for you to the leave podium for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 new speaker to come up. That's all I have. Thank you.

Les Spindler spoke on matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Jerry Healy spoke on matters of general concern .

PERRY: Mr. Donahue , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just to touch on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 what a couple of the speakers said. We did ask that the City Solicitor come in and give us further explanation on both 5-F and 5-G, settlement agreements . In terms of 6-A, we have requested more information about how they're going to implement that program with rental registration . So we're going to see what they give us before next week. And I know Mr. Gaughan had asked for the street paving list and we still haven't received it. And it's still not ready I don't believe . And I think the PEL thing is at 12:15. Is PEL on July 15th or is it -- what are we doing? No, we're doing noon. I'm sorry, noon. And that's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comment s? MR. EVANS: Very briefly . Right, so 12:00 noon is PEL on the 15th of July -- or 10th. I don't know why I keep on thinking the 15th. We're on Wednesday now, Wednesday time. Very briefly , I would like to congratulate the Recreation Authority that oversees Nay Aug Park 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 on the recent announcement that they worked out a deal with Geisinger CMC for long-term commitment for the park for a substantial amount of money. You may have seen that in the paper this morning . Also thank Geisinger CMC for stepping up and being a good neighbor of the park. This will go a long way to not only improving the park, but making it sustainable for years to come. So it's nice to see positive news in the paper every now and then. And finally all I have to say is, every day is your chance to make this city a little better. That's all I have for tonight . MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. In regards to Mrs. Schumacher 's question about the fireman , I had asked and posed the same question and received notice from the HR Department and the HR Director that he is still employed by the city. So that was the only response that I received , okay? The last two weeks I brought up 913-915 Eynon Street. Councilman Evans, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Councilman Donahue and myself had been out there to look at this house. Mr. Hinton had told us that this house was tied up in litigation . We had requested from the Law Department more of an explanation on that. Mr. Hinton explained that the city was going to take further action against the property owners. We did receive correspondence from Michael O'Brien of Oliver Price and Rhodes who is representing the City of Scranton Housing Appeals Board in the matter of Bing Chang versus City of Scranton Housing Appeals Board from 2014. I just want to briefly read the letter that he sent. "Enclosed please find a memorandum and order dated May 24th, 2018, wherein Judge Munley denies the property owner's appeal, upheld the relevant order of condemnation and further directed Mr. Chang to arrange for a walkthrough , necessary affidavit and bond, remediation work and subsequent inspection relative to the property at 913-915 Eynon Street. As of this date, Mr. Chang has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 failed to schedule these items in accordance with Judge Munley's order. Council for Mr. Chang has repeatedly requested addition al time to comply with the order attached and has sought to apply for a special exception wherein he may secure certain zoning approval which would in his view allow for the economic consideration s that he deems appropriate prior to abating the unlawful condition of current property . This request , however , should have no bearing on the property owner's obligation to abide by Judge Munley's order and the relevant provisions of the city code as it may relate to the property maintenance . Based on the above, I have advised opposing Council that we have prepared and intend to present a motion to enforce Judge Munley's May 24th, 2018 order and to seek any other such relief as appropriate and consistent with the code. I will provide a copy of this motion for your review upon filing." I was in contact with the residents in the 900 block of Eynon Street and in that vicinity who are concerned about this property 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 and the property 's condition . And they were pleased I think that now we have a better understanding of what legal action is being taken in regard to this property . And I do want to note that, you know, many times people are under the impression for a number of different reasons , one I think might be from a lack of communication that the city isn't doing anything with some of these properties . And if you look at the order here that will take you through since 2014, the city actually has tried to rectify this issue. And it is spelled out in the order. So I do want to thank the city administration , Mr. Hinton, and Mr. O'Brien and the Law Department for providing this and giving us a better idea of where this property stands. And I think giving the neighbors a little bit more comfort that you know something is in the works to rectify that issue. The 1100 to 1400 block of Oram Street received notification from neighbors about water runoff issues, pavement coming up revealing old brick pave underneath . The DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Director respond ed that actually this block of Oram Street is going to be paved by, I believe , the water or gas company . They are redoing the service lines. So there is no need for the DPW at this point to go out and mill and pave the street because that is going to be taken care of eventually by one of the utility companies . We receive d a request that I would like to forward , Mrs. Reed, to the DPW and also to the Chief of Police from a gentleman regarding the 1100 block of Hampton Street. He's requesting that that street be put on the paving list and also he is detailing some concerns about Hampton Street being so narrow. So if we could forward that, please to DPW. Also, I received a few calls about 1441-1443 North Sumner Avenue. Apparently last week the police department and other law enforcement agencies have raided this home. Neighbors are concerned . They would like to know if the property is condemned and what the status of this property is. They have called about this and tried to get some answers . So, Mrs. Reed, if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 we can try to find out for them what's going on with that property . Also, Councilman Donahue and I had asked for quite a few weeks now about the case against the City of Scranton and the Licensing and Inspections Department in regards to Theodor Brunelle with the city losing the case or -- I don't know if they settled or lost or whatever . But we would have to pay out a very large amount. So I just want to read into the record the letter from Jessica Eskra, the City Solicitor . "I am in receipt of your letter of June 11, 2019. By way of background , this case, Theodor Brunelle versus City of Scranton involve d allegation s by the plaintiff that his contract or license was revoked without affording him due process . At the time of revocation , the Housing Board of Appeals had been defunct for several years and it would have been impossible to establish the same in the short time period allowed. Subsequent to discovery , the Plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 judgment . The court partial ly granted Plaintiff 's motion for summary judgment as to his procedural due process claim. Specific ally, the court found that the city had failed to provide Mr. Brunelle the appropriate procedural due process prior to and after the revocation of his electrical license . All other aspects of the Plaintiff 's motion were denied." In response to Councilman Donahue 's questions and mine about why the insurance coverage for the city was denied, Solicitor Eskra explains that the insurance coverage for the claim was denied as the Plaintiff 's complaint alleged conduct and malicious prosecution which are not covered by an insurance policy and sought damages in the form of injunctive relief, which is also not covered by our insurance policy. Attorneys fees are included and reflect ed in the settlement figure. It is unknown how Plaintiff and his counsel allocated the total settlement award amongst themselves . The settlement was paid from the court awards line item in the 2018-2019 budget.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Other suits that include Director Hinton as a defendant had been filed by Alexander Brunelle , Kelly Klee{sic}, Steven Garanin , George and Judith Reihner , and Svee Sketti{sic}. This list may not be exhaustive but includes those that may have a significant impact. I just would like to follow up on this letter, Mrs. Reed, if we can because I believe Councilman Donahue and I specifically requested the insurance coverage denial letter from the insurance carrier . So if we can send a followup, I'm assuming Mrs. Eskra just forgot to put that in there. I would appreciate that for next week. And that is all I have this week. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . Yeah, I only have a couple things. Mr. Gaughan , how long ago did we get communication from the HR Department about that fireman ? Do you know how long about because I don't remember seeing it come through . MR. GAUGHAN : It was in an e-mail, correct , Mrs. Reed, I think. It might have been three or four weeks. It was a while ago.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. PERRY: Okay. All right. Okay. And really I only have a couple quick housekeeping things. If we could, I would like to take advantage of American Water's offer to clean out some storm drains as needed. The 2600 block of Pittston Avenue again, they did it last year and they did a fantastic job. With the recent flooding that we did have, a lot of sediment did build up in it. And I would just like it cleaned out again. I think it was eight months about since it was done. And after that last one, that would be some great preventative maintenance to take care of that. So I'll definitely take them up on that offer. And then thank you for getting back with the Kane and Kirst Ct light. I know that -- that's been notified and on the books since midMay. But it's still out right now if we can do a followup letter to see where we are with that and I could let the people in that area know that -- maybe give them a timeframe when that light's going to be getting taken care of. And then finally , we had a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 speaker -- I wasn't here last week. He brought up the LST breakdown . Did we send anything out on the LST breakdown for an answer form about where it goes or what the breakdown is form? So we're just waiting for a response back? All right. Okay. All right. That's all I have. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

EVANS: On the question . This is basically -- an all encompassing bill. This type of legislation is really to correct some of the proliferation of all kinds of signs we have downtown . We have 15 minute signs. We have 30 minute signs. We have no parking for bank signs. A lot them have just appeared over the years. So we're trying to get a handle on that. And many of those signs didn't even have enabling legislation to be put in place. So this is going to correct that. It's going to establish no loading zone signs, one per block to allow the businesses to be able to park and load and move onto where they would normally park their car. I think overall it's going to be a positive . And it's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 precursor to the kiosk parking plan as well.

MR. PERRY: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. EVANS: I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . You know, at least a week or two ago I had asked the Law Department and the Licensi ng and Inspections Department what their plan was to enforce this because I do have questions as other people do about the process for collection , you know, what specifically what city employees will be in charge of this whole operation . And I do think that although this legislation is just simply opening an account so that we can put the escrow funds in there, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 it goes without saying that when this type of legislation comes before Council , we have the opportunity to hold administration 's feet to the fire to make sure that we understand that there's going to be a coherent competent plan in place to collect and to enforce this type of legislation . There have been speakers that have brought up maybe there are legal questions to this. I'm interested in questioning the Law Department and the Licensing and Inspections Department further about that. But I do think before final passage on this legislation that we should make sure that they have a plan in place and a process in place so that this just doesn't fall to the wayside . Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question . Just for a little background on this, the original Rental Registration Ordinance that was litigated and there is also this Rental Registration Ordinance was attached to that as well. When it was settled , the judge did keep this portion in the new ordinance , which is very encouraging .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 I think at that point he felt it would pass muster. And again, this is, you know, what it is. It's just setting up the account . But I have no problem with trying to get ahead of this a little bit and find out if the city has a plan and how they are going to go about doing it or at least give us the outline of how they're going to do it before we move the legislation forward . But I'm very encouraged that this is here in front of us and that we are moving ahead with a plan to enforce this. MR. GAUGHAN : I just want to add too when I originally had a brief conversation with the City Solicitor regarding the previous legislation when we were accepting the settlement for the rental registration , and I brought up to her about the -- what the process would be like. And at that point they were still, you know, coming up with that and discussing that. So I will be interested to see, you know, how those conversations have progressed and where the city is at at this point. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. PERRY: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR.
