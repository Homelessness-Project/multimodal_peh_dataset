MR. KING: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community . Thank you. Roll call, please.

MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. MINUTES OF THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION MEETING HELD JANUARY 3, 2023. 3.B. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD MEETING HELD FEBRUARY 9, 2023. 3.C. CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MONTH ENDING FEBRUARY 28, 2023. 3.D. LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION EVALUATION REPORTS REVIEWED FEBRUARY 10, 2023 THROUGH FEBRUARY 27, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I only have one comment on the Third Order items. And this will be something I'm going to have Frank reach out to the administration . I did see that in 3-C, $4,000 was paid to the Nossaman firm for the month of February , just looking to see what actions they completed for the month of February . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I had one comment as well. This was regarding the ARC meeting minutes from February 9th. And in there under miscellaneous they had a discussion about whether or not a PA statement of financial interest was required since they're an advisory board. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 And it seemed that they were require d to have that and to submit that on an annual basis. So I was wondering if they haven't been doing that in the past if the other city boards and commissions have been compliant in doing that. Maybe that is something that the ethics board would be able to provide information on. Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to inquire about that? MR. VOLDENBERG : Sure. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : It is my understanding that all boards and commissions should fill out a financial interest form. DR. ROTHCHILD : Right. So I'm wondering which ones have not been completed and we want to make sure that everyone is on the same page. Thank you. MR. KING: All comments received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So first of all, as Chairman on the Committee on Public Safety, I would like to congratulate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 former Scranton Police Chief Len Namiotka for 30 years of service , dedication , devotion to public safety. I wish him a very happy retirement . Secondly , St. Lucy's Church spaghetti dinner will be Wednesday , April 12th and Thursday April 13th. That will be in the church auditorium at 949 Scranton Street, Scranton , PA. The cost is $14. And it includes spaghetti , meatball , salad, bread and dessert . Tickets can be purchased at the door. And donations -- they're looking for donations also of cans of soda, cases of water, etc. And then at the Ukrainian Club on Railroad Avenue there will be an Easter Ham and Kielbasa Raffle. It will be Saturday , April 1st from 2 to 5. And they will also have entertain ment, Juniors Eyes. There will be some raffles including 10 pound hams and two rings of Kielbasa , 18 of them. Again, that is on Railroad over in West Side. And that is that all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Any other Council members have announcements ? I have a few. I was asked to read this from Deb Niehouse {phonetic }. As 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 the research all but wraps up and invitations begin to forward for next week's tribute of proclamation recognizing women in history month and local women, Deb Niehouse would like to thank the following people who helped create the list of the first woman to serve: The reference staff at the Albright Memorial Library , the Abington Library , Sara and others at the Lackawanna Historical Society , also all clerks, secretaries , borough managers , managers and mayors within the various municipalities throughout Lackawanna County. Most of all Kathy Carrera of City Council staff whose kind words and support kept the project moving along. It truly was a countywide group effort and Deb appreciates all who offered advice, information , and words of encouragement . And thank Councilman McAndrew for saying yes to an idea which was out of the ordinary and which allowed the identification and commemoration of some of the most notable history making women throughout Lackawanna County. So thank you all for that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I just wanted to congratulate Norma Jeffries on a wonderful article in the Sunday Times and well deserved , thank her for all of her contributions to our city, very much appreciated . And I would also like to thank and congratulate former Police Chief Leonard Namiotka for over 30 years of service to the City of Scranton . And we wish him well in his retirement . That's all at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Yeah, you stole my thunder . I'd just like to say that Norma has only been back in town for five years and this is what she does in her retirement. She's done more for the city in five years than most of us have done in 50. And the other thing is, I think when she comes to this podium she will offer constructive criticism and even complaints , but she does so with dignity and grace. And she sets the standard for civil discourse. So when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 I grow up, I want to be just like her. I know you always pause at the beginning to remember the people in our community that have died. And I would ask you to remember Francis R. Martin. He was a soldier in World War II, killed in Europe. He was declared dead in 1946. And through the miracle of DNA his remains were finally identified . He was from West Scranton . And he would be laid to rest among the honored dead at Arlington National Cemetery this Friday. So please keep him and his family in your prayers . Larry West as he was leaving showed to me the audit. It's a fine baby boy apparently . And apparently they only received it this morning so it didn't make it on the agenda. Hopefully we'll see it next week. I asked Larry if the Mayor's made a decision on the penalty clause of the audit contract . He said they're considering it. And I told him point-blank I'm not going to wait much longer for an answer; yes, no, and why. And if they still can't, you know, answer that question , I'm going to write a letter to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 editor because I think the people in town who are paying taxes need to know how their tax money is being spent. And I want to know what Kohanski being late for four years in a row, why we aren't asking for some of that money back. We should be. And if we have inhouse problem s, let's get our people trained . If we have third-party problems like maybe the actuary , let's get that fixed. But let's get the audit done in a timely manner from now on. Speaking of timely manner, where does the DPW contract stand that hasn't been posted on the website ? It's been six months. MR. KING: Did we get an answer, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, Mr. King, as of today the HR and IT is following up with the attorney -- the City's labor attorney . MS. HODOWANITZ : Somebody is making a lot of money on that with billable hours. Yeah, this also unacceptable . The people pay the salaries and other costs for these unions and these employees . Let's get this done or they should explain to us what the problem is.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 They signed it on September 13th. Let's get a move on. What about the $600,000 loan to the Ice Box that now belongs to Geisinger ? Is anybody going to claw that money back? MR. KING: I believe that's tied up in litigation at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, we better litigate long and hard. Didn't we kind of sell that thing to the previous owner for what was it a lease for a dollar for 99 years? Our tax dollars at work again. And where do we stand on posting the statements of financial interest on the City's website ? According to Ethics Code, it's a must. MR. KING: I think that's still being reviewed and hopefully we'll address that in the very near future. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , Mr. King. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And well, that's all I have tonight . But I understand from Mr. West that there is going to be a public caucus on the audit. And we're going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 have Kohanski to come down here to talk about it. MR. KING: I believe so. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. Thank you. I'm looking forward to our chat next week. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . I too would like to congratulate Len Namoitka on a 30 year career. He served the city with dignity and respect . I know Len for about 20 years. He's a wonderful person. Good luck on his retirement . I'm sure he'll pop up somewhere in security or something like that. I know quite a few police officers that are retired that work in the federal building in security . He will probably do something like that. He's still a young man. Good luck, Len. I wasn't here for quite a few weeks. So last time I was here I spoke about Dorothy Street. There was a storm drain put in. Where they dug the street it's sinking . I went by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the next day with my dog. There were all kinds of lines painted on the street there where the storm drain is. I said, oh, that was really quick. So anyway, a couple of days later I went by and there was a big hole dug on the side of the road, the opposite side of the road. It was covered with metal. I said to my wife, I said, I think they're putting a storm drain on the other side of the street because that always gets flooded when there's a rain storm. There is a storm drain about 75 feet down the street. But most of the water never reaches it. A couple more days go by and I walked with my dog again. Much to my delight , there were two storm drains put in right next to the ball field. There shouldn 't be any problem with water ponding on the road anymore . They're still not done because from where the ball fields are down to the first storm drain, there's a section that wide with the pavement dug up. So I guess they are going to fill that in and pave it again or whatever . It's great for the people that live in that area. They 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 don't have to put up with all of that water ponding there. Next, speaking of water, the weather is getting nice and all, I wonder if anything is going to happen with our corner now on Bulwer and North Rebecca . I mean, it's a year and a half now. But I was told it's going to be taken care of and still nothing . Now we have a new DPW Director . I'd like to talk to him. Maybe he could meet me up there some day. So I don't know what the story is. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you look into that and check with DPW and see if -- I'm not sure if they have been up there recently if there is any plans to address that issue? MR. SPINDLER : The last I was told by Larry West when he was acting DPW Director , it was a pitch issue on the corner. The engineer had to go look at it. I said last year I don't know how it's pitched . The curb on my corner keeps wearing away. If they put something decent there that isn't going to wear away. I'm not going to have water in front of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 my house. MR. SCHUSTER : Did they cut that, Mr. Spindler , or did they just spray paint it? MR. SPINDLER : They spray painted it. The gentleman was up in October a year and a half ago. MR. SCHUSTER : Hawthorne Street is the same way. The water runs off the intersection and runs right down the sidewalk . MR. SPINDLER : He spray painted on each of the four corners. He said we're going to take care of the whole thing, so far nothing . I saw the Mayor on the TV a few weeks ago with the electric cars for the inspectors . Where did all of this money come from? Was it allocated in the budget or does anybody know? We're just out of distressed status and all of a sudden we have all this kind of money. MR. SCHUSTER : Some of that money was from a grant and the rest was from the ARPA money. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Lastly, yesterday I had to go to Geisinger CMC for a test. When I got to Colfax Avenue I looked to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 my left. I haven't been up there in quite a while. I couldn't believe the whole block was gone. I didn't know that. I'm sad. I mean, that was a beautiful area there. I could now really sympathize with the people that come here week after week. The people that live across the street if that was me, I wouldn't want to sit on my porch and look at parking garages . It's just awful. Those people were chased out of their homes and the people that are left there have to look at a parking garage. I don't think that's right. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Lee Morgan. Tonight I just want to read a letter I gave -- well, I gave a request to the Council and to the Mayor. And I think it's important for the resident s to understand exactly what I'm doing. So here I go. Mayor Paige Cognetti , I am requesting that you, yourself, as Mayor of Scranton send legislation to Scranton City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Council to restore the public access component of ECTV. A former mayor removed it. He was convict ed in a court of law I believe for public corruption . His name is Bill Courtright , also five Council members were involved , okay, Pat Rogan, Bob McGoff, Tim Perry, Bill Gaughan who is running for county commissioner , what a joke, and Wayne Evans. I have asked City Council to confirm the names of the elected officials . I'm going to ask the Council members next week about that. I have asked the City Council to confirm the names of the elected officials involved . ECTV at inception was a PEG channel and I am seeking to return it back to its intended use. Many groups used it including the Scranton taxpayers and citizens association . The franchise fee generates 1.5 million dollars from Verto -- from Comcast . And I know that's not used to fund the ECTV but that was how it all came to be, okay. So I'm just asking that it return back to the way it was previously . And Scranton City Council I said to them, Scranton City Council , I, Lee Morgan am 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 requesting confirm ation of legislation that removed the public component of the PEG channel at ECTV and for the Scranton City Council to have a public forum on the issue by the complete city government , including the Mayor and to invite former Mayor Bill Courtright and the remaining former Council members . And I told you who they were. There was a question of who was on ECTV's Board of Directors, okay, who their members are. Are they members of Scranton Tomorrow , how they were appoint ed and by who also who directs them because they receive public funds from this Council . Okay, now, so, you know, we're going to see where this goes. But I don't think it's going to be a happy day for the city. And I really think that every Council member should be really shocked by what's happened to ECTV, not for me but for all the residents , okay, because when you look at the history of PEG channels , they were designed for something . And I think all five Council members and the Mayor should read it and know what it was meant to accomplish . And the other thing I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 would like to say is that I watched the meeting here tonight from the back about the projects you're doing. And the most troubling thing at all that I see there is, this Council has no idea what's going on. You're sitting there. You're watching the Mayor. You're watching the other parties in play. This meeting isn't being conduct ed properl y at all because before you had this meeting and before this funding was directed anywhere you should have sat down with all the parties involved , looked where the money was going, okay, looked what the project entailed, how much the project costs, what the materials cost, what the benefits to resident s were. It's like you're on a fishing derby and you're throwing a hook in the water seeing if you could ask an intelligent question . It's the most asinine thing you could ever see happen with millions of dollars . That's how the Scranton School District got in trouble . That's how the city got in because we have Council members who ask silly questions without all the information . And in the end, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 the residents are stuck with a tragedy . And I'd just like to say, you know, I paid my taxes today. And when I total the taxes I pay to this city and the government for one year, I paid $50,000. And I'm only an ordinary simple man. But I'm going say that we as a country cannot continue the way we are going. And these five Council members you're looking at today, you are suppose d to be representing us. And when you don't have the knowledge you need to make a smart decision , then you fail and then we suffer. And it's just not the way to do business . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Joann Williams . MS. WILLIAMS : Good evening . I'm here again tonight . Let's talk about Geisinger , right? And I appreciate Les's comments when he was up there and he saw what it looks like. I heard a few of you Council people were around that area. I don't know if you got a chance to see what a beautiful neighborhood is destroyed , okay. But I'm back here again because I partly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 own a home that was my grandparent s that they bought in 1933, okay, and now we can't sell it. We had three buyers. And once they find out -- we have to tell them what Geisinger 's plans are, we don't know what it's going to be, they back right out. A few of us had said to us -- me and my cousin, who wants to live, sit on the front porch and look at a garage? And I don't know what Geisinger 's thinking . I don't think they care, eight-story parking garage. Now there are five homes left on the 500 block of Colfax, okay, and we're willing to sell ours. And I'm pretty sure the person next to ours is willing to sell theirs. Before you people who we put in those seats like I said before, okay, you do not represent Geisinger . You represent the resident s, the taxpayer s, and the children of this city. You need to do the right thing. Tell Geisinger to buy those homes or tell them to make it a four-story parking garage. It's going to be a mess anyway. They ruined the whole neighborhood . I'm not happy and this isn't the end. Now, I want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 go onto something else, right, that is near and dear to my heart, mental health. I don't know who speaks for the Scranton School District or, you know, who relates to them from this board; but today a 13-year-old emotion al needs student was told today he has to leave Northeast Intermediate because of the boundaries . He has to go to South. Now he's been at Northeast since he's in 6th grade. He's in 7th now, right. This particular child has several mental health issues and has been through a lot of trauma and he is crushed . So people reached out, administration , Mr. Gentilezza , oh, that's our policy. That's our policy. But they won't let him stay there. He loves his teacher s. His teachers love him. But the -- and the answers from the school, the administration was, you know, it's our policy. And mental health matters . Now, I love high school sports, okay. I like basketball . I love football . My brother s played it. But that seems to be more important 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 in this city in the school district than the children who suffer with mental health. And I miss you, Mr. King, being an administrator there. I do, because I know that they counted with you. At Northeast Intermediate , there is no assemblies on bullying . But bullying is going on here. There's no assemblies on mental health and what we need to do. So where are the so-called administrators ? Mental health matters, especially in children . The suicide rate is humongous . And this child said he -- a few times he wanted to kill himself , okay? They didn't care today. So today Northeast Intermediate left -- I'll give you his first name Matthew -- left Matthew behind. They threw him away like a piece of garbage . We all need to consider mental health. And whoever speaks to -- I'm going to their meeting too -- Scranton School Board needs to tell them they need to change their policies . This child is crushed today and it makes me sad. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Williams . Ron Ellman. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. ELLMAN: Council , I had to swallow my last Rolo just now. I imagine most of you saw this about Medicare in the paper Monday. I think it was Monday. It said that Americans are losing medicare . Americans have been paying for it. It doesn't say nothing about all these illegals that are on Medicare and Social Security . And then there is talk it won't be here for the next generation . This has been allowed to be destroyed the last couple years. It's just a heartbreaking thing. I was talking to my brother who I'm 21 years older and tonight he was talking . I won't get disability or nothing probably . I said, well, I don't know. Who knows. This Mayor wants to name -- did name a street after a failing president like this. He doesn't deserve anything in this city to me. Maybe -- I was listening to the talk about the parks. Nay Aug is a failed dinosaur . It's been neglected so long it's just not like it was when I came here in the 70s. I was there with my kids a lot when the zoo was there and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 all. And I remember it. It's a shame that went that way. Where I live a block from the river off of Parker Street for 20, 25 years I used to walk through the woods over there to behind the Toyota dealer where the little bridge is, there was a path that the kids made on the trail bikes of beautiful wood, beautiful . It could have been turned into like the Abingtons . But somebody in Harrisburg probably never been here, they levelled all the trees. You could imagine the cost. We got a bicycle path there instead of people having a park for families . How many people go there -- you'd have to carry your bike there to start with and ride bikes. Day and night the quads and the trail bikes race up and down the place. There will be an accident sooner or later, I imagine . This town when there's a bad accident , it seems to be swept under the rug. Bob Binky, I've complained and complained . Mr. Quinn slaughter ed this poor guy in front of witnesses and nothing 's been done. The man was Minicosa -- I forgot his name. He was hit by a woman right in front of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 my house. She stopped up, like, a block up the street and looked at her car, not about this poor guy laying there dead on the street, nothing done about her. She didn't put her brakes on. She didn't stop. It doesn't make sense. North Main is like a race track. Saturday night a lady hit a dog. I was standing there while I was walking my puppy back home. She had to be going about 65, 70 miles an hour. And besides that, there was a lady trying to get the dog back into the yard where it escaped . You know, it could have been tragic. I explained for years about the speeding cars. The kids are standing there on sidewalks that trucks have tore up and nobody cares. I told you one time they knocked the fence down where the school bus is. Nobody seems to -- I don't know. It seems to me speeding cars are a big problem but not around here. You could see on the sidewalk where trucks and cars are probably 3 feet onto the sidewalk on this little curve. They tore up 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 or 12 feet of it. It's got a cold patch right where your kids are for crying out loud. It's time somebody does something for them. I don't have any kids there. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . Okay, I got the marker this week in the right place. Last week I did mention nonprofit organizations should have a few benefits from the city. They were the poor guys that got drafted and some volunteered . But I lived back then and it turned out it wasn't the most popular thing to get the letter in the mail to report. And so I would like to see if we have a VFW or something , take their trash out. It's not -- they're not that big even anyway, you know, enough said on that. The speaker is missing from the back that was there last week. Was that a loaner or something ? MR. KING: So I think they were testing that speaker out. It's my understanding they are in the process of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 purchasing a similar speaker that's going to be mounted so that it will be much better sound quality . MR. DOBRZYN : Sure. Sure. You know, you get consternation , people are carrying on a conversation . I spoke to somebody and right away I had somebody jumping all over me and I don't need it. Last week it was mentioned that Bob Casey closed the state hospital system in Scranton and that was not true. Dick Thornburgh closed during the 80s. I remember seeing him on television we're getting out of the hospital business . So for better or worse we lost the state hospital . I've seen elderly relatives in there. The care wasn't the greatest. But therein again, at least they had care. And I read an article . I kind of messed up, lost track of it. You had Brian Fulton's This Day in History . And there were right as Nay Aug Park was being planned , there was mining going on under it which was suppose d to be taboo, forbidden , no mining under what was to become 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Nay Aug. It was probably like a 130 years ago. I have to get in touch with Mr. Fulton or you could at -- and he could send you an e-mail even on the -- I have the phone number here. It was 348-9100, verified . Okay, so maybe, you know, our pool problem is a great big mine under what is the swimming pool at Nay Aug and that's why we seem to develop trouble , you know? A lot of places have been under mine -- they caught an illegal -- somebody punched a hole in their basement floor in my neighborhood and they were heating their house for years going down into the mines on Willow Street in South Side. So it's something to consider . I don't know if maps would even exist from that time but you could get in touch with the Bureau of Mines. And I talked about walkability last week. And I got a little stern. But I don't see where stop signs are going to work downtown . And I certainly hope that we don't tear up a whole bunch of stop light apparatus and go with this plan. I recommend all way stops everywhere 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 so people could get across the street and that's about -- and I don't know what to say about bikes because they assume that they're bike paths. And they assume that they are a pedestrian and they just do what they want. I used to go out along the old railroad tracks that were abandoned for bike rides. And last week there was a comment passed about you people being paid to play. I don't know if I were you, but I wouldn't tolerate it. That's the limit. The only time I say something like that about somebody is when they're convicted in a court of law for it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else that would like to be heard before Council ? Please state your name and address . MS. AUGUSTINI : Laura Augustini , Grandview Street in Scranton . I'm President of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . And I'll be speaking again at the Zoning Board meeting . But I wanted to say a couple of things first. First, I want to commend Mr. King 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 for all of the work that he did working with the associations . We truly did meet four, five, six times over the past year. And he was able to accommodate most of the requests that were made by the various associations . When we all met as associations together , we talked about the fact that we didn't want to be singles . We didn't want to be the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association or the Hill Section , the South Side. We wanted to come together as a unit. And I think we've all done that. So I want to make sure that you're aware that it's not just the Hill neighborhood people that are against or that would advocate for changes to the zoning in the Hill Section . It's also the other associations because we want the best for the entire city. There were changes made to Green Ridge which I appreciated , moved some things around, some changes made to the short-term rental definitions and requirements . I just wanted to make sure that you were aware of all the work that did go into it. And I wanted to make sure that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 rest of the resident s were aware of all of the work that has gone into this zoning ordinance . It's a long time coming. I only became aware of it in the past year and a half or so and that's on me. But I want to make sure that people realize that this isn't a new thing. This is something that has been worked on for a long time and that we're better together that you need to realize that the city as a whole needs to be behind this and that you don't just focus what's happening at Geisinger , happening in the Hill Section that you see the whole picture . That being said, I would hope that you would listen to the recommendations or the requests that are said of those in the Hill Section with regards to the 200 block of Colfax and the change from a 45 foot height -- from a 100-foot height requirement to a 45-foot height requirement . I think it's fantasy to think that Geisinger is going anywhere . They're going to build there. They've already invested millions of dollars in it. So we need to make them accommodate us, not us accommodate them. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 know that we are a college and healthcare city. That's where our employees are. But we need to maintain the neighborhoods that are in the city. That's where our taxes come from. Geisinger is not paying taxes. They're nonprofit . You've got all of these resident s and homeowners who are paying property taxes. Also, as an aside for just Green Ridge, I would like to advocate for additional police patrols in Green Ridge. We do not have an assigned car. That's a good thing because we don't really need it in terms of crime. But we do need it for other things just for safety of the children and those who are walking in the neighborhood . We have people blowing through stop signs constantly , North Washington and Woodlawn , North Washington and Richmont , North Washington and Woodlawn . We've got schools in that area. I would just like to see the police have a little bigger presence rather than just to drive by every, you know, once a shift. I think we need to kind of look at that again. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Augustini. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Touching back on the documents in our -- on the file today is the budget what has been spent so far this year. I believe it was up to the end of February or might have been March. But what I noticed interesting in there is the budget year that's listed as the budget is coming from is the year 2022. Obviously people aren't paying to attention to numbers. It should be 2023 as that year is closed. And we're in a new year. So if you take a look at the column for the total money for this year, it actually reflects at this point 2022. As of the pool at Nay Aug Park, qualified census tracks are not defined as required for government services . A park and a pool complex owned by and run by the city would fall under government service s. That is one of the cutouts in the final ruling is that qualified censuses do not directly apply to government services . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 That way government services such as facilities in a neighborhood which may be affluent could actually get funding they deserved and would not be banned because they're in the wrong zone. So saying that it's not available because of the area map does not allow it, is not completely true. Now we have -- now we're asking one million dollars for an ARPA evaluator to work with the ARPA team who has an ARPA coordinator who designed where the money would go. And I guess they'll coordinate with the Wilkes-Barre group from the universities who are the ARPA coordinators that make sure everything is in compliance . So we have a new paid for -- a new evaluator they want to work with two other evaluator s that are currently out there. Seems like a lot of money is putting for evaluating evaluations . There's a one million dollar plan to revise the pool they're looking at. So that's one million dollars to do a plan for a plan that had three plans that were three feet that was for a plan that originally had plans of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 three pools. So once again, we're getting money for a plan for a plan for a plan and we need another plan to plan for the plan and then the overall plan for the park itself. That's a lot of wasted money. Onto SAPA, it was noted by the county commissioners to please make sure that when Council passes the ordinance the language states that it does not take affect until all nine SAPA municipalities adopt as Dunmore is still holding out. It was done by Liz Donato, the Regional Planning Manager at the county office. Fingers in the work, before it came before this body, Kyle Donahue had stated, "Additional ly, I'm in full support of your proposed project . But as a representative of the city resident s, I want to also give them the opportunity to form and express their concern s." So he's 100 percent in full support of it before the people even get input. Of course we could go -- Geisinger , of course, we can go into detail we'll actually go in but we can't because we don't -- without knowing the zoning we can't decide on what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 land use will be. I know the rules and how many Council members can be together for events like this. And I didn't want to get too far ahead of myself and invite anyone. I would like to invite Dr. Rothchild to attend since she's a Hill Section neighbor and has a healthcare background . Larry, the same question goes to the Mayor. I don't want to inadvertently violate any Sunshine Law rules. Translation of that, I don't want to have the Sunshine rule come into effect and have a public meeting that actually has to be advertised and a public caucus. There's a lot more here but I don't have the time to go over it. I'll continue it next week. There's a lot of documentation back and forth between the city and Geisinger for the entire plans that was never made public. And some of it is concerning . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. PERRY: Thank you for the opportunity . My name is Matthew Perry. And I'm a four year resident of the Scranton city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 I grew up in Clarks Summit and attended college at Penn State in State College and spent the last four years in medical school at Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine , GCSOM. Following my residency at Geisinger Northeast Program in orthopedic surgery , I will be returning to Geisinger to serve my home region as an orthopedic surgeon . For all of these reasons I'm dedicate d to the betterment of the Scranton community . The School of Medicine was founded almost 15 years ago with the goal of increasing the number of physicians who will practice in Scranton and surrounding communities . As our community ages and our physician population ages as well, I'm proud to be a part of this critical mission . In my fourth year of medical school, I had the opportunity to interview for my residency at several elite hospital systems which help me understand and appreciate areas for improvement within my own home health system. From my perspective, offering future medical student s the opportunity to get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 world-class education in Scranton and to continue this mission of care for NEPA is crucial to our community and its well-being. The opportunity to expand Geisinger CMC to include a larger emergency department , gain increase d hospital rooms of higher quality and more efficient parking solutions would greatly improve the patient experience . During my rotations at GCMC, I've seen patients wait several hours to receive emergency care for multiple reasons. First, when a person needs to stay overnight , they must wait for a hospital bed to become available . But we don't have enough hospital beds for all the patient s who are in need so they end up occupying a bed in the emergency department . Second, multiple hospitals in the surrounding communities can no longer provide emergency services forcing our hospital to treat a larger population . The longer we wait to provide a solution , the worse this problem will get. The propose d expansion will not only improve the patient experience but also greatly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 improve the student learning experience by enhancing the learning environment in multiple ways. More patient care areas will provide improved and increased learning experiences for students . The opportunity to expand care teams and further special ized treatment teams will offer unique opportunities for advanced trainings such as increased residency and fellowship programs . Furthermore , as the learning environment becomes more advance d, we will attract more attending physician s who work in that community and serve as mentors to our medical trainees . All of these benefits will in turn attract more interested student s who may ultimately decide to serve our community and their future careers . The cycle of improvement and positive feedback is how elite program s become great and become greater . For these reasons , I ask the City Council to approve the propose d zoning ordinance as it was approved by the City Planning Commission and advance d by this body on the first two reading s. Thank you for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 opportunity . MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Matthew -- Matthew , can you state your address before you leave? MR. PERRY: Yes, sir. My current address is 831 Adams Avenue, Scranton , Pennsylvania 18510. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , East Mountain . First, I'd like to start by thanking Mark for taking the initiative improve the acoustics in this room. I was really disappoint ed when I came in tonight and couldn't hear a lot of what was being said at this table because the equipment was removed . I hope if it's just a dollar amount you people will help ECTV or whoever is going to buy the proper equipment . But I know it's a pittance compared to the thousands we're being told it could happen before. So the quicker the better I'd say. Now last week I did not have an opportunity to get to the podium because I attended a program of my little friend and got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 here before seven and people were still at the podium because I was listening to it. But because the door was locked, the back door was locked. I came walked around to the front. The front door was locked. And then I thought , well, if I'm patient here maybe somebody will leave after they speak and I could get in. Well, three people left. I got in. And I thought very good. I could get up here. Well, guess what, the next door is locked. Now, I could see one door locked seriously . But two? What is the need for the second lock, you know, it just keeps people out. So I think that should be looked at personally . And on the parks, the one thing I did not hear was whether or not we're going to do a safety inspection of all of those -- all of our parks. I as a taxpayer do not like having that liability hanging over our heads. If you go to -- I forget the name of the park, but you go in there the door, I mean, there's a gate that gets into the playground area. But if you go over to the sliding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 board, you get down hard and there's a hole like that big (indicating ) and nothing 's been done about it. And all it says is, you know, something like park closed. But it doesn't even have a gate on it. MR. KING: What park is that, Mrs. Schumacher ? MS. SCHUMACHER : It's -- MR. KING: Robinson or -- MS. SCHUMACHER : No, it's closer to the DPW. Somebody 's name, Chick Feldman. MR. KING: Chick Feldman? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes, that's it. MR. KING: Thank you. We'll check on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then I wonder if I'm going to live long enough, I mean, I know I'm close to being a dinosaur now if I'm not already , but I would like to see what is going to happen to our stormwater authority . I mean, I've been listening to this forever and when is it going to happen? I don't see anybody even doing anything . I mean, there's a study here, a study there; but I don't see anything as far as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 an authority goes. Also I've been out going door to door on petition s. And we have a very large number of homes that do not have numbers on them. And that is in the code that people are suppose d to do that. So, you know, I would hope that we would either do it or get away with the authority -- or the rule. Now, quickly, the pilot, I would like to know next week what you people are going to do to get a group together to go out and visit some of these nontaxable businesses actually and see what you can't get them to give us in lieu of paying their taxes as they are supposed to do. So I look forward to hearing how you're going to do that or maybe even you all going out during August or getting the authority -- the administration to do some visiting and tell us what happens . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. RINALDI : Yes, Good evening , Council , Dave Rinaldi , a property owner on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Colfax. I wanted to talk to you about something tonight . But before I get into that, a lot of people are talking about the values of the property up where I live on the 200 block of Colfax and the 400 block of Wheeler . Now, it's very simple for you to quantify what the harm is to the people who live there. Geisinger set the price of all of those properties . You just needed an appraisal of what they'll be worth when there's 100 foot garage there. And that is the real harm. You could ask your solicitor . You could ask Attorney Scacchitti . This is the way it's valued. So but now I want to get onto the other thing I wanted to talk to you about tonight . Last week a gentleman got up here and he talked about how he had a good life and his family had a good life working for Geisinger . And that's fine. A gentleman got up here today I guess he's in med school. And he's telling you from a perspective like a V. They're looking at it from one little point. Now what I'm suggesting is that Council should be open to look at it from above and see all the little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 points. And one point I want to make specifically is as we talked about emergency room. Now, yes, Scranton does not have enough emergency rooms, but who principally uses emergency rooms for regular medicine ? We all know. It's the poor. So great. You have a mega hospital , mega emergency rooms. Scranton will be better off. But what does that do because the gentleman last week talked about there's no hospital in Tunkhannock . There's no hospital in Honesdale . There's no hospital in Montrose . I don't know whether you spend a lot of time around the county in the rural places. But if you take a ride you'll see disaffected people because services get concentrated . This is the same thing that's happened with beverages in the United States with (inaudible ) in the United States. They all become mega monopolies , a couple of providers . And this is why these people out in the rural areas are disaffected because everything is here. They want to get here. How are they going to get here to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 emergency rooms? Are we going to have a fleet of helicopters ? Maybe drones, right, that's the future. Maybe they will bring people to the emergency rooms in drones. I mean, those are the people really that are affected. And I'm asking you. Your legacy starts now. And it starts with a very difficult situation . But as a Democrat myself and without universal healthcare , these are the problem s we're going to run into. And if you go on the side of the mega corporations who can do these to try to put other ones out of business , what you're doing is you are making it harder and harder for everyone to get the services because they are getting further and further away. And you are just -- it's contributing to the angst that's in society now. And I wish you would think about that and the overall picture . And I understand you weren't elected for Northeastern Pennsylvania . You were elected for Scranton . But please consider the fact that every decision you make here is going to have -- especially in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 healthcare is going to have an impact everywhere in Northeastern Pennsylvania . And if you consolidate it here, no one else is going to have it. They're going to all have to come here. Listen, that's great for mega money because that's what corporations do. And that's what they're looking for. The question is, do you really want to foster that and that's why I talked about before Lehigh Valley and building smaller facilities . I think that's really what we need. We need medical coverage out in the peripheries where corporation s don't think about the cost so much but the benefit . It's great for Scranton as I say. But I wish you'd consider that. That's really what I wanted to talk to you about tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Attorney Rinaldi . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. FARRELL : Timothy Farrell , North Abington Road in Clarks Green, Pennsylvania . Thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight . My name is Tim Farrell . I am a general surgeon . And I'm also the Chief of Surgery at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Geisinger Community Medical Center. As full disclosure , I am after 20 years of being in private practice in Scranton since I'm 25, I am currently a Geisinger employed physician . I'm also not a resident of the City of Scranton . My father is from Green Ridge. My mother is from South Side and although the Farrell and Scott families have lived in Scranton for more than a 100 years, I grew up in the Abington s and I live there now. I'm here today to advocate on behalf of my patients and people of northeastern Pennsylvania in favor of approval of the zoning ordinance in favor of expansion of Geisinger CMC. We've heard a lot of great counterpoints this evening . I appreciate everyone 's comments . I was here for 20 years before Geisinger was. But what impressed me most when they got here was their immediate investment in the City of Scranton and the future of healthcare of Northeastern Pennsylvania . I currently work in a 100 million dollar facility that Geisinger built upon arrival in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Scranton . We have 14 operating rooms, 19 intensive care units and praise the level of healthcare in our community . We are surround ed by healthcare systems that are failing . The imminent closure of the Moses Taylor emergency department on April 1st highlights the importance of timely expansion at Geisinger . Our expansion will focus on the areas of greatest need. We have the largest emergency room department -- or emergency room in the area. We're the only level two trauma center in the area. We have the busiest emergency department in the entire Geisinger system. But with that at 38 beds, our emergency department is less than half the size that it needs to be to the evaluate the 150 patients that we evaluate every day. The second area of our expansion involves conversion of semiprivate rooms to private rooms. I don't think any of us here today would choose to be in semiprivate room as opposed to a private room. The COVID-19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 pandemic humbled us. It reminded us how susceptible we are to infectious diseases . There's less risk of cross contamination between patients in a private room than a semiprivate room. It's also a great patient satisfier . It's also been shown that patients do better, recover quicker and have better outcome s in a private room where their safety, privacy , confidentiality can be protected . Over 100 years ago eight courageous women banded together and created the hospital that was our predecessor , Hahnemann Hospital . If we would go back and criticize one part of their vision, it would be the decision to put that hospital in the middle of a neighborhood . We can't change history but we can approve the expansion to improve healthcare to the patient s of our area. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you very much. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. O'MALLEY: My name is Barbara O'Malley and I live on Wheeler Avenue in Scranton . On March 7th, a spokesperson for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Geisinger CMC addressed City Council . She identified herself as a taxpayer in the City of Scranton . When she finished her remarks Councilman Schuster asked her for her address . She replied that she was not a resident of Scranton . So she intentionally misled the public with her taxpayer in the city inference . Whose eyes was she trying to pull the wool over? I for one, do not like being played and I doubt any of you up there like it. While technically as an employee of the city she pays the annual LST of $156. It is a far cry from the property taxes Scranton ians pay, the highest in Lackawanna County as reported in the Sunday Scranton Times. I would gladly trade my $5,000 plus tax bill with her. Is this example of pity shadiness reflective of Keystone CMC -- excuse me, Geisinger CMC business ethics? I now have a greater appreciation for my neighbor 's ongoing trust issue with Geisinger . But for me, the larger issue is whether or not the information that Geisinger administrators provide city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 official s is being manipulated as well. The hospital spokesperson blamed the struggle s at CMC on the lack of space. But there are other factors at play. In December as reported in the Scranton Times several hundred Geisinger employees including ER techs and other specialist s and professionals voted to unionize. The reasons were given that they gave were one, under staffing ; two, unsustainable patient to provider ratios; three, increased workloads ; four, staff burnout leading to low moral. Anecdotally we have been told that floors have been closed in the hospital due to lack of staff which contributes to bottlenecking and other problems . In an op-ed piece published in the Scranton Times, CMC employees expressed these sentiments . We were a community hospital long before Geisinger bought the facility . And while community is still part of our name, it doesn't feel as though community is something our administration prioritizes . Well, we as neighborhood residents and Nay Aug Park residents feel your pain. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 I ask Council , I want you to consider if CMC if they were willing to stretch the truth about the status of a taxpayer and gloss over serious staffing issues, what else are they willing to do or say to get what they want? We know that all of you are being lobbied hard by them and this administration . But please don't take everything CMC puts out there at face value. Ask questions . Ask followups. Dig deeper. Explore different perspectives . In other words, exercise due diligence on behalf of the real taxpayers of Scranton . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. O'Malley. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? ATTY. SCACCHITTI : President King, members of Scranton City Council , Edmund Scacchitti , Arthur Avenue resident for 38 years in January , also serve as a pro bono counsel for the park area residents who are opposed to the radical zoning changes that are present before you and come to a vote sometime after the public hearing which -- is it April 18th, Mr. King?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 Just on that regard before I get into some brief comments , one of the things that Tim from the Hill Neighborhood Association asked is whether or not Council is prepared to waive its rules on time limits for speaker s. Since it is a public hearing , there's going to be a presentation of evidence . I intend if I'm going to be here to present witnesses , some of whom may be expert witness es. And their testimony is going to take just more than five minutes . So I'm wondering if Council has thought about that and can it think about that between now and sometime before the public hearing so we know how to prepare . MR. KING: We're going to make -- stick with the five minutes . However , I'll try to allow for some extension to accommodate . ATTY. SCACCHITTI : My comments are predicated on a couple of news article s that we've all seen in the last week, one nationally with the failure of banks. And the pundits who have looked at the issue federal government officials , people on Wall Street attribute it to mismanagement .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 It was no small article what we read a week or two ago that Geisinger had suffered a 842 million dollar loss. Is that as a result of mismanagement , I don't know, but certainly food for thought . And if they're having that kind of financial issue presently , how if at all is that going to bear on their ability to go forward with anything that they have planned? They spent probably close to five million dollars acquiring real estate without even knowing that there's going to be a change in zoning but they did it anyway. So there may or may not be management issues there, not only at the upper echelon of hospital management but at the board level as well. Medical hospitals in this country , medicine , healthcare is a very volatile issue. So you could only look back and see what happened -- and I mention ed this to the Planning Commission down between Moses Taylor and now Regional Hospital where all of that land, all those homes were taken, razed, taken off the tax rolls and nothing ever happened. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 And that was probably 15 years ago. The other thing that I thought was interesting in the news was the tax -- MR. KING: That land is actually on the tax rolls. ATTY. SCACCHITTI : Is it back on the tax rolls? Well, it may be on the tax rolls because it's a profit -- because it's for profit, yes, I agree. But it doesn't change the fact that a whole neighborhood was wiped out. The other matter that I thought briefly with the time I have left that I thought was relevant to this argument and that's the tax burden in the City of Scranton . We are the highest taxed community in Lackawanna County. And that's not even close. The more we allow non-profits to eat up residential property and the more we reduce the tax base, the greater the burden is falling on those of us who remain. I for one have a tax bill -- someone said $5,000. I don't want to tell you what mine is but it's substantially more than $5,000. Thank the good Lord I could pay it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 But there are a lot of people who can't. And this continuing eroding of the tax base is going to destroy this community . We can't make it up. The university I believe pays $200,000 a year under a pilot program . Geisinger pays zero. They haven't offered to pay anything. Yet they are trying to tell you how much healthcare is going to be benefit ed by this development . And by the way, I for one, would be elated to have top quality healthcare in the City of Scranton , but whether it happens or not is another story. And how it happens and whether it happens at the expense of one of the most establish ed neighborhood s in the city is a whole other argument . The amendment that we propose d to the planning commission was very, very simple. It basically changes one side of one block to mirror another block by reducing the height of the garage or the structure to 45 feet from 100. Geisinger is not going to abandon their plans if you adopt that amendment . I could assure you of that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Hopefully we could work together . We've never been approach ed to discuss anything with them despite our overtures in that regard. And I hope when the times comes when we meet again we'll have a greater opportunity to express our views. MR. KING: Thank you, Attorney Scacchitti . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. I was driving through the 200 block of Railroad Avenue, and from the 200 block of Railroad Avenue there's a new -- I believe it's a new water main going in. And it goes multiple blocks all the way to the viaduct . I don't know if the holes are so deep over there and how long they've been like that but the road is really torn up. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would ask our pave cut inspector to go there tomorrow and find out who's responsible for that disaster of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 multiple blocks. It's a busy, busy area. It's pretty much the only way to come to the city from that area, but if we could find out who it is and who is responsible for it and get it repaired. And also our pave cut inspector , before they repair this road, can we find out what rules the city has as if do they contact the underneath -- some of the holes were like five and a half feet deep. So there is going to be sinking there. But they were at one point putting concrete down before they put the blacktop on top. So I'd like to know what the city's code is on that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions , sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And one other thing, I had requested Moosic Street and South Webster Avenue, multiple cars parked in the corner and it's hard for kids to cross for school. We had asked this a few weeks ago. Would you ask our traffic department what is happening up there? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. The city engineer is doing a traffic study and I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 follow up tomorrow . MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : To followup with Mr. Smurl, I was also -- had Railroad Avenue on my list of things to address tonight . So if we could just add to his request if we could reach out to the pave inspect or to get the timeline that they've been told for Railroad Avenue, have they been inspecting the current work and how they are ensuring that the restoration s are up to code and correct . Some of the codes -- some of the concerns in that area is that the utilities aren't using the sufficient binder, topcoat, etc., for that so if we could just add that to those request s. I did notice again, I brought it up I think in the fall I noticed that there were tents and other encampments along the expressway from downtown to say the Main Avenue exit where you get to North Main Avenue and to North Scranton , Tripp Park. Can we reach out to the Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 Police Department ? I know they were very quick with the last request if we could see if they could get out there and see what's going on with these encampments along the highway . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll make note of that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. As well as it seems that the houses -- I don't know if it's the last few houses on Main Avenue there, it seems like they're dumping trash possibly down that hill. So if we could send that over to code enforcement to see if there's trash being dumped down that hill say from the rear homes on Main Avenue towards the express way. I want to thank Joan for bringing something up, Private Francis Martin who's going to be laid to rest in Arlington . It's my understanding that some of his family members are going out to attend that service . It's great that they found this man and that some of the family members will get some closure . He was killed in France on January 16, 1945. I think original ly they thought it was in a different area, but thanks to DNA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 studies they found out where it actually was and were able to piece that together . So it's great to hear that for his family. So it goes out to his family as well as thank you, Joan, for bringing that up. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just have a couple quick updates . The first one being something I had mention ed a couple of times regarding Bloom Avenue which is a pretty narrow street and DPW trucks were having trouble getting through the street as a result and vehicles were parking on both sides. So we were requesting that a study be complete d. And there were recommendations in the study for it to be changed to parking just on one side of the street. So next week I was made aware that we will be receiving legislation to make that change there on Bloom Avenue. And secondly , we had some complaint s about permit parking signs being needed and other signs as well. And the new sign machine that was received still is not operating yet. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 I think they need to get some software updates from IT before they can use it to create the new signs. But they were at least able to find one extra parking sign that can be added to where it was missing on Vine Street. But there is still plenty of other signs that need replacing throughout the city. So I'm hopeful that they will get that up and running very soon. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I mean, all I have tonight is just I'd like to forward two public comments . The first one, Mr. Voldenberg , being see if we can get some more police presence in the Green Ridge neighborhood , okay. And secondly , safety inspection s for the parks, I think I remember last year some were done by the previous parks director . Can we verify that? And in addition to that let's see if there's a list, you know, 60 degrees today so everybody is looking forward to getting out there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 Let's see if this is going to happen throughout the city and all the parks are inspected for safety. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to Mr. West in the morning . MR. MCANDREW : That's all I have. Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few answers from last week. Joan Hodowanitz , per Matt Domines , the City Finance Director and Larry West, the BA, the legislation for the new auditor Clifton LarsonAllen, LLP is anticipated to be present ed to Council by the end of March or the first week of April. They'll let Council know if anything comes up that affects this anticipated timeframe . Mark Migliore , ECTV message to Council , last week ECTV tested the use of a public address speaker facing the gallery seats to alleviate ongoing audio concerns . The test was successful . ECTV is now sourcing an appropriate speaker for the job. And it will be permanently in place within the next few weeks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 Fay Franus, we are still awaiting response from both DPW and Business Administrator office related to DPW supervisor overtime for 2022 and 2023 to date. The electronic doors that was mentioned earlier , I'm told are set to be open each Tuesday from 5:15 p.m. to 8:05 p.m., for Council caucus and meeting s. So I don't know what happened , Marie, last week. I apologize for that. But I'm told 8:05 is when they lock down. But apparently that didn't happen last week because obviously you would have gotten through . A reminder the zoning ordinance public hearing is being moved from April 11th to April 18th at 5:45 p.m., in these chambers . There was an executive session held prior to this meeting tonight to discuss litigation , negotiations , and personnel issues. Also, the pocket park on the corner of Linden and Wyoming finally got started today. I'm sure Joan walked by there and saw the machines down there. So we've been waiting patient ly for that to happen. We thank Scranton Tomorrow for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 getting that project rolling and we look forward to its completion very soon. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King, can I say one more thing? MR. KING: Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. While we're on answers , thank you, Frank, for getting some answers. We did get a reply back from DPW about Rubicon . So last week I asked a few question s about Rubicon . So the first one was, what are the savings to the city at this point in time and the answer that I got back is we cannot calculate savings because we have not implement ed the new optimized routes. The timing for the routes is going to start the first or the second week of April. So they won't be able to calculate any savings until the routes have been started . And the second question I asked was, have the routes for refuse collection been solidified through the Rubicon system. The answer was, it's a work in progress . Rubicon lost some key personnel but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 they are getting caught up. They are still within the timeframe of the contract for implementation . And last question I asked, well, it's a several part question but -- and an update on the 11 yard truck. Are we now using the truck for route pickups and have we received the 520 yard trucks. And the answers that we got back were, we're negotiating the disposition of the 11 yard truck and truck isn't currently being used. We should have one of our 20 yard trucks delivered next week and the remaining four by the end of April. So with that being said, Frank, can we reach out DPW and ask for clarification on what is the negotiating the disposition of the 11 yard truck, what does that mean? And let me know if I'm correct with this, with the DPW overtime , were we request ed to put a right to know in to get that information ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out again in the morning . I hope it won't be necessary but I will if need be. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 MR.
