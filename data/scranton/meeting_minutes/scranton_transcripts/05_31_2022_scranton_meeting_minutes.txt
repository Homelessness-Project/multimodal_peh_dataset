MR. DONAHUE : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Here. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. OVERTIME REVIEW FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY. CONTROLLER DATED MAY 26, 2022 FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY THROUGH MAY 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? I just have one. I would like to wish my wife a happy anniversary . I'm sure she loves the fact that I'm here tonight but here we are. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton City resident . It's May 31st, day 151 of the calendar year. Forty-one percent of the year is gone. Do we have any status on the negotiations for the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they're still ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : I came in this morning at 10:00 for the opening of the bid on the RFQ for special labor Council . Surprise , surprise , there was only one bid made and that was by Ufberg and Associations . So we'll see if legislation is forthcoming . Here's what's surprising , Ufberg's contract ran out on March 31st. So they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 operating under an extension . The RFK was not published in the -- the RFQ was not published in the paper until May 12th. And I don't understand why we wait until contracts expire to publish an RFQ. That makes no sense. And we're also in the middle of labor negotiations . It's just not the way to run a railroad . Just in this case before I forget, the Clerical Union Contract still has not been posted to the City's website . And also, May 31st, if we operating by the Home Rule Charter , today would be the day that the 2021 audit would be due. Figure the odds. Okay, Item 5-H, raising Eileen Cipriani compensation by 35,000 to $100,000. Now, you know, I mean, that caught my eye. And I wanted to see what her current compensation was. When the 2022 budget was first proposed , she was making in 2021 $56,000. And she was proposed to go up to $80,000. Well, that didn't happen. It settled down to $65,000. And I understand that this compensation increase is not coming out of City funds. It's coming out of ARPA. And it's going to be a $35,000 increase for the next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 five years. So I have no issue there. But I looked at the legislat ive backup and a couple interesting things which they published . One was that designating a ARPA Director -- they're going to have her as OECD Executive Director and the ARPA Director . Designating an ARPA Director at the City is necessary to direct the work of all such contractors . That's the contractors working on ARPA and to ensure that the City does not lean too heavily on contractors . That's a statement in itself. And then it says further down, Eileen Cipriani has already demonstrated a willingness to work well beyond the required 40 hours per week for the City. We have the utmost confidence that under this new arrangement she will put in the extra hours needed to expertly perform the functions of both ARPA Director and Community Development Director . Now, this $35,000 increase , that's a 54 percent increase over $65,000. If a 40-hour work week includes 54 percent , she would be working 61.6 hours per 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 week for five years. Let's assume as they say that she works well beyond the 40 hours. Let's say she works 50 hours a week. 54 percent increase would have her working 77 hours a week for five years. Now, I'm sorry, she's going to need to delegate some of her function s to her subordinates . And they're going to have to pick up the slack. She can't be working that many hours. It almost like -- I'm sorry, it's looking like she didn't get her $80,000 so let's do this instead . And that makes me feel very uncomfortable getting around the budget that way if that's, in fact, what is happening . I'll be interested to hear your comments in Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I'm going to start off what an appropriate conversation to have with the pool to be 100 degrees outside . It was just very appropriate tonight that there was so much discussion about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the pools. And I brought the paper and I have to give the inquirer kudos for the wonderful information that they put in the Sunday's paper. It just went on and on and on about the various things -- the conditions of the pools, the money that's going to be spent. So I brought the paper thinking that we were going to talk about that tonight . But a lot more information was shared. I'm just sorry that I couldn't have a copy of what was shared and all. But I wasn't sure if it was on the City website that I could have printed it off. But I didn't see anything . And I know the Mayor apologized for not having slides but sitting there and just hearing you talk about it, I would have liked to have had a copy to see exactly what and where you were with the discussion . One of the things that I did talk about as you were going through the discussion was the maintenance of the pool and my neighbor Barb showed me that one of the sheets that was distributed tonight does show the maintenance cost that will be associated with the pool. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 A lot of talk about the splash pools. Now as a senior citizen , I cannot see myself going in a splash pool. I could not see myself just in 3 feet of water. So I have to hope that they're going to go and really take all the suggestions and make it sort of inclined so it does goes to 8 feet or 7 feet of water. You know, 3 feet is fine, but not for the whole entire pool. So I hope that that is something that will be taken into consideration so that we, you know, you talk about the young ones, the teenagers but also for the senior citizens . We want something as well to cool off. The last thing that I went to at the park before they closed the pool, they had senior night. And it was unfortunate it wasn't well-attended as I would have liked but it was a great night. And we were able to have the pool all to ourselves. But that night I remember feeling that the lining in the pool, you know, it was throwing you off balance because it was just all bubbly-bubbly with the water underneath it. So, you know, we do like to know that there will be something there for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 us as well and not just a splash pool. The other thing I wanted to talk about tonight was I had talked a little bit with Jessica . We went back and forth with information . I saw on our City website that there's this tag -- tab that you could go in and put events on the City website . So I went in and I clicked on the events and a form comes up but I couldn't go any further . So I was just wondering , like, how do I get an event on the City website ? What we're working on right now is the Electric City Flower show which will be August the 6th. And I want to start getting the publication , you know, getting in as much advertisement for this event. It's something that is new for the City and it will be their first time doing this. But I would sure like to have it on the City website. And I think I sent Jessica the flyer that we're going to be -- that we have developed . And I will be printing it off and giving it to you. But I think Council is on vacation in August, is it? Yeah, so I'll have all of July to talk about the Electric City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Flower Show. And my one final thing in my one minute left. I have to think about Ron Ellman. And, you know, a couple nights I wasn't here. I had conflicts . But my heart goes out to him. He comes here along with all of us. And he has such a heart for his neighborhood and the things that he goes through as far as living there, you know, as a senior citizen and have to put up with the things that he has to put up with. So I say kudos to him that he continue s to come here to City Council . And I know that you said you were going to look into some of his issues. So I just hope that that's true and you'll go through and help him in his neighborhood . I'm not sure exactly what part of Main Avenue he's on. But he always has such a heart where he lives. And I remember something sticking out in my mind is that he said his boys don't want the house. And I thought , wow, it's probably the house that they grew up in and they don't want any parts of it because of the neighborhood . So help him out, okay? That's all I have to say. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list Doris Koloski . The TV can't get you if you don't come up to the -- MS. KOLOSKI : I'm sorry. I do agree the pool needs to be bigger so people could jump in on the side. I didn't hear everything because with the backs to us, I couldn't understand some of it. So if I ask you a question that is totally out of it, that's why. I was wondering first about the bathhouse. Is that a requirement for the grants because I don't think we've had one for quite a while. I could be wrong on that. But most of the people in the neighborhood , they just stick their bathing suits - their clothes on over the bathing suit and leave. You know, and the ones in the neighborhood just walk home in their bathing suits. So if that's not a requirement it's kind of a waste of money in my opinion . The other thing I was kind of confused about and it might have been what you talked about. I thought that where the large pool that used to have the diving boards they took down years ago, I thought that was going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the splash pad and the size of the middle pool was going to be the new pool, the one where the slide was. And there was kind of going to be like at the other end where they had the pump house and all that, that is where all the stuff would be stored in the pump house with the equipment . So I didn't hear any of that plan option A, option B because I was just coming in. So was that -- was that what that was sizewise or -- MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, we can -- so we can get you a copy of what was given to us tonight before you leave. But, yes, the splash pad was going to go where the lap pool was. And then the new pool would go where the current pool is -- where the old pool with the water slide was. MS. KOLOSKI : Yeah, that's what I thought . MR. DONAHUE : And then it's all just a matter of square footage and also like we brought up tonight a -- MS. KOLOSKI : Well, I'm glad a pool is -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. DONAHUE : But the question I asked about the bathhouse was, you know, as the pools got bigger, so did the bathhouse . I didn't know if that was a requirement of, you know, a grant or whatnot. MS. KOLOSKI : I have the feeling -- I was wondering many years ago there was a bathhouse with the little showers outside that you pulled the string and then you went in the bathhouse and the City CETA children that didn't qualify for a lifeguard they worked it. But if you have a bathhouse and you don't really need it, then we don't have to waste money on it. I mean, you're not only talking about the bathhouses and changing room, but if you've ever walked in them, if you don't have someone there cleaning up, I mean, it's paper and mess and everything all over. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. KOLOSKI : And that would be a whole other area unless you're reintroducing the CETA program . That's all I have to say. I'm keeping it short and sweet. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Doris. MR. KING: If you recall though, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 that bathhouse was much bigger initially , like, back when I was kid back in the 80s or 70s. And then whey they redid the pool, it got much smaller. So now it seems like maybe that could be an area where it doesn't have to be as large as what was discussed . MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . First off, I wasn't here last week. My thought s and prayers go out to the families in Texas that lost children in that senseless killing. It just breaks my heart. And I have a 14-month-old granddaughter . And I pray every day that nothing happens to her. She's not in school yet. But something 's got to be done. And maybe this isn't the forum, but I have to say this. The only way this is going to get done is vote every Republican out on election day. They're the ones holding up gun control . And their excuse is it's mental health. Well, if it's mental health, don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 make AR-15s and AK-47s available for them to buy. We have to do away with those weapons . It was on the news last week, the national news. I didn't hear the countries , but a number of years of ago there were two killings like that in two countries . They passed gun control and they haven't had a killing since. We need gun control . And the only way we do it is put all Democrats in there. They just care about themselves , their self-interest and the NRA. A couple of days after, that idiot Donald Trump, these kids just got killed and he's speaking at the NRA Convention . It shows where his interest is. So anyway, this isn't the forum. On election day vote all of these Republicans out of office before it happens in our City. These military style weapons should not be in the hands of anybody . They're for military , not the normal person on the street. Do away with them and we'll do away with these killings . We're the only country in the world they said on the news last week that this is happening in. There is no other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 country in the world dealing with these issues. What does that tell you? You got to put politics aside and get this country safe. All right. That's my rant on that. Last fall I brought up about the supervisor for DPW coming and painting lines on the corner. He said they'd come back before the cold weather . Well, they didn't come back. And now it's summer and so far, the corner hasn't been fixed yet. So I hope they're listening because I know Tom Preambo told me he always watches these meeting s. I hope they're watching because it's got to be done. Second thing, last Sunday's paper I saw the story about all the parks. I didn't realize we had so many parks in the City. A couple questions about Tripp Park, the one thing they want to do is install a speed table on Dorothy Street for traffic economy . Does anybody know what a speed table is? MR. DONAHUE : I don't. But I'll find out. MR. SPINDLER : I know there is speed bumps. I never heard of a speed table. I don't know they could slow the traffic down.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MS. SCHUSTER : It think it's probably going to be the crosswalk that's a little wider that I don't know -- it's probably about a foot wide. This is going to be probably a 4 or 5 foot wide speed table. MR. SPINDLER : And another thing, consider Dorothy Street one way. I think that will be a good idea because they talked about that when they were putting the Isaac Tripp School. The buses were suppose d to come up Dorothy Street and down Bulwer Street. That never came about. But I think making Dorothy Street one way would be a good idea, especially when they are playing ball down there. It's so congested . So a one-way street would make it a lot less congested . Lastly, I was listening about the pools. And did I hear correct that they're going to put synthetic turf in between the splash pad and the pool? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. SPINDLER : I don't think that's a good idea. If any of you watch baseball games on TV, synthetic turf gets very, very hot in the summer. I was watching a game last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 where they said a year ago at Veteran 's Stadium in Philadelphia , they said the synthetic turf was 148 degrees on the turf. So a lot of kids want to go lay on that. They're going to get burned or just walking on that. Just put regular grass in. It's a lot cooler. And it's probably less money. Synthetic turf is a really bad idea. That's my opinion . It's a fact. It's a lot hotter. The baseball players used to complain their feet would be burning right through their cleats standing on that turf. Anyway, that's my opinion . That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . I hope I didn't bother nobody sitting back there eating my Rolos. I love Rolos. Just as I was coming in here, a lady walking down the alley with some books asked me why I wear sunglasses all the time. It's because I squint so bad. I can't -- I don't like light. I guess I ruined my eyes wearing sunglasses . So I wouldn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 advise it. I like dark. I probably do my best work in dark. But I don't know. Anyway, if that makes anybody feel better. Probably some of you notice over the years, I'm not an overly religious person. The last time I was in church was the afternoon of 911. I went to church in Hanover . I felt so bad that day. And lately there is so many adversities , this Putin, so many tragedies . And I'd have to agree with Les about these big guns. I wouldn't take guns away from people but they're not necessary to me. I was in the service . And we didn't have -- the Air Force, we didn't have any guns. But on the planes they had 50 caliber guns, which would destroy something . My son years ago had an Israeli made machine gun. The shells cost about 60 cents a piece then. And I wanted to shoot it. And I did like that (indicating ) and I guess like 20 shells come out. They're just not necessary . I don't remember what he did with it. He probably traded it for some dope or something then. I don't know. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 This week I listened to these armchair generals at the Taurus Club, their solutions to everything . I don't know where they get the information . They were talking about in Arizona and Texas warehouses full of baby food that is only can go to the illegal 's babies. Several of them saw it someplace . I didn't. But after I left church, I'm still full of hate for everything . I hate hate mongrels . I hate Putin. All I do 24/7, the paper is full of hate. Letters to the editor from Sandra Myers and all her admirers , they hate Trump and the Republicans . It just doesn't stop, the access to it. Kelly writes hate. He doesn't give up sometimes on his subject matter. I don't know. Anyway, I'm glad I got up and went to church. And I'm going to start doing it more often. Maybe I get rid of some of this -- I'll tell you one thing, since I dropped the cable a couple weeks ago, I've read some books -- well, magazines . And I really feel a lot better. I'm saving $2,000 a year. And after a few days of missing all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 my regular programs , I'm not a big television watcher anyway. I didn't miss it. I wish more people would -- I got a letter today from Dish asking me to come back, which surprised me. More people need to drop them and view the world. And while I think of it, I was glad to see sister Paige here tonight . I wish she'd put more emphasis on the parks and all. I love the parks and the City. Can I say something real quick? MR. DONAHUE : Real quick. Real quick. Your time's up. MR. ELLMAN: For years I've been bringing apples to the deer off of Parker Street. Last week I had two little bags of apples. I don't know if they cost $5 or $6 or something . I walked way out in the woods with Shelby{phonetic } my little puppy, threw the apples on the ground and this -- where nobody goes. Here's a couple followed me out there. So I turned around and said hi and I'm walking and Shelby wouldn't walk. So I turned around to see why. This man picked up one of my apples I threw for the deer. So we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 had some words. I just had a fit about that. How can you be so cheap to pick up apples for the deer, you know? Anyway, he's wearing this blue T-shirt. I picked up my cane at the bottom. I was going to smack him. One of us go to jail, the other one go to the hospital . But his girlfriend called him off of me. So I guess we could call it an even. MR. DONAHUE : A draw. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . On the pools, the answer years ago that I heard on a bathhouse is you have to have a certain size bathhouse to accommodate the size of the pool. So that may be another imperative . The bathhouse that was torn down as far as I remember wasn't the greatest . But it wasn't the worst. And when I was up there with kids swim free with the Taxpayers Association , I started going to a different bathroom because people were dressing in there. And it was just so tight that it was ridiculous . And that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 activist portrayed it as a pork barrel situation . So I don't know the full (inaudible ) but that's something to look into. They may be just telling you the truth that we need a bathhouse. And I also favor pools more so than splash pads. That's okay for the kids. But I don't even swim myself. But the people that want to, I don't see anything wrong with spending some money on a pool if we have it. On COVID, I'm already on my fourth vaccination . And I have friends that just can't see the light. He was called a murderer by a couple that worked at a hospital . I tried to explain to him and explain to him that what these people are working 12 and 16-hour shifts trying to keep people alive. And a lot of people don't see the point in vaccinations and masks or anything else. And it's really a shame. It's really a shame. Get out and get vaccinated . It's only a little pinch. And the first one or two times you might feel a little uncomfortable . But if you can, there is no medical reason you can't do it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 And once again, I'd like to mention that it is time for Pennsylvania , the state to kick in on all of these properties going off the rolls. It's going to be a must. Can't just keep paying for the whole county or the whole area to have institutions , government institutions , and what have you, all kinds of tax exempt institutions to just move in and take more and more land up. And as far as my Democrat friends , the only thing that is important to me after January 1st of 2021 was voting, and that was it. The aid packages were fine and dandy. But we have to make sure that voting is fair, easy, and possible . We don't need elections where people are standing in line for 12 hours. And it's happened in many states and it may happen here with the person that's going for Governor . I mean, really forget about him. Oh, I just want to mention a few weeks ago I said about the people at the border, well, the reason those people are at the border is because we did not get a global initiative on family planning . And that's all there is to it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 These population s in South America , Africa, South Asia have doubled and tripled over 50 years. We had enough time and they're standing at the border now. The chicken s are home to roost. So don't blame the next guy. Don't blame the next guy because it's your fault for being anti family planning . And there's a -- quickly , Teddy Roosevelt is on a five-hour documentary tonight . We're missing the first half. But I seen it already . And I might be ducking out. Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . That exhausts our sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, from the caucus, I don't know why after six, seven, eight months that this -- actually since the last president was on Council basic pool questions are not even answered . I mean, first thing you do is how big do we want this pool? It's not a big concept to go, you know what, I'd like to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 into it and be able to swim or be up to my neck. We are now seven, eight, nine months into it and we're finally figuring out that a 3 foot pool just is not what we want. I think it was kicked down the road for too long. And things were too unclear because it should not have taken this long to get an idea of where the pool should be. I like the idea of the splash pad having beach type showers where there are little boxes that you press on the button and the shower comes down. That would lessen the foot pad on the inside while still allowing shower facilities on the outside for someone who doesn't want to go in there. He just wants to take a quick rinse off and be done with it. For caucuses , it's for public that these caucuses are out here. They're under the Sunshine Act because they're the method for making decision s for the government. We need to have that documentation per the Sunshine Act uploaded 24 hours before these meeting s so the people who come to these meeting s have the documentation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 and can review it because this is for the public's information as well. And without those being put up 24 hours beforehand for these caucuses , it leaves the public completely void of anything , especially with the sound system as known in here is substandard and for people who are hearing impaired have trouble actually hearing what's going on. And I did check and none of those documents were online. Pump houses need to be separate . Obviously they need to be separate because there's high pressure water going in there. And they're chemicals . You don't want to store your chemicals in the same building as you have showers or any other facility . So they do have to be in a separate contained building just because they are dangerous chemical s that are regulated . Now, for the Recovery Act funds, I don't know if any of you looked at Wilkes-Barre, but they're having a problem now because Wilkes-Barre allocated funds -- the City Council and gave the Mayor's office permission to use them and they expect that the Mayor would return back to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 City Council when she was getting ready to distribute those or he. I don't know if it's he or she, the Mayor is. But the problem is, they wound up spending them. And now City Council is completely devoid of input because they gave carte blanche to it by saying the Mayor could choose what to do with that money without coming back. And I think a lot of the stuff in these documents now that have been passed have put the Mayor as discretionary and have not put a review process in place. 3-A, what I see in the document is the overtime for the LIPS is already exhausted its funds for the year. 5-F, about scalers. I see nothing that we are doing for the -- it's a cooperative agreement . I see nothing that says that as part of the cooperating agreement that the City is reimbursed for anything . So we're offering a service through a cooperative agreement , and I don't see any mechanism there where the City is getting paid or reimbursed for that workload . 5-H, we see the new director to help the OECD, the director . I see prior we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 four positions planned . And now we changed that from fall of 2021 it included four full-time positions . Now it's reduced to two full-time position s. I guess two cut positions pays for this director . That being said, you also are listed as 1099 contractors . How is the money for contractors going to come back to the City? How does it pay the residents ? How does it keep people in this City employed ? When we keep taking money that's meant for this City and sending it to contractors outside of the City and taking four jobs and reducing them to two to save money and to push it elsewhere, we rob our own community of jobs that should be here from funds that were meant to help this community . I just don't see putting a director in place is reasonable . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. KING: Just a couple comments I'd like to thank I guess it was Bob Gattens and his group of volunteers that were involved with those hometown hero flags that went up in South Scranton and East Mountain and all throughout the neighborhood throughout the City honoring our veterans . And I thought that that -- it really kind of -- it was great to be able to honor those who fought for us and for our freedoms . And my uncle and my father were two of them. And I just think it was so nice and just really looks great in the neighborhoods on the City streets . So I just want to applaud all of them, everyone who was involved in that project . I thought it was excellent . Once again, I do want to commend the DPW for all the work that is being done with the paving projects around the City and filling pothole s as requests are submitted . They are doing an excellent job. And I see that Cherry Street has been completed . East Elm Street is just about done up on East Mountain and Roland Avenue, and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 they started milling around Mountain Lake which was really, really bad. So they're doing a great job and taking care of the infrastructure underneath with the water issues prior to doing the paving. So I appreciate that. And to kind of echo Mr. Coyne's comments , I've been on Council now for five months. That was the first I've seen that proposal this evening . So I, you know, I was, you know, I didn't even have a minute to contemplate it until I was sitting here. So that's why I was kind of surprised it was like a 3 foot pool on there. So I was glad I had the opportunity to add some input and, you know, once again, you know, it sounds like a number of my colleagues here on Council would like to see -- and from what I heard from some of the public that we would like to have a swimming pool up there. And that's important . And not only as Norma Jeffries pointed out for the teenager s and the young kids but also for, you know, adults and senior citizens have the opportunity to go out and fully enjoy our park just as we had years ago. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 If we're going to make that kind of investment I think into our city and into parks, let's make sure we do it right. That's all I ask. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, a couple. So just to piggyback on Mr. King's statement s, if we are going to make the investment on the facilities up at Nay Aug, I do think that all ages should be able to partake in the facilities that are there. So, I mean, I'm in favor of getting a traditional style pool there so all ages can use it. So it's been some time since we got that. It was good to hear what the updates have been. We did have a presentation in the past about the pool which had seemed to change from the first presentation to the second presentation . So I would like to see what the input that was put in tonight and what comes back to us in the next week or so. There were a couple -- Mr. Voldenberg , there were a couple e-mails that came in. I'm sure other Council members 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 forward ed these along, 632, 634 Harrison Avenue we had complaints about grass and cats. I think you were also included on that e-mail. We had an e-mail sent over about the Theodore Street bridge. And I got another address today on the way over here. It was the corner of Wyoming Avenue and Green Ridge Street across from the church there. The grass is really tall. And if we could send that over to code enforce ment for them to take a look at it. Other than that, Solicitor Gallagher , did Mr. Cutillo reach out and give us a response after your May 24th e-mail on labor billing ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : I asked him to contact me concerning any redactions . But he did not contact me. And I didn't get a chance. I saw him here earlier . But I didn't get a chance to speak with him. I'll reach out to him tomorrow again and see where we're going with that. MS. SCHUSTER : Okay. So we haven't heard back since May 24th about the billing . ATTY. GALLAGHER : I don't believe so. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just real quick on Harrison . I received that complaint as well in the 600 block. And there have been several complaints I've been receiving regarding multiple issues along Harrison Avenue for years now. And I try my best to stay up on the complaint s and the properties as much as I can because it's my neighborhood . I feel like I have an added responsibility towards it. And with the Committee for Community Development that I'm Chair of, it's frustrating that a lot of changes have not been made. And I would like to make a request to have another walk-through of Harrison Avenue with the new inspector that covers that area because I know there was someone who was recently hired. And I just want to make them aware of it. And there is honestly just too many to send along because it's something every single block going from at least the 2, 300 block of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Harrison all the way up to the 700 block and its main through way through the City. So it's important to me that I do that again with the new inspector and they could put out door tags for whatever hasn't already been addressed . I know many of them are put into the system. But nothing 's being done about them. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out in the morning , Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. I appreciate that. And just to note from our conversations earlier from the caucus, I was happy to see that the options that were included do have a pool because I know from earlier options we had received that there was at least one option that was just a splash pad. And I know none of us were in favor of that. But I don't feel that a 3 foot pool would be sufficient enough. I would certainly want to see something at least 8 feet. But, you know, we can certainly be on the size ultimately I do understand it needs to fit into a budget. And we don't have all the money that we would like to spend towards this. But I want to make sure that it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 worth our while for the City and for the people who will be utilizing the park and the pool complex . I would like to see some more details on what would be included . It's been a while since this study. And I'm not sure if everything in these options were taken from the original study. But, for example , what would be in the bathhouse that's proposed as of now because my question during the caucus for those who couldn't hear was is the bathhouse something that is a priority to be completed . As of right now the Mayor responded that it is, in fact, a priority and the current structure is not going to be useable with a -- once a splash pad and new pool is in place. And because there are other options that -- additional add-ons they included a list of for us that could be funded later on, which included ideas of like a volleyball court, basketball court, tennis courts, pickleball and a wellness loop which I think are all great ideas and understand may not need to come first. At least we want to get this going with the water features and put a splash pad in and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 a pool. That's all I have for now. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have some comment s. So I'll start with the pool. So I'm a type of guy that looks at what's need to have versus nice to have, all right? I think we've already decided that we need a pool, right? We've been talking about this for the three years I'm on Council and I never heard it was going to be 3 feet deep, which I feel is ridiculous . So we need a pool. Is it nice to have, some volleyball courts? Is it nice to have some artificial turf? Is it nice to have splash pads? Well, we have a splash pad. We got one last year. And from what I'm reading in the paper, McDade Park is going to become a splash pad. So do we -- which is very accessible to everybody in the City. So, I mean, let's cut back on the nice to haves and focus on the need to have which is a pool that will serve everybody and every generation . It can't just be 3 feet. And also about funding , I know the Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 mention ed a couple of times to us how are we going to fund it, what are our ideas to fund it. Maybe I'm incorrect but our role is to approve the funding . It's the administration 's job to find the funding and the OECD Director . So with that said, I'll entertain any ideas how to fund it. I threw my own out there or pitched one. But we talked about this for three years. I expected more work to be done. I expected more answers. So I'm looking forward , you know, this looks like we're moving forward . But they're my thoughts on the Fifth Order -- I'm sorry, on the pool. Secondly , so last week I brought up a concern . Some resident s came to me about the West Scranton Skate Park as it relates to upkeep and regular maintenance of the park because I got a bunch of complaint s that it was in disrepair , you know, it was in pretty bad shape. So I asked, you know, where we at with that and the status of it regarding the next steps plan to improving the park outside 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 of just regular maintenance . So I'm happy to report that I received -- I want to thank Mr. Voldenberg because he sent this inquiry for me that the Jackson Street Park will receive weekly routine maintenance and upkeep since I've implement ed a schedule and assigned parks to our team. I was there this week while my team performed duties. I was able to get valuable feedback from a few concerned resident s that live next to the park. We are assessing the building onsite and determining the direction of the park currently . I could attach the park's assessment guidance and suggested improvements . These aren't the extent of the plans of the park but used as a resource when discussing the long-term plans, direction , grant opportunities , etc. I will bring back feedback as I receive this week to our next discussion . So this is from our new parks director -- Director of Parks and Recreation , Marissa Duffy. So I thank her for the immediate response . And I already know some of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 residents are thrilled because , you know, I was able to mention back that we have something for you and I'll report out tonight . And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just briefly , Mr. Voldenberg , did we get a response regarding my question s to the Fire Department on responding to calls outside city limits? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as of this afternoon , Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Okay, thank you. Second off, I know Mr. Schuster mentioned the six -- and Dr. Rothchild mentioned Harrison Avenue. One of the things that was brought up in this e-mail, which I've gotten a lot of complaint s about across the City is people feeding stray cats. I know they are probably thinking they are doing a good thing. But I think sometimes it creates more harm in a neighborhood than it does any benefit . So I really do think we need to look into putting some restriction s of the feeding of stray cats, especially in neighborhoods that are more close together . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Also, I got a complaint about the area of Mineral Avenue and Silex Street which is down off of Olive Street. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'll give this to you and if you would be able to forward this complaint to Code Enforcement for them to go and check it out. And that's all I have this evening . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

ROTHCHILD : On the question , I was just wondering because of the name of who this is going to be transferred to, I'm wondering what type of business or what the restaurant name this is being transferred to. I wasn't unable to find more of the details in the backup. Does anyone else have that information ? If not, could we find out, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I could find out, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Yeah, because it states the owner but not what place it's -- MR. DONAHUE : So I think that might be something in that new building by the bowling lanes there that would be the 820 range there. But we'll find out the exact name. DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, but I want to know what the business is. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just in terms of, you know, the area where it is there. Anyone else on the question ?

SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I think that's a good idea because I think this one was applied for last year and it wasn't granted . But they were applied for.

MR. KING: Okay. MR. DONAHUE : I don't believe anything 's changed but we could take a look at that too. But based off of the backup, it said it just was a renewal of the MOU that's already been in place. MS. SCHUSTER : Yes, I think it would be a good idea to ask if anything has changed from the MOU that's expiring in 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to reach out and see if anything has changed with the MOU we have compared to the one we're currently operating under? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. SCHUSTER : And this one, it might not be totally fitting for this resolution , but when we're looking at the trucks that are moving off of Railroad Ave, Third Ave., in that section there in the Bellevue section , can we look into whether anything could be put into this that would help us to regulate the traffic that's moving 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 through that area any different ly than we are now?

MCANDREW : On the question , so I have a problem also like some of the residents who spoke tonight . First of all, for Mrs. Cipriani -- and this is nothing personal . I voted no for appointment because she didn't want to move into the City. I voted no for the waiver to allow her to work here and not live in the City. So also, I mean, I'm not going to be a hypocrite . How can I vote now to allow her to receive $100,000 and still not live here? All right, in addition to that, so we have money for this ARPA Director . I would like that -- I would like to hire a director over five years with laser beam focus on disbursing these funds, all right, not just another position combined because let's not forget, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Mrs. Cipriani is -- she's the head of OECD. But she's also the heads of the LIPS Department slash Code Enforcement Office. All right. So she has a lot on her plate and then another position , I think it might be too much. And it's nothing personal -- too much for her to complete in a day with these three oversight positions . So I'll be voting no for all of them reasons combined . MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I have some of the same concerns . Can we also if this resolution gets introduced tonight , can we also reach out to the administration to see what hours Mrs. Cipriani will be allocating towards OECD, Code Enforcement , and the ARPA Director if she is in that position so we could just get a beat on what she would do during the regular work week for each of these positions . MR. DONAHUE : Just on that I agree, but it is my understanding that there are time sheets that have to be kept in terms of how federal money is spent so it's not -- you know, so it's used properly , especially when you are separating , you know, code enforce ment part with the CDBG money that funds the majority of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 her salary now. So I think that the time sheets are a requirement that she has to keep. But we'll have -- we could look into seeing what that is. MS. SCHUSTER : I mean, with that request , we could also do how much time did she dedicate to OECD versus LIPS, Code Enforcement . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I will be voting in favor of this. I do have a question about the amount of compensation how that was determined based on how many hours of work. I would like a response to that. However , I believe that she's already been doing some of this work. And I think that people should be compensated properly for their work. I don't see it as a raise. But if she's doing this work in addition to her current job, then I understand there being additional compensation . And it would also save us on ARPA money that could be utilized for other things rather than ARPA Director salary of $100,000 that was pointed out in the backup.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 But, of course, we want to make sure that the amount of time needed for that position could be dedicate d to it with just it being added onto the responsibility that she already has. So I'll be looking forward to some of those responses . But as of now, I'm in agreement . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I'll be voting yes on this for introduction with the hope that we're going to get some these questions answered prior to ultimately Seventh Order. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ?

MR. DONAHUE : What is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MS. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so last week I posed some questions that I needed to make an informed decision on final vote. I voted to introduce. But I asked three questions . And they were outside of the TAN, will PFM assist in other current and future financial matters. And what are these advisory services ? The second question was, did PFM's work end or pause following the TAN process and City exit from Act 47 and why the pause? And the third one, is a four-year contract necessary with PFM. I also asked in addition to that, would there be a cap, how much we're going to pay them or is there a ceiling ? So with that said, Mr. Voldenberg did a great job. You sent this correspondence knowing that I wanted this information to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 an informed decision on behalf of the resident s for final passage . So what did we received back today from the new Director of Finance ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. McAndrew , we were advised that the information would be forth coming. However , we did not receive as of the meeting . MR. MCANDREW : Right. So the e-mail stated I was going to get it today from the Finance Director . He was waiting on Mr. West's approval to allow this information to get to me. So with that, like I said earlier , you know, these are reasonable requests . These are reasonable questions . But without the answers , I can't make an informed decision on behalf of the taxpayer s. So I'll be voting no. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Well, on the question with that being said, I would like to make a motion to table. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor to table Item 7-A. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 mean, I'm going to vote no to table because I should have had this information . This isn't the first time that I asked question s and have correspondence sent to the departments seeking information where I either never get it or I get it weeks or I get the wrong information or half of it. So unfortunately , I will be voting no to table because I just think I shouldn 't have to wait this long. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , I just have -- my question would be is this a new service or an existing service ? So if we can forward that request along too with Mr. McAndrew 's questions ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much, Mr. Voldenberg . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I will be voting yes on the motion to table just to allow for more time for a response because I am interested in the responses to these questions prior to voting. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 question ? All those in favor of tabling Item 7-A signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye.
