Mostcitizens whoappear heretoaddress you areconcerned aboutfinancial matters .I'm notsaying thatthoseconcerns are unimportant ,butIcomebefore youtodetail theelderabusethatcontinues togoonin thiscitywithyourassention .I'mtalking aboutexploitation ,control ,andfinancial rapeoftheelderly . In2012whenClover Management testified inpublic hearings before this bodytheyfraudulently toldcouncil that theysought abuilding andoperating permit andaten-yeartaxabatement forasenior apartment complex thatwouldoffer "affordable housing "tothose55andoverof between seventoeighthundred amonth. Thisbodygranted themalltheirrequests . Fromthetimethedoorsopened to theGreenridge senior apartment complex on September 1,2014,theone-bedroom apartment wentfor$865andthetwo-bedroomfor$985. Attheexpiration ofeachyear'sleasesince theneachrentwasraised $50ayearand thosewhowereneverinformed before they1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 movedinwerecharged anextra$15forthe convenience ofliving onthefirstfloor. Justthismonthanewmanager atthecomplex toldresidents therewouldbea3percent raiseinrentseveryyearwhenalmost all original residents havebeentoldthatthere wouldnotbeanautomatic increase atthe expiration oftheannual leaseandwhen therewasanincrease itwouldbeonlythe costofliving adjustment . Additionally ,thismanagement corporation hassought tocontrol thevery livesoftheresidents thatlivethere. Theycannot hangcommunally produced jigsaw shellacked andframed inthehallways .They cannot feedthebirdsnorcantheyhangwind chimes orhangwreaths ontheirinside doors.Theyhadtosurrender monies that theresidents themselves hadraised for community events andoutingsfromaweekly bingogamewhicheachattendeepaid$5for andranthegamecompletely ontheirown.

Theotheregregious behavior by Clover Management wastocallthreeScranton police officers toescort aformer elderly resident offtheproperty whileshewas visiting herbestfriend orfacebeing arrested fortrespassing because thisformer resident hadtheaudacity tocontact our elected officials whenmanagement demonstrated theyhadnointention of keeping theirwordtothecityandthe residents andsoshewasrefused arenewal ofherlease.

Whenallofthiswasrevealed tothe Better Business Bureau inScranton there opinion wasthatthiswasnotjustacaseof fraudbutanabuseoftheelderly .They revealed thatthismanagement corporation already hadsevencomplaints against them andnowthereareeight. Despiteallofthis,whenIappeared before thiscouncil torelate allofthisin thepastIwasignored ,notevenawordwas spoken tomenorevenanodoftheheadby anycouncil member during themeeting .Let mewarnthoseofyouwhoaresoarrogant as totreatthosewhoelected youasthough theyareinvisible anddon'texistorthat theconcerns aresoinsignificant thatthey don'tevendeserve comment ,thatyouwill notlasthereandyouwillnotgofurther in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 public service ,whichbrings metothis council 'ssolicitor .Aftermeeting amember ofthiscouncil inanother setting and discussing theplight oftheelderly atthe apartment complex whoarebeingfinancially --theresidents ofwhomarebeing financially rapedbythisfraudulent corporation ,themember askedsolicitor to review thepublic testimony byClover Management andwhattheyhadpromised this city.Thecouncil member e-mailed methat Mr.Minora woulde-mailmedirectly after hisreview.Mr.Minora didnotreview the public testimony byClover,butinstead he sentmeacopyoftheLERTAlawunderwhich thecouncil granted thetaxabatements and permits .Either Mr.Minora istoodenseto dowhatwasaskedofhimorhepurposely refused todosoforwhatreason Icanonly speculate.

MR.WECHSLER :BevDevaros . MR.DEVAROS :BevDevaros ,Quincy Avenue inScranton .Thisisjustforyour information aboutourcounty prison whichis1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 rightonNorthWashington ,sameasthis,you know,upthelinehereandwithgetting booksinthereandgetting alibrary ,andI bringthistonight forinformation because eventhough it'sacounty jailit'sinour cityandtheseareourneighbors . Itcametomyattention thatthere isnolibrary inourcounty prison uphere, andthatwaspretty astounding tomebecause Ithinkalmost alloftheprisons in Pennsylvania havealibrary system inside, soIwenttotheprison boardmeeting and JudgeGeroulo andtheboardsaid--Isaid, "Howaboutifwegetdonated booksandput intheprison?" Andhesaid,"Yeah,thatwouldbe good." Sothat'swhenwearebeendoingand thanks totheTimes,KyleWynn,wrotean article aboutthatverythingandoh,my goodness ,thedonations justpoured infrom churches andtheCentury Club,individuals , younameit.Wehavehundreds ofreally goodbooks.Theyhavetobepaperbackbooks togoin,sowearegathering allofthese1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 booksandnowweareworking onasystem to distribute theminthereandtheprison bought somebookcardsandsowe'llload themupwiththesebooksandvolunteers will takethemaround,soIjustthinkthat'sa goodthing,andIthinkthatit'sonthat. ButwhileI'mhere,forthewinter, forthesnowremoval ,thesnowonthe streets ,thecitystreets ,Iwishtherewas another wayotherthanthatgritthatisput downwhichsolves theproblem immediately ,I mean,youknow,itmakesiteasy,youknow, safetodriveon,butthentheaftermathis moremonths youaresweeping upthisgrit offthestreet,andifyoudon'tsweepitup itgetswashed downintothesewersystem, whichisnotgood. SoIjustwishtherewasanother alternative andanother product thatcould beeffective butnothavethesideeffect so Idon'tknowwhatthatwouldbe,butI'm sureyoucould. MR.ROGAN:Iactually spoketo PennDOT regarding that,butPennDOT doesn't havethesameissue,andtheproblem is1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 PennDOT uses100percent saltontheir roads,thecityusesasaltaggregate mix andthat'swhyyouhavethosepebbles ,that grit,whichgivescarstraction .Thiswas yearsagoIspoketoaformer DPWdirector whywedothings differently thanPennDOT andtheanswer Iwasgivenwascostbecause theaggregate ismuchlessexpensive than thesalt,butIthinkinthelongrunit probably wouldbesaferandcheaper fornot having todealwithallofthatmessifwe explored goingtothemixture thatPennDOT useswiththe100percent salt.

MR.WECHSLER :Youpicked agood one.

Mymainreason forcoming heretoday isbecause I'mdoingalotofresearch on theCityofScranton ,particularly the history whenitcomestoAfrican Americans hereinthistownandIfeellikewehavea lackofrepresentation andrightnowmy motive andmydriveistopromote thatand theamount offactsandrepresentation that wehavehadinthiscityfromlikethe18801 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 tothepresent dayandallofthemenand womenthatactually satinthiscouncil ,sat intheveryroominthe1800'sandnow, like,wearenotreally represented .

So,anyway,Iwouldliketotalk aboutyouguyshavebeen--Ilooked atyour agenda fortodayandyouguysareworking on something withthedowntownplan.Ididn't really findwhatthatplanwasexactly ,but Idoseethatyouguyshaveplanstomake thatcitybetter,butIdon'treally seehow renovating theseapartments thatareabove1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 thecostofliving hereisgoingtomakethe citybetter andwhatyouarereally doingis tobring--torevitalize downtown because I knowyouguysarebringing inbusinesses , butbusinesses don'tactually builda community ,andwhenyouarelooking for community tomeitdoesn'treally seemtobe something thatisworking . Youalsosaidthatyouarelooking forsomeone thatcanbeastaff representative ofthat.Ihaveamaster's degree,Ihavealittle bitofbackground on businesses andIknowpeople whowouldbe interested inopening upbusinesses and things likethat,soifIknewthebusiness planIwouldlovetoparticipate inthat way.Iwouldhaverecommendations ofdoing morecommunity activities ,specifically located downtown Iknowthereissomething happening onSaturday soI'mnotsaying it doesn'thappen,but,Imean,asfaras making thisacommunity downthereIdon't thinkitactually ishappening .Ithink thereispeople thatareliving downthere, butIdon'treally thinkit'sacommunity .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 SoIwouldliketoknowmoreabout thedowntown planbecause Iworkdowntown andIspendalotofmytimedownthereso, likeIsaid,thisplandoesn'tactually do thethings Ihaveseenandeventhough there hasbeensmallprogress since2015Idon't thinktheamount oftimeandmoneyyouguys arespending intoitis,like,showing up yet.

Ihavecomeheretonight -- MR.WECHSLER :Excuse me,youhave tostateyourname. MR.CATENZARO :Oh,I'msorry. Michael Catenzaro fromChilds,Lackawanna County.Ihavecomeheretonight because I havebeenreading thatthecitycouncil wantstothewholecounty reassessed .Since Icannot voteforagainst anyofthecouncil members ,Iwouldliketorelaytoyouafew factswithareassessment coupled withmy personal thought s.Ihavebeencoming to thiscity,worked inthecityandwalked in thecitysincethe1970's.Scranton currently islessthanone-thirdofthe county population whichdoesmakeita minority within thecounty.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Whatisthepurpose ofafullcounty reassessment ?Thelawstates thatany reassessment mustberevenue neutral sothat intheory itoddhisanyadditional revenues .Anyreassessment wouldalsobe subject tosomething called thefairness principle whereasnoproperty canbe assessed anyhigher thananyproperty of similar typeinthesamearea.Anyincrease intheassessment swillalsoincrease the amount ofschool taxesaproperty owner pays.Sinceschool taxesarebasedonthe sameassessed value,ittherebycreates a double whammy forthatproperty owner. Thecounty government itself does notneedanynewtaxrevenues andisfine withtheassessment astheyareasevidenced bythevoteagainst areassessment takenat thepublic heating heldupinGreenfield Township thispastspring. Lackawanna County,unless anybody forgets ,raised property taxes90percent between theYears2003and2013.Ifyou buildanewhouse,you'reprobably assessed attwotofourtimesanyotherproperty in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 thatneighborhood ,sohowdoesthatmake property taxesunfair? Also,ifyoupurchase anexisting property youprobably haveahigher assessment thantheprevious owner.Iknow thecouple whobuiltahouseinScranton and between thecity,school district andthe county theyarepaying $12,000ayearin property taxes.That'salotofmoneyfor theprivilege ofliving inthecity.Iknow Icouldn'tafford topaythese.Thecounty currently hasrenege 1,100--alittle over 1,100properties onit'srepository for nonpayment oftaxes.Over700areinthe CityofScranton .AsIsaid,Scranton is one-thirdofthecounty population yetit hastwo-thirds oftheproperties onthis repository . Ialsodonotbelieve thatalackof current assessment curtails economic activities sinceanylargebusinesses that locate inthecityorthecounty wouldget allsortoftaxabatements .Property values intheCityofScranton inparticular are depressed precisely because ofthehigh1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 property taxes,school taxes,wagestaxes andmercantile taxeswithin thecity. Property values arealsoaffected by whether amunicipal orschool district is runinanfiscally responsible manner.Have hightaxeseverpromoted economic activity ? Thiscityoranymunicipality orschool district haseveryrighttoshowupatan assessment hearing andargueagainst the reduction oftheassessed property value. Thecostofafullcounty reassessment isaround $15million according tothecounty estimates .Thisis approximately 10percent oftheentire county budget and20percent oftheproperty taxesthecounty collects .Whereisthis moneycoming from?Thiswillonlyresultin thecounty raising taxesorborrow moneyin ordertopayforareassessment thatmustbe revenue neutral bylaw.Ibelieve this$15 million number isaccurate because the gentlemen thatrantheAssessor 'sOffice backinthe70's,whenthiswaslast seriously discussed putthecostatthat timeat$5million ,sofiveto15.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Inregards tothecounty,itdoes haveacashsurplus butthissurplus mustbe maintained ortheywilllosetheircredit rating againandbepaying $1.5million a yeartoit'screditors andpenalty forloss ofthatrating.Also,anyreassessment will alsocloganalready overburdened county courtsystem withassessment appeals which thenaddadditional expenses tothecounty budget. Thesolution tothereassessment . Issueistogotothestatelegislature and askforacarveoutforLackawanna County so thatitcanstarttoassess onthesales priceofaproperty .Ourlegislature has previously --Igotaboutanother minute, okay?Ourlegislature haspreviously done pardons formunicipal itiesandcounties on taxingissues.Thisisalready donein California andFlorida andwasadjudicated through theCourtsystem asboth constitutionally fair.Thiswouldbethe fairest waytogradually raiseproperty assessments without punishing people who havebought theproperty decades agofor1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 lessthan10,000andhavespentmoney-- theirownmoneytomaintainandimprove theseproperties andprobably havepaidmore inproperty taxesthantheypayforthe property .Thiswouldalsoeliminate the$15 million costofthereassessment . Finally ,isthereanyone oncouncil oranyone inthiscounty thatthinks they arenotpaying enough intaxes?Thereis nothing stopping themfromsending extra moneytothecityorcounty treasuries .I seenaninterview afewyearsagowith Warren Buffet,oneofthemostsuccessful financial menandinvestors inthiscountry , Mr.Buffet wastouting increasing income of corporate taxesbecause hethought people in corporations couldbepaying for.

MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou,Mr.Perry. Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,acouple of comments primarily onitemsthatwere brought upfromthepodium tonight . Mrs.Reed,couldweplease asendarequest toDPWDirector Gallagher asking forcopies oftheDPWgarbage andrecycling routes,as wellasaskhowthoseroutes wereformulate d andwhentheywereformed.Definitely think it's--andI'mgladitwasbrought upasa reminder,it'ssomething thatdefinitely needstooverhauled andovertimeasthe citychanges andthepopulation shifts it's something thatneedstobelooked atafew timesand,youknow,I'msurewearenotas efficient asmanyprivate businesses ,butI knowcompanies suchasUPSandFedEXwhile they'reinacompletely different business1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 fromcollecting garbage ,theyhavealage fleetoftrucks driving through neighborhoo dsonroutes thatareplanned out verymeticulously andit'salldoneby computers sothereisnoreason whywecan't dosomething similar inthecity. Next,acomment wasmadeabout reassessment tonight fromaspeaker ,and although Idisagree withsomeofwhatwas brought upIactually doagreewiththe solution .IdowishintheStateof Pennsylvania wehadassessments doneatthe pointofsale,wedonot,andoneitemthat wasmentioned thatwasincorrect wasifyou purchase ahomeyourassessment doesnot change.Theonlywayyourassessment can change currently isifyouputaphysical addition onyourhomeorifyouappeal your assessment ,theyaretheonlytwoways. Transferring oftheproperty doesnotchange thetaxassessment underthecurrent system soIjustwanted tocorrect thatitemas well. Next,regarding thefirehouses,we didhaveacaucus withDaveBulzoni andwe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 spokealittle bitaboutthecondition of thefirehouses andwhenItalked tothe guysatourfiredepartment thebiggest complaint thatIhearisaboutthecondition ofthefirehouses,andIdidask Mr.Bulzoni inthecaucus whenthelasttime meaningful workwasdoneonthesefire houses andhisfirstanswer wasprobably around thetimehewasbornandthesecond answer wasaround thetimeIwasborn,so 1986,whichwaspriortomebeingborn,was whentheydidthelastrepairs onsomeof theseproperties andpriortothatwasin the60's. Soyouhavehadnumber offire houses inthecitythatreally havebeen builtandlefttodeteriorate .Takeyour ownhomeifyoudidn'tdoanybasic maintenance for30yearsthecostandwe havetolook--aftertheserepairs are done,because it'salargesumofmoneythat isbeingspentfortheserepairs ,andthey needtobedoneforthepublic safety orthe safety oftheguysthatareworking onour firedepartment ,butoncetheserepairs are1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 donetheyneedtobemaintained thesameway inanindividual maintains theirhome.Like Istayed,it'salargeexpenditureandwe needtomakesueareprotecting that investment ,butanyone whohasbeentoany ofthefirehouses ortalked toanyone out ofthedepartment knowsthatthisshould havebeendone10,15,20yearsago.Again, itwasbecause ofeconomic issues whyit's beendeferred anddeferred andyougetto thepointwhereinstead ofdoingarepair youaredoingacomplete redo.Allofthese roofs,sevenoutoftheeightroofsneedto becompletely replaced .That'saverylarge expenditure .Again,comparing itfora regular individual iftheroofonyourhouse goesit'saveryexpensive proposition and it'sverystressful ,youknow,thatamount ofcost.Multiply thattimesseven,seven properties andthey'reobviously muchlarger thansingle family homessoyoucould imagine thecost. Sowedohavetomakesurethatwe keepuponthemaintenance ,andasMr.Perry mentioned ,it'sdefinitely something thatwe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 needtomakesurethatnotonlythecurrent mayorbutanyfuture mayors andfuture councils aswellweneedtoholdtheirfeet tothefireforbudgeting forongoing maintenance .Theysayastitch intime savesnine,andit'strueandit'ssomething thatwereally needtomakesureweapply to. And,finally ,itwasnicetoseea couple ofnewspeakers heretoday,Iforget yourname,butyoumentioned aboutyounger people inthecity,andyoumaynotknow thisbecause wehavebeenuphereawhile, butmyself andMr.Gaughan aretechnically millinneals .Iactually looked itup,Iwas bornin1987,soyouknow,therearealot ofyounger people inthecitythatare involved andoneofthebiggest frustrations asa--Istillconsider myselfyounger ,I hopeIam,oneofbeingyounger intheCity ofScranton isbraindrain,whichpeople -- youngpeople gothrough ourschool system andtheygoofftocollege andtheynever comeback,ortheymaygotocollege here andthenmoveawayforajobandnevercome1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 back. Andtwoofthebiggest problems and oneMr.Perryhitonalready isthelackof goodfamily sustaining jobswithin thearea andthat'ssomething thatis,youknow,it's notjusthereinScranton ,that'ssomething that'shappening allthroughout therestof thecountry sothat'sonemajorissue,but wedohavealotofpositive things that havebeenhappening inthecommunity for younger people aswelland,youknow,just goingthrough thedowntown onaweekend you canseealotofthedifferent festivals thataregoingon,artsfestivals ,alltypes ofdifferent events,whicharenice,butwe dohavetohavethatgooutintothe neighborhoods aswell,notjustinthe downtown .Sothatisallfortonight .

IaskedSolicitor Minora tolook intotheissuetoreview theeffect thata Pennsylvania statestatute 53Pa.C.S.A. 4612wouldhaveondistribution offundsto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 thecityfollowing theassetsaleto Pennsylvania American WaterbytheScranton SewerAuthority .I'mnotgoingtoread through thewholememoissued byMr.Minora, buttherewereseveral things thathesaid thatIwouldliketotakenoteof.

Iwouldliketosendaletter tothe mayorasking thefollowing :Whyhasn'tthe mayorfiledatermination certificate that waspassed bythiscouncil backinDecember of2016withtheOfficeoftheSecretary of theCommonwealth ofPennsylvania ,and shouldn 'tthecityhaveassumedtheeasement1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 issues andtakenitin-houseasMr.Minora hassuggested ? Ilooked backontheordinance that waspassed intheDecember of2016 dissolving orgiventhecitytherightto dissolve theAuthority andIlookatfew section sthatwereacauseforconcern . Section onesays,"Thecityapproves the termination certificate submitted bythe SewerAuthority toterminate it'sexistence following thesatisfaction anddischarge of allScranton SewerAuthority bondsbythe Scranton Sewerauthority . Section II.Thecityhereby agrees toassume liability forallclaims outstanding against theScranton Sewer Authority following thedischarge ofall Scranton SewerAuthority bondsandallother Scranton SewerAuthority indebtedness ,which Ibelieve thathasalltakenplace.

Somybasicquestion iswhyhasn't thisbeendoneyet?Now,Ithinkmanyof thesequestions probably willbeanswered in thecourtcasethat'songoing because these questions havebeenraised,butIwouldlike toknowwhythetermination certificate was notsenttotheOfficeofSecretary ofthe Commonwealth ofPennsylvania bythemayor whenthisoccurred because Ithinkthatall ofuswereundertheassumption oratleast Iwasundertheassumption atthattimeeven though Ivotedagainst thisforother reasons thatoncewe--thiscouncil passed thislegislation thattheSewerAuthority BoardandSewerAuthority asitusedto existwouldhavebeen,infact,been terminated .AndthatisallIhaveforthis week.Thankyou.

MR.WECHSLER :AsChairperson for theCommittee onRules,Irecommend final passage ofItem7-A. MR.ROGAN:Second. MR.WECHSLER :Onthequestion ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,onthequestion . Reading through thethree-yearexitplan,we havehadquitealong,longtimetotakea lookatitandIhaveseveral comments and concerns . Number one,whichIhavestated here before,andthisisincluded inthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 three-yearexitplan,istheamount ofmoney thatisgoingtobeputasideforthestorm watermanagement .Ihaveobjected tothis before.Theplancallsfor$500,000beput aside,Ithinkthecityadministration is seriously underselling stormwater management .Ithinkmoremoneyneeded tobe putasideforthatcost,whichatthispoint wedon'tknowbecause thestudyhasnotbeen completed yet,sothat'soneconcern . Mysecond concern ,andImentioned thisatthepublic hearing thattookplace withthePennsylvania Economy League,ison page--orChapter 9,pageseven,andthis iswheretheplancallsfor--the three-yearexitplancallsforthe allocation ofadministrative responsibilities andIwouldjustliketo readasection ofthisrecommendation .It saysthat,"Thefundamental objective ofthe operation oftheoffice ofthebusiness administration should remain the administration oftheyearly budget and completion oftheauditonatimely basis. Thebusiness administrator 'soffice1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 presently assumes responsibility for departmental initiatives outside ofits administrative Coderesponsibilities .To achieve theidentified financial management objectives ,various citydepartment will assume greater responsibility fordirect department initiatives suchasrequests for proposal preparation andexecution tothe greatestextentasallowed undertheHome RuleCharter andAdministrative Code." AndImention edthisatthepublic hearing ,thisrecommendation inandof itself isveryconcerning tomeifwelook atthisplanfromthestandpoint ofthe operation ofthecityhalloverthepast threeandahalfyears.Thefactthatthere hadtobearecommendation inthethree-year exitplanthatdepartment headsshould do theirjobisextremely concerning ,thatthe business administrator hastakenonallof thisresponsibility ,thathepresently assumes responsibility fordepartmental initiatives outside ofhisAdministrative Coderesponsibilities .Idon'tgetit.I mentioned thisafewweeksagoandIstill1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 don'tunderstand it. Again,thefactthatthathastobe recommendation tellsmeoneoftwothings: Thereiseither --hehiredthewrongpeople asdepartment heads,number one;andnumber two,thereisnoleadership soyouhadto havehadPELtellthemayorthathehasto havehisdepartment headsperform their duties.Idon'tgetit.Sothat'sone concern . Second concern ,andIbrought this upbefore,iswiththearbitration issue that'scurrently goingtobedecided soon fromwhatIunderstand overtheretiree age discrepancy inthecode,andI'llreadfrom thethree-yearexitplaninasecond,but basically thismaycripple thepension system evenfurther thanitalready is.The cityischallenging aninterpretation ofthe adopted cityordinances thatgovern the required ageforretirement plan participants .Thereareinconsistent provisions fortheageofretirement eligibility forthepolice andfirefighter pension plans.Theseinconsistencies are1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 thesubject oflegalaction bythe--I believe bythepolice andfiredepartment unionseeking toremove astated retirement ageandallowretirement solely uponyears ofservice .Theelimination ofanage requirement willallowforalargenumber of retirees inthenearfuture.Suchan increase isnotfactored intothecurrent actuarial assumption s,valuations ,and annual funding requirements andmayresult inalargeincrease inthecity'sannual required obligation whichitcanillafford. Again,thisinandofitself isextremely concerning .Wearetalking aboutputting millions ofdollars intoaPennsylvania system whencurrently thereisacasebefore aarbiter ofwhether ornottheyaregoing toremove theretirement agerequired ,soin thefuture wehavecouldhavethis three-yearexitplan,iftheywinin arbitration wecouldbelooking downthe pikeatalargenumber ofretirees andwe're rightbackwherewestarted .So,again, extremely concerning . Another thingthatpopped outtome,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25105 andIhavespoken aboutthisforthelast threeandahalfyear,iswhenyoulookat thenumbers inthisthree-yearexitplan,75 percent ofcityexpenditures areemployee compensation andbenefits .Overthe three-yearexitplanthisnumber fluctuates butnotalot.Wearestillaround in2020 about75percent ofourexpenditures for employee compensation andbenefits .Idon't knowhowthisissustainable .Ihavebeen talking aboutthisnowforthreeandahalf years,andI'llreadfromthethree-year exitplan. Itsays,"Thebottom lineisthe restoration ofthecity'sfiscal health cannot beachieved without controlling it's future personnel expenditure s,workers' compensation ,andpension benefits . Personnel expenditures foractive employees andretireesrepresent themajority ofthe city'sgeneral fundoperating expenses and riseannually during thereview period.The levelofcashcompensation andbenefits is offered within thecontext ofthecity's weaktaxbase.Thecitycannot adequately1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25106 address it'sstructural operating deficits without diligently managing theentire employee compensation package itoffers it's employees sothatthegrowth inemployee compensation andemployee benefits more closely tracks thecity'srevenue growth." AndI'llsayitonceagain,Ithink oneofthemajormistakes thathasbeenmade overthelastthreeandahalfyearwasin 2015withtherenegotiated police andfire contracts .Idon'tknowthat--wemayhave madesomeprogress ,butIdon'tknowifwe wentfarenough thereinregards to expenditures andhowmuchmoneywewere actually goingtosave. Another concern ofmineisChapter 6 pagetwo.TheCourtmayrecommend thatthe cityengage indiscussions withit's collective bargaining unittoenterintoa pension benefit memorandum ofunderstanding . Thismemorandum should control thetiming andthelimittheamount ofanypension benefit enhancements foratleasttenyears beginning in2017.Moreover ,anydisputes between thebargaining unitsandthecity1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25107 thatcouldhavematerial adverse impact on thefunding ofthepension plansas estimated orcalculated bytheactuary to theplansshould beadjudicated orresolved priortoinsignificant contributions being madefromthesewersaleproceeds tothe pension funds. Myconcern here,andIdon'tknowif itwaspossible ,isthat,youknow,maybe thisshould havealready beenaccomplished whenthepolice andfirecontracts were beingnegotiated ,oratleastshould have beenbrought upthatthereshould havebeen apension benefit memoranda of understanding .Idon'tknowifit'sgoing tobepossible todothatinthefuture but Ithinkitmightbedifficult . Mylastconcern isChapter 7,page two.Asitwasbrought uptonight ,the National Resource Network isdeveloping a strategic planthatfocuses onrevitalizing thecity'sdowntown .Oneofthe recommendations within thatplan,as mentioned inthethree-yearexitplan,is fortheCityofScranton toincrease its1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25108 capacity foreconomic development by designating acurrent oranewstaffmember tobethecity'spointperson for implementation ofthedowntown plan.Mayor Courtright designated theBusiness Administrator DaveBulzoni temporarily as thecity'spointperson tobeassisted by thedeputy director ofOECD.Theplansays thatMayorCourtright hasindicated a willing nesstodesignate apermanent economic pointperson,butcurrently noone intheadministration canassume those duties full-time.Asforthefull-timecity economic development pointperson,itis anticipated thatthepartner shipwith Scranton Tomorrow willbolster thecity's internal economic development capacity . Ihadseveral concerns basedonwhat wasindicated intheplan.Firstofall,I thinkbasedonwhat'salready occurred the cityisnotfollowing oneoftheprevious recommendations thatImentioned about allocation oftheadministrative responsibilities .Again,inthe recommendation itsaystotakeaway1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25109 responsibilities fromwhatotherpeople in cityhallshould bedoingawayfromthe business administrator .Well,weare designating Mr.Bulzoni asthetemporary pointperson forthisproject .Again,it doesnotmakesense. WehaveanOfficeofEconomic and Community Development .Whyisthedirector ofOECDnotheading uporbeingthepoint personforthiswholeproject ?That's something thatIdon'tunderstand .Andit alsosaysherewithin theexitplanthat challenges remaintoimplement economic development initiatives suchasthe continued lackofcapacity intermsofthe designated economic development pointperson incitygovernment otherthanthecity business administrator . SoIwouldliketoknow,andmaybe wecansendaletter,whythedirector of OECDisnotthepointperson.Iwould assume thatthatwouldbetheduties ofthe department head,andthat'swhytheposition isthereandIwouldthinkthatthejobin it'sverynature issupposed tobeapoint1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25110 person fortheseseparate projects . Theotherconcern here,andI'llbe verybriefonthisone,isIunderstand why tocontinue todevelop thedowntown ,the allocate resources there,butIdothink basedonwhatIreadinthethree-yearexit planandIwouldhavereadsofarfromthe National Resource Network,wearenotdoing enough tofocusontheneighbor hoods.The downtown isdeveloping ,thereisa residential community ,butIthinkweneed toputmoreofafocus,theOfficeof Economic andCommunity Development needsto putmuchmoreofafocusonour neighbor hoods.Thereneedstobemoreofa concerted effort there.AndthatisallI have.Thankyou. MR.EVANS:Onthequestion ,justto getbacktosomehistory ,Idon'tdisagree withCouncilman Gaughan 'sconcerns ,theyare allvery,veryrealconcerns ,butthe decision toexitismadebyPEL,notthe CityofScranton .Theydetermine ifweare exiting .Ifwedon't--therearethree options wecanmake.Disincorporation of1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25111 themunicipality ,andwedon'tmeetthe criteria fordisincorporation .Existenceof fiscal emergency ,wedon'tmeetthe definition forfiscal emergency ,sotheonly otheroption wehaveistoexit.Now,doI agreewithsomeofthethings intheexit planandIthat'scertainly appropriate ,but thatatthispointisouronlychoice because wedon'thavethesay.Itisour plan,wecanputupordown,butPEL determines ifthecityexitsAct47.That's allIhave. MR.WECHSLER :Yes,inregards toa fewofthecomments thatMr.Gaughan made,I votedforthepolice andfirecontracts ,the reason whyIvotedforthemwasto,number one,itgaveusaquietcontract period whilewewereundergoingourefforts tobe inrecovery .Itdidresult insome modifications topolice contract andthe firecontract thatarehaving positive results .Theamount ofthecompensation claims thatweretaking placeearlier are greatly reduced .Theincreased contributions thatboththefireandthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25112 police aremaking adifference inour pension .Ibelieve whenthiscouncil and theadministration camein,thefunding balance ofthepension wasaround $39 million andrightnowitsitsat$58 million .That'sbecause ofincreased contributions ,better management oftheplan andmoreofafocusonmaking surethatit performs well. SoIamconcerned ,asMr.Gaughan is,withthestateofthelawsuit ,butin termsofvoting forthatcontract and providing uslaborpeaceforthesethree yearsIthinkweremostimportant tomake surewegetoutofourdistressed status. AndI'mnotsureinregards toMs. Aebli,whoistheOECDdirector ,sheispaid withfederal fundssoI'mnotsureif actually sheisallowed todoothereconomic development workthatdon'tinclude non-federal money,I'mnotsure.
