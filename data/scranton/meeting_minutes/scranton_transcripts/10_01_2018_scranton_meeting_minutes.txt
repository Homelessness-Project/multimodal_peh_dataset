MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I just want to briefly comment on the subject of today's work session we had with Arcadis regarding storm water. Let me start off by saying -- restating my position that the study absolutely should have been commissioned prior to the sale of the Sewer Authority and the fact that it wasn't just blows my mind. The result of not conducting the study, as Councilman Evans pointed out a couple of weeks ago, is that the city is not capable of properly handling storm water, and as we heard at our work session this won't be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 simple undertaking. I just think this is one of the many examples of city government being reactive instead of proactive and I think that's an approach we must change. That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes, one other thing I wanted to touch on, a little bit what Marie said, what we are trying do, I had a conversation with ECTV. We are trying to get to the point where they can get new equipment that we can put on the table here that would pick up the voices for the camera because that's part of the problem right now is we are passing around microphones and logistically it's a real problem , we have guests at our large table there, so if they can do that I think there is no reason why we would have all of those meetings in here and they would all be televised so I think that's our goal, and we are supposed to get an answer sometime this week so hopefully by next week I'll have an answer from ECTV. Over the last few weeks a regular 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 speaker at our city council has challenged us, all of us, to post to the city website the work that we do individually related to city business during the previous week, so while in theory that's a pretty good idea but with full-time jobs and all of the responsibilities we have our position s on city council it isn't practical to think that could be done on a regular and consistent basis. But with that said, I have said in the past and I have described in the past my schedule on a typical week of city business and I will do that again this evening to give an example of what may take place week to week for our city council member. So beginning from last Monday to this evening for a full week's review, last Monday, of course, we had our city council meeting at city hall. Prior to that, myself and Councilman Donahue met with the Pennsylvania Economy League during the afternoon and that evening we had our caucus and city council met with the developers of the proposed project of the Scranton State School for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Deaf and, of course, we had our meeting . On Tuesday morning , I met with the mayor, police Chief Graziano , representatives from Lackawanna County and Scranton Tomorrow to discuss an ongoing issues related to the downtown . Wednesday and Thursday I dealt with approximately half a dozen citizen complaints of various types referring them to the proper city departments for a resolution . On Friday, I had a meeting in the morning at the Chamber of Commerce to meet with some city officials and others to discuss some grant opportunities and new initiatives that I am interested in that are related to our neighbor hoods. Early Friday afternoon I met with BA Bulzoni and our city clerk Lori Reed for a conference call with a representative of See, Click, Fix as we continue to move that initiative forward . Later that afternoon, Friday afternoon , myself and Councilman Gaughan were guest speakers at the University of the Scranton student government council 's meeting . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Over the weekend, I met personally with several residents to discuss their concerns and issues as well as answering numerous e-mails I received during the week on the weekend and, of course, somewhere in the mix answered many phone calls and responded to those as well. During the week and the weekend, I attended at least seven events sponsored by the Scranton Fringe Festival . While not directly related to our work on city council , as a vocal supporter of the arts I felt it was in my best interest to learn as much as I could about this important city arts events and how it relates to an increase in commerce within the city and specifically the downtown. So bring this to today, Monday, October 1, we attended a work session in the Governor 's Room at 4:30 with represent atives of Arcardis , the organization that is working on our storm water study. At 5:15 we met in caucus with Leslie Collins and Josh Mast of Scranton Tomorrow for some updates on their work. At 5:45 we held a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 public hearing on a liquor license transfer and at 6:00 p.m. our regular city council meeting started and here we are. So would I call that an average week, probably . Sometimes it could be busier than that, much busier, sometimes much less busy. And, of course, that doesn't count the 40 to 60 hours I spend a week working as a small business owner in Scranton and the time my colleagues spend as well working in their own profession s. And certainly none of us are complaining because that's what we signed up for. At the end of the day, if you really want to effect positive change you do what you have to do, but this is just a response to a personal request from one of our speakers . Again, I don't think it's a bad idea if we were able to post this, I just don't think it's practical , so every now and then I'll give a weekly report of what happened from the week before. And that's all I have tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Councilman Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 a few concerns that I received from attending a neighborhood meeting in the hill section . Mrs. Reed, I have quite a few here, I just want to check through some of them. I was asked to ask the city administration to consider paving the 800 and 909 blocks of Costello court from Gibson Street to Ash Street. Also, there was a major concern about Okell court that needs to be paved between Rosalind Street and Linden Street, and we did already send a letter out on that to the administration . The 200 block of Arthur Avenue there is several storm drain issues, blocked and people are flooding down there when they get a light to moderate rain. Also, Mrs. Reed, if we could send a letter to the DPW about a streetlight that does not come on until 10:30 or 11 p.m., very dark and dangerous on the corner of the Rosalind and Arthur Avenue, the 200 block. Also, the 700 block of Mayhan court between Gibson and Pine, same thing with storm drain issues, same thing with storm drain issues. This area turns into a huge lake when it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 rains and there is also a huge pothole that needs to be filled. Another resident complained of drainage issues on Harrison Avenue, the Harrison Avenue bridge when it rains so if we could have Mr. Pocius check that out. The 900 block of Prescott Avenue and North Irving and Ash Street, people flying through stop signs if we could send that to the police department . And then I received a request that we ask OECD to consider sidewalk improvements in front of John Adams School, if that's possible the area is bad. Storm drain issues at Quincy and Myrtle Street and several abandoned properties on Quincy Avenue and I have specific addresses that I'll give you after the meeting , so I would appreciate that. Also, I have a question just going through some of the mail we received in the last few days, the Business Administrator 's Office is transferring $349,000 from the Worker's Comp Trust Fund to the IT Department for capital expenditures , so I would like to ask what that is for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 specifically if we could find that out for next meeting . Also, we received a letter from the Borough of Taylor, I won't read through the whole thing, but it's from the manager of the Borough of Taylor and there is some concern over a line, a service line, sewer line that services the museum operated by Lackawanna County and they go through the whole background here, but they have serious environmental concerns and the general public has concerns that must be addressed in this area. They did copy the council , DPW and engineer and city planner on this so if we could get follow-up on it, Mrs. Reed, I would appreciate that. Also, we did receive a letter, a response from Mayor Courtright regarding our letter a week ago asking for his opinion on the coffee house at Nay Aug Park with Mr. Hinton and I do want to read this letter into the record. Mayor Courtright says, "Dear Councilmen , I am in receipt of your follow-up letter of September 25, 2018. To address your questions I have carefully 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 reviewed the opinion issued by your solicitor , Amil Minora, along with the position of the Recreation Authority issued by its solicitor . Having great confidence in their legal abilities and expertise , I condition occur with their position that the lease of the facility at Nay Aug Park is valid and in conformity with ethical requirements . Despite my concurrence , I have discussed this letter with Director Pat Hinton and he has agreed that the propose d coffee shop will not open during his tenure as a member of my cabinet. Please see the attached letter memorializing the same. Thank you. Mayor William Courtright ." I appreciate the response but, you know, there is a couple of issues with this letter. Number one, the mayor doesn't really answer any of our questions . We asked him specifically what he thought about it, if he was in favor of it, did he give the okay on this and all he does was agree with the attorneys . We didn't ask him that, we asked him whether he thought that it was ethical and that he would allow a member of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 his administration and his cabinet to go through with that, and I just still do not think this is right. Even if Mr. Hinton runs the coffee shop when is no longer the director , the fact that it took place, this whole process took place when he was the director that is just wrong and it's time for the mayor and other member of his administration , quite frankly , to grow a spine, and when this council asks questions answer them truthfully, respectfully , and don't wait until a year or two later to come out with all of this stuff because it's just ridiculous , and I can understand why people lose faith in their government when they see these kind of things go on. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Just a couple of quick comments , Scranton Tomorrow was brought up from the podium, we did have a caucus with members from Scranton Tomorrow about some of their activities . They talked about some of the ongoing plans and we actually are scheduling quarterly updates with representatives from Scranton Tomorrow to talk about some much their plans for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 downtown . I believe our next update was scheduled for January 14 will be the next time they will being on, so it should be every three months on an ongoing basis. We did get an update tonight about some of the initiatives that we have been undertaking, the planters that have been put on a couple of streets downtown have been done by Scranton Tomorrow as well as some of their other initiatives that should be rolled out within the next few weeks to a month, so we are thankful to have them continuing to come in and get these updates on a quarterly basis. Another speaker , I think it was Mr. Bolus, brought up about speaking out to the county and the school district and I'll say for myself if you ask some of the commissioners they are probably not a fan of mine because , you know, I pretty regularly take them to task on some of the items that I feel are lacking there, and reassessment especially and next year with commissioner elections coming up I'm sure that's going to be a very big issue. And, again, in my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 opinion , many of the county administrators have been inept from the commissioners , de facto, the majority , the control ler they have been silent, nothing has been going on so we will see how that plays out in the elections next year, but it is something that's certainly on my mind and in the mind of my colleagues , we have spoken out on specifically county issues quite a bit and the school district , unfortunately , as we know is a disaster . Hopefully they will get their act together over there, but the way I look at the school district is really the way the city was about five or six years ago, unable to pay their bills, multiple investigation s going on so I hope the school directors will get their act together and get things going and I know they are certainly trying, it's no fault of many of the members that are there now that just took office, but we are watching everything else. So that is all. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.
