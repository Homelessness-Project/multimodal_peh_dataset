Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? I have a few. Next Monday in observance of the Martin Luther King Day city hall will be closed. Councils next regularly scheduled meeting is January 28. DPW is also off in observance of the holiday . Refuse and red recycling will be one day behind next week. DPW will continue to pick up Christmas trees throughout the month of January . Residents may place their tree at the curb and a DPW tree crew will be going into the neighborhood to chip the trees on site. Also, an executive session was held this evening prior to the meeting regarding a personnel matter. Prior to citizens ' participation one quick comment I'd like to make, I see we have a packed house here tonight , I think it goes without saying we know why everyone is here to discuss much of what's been in the media and I understand a lot of you may be here looking for answers from council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Council has learned everything we have through the media as the public has. I understand there are residents that want to discuss this issue, may want to vent and discuss it and that's certainly your right to do so, we would just please ask anyone to avoid spreading rumor or innuendo that hasn't been substantiated as fact in the media as of yet. We did also discuss with our attorney previously to the meeting if there was any action that council could take regarding finding more information on the current matter, so I'd like to turn it over to our solicitor , Attorney Minora. MR. MINORA: As I mention ed, apparently , although we don't even know this to be true, but apparently there is some type of investigation going on and it's as most investigations are confident ial. Our course of action ought to be to write a letter and try and get some information from the investigative bodies and hopefully we will get some response that will help us in moving the city issues forward or at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 not slowing them down. Beyond that, we are not an investigative body and we have no right to do that, so I'm not sure there is much more we can do beyond that until we get some response . MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Attorney Minora. And I do want to mention , as I do most every Monday morning , is I meet with the mayor and the city solicitor just to go over legislation , general city operations , that meeting did take place in morning as normal. We did not discuss any of these ongoing matters but we did discuss city business and the mayor did relate to me that if there was anything as far as problems with the city or any operation s everything would continue as normal and council would be kept in the loop. (The following speakers offered public comment as follows : Florelena Rospigliosi spoke on city business . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business . Les Spindler spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on city business and matters of general concern . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Dave Dobrzyn spoke on city business and matters of general concern .

Lee Morgan spoke on matters of general concern . Glynnis Johns spoke on matters of general concern . Fay Franus spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on agenda items and matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, I have a few. If we could, we talked about this at the beginning of the meeting with sending out correspondence to the FBI, if I my colleagues agree, Attorney Minora, are we able to include with that some kind of -- asking for a timeframe to release at least the scope of the investigation or the nature of the investigation ? I know they are going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 to be very tight lipped, but if we could just have a timeframe on when they think they will be releasing information to the public? MR. MINORA: Yeah, I'm sure we can include that in the letter. MR. PERRY: Okay, and at least then we will have an idea of when we will be able to expect something . MR. MINORA: Will do. MR. PERRY: So needless to say I was stunned by the news that came out this week's investigation . You know, I don't plan on, you know, feeding into any rumors or speculation s or assumptions that are making the circuit right now. I found out about the investigation by a phone call from the Scranton Times during the week and that's how I was I alerted , and I was also alerted that the mayor did not resign via the Scranton Times website . So I'm not looking for information just like everyone else at this point. No, I haven't spoken to the mayor this week, I don't speak with him every week anyway so it's really nothing out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 of the norm, but I'll be waiting for the FBI to conclude their work before I make any further comments on this because there is really -- it's just kind of work play right now and I don't have any information to give, unfortunately , but I think, you know, I at least owe it to go on the record to say that I didn't have any information , that's why I gave Jim a call back with the Scranton Times just let him know I did get his call and, unfortunate ly, I don't have any information about me waiting and trying to get it as everybody else will be. Getting to some business , that handicap ped parking permit I'll be working on that, I'll probably start that tonight . I'll make a phone call and we'll see how fast we can get that fixed for you, okay? And you left your phone number so I'll keep you in the loop step by step on the process . You are welcome . You're very welcome . I'll also be looking into that second chance grant, I'll try to find the date and the amount and when it went through . I really wish I could remember but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I can't remember the amount or the date that we had that in front of us. Also, on the agenda tonight is Item 5-C so we have some information from the chief on that so I figure I'll fill everybody in what he responded back with. TERI is an acronym used for a terminal illness as defined by the Social Security Administration . The TERI assignment could be anywhere from an approved light-duty position with the police department to being placed on leave while being treated for a terminal illness . The duration is covered by the MOU and the assignment would depend on the employee 's current physical capabilities that would be determined by a physician and based on a specific terminal illness . The MOU stems from having two officers recently battling serious illnesses and there, you know, really wasn't a place, this kind of helps them stay in like a light duty capacity to help them keep working if they are physically able to if they need to because , you know, a lot of times that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 some of the best medicine is just continue on your daily life and keeping things as normal as possible so this is going to help them continue that if that's the path they wish. And that is going to be all I have tonight , Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I just have a couple of quick resident items first. Mrs. Reed, would you able to send a letter to PennDOT requesting a meeting at their earliest convenience to discuss the intersection of Pittston Avenue and Orchard Street. And, also, would you be able to send a letter to the city solicitor to ask for a breakdown and the scope of the work being done on the emergency repair of the Meadowbrook conduit . I just had some neighbors who were not involved in the settlement who have approached me with some questions about what exactly is being done. Now onto the big news of the week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 I'm not going to speculate or comment on any rumors that may have circulated over the past few days because rumors are not fact. Obviously , an investigation is ongoing and I'm positive as soon as that investigation is concluded , any information will be released as soon as it is appropriate to do so. In saying that, I would only urge the mayor that if he did nothing wrong he should make a statement to that effect and continue to come to work every day to do the work the residents of this city elected him to do. If he did do something wrong, especially with everything going on at the school district and in the county, I strongly urge him to do whatever is necessary to spare the residents of this city from the dark cloud of corruption that would inevitably hang over all us. I would also like to assure the residents of the city that I firmly believe a majority of this council is capable of setting the ethical bar extremely high moving forward . Proof of this is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 updated Ethics Code that was introduced last week and which is on our agenda tonight which originated in and was drafted by this council . I'm extremely proud to have worked on this updated code along with Councilman Gaughan as well as may other colleagues over the last few months. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: I do, thank you. Well, the events of the past week can best be described as shocking. It's something that none of us could have ever expected and we can only hope for the best and plan for the worst. In the mean time, we should do our very best not to be part of the unfounded rumor mill and we need not no participate in the endless games of speculation and I hope no one here takes pleasure for one second in the pain and anguish of others, we are better than that, but with that said, sometimes soon we would all like to hear from the mayor. This investigation will take the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 course that it takes. It is very little that we can do about it nor should we. We can only hope at the end of the day that truth ultimately prevails and justice is rightfully served. Our role is not to interject ourselves needlessly , our role is make sure transparency is achieved and trust is restored . But for now our primary focus needs to be to continue to lead where we can to step up even more to make sure that this city moves forward in a positive way by controlling those things that we can actually control , and beyond that we should help wherever we can in any way that we can. Last week, as you know, I laid out an agenda for 2019 while I envisions I felt and as I do now that we can effect positive change and make those things happen this year. I still feel that way. Somehow my commitment to this city is even greater today than it was even a week ago simply because it has to be. We are all entering uncharged territory . If we allow the events of the past week to paralyze our decision making 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 process , if we allow the events of the past week to stymie our efforts to achieve progress in a positive agenda, if we allow the weeks of the past week to define us as a city now and in the future then we have failed the citizens and we have failed as leaders . So now, more than ever, we need to all come together as a city council , as a community and as a city. And that's all I have on that subject . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. As my colleagues said, it was, you know, really shocking all of the news that has come out in the last few days, the last week, that the FBI had raided Scranton City Hall and as well the mayor's home. It's clear to me that, you know, not only these events but the events over the last few years in the city, the school district and the county that the faith that people have in their government officials has eroded to the point that it's just become disgraceful and, quite 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 frankly , it has been a sad few days for the City of Scranton as a whole, in my opinion . I would encourage the mayor, his cabinet and any other government officials to fully cooperate with the FBI and Justice Department in their investigation . At this time, I do not know any specific details about the investigation other than it is ongoing . As details become available to council regarding this investigation , I would assume that we would all disclose them to the public and to the press as well. I understand in listening to citizens here tonight and those who have contacted me over the last few days that you are upset and you want answers . All of us want answers on what exactly is going on. As my colleagues had correctly pointed out, I don't think it's appropriate to guess on what may have happened or what may not have happened , what may have taken place, what may not have taken place. We need to let the investigation into these matters run its course, allow the authorities to do their job so that all of the facts can be made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 available . The past few days have only highlighted for me the need for a stronger Ethics Code in the city and most importantly public officials who ask tough questions and demand integrity and accountability . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. I did address what's going on at the top of the meeting , I'll just reiterate basically what might have colleagues mention ed, I think we are all in agreement and we are all on the same page that I know people are coming to us looking for answers because every Monday night city council is the face of city government . We come here, we listen to the public, we are in front of the cameras and we are going to continue to do that and as we learn anymore information it will be passed along to the public. I agree, and I think all of my colleagues mention ed this, that none of us are going to comment on rumor or speculation and we'll see what happens as this investigation pans out, but most importantly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to the residents of the Scranton and there had been some questions about what ifs during the presentations tonight . City services are not going to be effected . Your police are still going to be working , your firemen will still be working , DPW, so most importantly to the residents of Scranton the city is going to continue to operate whether it's under the current mayor, if there is something that happens , but again, people tend to jump to conclusions , let's wait and see what happens , but rest assured no matter what happens the residents of Scranton are going to continue to have the same level of service that they have had over the last number of decades . I do want to end this meeting or this portion of the meeting on a very positive note. Unfortunately , I wasn't able to attend last week's meeting , over the Christmas holiday my company had a Christmas dinner at the new AV on Penn Avenue, and I tend not to tell personal stories but this one is a nice story that I wanted to share. As you know, the City of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 had helped out the AV restaurant move from Moosic to Scranton to relocate . On my travels heading to the restaurant on Penn Avenue I had to drive around the block four times to get a parking spot. The first two times I was a little bit frustrated looking for that spot, but the last time I though, you know what this is good thing because this block has been revitalized so much that you cannot find a spot. So I want to give a big thank you to all of those developers who made that block really come back to life, and I hate to admit it, I hadn't been on that block for quite a bit of time prior to this Christmas party, but I really encourage everyone just to take a stroll down Penn Avenue and see the beautiful buildings and many of the changes that have taken place in that area. That's is all. MS. REED: 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH COMMONWEALTH ENERGY GROUP, LLC FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON CONSULTING SERVICES FOR ENERGY SAVING PERFORMANCE FROM OCTOBER 1, 2018 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2021. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , in reviewing this legislation , part of the backup material is, "Attachment D, disclosures by a firm or a contractor ." When we voted months and months ago on the labor contract between the City of Scranton and Abrahamsen , Conaboy and Abrahamsen I had brought up issues with Attachment D that it was not filled out properly by the firm, so when I was looking at this piece of legislation is looks to me that Attachment D has been altered . It's been changed . It doesn't -- I think we went from being very transparent with it and requiring more information to now kind of backing off of that a little bit. I could be wrong, but that's the way that I'm looking at it. So I would like something in writing from the administration on why exactly that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 change was made to Attachment D. Maybe there is a reason for it. This company did answer the questions on Attachment D about the contributors , whoever in the city contributed from this firm but, again, it looks to me like Attachment D has been changed and we are going backwards instead of staying where we were when this attachment was originally in previous legislation . So I hope I explained that the right way. But, Mrs. Reed, if we could send a letter to the administration before final passage on this legislation asking them why that took place. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 51, 2019 – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING “THE CODE OF ETHICS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE CODE OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA .” MR. ROGAN: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A, what is your pleasure ? MR. PERRY: I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Late today council received a letter from the Fraternal Order of Police Jermyn Lodge No. 2 making several objections to the Ethics Code. I have not had a chance to go through every single objection or the letter in full, so we discussed it briefly in the caucus. I would like Attorney Minora to dig into this and take a look at what they are objecting to. And then just on a secondary note with some of the comments tonight in the public hearing and at the regular council meeting , you know, this all started really when I looked at our Ethics Code previously over the whole coffee shop incident , and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 previous to that I had sent correspondence to the mayor asking him why the members of the Ethics Board had not been reappointed . The terms had expired so I had questioned that and I never received a response , and I could not find out when that board met, if it had ever met in the last few years, if anything was ever published in the newspaper regarding the rules because there were rules and regulations if someone in city hall, a whistle blower had a complaint about something that happened how they would do that so I think this Ethics Code takes care of that issue at least. The coincidence with all of this, obviously , is that -- and it's been reported in the newspaper that this Ethics Code comes at a time when the FBI investigation is going on. Purely a coincidence , but it is unbelievable to say the least. Several residents tonight questioned , you know, if you have rules and regulations who is going to enforce them. This board is going to enforce them, not this council , but the Board of Ethics. So whoever we put our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 trust in council gets two appointments , the mayor gets two appointments and the control ler gets one appointment . So whoever we appoint to the board once it's up and running they will then have to take the mantle and enforce all of the rules and regulations within the code, so I hope I answered that question satisfactorily . There are a number of procedures in this code, it's very clear if somebody makes a complaint the steps that the board has to take then to rectify that complaint . So I hope I answered questions there. If there are anymore questions my e-mail is on the city's website , please let me know and I'll try to answer them as best as I can and again, we did receive a letter from the police making several objections to the code and concerns that they had so we'll have to take a look at that and have our solicitor respond . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Just a follow-up, as Councilman Gaughan mentioned we did receive the letter. I did speak with the president of the FOP. It does seem like many of these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 items are more of language in nature having to do with collective bargaining agreements , making sure things are consistent so I'm very confident that these items can be worked out so this legislation could pass without violating any of the collective bargaining agreements but still have all of those items in this law that were intended . Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. MR. ROGAN: If there is no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. PERRY: Motion to adjourn . MR. ROGAN: Meeting adjourned .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes of testimony taken by me at the hearing of the above-captioned matter and that the foregoing is a true and correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
