CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM MAYOR COGNETTI DATED FEBRUARY 16, 2022 REGARDING APPOINTING MITESH PATEL TO THE POSITION OF ACTING TREASURER FOR A PERIOD OF 35 DAYS. MR. DONAHUE : Do any Council members have any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one announcement in case people missed it. It was announced last week that we are participating in the small business micro grant program . So this will be able to provide grants in the amounts of between $2,500 to $5,000 to businesses specifically ones that are in, like, the new or early stage of their business which I think is exciting because there have been a lot of funding opportunities for businesses that suffered through the COVID pandemic . But then we have had new business es 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 that have opened as well or plan to and this will be something to support those efforts . The businesses have to be in a low to moderate service area. It is a CDBG Program . They are partnering with the University of Scranton on it. So you can apply if you meet the qualifications through the City of Scranton 's website . And then, if you have additional questions you could contact Tiffany Cross Luciani in OECD at Tcluciani @Scrantonpa .gov. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. KING: Just a few real quickly . I want to remained everyone that the Scranton St. Patrick 's Day Parade is scheduled for Saturday , March 12th. The day begins with a mass at 10:00 at St. Peter's Cathedral followed by the Brian Kelly memorial two mile race, which begins at 11 a.m., in front of the Scranton Cultural Center. And then the parade kicks off at 11:30 or 11:45 -- 11:45. We're hoping for great weather and looking forward to the St. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Patrick 's Day Parade. I also want to announce that hopefully it looks like we're going to be running the 25th Steamtown Marathon on Sunday, October 9th. Registration will begin April 1st. So we've been trying to do the 25th annual for three years now. So hopefully this is going to be our big year to get our 25th annual marathon in. And I just wanted to announce that. Also the Shamrock Heart Foundation , we're a local 501C3 that sends out flowers and carnations on St. Patrick 's Day, March 17th. We bring them to all the nursing homes and to the hospitals . So we're working to gather donation s to help offset some of the costs of that venture and looking for some volunteers and drivers to help put together the corsages and deliver them to the nursing homes and hospitals on March 17th. So those are some of the things happening in the next few months. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Any other Council members have any announcements ? Just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 one thing I think Mr. King forgot to mention regarding the St. Patrick 's Day Parade if you want to put an entry into the parade, you have until Monday, February 28th to submit an entry. The website is Stpatparade.com. So if you want to put an entry and participate in this year's parade, please do so. Also, just a reminder that although even though there was a holiday yesterday , garbage is on schedule this week. The DPW contract doesn't call for President 's Day as one of their observed holidays . Just a reminder that garbage pickup is on schedule this week. And then also to just -- an update I got from the Tax Office last week regarding real estate bills, they should have -- you should have received last week. The tax collector just wants to remind taxpayer s that in person payment methods that taxpayer s paying with checks at the Lackawanna Government Center are require d to utilize the drop box in the vestibule in the building . All payments made via the drop box will receive a receipt in the mail. It will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 accessible Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. through 4:30 p.m. Taxpayers paying with cash will be permitted to enter the Single Tax Office to make their payments . Social distancing will be enforced and masks are required . Taxpayer s who mail their tax payment s should include a stamped self-addressed envelop to receive a receipt . Online payment methods are listed on the STO website at Scranton taxoffice.org. For the refuse fee payment and exoneration procedure , the STO is collecting the refuse fee for the City of Scranton and it's included in the tax bill. The City and School District real estate taxes cannot be paid without the refuse fee. City, SSD, and refuse fee can be paid quarterly using the coupons at the bottom of the bill. Quarterly payments do not include county taxes, no other partial payments will be accepted . Taxpayers who believe they're eligible for exoneration of any part of the refuse fee should contact the City of Scranton 's Treasury Bureau. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Applications are on the City's website or at the Treasurer 's Office. And all refund requests will be processed in December of 2022 or January of 2023. Once sufficient proof that a vacancy has existed for the full calendar year, advanced exonerations will not be granted. And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the sign-in sheet is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . Let me just start with announcing the Friends of the Scranton Public Library will be having a book sale at the Market Place at Steamtown , March 1st through the 6th right in front of Crunch Gym. The hours are pretty much the same as the mall's hours. And it's a great place to get books for 1 or 2 dollars , especially hard cover books. You can't beat the price. So I hear there's a rumor we have a draft audit? MR. DONAHUE : That's what I was made aware of this afternoon . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MS. HODOWANITZ : Hallelujah . So can I also assume that maybe we'll see it either in Third Order or on the City's website sometime next week? MR. DONAHUE : As soon as we -- as long as we receive it by Monday morning we will have it on our agenda in Third Order for next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. It's only five months late from when Kohanski said they were going to give it to us. I remember the date they announced originally was September 30th. I also noticed according to Controller 's report for January , they picked up another check for $15,000. The labor union contracts , is there any information on their progress ? MR. DONAHUE : They're still being negotiated . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, 14.5 percent of the year is already gone. I hope there won't be a negative impact on the budget. Item 3-K on the agenda tonight , Mitesh Patel is going to be acting treasurer through March 22nd. I didn't see a resume on him. Does he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 have a background in finance ? MR. DONAHUE : I will -- we will request a resume and we'll get back to you on that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. At least it didn't get into the agenda. Items 5-C and 5-D, the City's requesting grants for 10 electric vehicle s and charging stations . I would assume that this is the beginning of transitioning from gas powered vehicle s to electric vehicles long-term. But it's interesting since I pointed out last week and I will point out next week during the public caucus, your proposed zoning ordinance says nothing about electric vehicle charging stations . It says a lot about the gas station s because of the hazards with fuel. But you got to remember those electric vehicle s and their batteries , batteries cause a lot of fires and have to they have to be stored somewhere when they're used up and they have to be disposed of. So I hope that someone takes a look at that before we finalize a zoning ordinance which may not be updated for another 30 years. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Item 5-F, the grant to help us navigate out of Act 47, it's probably PEL and Jerry Cross. And he's a great asset to the City so he would help us a great deal. But it just surprised me that we -- I thought we successfully exited Act 47 and this is to help us successfully navigate our way out of Act 47. So I think I understand what you're trying to do. But it looks a little awkward the way it got advertise d so, you know, I support it but -- MR. DONAHUE : I think there was a miscommunication too between the City and DCED regarding this grant. I was under the assumption that this was going to be put in and be finalized before we exited. But there was a little miscommunication , which is why we're getting it now. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Is this a one year thing or -- MR. DONAHUE : That's my understanding that's it's going to be a one year thing. I think the grant only provides for one year. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And Item 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 5-G, I was trying to find out who owns 524 Penn Avenue. So I went on the county's assessment website and their database and nothing popped up. And I wanted to go onto the City's database for delinquent real estate and refuse fees. I couldn't find the database. Is it still on the City's website or I just couldn't find it? MR. DONAHUE : I'll have to check that. I don't know. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. The point being, I have no problem with going for a grant to clean up the contamination at a certain site. We did it for the Pocket Park. But I would hate to see a precedent that property owners could just walk away from contamination because the City's going to handle it. We need to hold property owners accountable . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner and taxpayer . First off, welcome , Mr. King. I haven't been here since you were on Council . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 was here a few weeks ago. You were off that night. Good to see you again. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SPINDLER : You're welcome . As Councilman Donahue said, last week I received my tax bill. And it got me thinking . I think this is the second year where the garbage tax is in with the property taxes. And it got me thinking , how do I know I'm getting a discount on a garbage tax? I don't remember what my property tax used to be. So how do I know I'm getting a discount ? MR. DONAHUE : It's factored in the equation there. So if you could -- MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, but how do I know -- how will I know that? I don't know what I'm suppose d to be paying. There should be a separate line on there for the garbage fee. MR. DONAHUE : So it is itemized on there. It's itemized on there. Where -- MR. SPINDLER : I didn't see it. MR. DONAHUE : So when you go down -- when you go down the list it says what your county taxes are and then there is also, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 like, the library fee on the county side. And I believe there is another fee. And then it goes down to the City and then it has the city, school district , refuse fee. MR. SPINDLER : I'll have to check it again. I don't remember seeing that. Anyway, another thought I had, I have been coming to these meetings for 20 years. And for the first 18 years before they put it in with the property taxes, I argued that we pay our property taxes to have our garbage picked up. And the answer I got, oh, it's not a tax it's a fee. Now all of a sudden, it's a tax. Who makes these decisions ? MR. DONAHUE : It's still a fee. It's just on the garbage -- or on the -- MR. SPINDLER : That's illegal because I came to this Council two years ago. And I was told that by somebody that works in a CPA's office you can't put -- the IRS said you can't put a fee in a property tax. MR. DONAHUE : The library fee has been on the tax bill for 15 -- at least 15, 20 years. MR. SPINDLER : Well, maybe nobody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 cares about that. The library fee isn't like the garbage fee. Now, I hear it's a tax. What is it, a fee or a tax? I think it's another way that the City is screwing over the taxpayers . They've been doing it for 20 years since I've been coming to these meeting s. I don't know if that court case that's pending will have anything to do with it. But I hope it does. The property tax -- the taxpayers deserve a break one of these times. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening Council . You know, if there's anyone out there that is better off today than they were a year ago, I wish they'd tell me the secret. This isn't the America I grew up in. That one's abolished . I don't know. Twenty years from now I just can't imagine what this country will be like. Anyway, like a few of the people I talk to I read Kelly's obnoxious statements every Sunday, Wednesday and see what's on his hate list for the week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Last Sunday it was the landfill , the plant -- I don't know if you -- any of you investigated that plant. But simply it takes the waste products and turns it into heat and gas and electric ity that's going to sold probably to New Jersey. There's a possibility if you ask me of our Mayor trying to broker a situation for this county -- the City and the county buy at a reduced rate because all the contract s there's still room to squeeze in there. You're talking about a huge savings. And I know she's capable of doing that. I don't know if she wants to. But it certainly -- it'd certainly be a plus for everybody involved . And one other thing, Saturday when I was watching Flash Gordon he crashed landed his spaceship on planet Mongol. I'm going to tell you -- I'm coming to something . Don't look at me like a nut case. And the emperor , he's got these zombies . They look just like the ones that the living dead -- of course, that's 80 years ago. The zombies captured Flash. And he'd bring it before a council just like you guys. But they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 were better dressed . They had robes with hoods on them. You couldn't really see their faces too much. The council 's name was the Council of the Wise just like here. But I have to wait until next week to see how he escapes. You know, when I look at that clock, it reminds me of a NASCAR speedometer going around and around. If you want, I'll tell you what happens next week. Really, give some thought to this plant and investigating if we can further it. You know, I see these people every couple days. I get up at five in the morning and go have coffee with them. They can be talked to. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts our sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I have a hard time saying Keystone Landfill when it really is a mountain of garbage . But they did advertise on the 2nd of February that they are going to be submitting a major permit modification to DEP to modify the leachate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 management . Now what I'd like to know is, will the City be commenting on this since much leachate flows through our neighborhoods ? MR. DONAHUE : I'm hopeful , yeah. I mean, we have to see what the permit modification is. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I mean, somebody is looking at it --- and do we get -- do we get paid for the lines that -- the leachate lines that go through the City? MR. DONAHUE : I don't believe we do. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, okay. Then moving onto a property tax conundrum . Does a property owner benefit from having a tenant? For instance , does General Dynamics pay property tax or not based on the fact that the owner is a -- is government owned? And comes to the other way, does the Steamtown receive a tax reduction because they rent to nonprofit s such as Geisinger and Luzerne College and I guess at one time Delta Medix. But I heard they moved out. Does anybody know the answer? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know but I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 look into that and hopefully have one for you next week. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. Now, census impact, as we're well aware our population has declined . And the Governor has given us the opportunity to become a third class city. And I would like to know when you all are going to put a committee together to at least study the differences positive s and negatives and bring it forth to the people. Do you have any intention of doing that? MR. DONAHUE : I think the whole class system, first class, second class is just outdated anyway. I think that needs to be complete ly rewritten . MS. SCHUMACHER : But that's what we have to work with now. That's what we have. So I think we should -- I think you all should appoint a group to tell what the positive s and negatives are of going from a 2A to a third. Then stormwater , many moons ago we were told that SAPA reps were coming here. But I have not seen them. And I think I've been here every meeting . And I just like to know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 how long you are going to plan to kick this stormwater can down -- I mean, Mr. Donahue , when you first came on board you were pretty deeply involved in some of that and particularly I know over in Keyser Valley you were because I remember the other day -- I don't know where it came from. But my -- on my computer came a former -- well, I guess it was just a City Council meeting . But you and Lenny Srebro was here where I'm standing and he asked about that pipe and you told him that you believe the pipe was replaced that had been cut off. Now, has that been -- has that portion between what Merrifield and Dewey, is that no longer a problem floodwise? MR. DONAHUE : So I don't believe it's as big of a problem . It's not as big of a problem but it still is a problem . We just had I think it was about six months ago we had an engineering study done on the impacts there. And that now is going to impact how we use some of this ARP money to actually do a complete fix of the issues over in Keyser Valley. MS. SCHUMACHER : Has that -- did you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 ever follow up on that? Did that pipe get put through ? MR. DONAHUE : I was never given a solid answer one way or the other on that pipe. But we do have an engineering report now on the issues facing the Keyser Valley on the whole, not that just that one. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, and what's going to happen now you got that, what's the next step? MR. DONAHUE : So, no, the next step is to actually do something to fix the problem now that we have the engineering report on how the water flows off the mountain . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : You can finish your thought . MS. SCHUMACHER : And the rescue plan, when is the meeting going to be -- a public meeting so we people -- MR. DONAHUE : So myself and Dr. Rothchild had our first sit-down with the Mayor today. And now the Mayor's going to move through and have a sit-down with the rest of Council and then we're going to have a public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 meeting about what the, you know, the overall plan looks like. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . It was an interesting premeeting session . And one of the interesting things I scribbled down is business , future business in Scranton . As we know, business trends have been going towards the internet sales which can be run from home offices with supply lines being mailed from China or anywhere else in the world. Why would anyone incorporate build work and create a business LLC in Scranton ? There's a problem with taxation in Scranton as we all know. That's why a lot of the companies are going up to Jessup to build their houses and everywhere else. It's because of the tax burden in this area. MR. DONAHUE : I disagree with that. I think they build them up there because it's easier on and off of the highway than it is here and land. MR. COYNE: I just look at it and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 see that if I can incorporate in Delaware or somewhere else and run my business officially out of there, there is no reason to come to a place where I have a bigger tax burden. That's why the garment workers union left Scranton and why a number of business es left over a period of time. It's not just this area. It is a number of places throughout this nation have been reaching the struggle of loss revenue purely for the reason it's no longer bound to City borders . I understand we left Act 47. I believe the triple LST tax is part of Act 47. Is there anything about readjusting the fees considering I believe the maximum is either 104 or 107 once you're outside of Act 47? MR. DONAHUE : It should be 52 -- the maximum is $52 a week we're allowed to continue the tripling as long as our pension systems remain distressed . That was a law passed I think in 2014. MR. COYNE: Thank you. Now, members of Council , first on a side note, I brought up pilot or payment s in lieu of taxes and how in comparison some nonprofits versus single 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 private donors were greatly under donating . Since we're talking about non-profits -- I want to touch on Scranton Tomorrow . It's been disclose d before that Scranton Tomorrow is financed by a pilot passthrough donated from the University of Scranton . What I had to look for themselves , Scranton Tomorrow was made to support an increased growth in center city Scranton . It's the goal -- is not the entire City but the backyard of the University . Back in years ago it was underfunded and fell into almost hitting a zero balance . This was corrected by two increases in donation s. The City I believe changed from 37,000 to 75 and then U of S stepped in with $200,000. Over the few years the coffers have swelled and they have close to a million dollars in their revenue . I would like to see Scranton Tomorrow come forward as it is a nonprofit and do a pilot program for the neighborhoods around the City of Scranton . I'm talking about 10 percent donated specifically to surround ing areas per year to serve to build up not only center city but the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 lifelines coming into this city. They are nonprofit . And as long as they have excess funds every single year growing their bankroll, I think it would be beneficial to ask them to put in some of that money towards building the community . I also have a problem with that someone needs to deal with Mr. Murray and his ECTV from the IT Department or whoever the contracted skill trainer is. So far in his bid openings we've had when he shared screens on ECTV blank screens while he's talking . We've had him open a screen to show it and all of a sudden instead of seeing a screen when he's on dual screens, he has the wrong screen open and we're seeing popup reminders on his computer . And last with the -- on 1/17 there was a bid for smoke detectors for City Hall. Two of them were taken by e-mail from him. The third was put through City Hall. It was done through a telephone call that was basically muted. The problem is evidently no one in City Hall knew how to scan that document put in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 for a bid and get it to him on e-mail so he could effectively open up that bid and in clarity show it. He had to contact by phone for that bid. And I think someone needs to look at that department 's communication because we're not getting the information that we should be getting from him. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : It's me again, Dave Dobrzyn , resident . Okay. Once again I'm going to display my little poster. I remade one. And it would end most gerrymandering . The old direct is here. You could move out this way. You could move out south. That would be west. But no more districts looking like a bowl of Lucky Charms cereal, breakfast cereal. And I'm calling it the straight line redistrict plan. I'm going to leave this one here. This new district restores the necessary population . And this is only a prototype . It has nothing to do with the actual 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 size of our district . It's just so that someone can see it on television . I think Scranton is being carved up like a birthday cake. And I'm not happy with it at all. Some of our proposed districts will not reflect the attitude s and opinions of Scranton or maybe not even be concerned about them. Originally it started with four. I mean, come on. And on Spruce Street last week, I don't talk the way some people do. But actually I find Spruce Street not to be too objectionable of a street. There's a nasty pothole in front of Pisanchyn Law Firm. And I do use Spruce Street right from the expressway . I turn off from South Side which is where I live. But I don't know if that many project s or that large of a project going on, you know, it may even alienate the people on that street further by having 15 months of construction going on. And it's really questionable . So I think there's other parts of the City that could use some funding . And on electric cars, I hear that again tonight . And I'm wondering , you know, I have been through about five 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 so-called gas shortage s or whatever you want to call it in my lifetime . And it was very disruptive because I was employed virtually all my lifetime in the automotive industry and repair industry . So what I'm wondering if we're not funneling ourself into a thing where then we could cartel homes and no electric ity for the home, your furnace won't work, your oil burner or gas burner won't have an air supply or, you know, it just goes on and on. You won't have power for your television because all of these people plugging in their humvees every evening at their home will be hogging up the energy -- the electric al energy. Well, I think hybrids are the better solution , way better because you could use a hybrid even if the electric ity goes out. And I'd like to salute the antivax people. Please find somewhere else to go. And Joan mentioned about pollution on certain lots. We're cleaning this up. You know, all my life until I was 16 I lived in a little mining town that was surrounded by 50 and 100 foot holes, if not a thousand foot hole. And the point in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 being that that is what industry calls externalization . They external ize their liabilities . They didn't cover in the holes. They didn't want to pay 10 cents for it. And who gets stuck with it to remediate it, the people that -- in my area people used to go out on those ATVs. And they'd go over a cliff and right into a strip mine full of water and drown in the middle of the winter. You know, so that's what it's called, externalization . I really think that DeNaples -- I looked at their plan. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : I'll make it quick. But they want to dump their leachate in the Nay Aug gorge. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DOBRZYN : I don't think so. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: None at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I have a couple quick ones just in response to Joan. I am looking into whether or not the electric charging station should be included in the SAPA plan. So I haven't received a response yet. But I will mention when I do. And just something with regards to ARPA funding for American Rescue Plan, there will be available on the City website -- I don't have a date yet. But they are working on it and it should be out shortly . There will be a survey that resident s could take for how they would like to see the ARPA money spent within the City. And, of course, there's a draft plan and we have an idea of some areas that the Mayor and her administration feel that money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 should go towards . But it is also important that we receive public input. Maybe there's a big piece that we're missing or something that is more important to people that we should know about. And so I think that will be really useful when that is published . And another exciting part of it is that you will be given a budget, $100. And then you could put, you know, how much of the $100 you would place into certain things for the City and for the use of that money. So that will be our way of seeing, like, what percentage of the public would like to see go towards , you know, whether it's stormwater or the parks. And so that will be a useful component of it. And the last thing that I wanted to mention , I did have a resident contact me. He's having difficulty getting his refunded money for the refuse fees from last year. He had a property that he shouldn 't have had to pay refuse fees on. And we're still waiting to see if those checks have been sent out. I don't know if other resident s are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 experiencing that issue if they haven't received their checks yet for that. But this gentleman has not. So I would ask that, Mr. Voldenberg , if could you once again reach out to the Mayor's Office to find out where those checks are, if they've been sent because that's very important if people are expecting to receive that in December and now we're close to March here and they still haven't received that money that's owed to them. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have two complaints . Both of them were this past Sunday. One is on East Mountain , one is on West Mountain . So we'll start with the West Mountain . So this is West Mountain Road from Parallel Drive to Newton Road early this morning inches of ice. The City says it's a PennDOT issue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 but these are City roads. If there's an emergency , emergency vehicles won't be able to get up the streets . This is a huge issue. Please share this and help get the word out. All right. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I have a picture -- I'll just give you what I have, all right, so you could send this over to clarify who is responsible for the road so we know for sure, okay? And then on West Mountain , the same issue. This was Sunday morning -- Saturday ice everywhere . This is at the 1500 block of Froude Avenue. It was impassable . The citizen -- MR. DONAHUE : East Mountain -- MR. MCANDREW : East Mountain . What did I say? The first one was West. This is East Mountain . I apologize . So this is East Mountain , Froude Avenue, 1500 block of Froude Avenue. I guess, you know, this resident called the DPW three times. Guy said he'd pass it along. So called later, still nothing . And then finally they got a call back and they said that they aren't sending anyone out until it snows. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 if you could also please put this section up on East Mountain , this street, on their radar. There's a storm coming Friday. I'll give you both. I'll give you the picture s for both and the correspondence I received . And then secondly, so past couple months we receive d a summary from OECD about quality of life issues and we put it in Third Order. And, you know, it's been very helpful I think for us. We have something to look at. I think it's helpful for the residents . They get to see it and eventually it's going to be in OpenGov . But as of right now, it's only going to be in OpenGov . So I think that we as Council should provide a report like that or summary to the taxpayers . So when you -- like, an example , Mrs. Hodowanitz , when you keep asking about say, you know, where are the union contracts ? Or you ask about the audit or, Mrs. Schumacher , you come and ask about a bunch of stuff that we do send down but we don't get the quick response we think we should. And it's not that we're leaving you hanging . But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 would love to have a similar report because these issues that we talk about and you do bring to us during the Citizens Participation is important . And but those concerns and complaints are probably not going to funnel through OpenGov like the quality of life issues. It will be very visible eventually to everybody . But I feel it's our responsibility to provide the same summary or update -- not weekly but we could put it in Third Order like the one we get from OECD. So with that said, I'd like to make a motion to start that process . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : That is all I have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I was actually up on East Mountain Friday night and I think it's all over the mountain where there's that issue when you have, you know, warming temperatures then immediately freeze over. There's certain areas that turn into ice. And I think that's, you know, that's a product of us not addressing stormwater . But, you know, that is something that will be address ed because it is a stormwater issue too that's causing those issues on both, you know, east and west mountain and also in certain parts of, you know, the City overall . Just the other thing I have is, I was extremely disappointed that the commissioners tabled the their legislation regarding reassessment last week. And I was even more disappoint ed that Commissioner Dominick reverted to the same scare tactics that have been used in the past. Reassessment is not done to, you know, to raise anybody 's taxes. It's not done to impact, you know, those that really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 shouldn 't be affected . It's done to help those people because the only people that are benefitting from the lack of a reassessment right now are the people that are able to take advantage of the system as it currently is. We are not taxing on current value. We're taxing based off a formula that's uses to calculate current valued based off of what the assessment was 50 years ago. We need to tax on, you know, we need set tax rates based on what current value is, not what it is 50 years ago. So I really -- hopeful that the commission er will reevaluate her stance and that we can get this process started . There are protections for people who are disproportionately affected by, you know, property taxes. There's a Pennsylvania property tax rent rebate. There's an assessment process . You know, if the commission er is so concerned about actually , you know, coming up with policies that affect these people, then why hasn't she proposed one? But I really hope that she reconsider s and that we could get this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 process started so that we modernize the way we do business . Because it's not only about doing reassessment once, but it's about creating a process where reassessment can be done within an every 10 year period, whether that's spot reassessment , whether that's some form of that. But I just really hope that she reconsiders her stance on that. And that's all I have for tonight . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS (UNC) OF NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA , ACTING THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH FINANCING AUTHORITY FOR A LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT GRANT, PURSUANT TO THE PA RACE HORSE DEVELOPMENT AND GAMING ACT IN THE AMOUNT OF $997, 500.00 FOR THE PROJECT TO BE KNOWN AS “UNC 530 CEDAR AVENUE ANCHOR BUILDING PROJECT ” LOCATED AT 530 CEDAR AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 SCRANTON TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, IF SUCCESSFUL , AND EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT GRANT CONTRACT AND COMMITMENT LETTER WITH THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA TO ACCEPT AND UTILIZE THE GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF $997,500.00 IF AWARDED BY THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA FOR SUCH PROJECT . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MS. SCHUSTER : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , one thing I did forget to mention in Fifth Order but I will bring up here because it is relatable here. Mr. Coyne brought up about Scranton Tomorrow about going into neighborhood s. Scranton Tomorrow is an economic development organization . That's their main purpose . UNC, NeighborWorks , they're the neighborhood development organization s that we go through . So I just wanted to clarify that. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR $35,641.50 TO HELP FUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND CHARGING STATIONS FOR UP TO TEN (10) ELECTRIC VEHICLES , FUNDING FOR WHICH IS SIMULTANEOUSLY BEING SOUGHT BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON , AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, COORDINATE AND DISBURSE THE GRANT FUNDS AS APPROPRIATE . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm okay with moving this forward and introducing it. I think when it's time -- it comes time to actually do this project , I think we do have to take a closer look at the cost benefit of this. Right here this one $35,000. I'm looking at the average cost of these stations . They're at least $60,000. So the City is going to have to put up a match and electric cars are only as clean at their power source. So I think we do need to look at, you know, is this maintainable ? What's the lifespan of the cars? Where are they going to be stored and things like that. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm happy to see this legislation being introduced tonight . I hope that we do receive this grant. I think it will be helpful in moving the City forward towards applying more environmentally conscious . And I also -- sorry, I also feel that this will be a good way for specifically the LIPS Department to travel around the City and so that resident s see them being more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 visible within their communities . I think that we've been missing that factor. And an inspector might be around your neighborhood and checking out a property but you're not aware of it. You might not recognize the person. They're not in a uniform so you'll see these vehicles coming around throughout the City and knowing that something is being done within the neighborhood . So that's why I'll be voting in favor of introduction tonight . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D.

MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : On the question , very similar to the 5-C, the grant application is for $75,000. The average cost of these cars is about 56,000. So this will be about I guess about 1/10th of the cost of the total project . You know, I have questions as to who is going to maintain these vehicle s, where they're going to be stored, disposal , etc. So I think it also might be beneficial if we're looking into this alternative sources . Maybe talk to the landfill about natural gas vehicles which are about half the cost. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ?
