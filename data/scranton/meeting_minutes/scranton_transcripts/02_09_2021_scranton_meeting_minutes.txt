This is a collaborative effort by ShopRite , which is -- donated the food and Toyota of Scranton along with Johnson students that will be packaging the food. There will be a limit of four meals per vehicle and is, you know, utilizing a safe drive through pickup. So great job to them guys. Also Bob Gattens has reminded me of the Nay Aug Food Drive which actually started today, February 9th. And it's also February 11th from 5 to 7 and again February 13th and 14th, 10 to 3 p.m. Donations go to local pantries, which, you know, these are -- they want non-perishables , so canned goods, legumes , dried stuff like that.

Any other announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just wanted to congratulate the Scranton Ice Festival . I know that I had mentioned it a couple of times that was going to be going on this past weekend . And it sounds like it was a successful event then. And they raised several thousand dollars to go to Scranton small businesses . And I think it gave people something to, you know, to do over the weekend and to enjoy it. A lot of great ice sculptures and a lot of the businesses benefit ed from it which was their goal. And so I look forward to that continuing in future years. And it sounds like they maintained safety as well. And people wore their mask. And the sculptures were spread out like throughout the downtown area, different business es. So it wasn't like one big crowd, anything like that. Yeah, so I just wanted to mention that. That's it. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Anyone else? I just wanted to mention that next week, NDC, the National Development Council will be coming to caucus at -- Council 's caucus at 5:45 to give an update on the parking garages and the progress that's being made. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individual : Fay Franus. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission as follows : Council What have you done to stop the trucks on Railroad Avenue and 3rd Avenue?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Have you decided to start enforcing the law that bans trucks over ten ton? Mr. DeNaples has a business that has hundreds of trucks going down 3rd Avenue -- This is against the law enacted in 1995,, banning trucks over 10 ton. Mr. DeNaples has to find another way to get his products delivered . The residents of Scranton should not suffer safety----- health issues ----or any other adverse affect due to DeNaples trucks. Also the tractor Trailers and big dump trucks are continuing to travel on Railroad Avenue every day and the police are doing nothing to stop these trucks. Mr Gaugahn , you mentioned at last weeks meeting that you and the Mayor have discussed this situation . Can you please share with the residents of Bellevue what you have discussed and any solutions . What is the status of any contract being signed to have a company take care of our delinquent garbage fees. Today is February 9th 2021. The last contract ended on December 31st 2020. Please share with us when you will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 reintroduce this to hire a company to do this work. Submitted by Fay Franus. (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that conclude s the public comment . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question ? On the question , just a few things. First of all, we addressed the Third Avenue issue in the caucus. But I'll address it again tonight . We are going to -- right now. We are going to send a letter to the administration regarding Third Avenue because we did receive a letter from -- had to be almost every resident who lives on the street about two weeks ago. It is a major problem . It's a major inconvenience . It's a major impact on the health and welfare and safety of the people that live on that street. I know just as somebody with young children , trucks, you know, rumbling up and down the street nonstop day in and day out is not a good thing especially when -- for those who live there almost their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 entire lives they never had to deal with that. So it's an inconvenience for the people on Third Avenue because of a business on Elm Street which does not seem to be -- is not fair whatsoever . So we are going to ask for action from the administration . And as for Miss Franus's comment on have you decided to start enforcing the law that bans trucks over 10 ton. Council cannot enforce any laws. We are legislators . We're in the police department . We're not the administration . The police department would be the department that would enforce any laws that were passed, any ordinances or resolution s that were passed banning any trucks in that area. In fact, when I met with members of the administration and the former Police Chief in the summer of 2020, they told me that at least once a month the police department would be on Third Avenue enforcing the Jake brake ban there that we put in place that -- at my direction and Council 's direction . And there was going to be some other things down there. So we are going to find out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 if that's been done. I would like to know personally how many trucks have been cited since the summer of 2020. And I do think that action should be taken. Councilman McAndrew had I thought a pretty good idea in investigating if there is an alternate route. The ultimate solution to this problem as I mentioned before is the Elm Street bridge being replaced. Unfortunately , that's three or four years out. And I don't think that the people on Third Avenue should have to continue to be burdened by this for the next three to four years. So there has to be another solution . And we're going to do the best that we can to investigate that and make sure that those people are not burdened any further . We're going to do the best that they can as Council . But ultimately , you know, the Mayor and her administration are the ones who have to enforce any laws on the books and are the ones that have to, you know, make sure that this does not occur. Any one else on the -- oh, one other point. But we did mention this in the caucus, but Miss Franus also asked about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 status of the delinquent refuse fees. I just want to make very clear. Council did their part. We did our due diligence . When the contract came to us in late in 2020, we did what Council is suppose d to do which is go through the contract with a fine-tooth comb and make sure that it is, you know, representative of making sure that the people of the City of Scranton get a good deal. So our solicitor to his credit went through with all of us and made some significant changes to make sure that the contract benefited -- not a private company but the City of Scranton and the taxpayers . So we did that. We gave our recommendations . We gave the language in December of 2020. And it's February 9th, 2021. And we haven't received anything yet. So the ball is not in our court. The ball is in the administration and the Mayor's court. So the Business Administrator did say that we are supposed to see legislation I think next week or in the next few weeks. So I just wanted to make sure we made that point. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a comment or actually a notice. There's an upcoming Fire Department vacancy civil service test. Signups will be -- will begin February 16th through February 26th. All of the information is also on the website. So there's a downloadable application on the City website where it could be filled out and the interested applicant s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 need to submit this between , like I said, the 16th and the 26th with a non-refundable fee in the amount of $75. So like I said, I'm not going to read all of this because it's all posted on the website if anybody 's interested . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Not at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have two quick things. So we received an e-mail from a gentleman from Clearview Street. There is an issue with again, unfortunately , truck tractors -- or tractor -trailers , rather, that are coming down the 17, 18 and 1900 blocks of Clearview Street. And they are coming from North Main Avenue from West Scranton . They encounter a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 railroad and expressway bridges . And they realize that they can't go under them so they are veering left on Euclid Avenue. And then they're travelling down Euclid and then they're turning onto Clearview Street. And it's causing all sorts of problems here. So the neighbor that reached out -- and I know everyone in this span of Clearview Street is upset about this. They did say that in the past they had asked for signage to be put up. But they didn't get anywhere with that. So, Mrs. Reed, did you send -- forward this already ? I can't remember because we got three or four requests this week. MS. REED: I don't believe I was included on those e-mails, Councilman Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. You know what, I'm looking now. It's a good thing I brought it up. You weren't included on this one. So I'm going to forward this to you. MS. REED: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : If we send to the DPW or -- yeah, the DPW and the police department I think would be involved in that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 So I'm sure signage might help. And I don't know what else they could come up with. And then if they could just ask them if they could get back to this gentleman . He provided his e-mail address and his address as well. The only other thing I wanted to mention was we talked about it in caucus. But we did receive several updates from the Business Administrator , which I do appreciate . I asked last week for updates on quite a few things. The one thing that Solicitor Hayes is going to meet with the Labor Solicitor , Bob Ufberg about the Police Chief -- the Acting Police Chief. So this just has to do with making sure that we're following -- I just want to make sure that we're following the rules. According to the Administrative Code, when appoint someone as an acting director , you only have -- it's only for 35 days according to the code. So this has been a few months now. So we want to make sure that we're following the Administrative Code and the rules there. Also, we're still waiting for an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 update on one of the things that I asked for that I think is really important and it's the recommendation s from Act 47. And I know the administration is working on putting something together . There's two things in particular and I brought this up -- and it predates this administration . It goes back to the previous administration . But the fund balance policy and the debt management policy are two things that I've asked for repeatedly . I think they're very, very important especially since we're coming up on exiting Act 47. So I would like to see what progress has been made on that. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : So just to -- just to touch on that, Councilman Gaughan , real quick. I believe they are in the process of like deep -- really starting to get into the process of formulating those two policies . That's what -- at least what I heard in my discussions with them. MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Thank you. Okay. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 11, 2020 ENTITLED “APPROVING THE TRANSFER OF A RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE OWNED BY OAK STREET EXPRESS , LLC, 610 NORTH MAIN STREET, TAYLOR, LACKAWANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA 18517 RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE NO. R-3114 TO ARADHY DEV BEER, LLC, (THE “MINI MART”), 401 WYOMING AVENUE AND MULBERRY STREET, SCRANTON , LACKAWANNA COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA , 18503, AS REQUIRED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA LIQUOR CONTROL BOARD” TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS PER THE PENNSYLVANIA LIQUOR CONTROL BOARD. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? The only thing I have on the question here -- and, Kevin, if you could look into this before next week, you know, I don't have a problem with this because it's a standard boilerplate type thing and we got (inaudible ) over the last few 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 years. I just don't understand what this legislation is actually doing. Like, it says in the fourth whereas clause that the Liquor Control Board requested additional clarification on the location of the premises and inclusion of the date of the public hearing . And then this minimart seeks to be in compliance with the requirements of the Liquor Control Board and request this revised ordinance to accomplish the same. I just -- I don't know what's different with this than what we had previously passed. I don't unless -- I just don't understand the point of it. ATTY. HAYES: I'll get confirmation , Bill. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. ATTY. HAYES: As far as -- my understanding is that the -- whatever the propose d legislation that we passed this summer with regard to this liquor license did not indicate that there was a hearing , which there was. It may not have identified the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 address . So they asked for further details to be included in the legislation . That's what -- I think's been resubmitted by the Law Department . But I'll confirm and get back to you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. I just wanted to -- wanted to make sure. Okay. Very good. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 67, 2014 ENTITLED “AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 52, 1903, ENTITLED ‘AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) RELATING TO DOGS, THE LICENSING OF, AND DOG POUND THEREFOR , AND PROVIDING FOR A FUND AND REGULATING THE PAYMENT OF BILLS FOR THE TREATMENT FOR THE PREVENTION OF HYDROPHOBIA ,’ BY DECREASING LICENSE FEES BY1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 AMENDING SECTION 1(A) TO CHANGE THE FEES OF THE CURRENT DOG LICENSES FOR ALL DOGS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , as I mentioned in the caucus, I -- this is a really good idea. We've always gotten complaints about the fee being too high in the amount $35. The one then I do think we should look into though is -- is it the county or the state, I can't remember off the top of my head that just has a one-time fee. ATTY. HAYES: It's the state. MR. GAUGHAN : Is it the state. Yeah, I want to look into does it make more sense for the City just to have a one-time fee instead of every year registering your dog. ATTY. HAYES: Right. MR. GAUGHAN : That makes a ton of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 sense. So we -- I'm going to look into that and see what other municipalities and counties do, see if that might make more sense. But I do agree with this legislation and lowering the fee at least. MR. DONAHUE : The only thing I would bring up there, Bill, about, you know, the -- just doing it once as a one-time fee is one of the things they request for on the form is that the, you know, the dog is up-to-date on its rabies and something else. And it actually asks you to give a confirmation number on that. But just to keep that in mind at least if you could report that. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, that's a good point. MR. DONAHUE : One of the functions of it is, you know, make sure they're up-to-date. I mean, our collection level on that, I mean, I don't think we hit a thousand dogs in the last few years per year. And we all thought there's more than a thousand dogs in the City. So hopefully , you know, we could start enforcing it a little bit too. I agree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 100 percent that it needs to be lowered. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, and I know that they're -- that's a good point. I know that they're adding an online payment option now if it's not already in place to help people instead of going down to City Hall. You could easily do it online so, okay, very good. MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick question though. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. MR. MCANDREW : I'm just -- I'm not clear on the process . So I'm thrilled that they lowered the fee because it's been a point of contention for a lot of residents and they've been heard which is great. But like, you know, my car registration I get a notice every year. Is that the process with the City -- MR. DONAHUE : So, yeah, so once you register -- once you register the dog in the first year, normally -- not this year because they haven't sent them out yet because they lowered them. But after I registered my dog the first year, usually in December you get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 notice from the City, you know, to renew your registration . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And then what happens if the -- MR. DONAHUE : But that's only if you register it the first time. MR. MCANDREW : So if you never register you -- all right. MR. DONAHUE : That's -- yes. MR. MCANDREW : And then what happens if you don't pay next year? You know, God forbid, you know, a dog -- or what happens when a dog passes away? Like, do you notify the City? Do you they send the registration form back and say, I'm sorry, but I no longer have this animal or -- I'm just curious about the whole process because I just don't understand it. I just -- MR. GAUGHAN : You can double-check on that with the Licensing and Inspection Department . ATTY. HAYES: I could look -- I'll look into that for you, Councilman . MR. MCANDREW : Just my own clarity . ATTY. HAYES: I don't know the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 answer to the question in terms of the -- their process but I'll look into it for you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I would agree it's unenforceable -- it's really been -- ATTY. HAYES: Right. Councilman Gaughan , I know with the state in order -- a lifetime license fee I think it's about $50. But I know that in order to be eligible for it, your dog must be either microchipped or -- MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, okay, yeah. ATTY. HAYES: That's my understanding of it under the Department of Agriculture and regulation s. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, and I believe that -- so that the way the state does it too and the county is different because the county charges the fee to give it to the state -- ATTY. HAYES: Right. MR. DONAHUE : Because then the state game warden I believe is the animal control officer in other parts of the county. But, you know, cities are different in that respect since we deal with our own animal control we have our own fee structure .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 ATTY.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. DONAHUE : On the question , this is just, you know, this is a first step in this process . This is work that needs to get done on the front end before we could even start applying for grants. So I'm happy to see this put in motion. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree, Councilman Donahue . And, you know, how many times I've been over the last few years down in this area of the City of Scranton with neighbors and standing outside their homes outside after a storm -- Lenny Srebro is one gentleman that comes to mind that continue to come to Council year after year looking for relief and I know the City did in some ways help him. It's just a very different situation unless you get a company like to come in and do a full-blown analysis and attack this problem with this type of study and this type of information , I think this will hopefully resolve it once and for all. And it's probably going to cost a significant amount of money. And that's the reason that we do the study first as Councilman Donahue mentioned . And then we try to go for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 grant money. And they did mention the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development , the H2O Program . So they're going to go and see if they could get grant funding through that. But like I said, there's been time after time just recently up in the Fawnwood development , we're still going back and forth with the neighbors up there. And the City is trying to help them, but it's just a difficult situation for a lot of homeowners. And hopefully this is the first step in rectifying a lot of that. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-F. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 CONTRACT WITH BENEVATE , INC d/b/a NEIGHBORLY SOFTWARE TO MANAGE THE OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT ’S HOUSING , ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GRANT PROGRAMS . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Was there a second? Oh, there was a second, okay. On the question ? On the question , this is going to cost $36,800 to enter into this contract for this software with this firm. And the maintenance cost -- the ongoing cost every year through OECD is going to be about $16,000. One of the things I will say about this is that I think -- this is a movement in the right direction . In terms of the City, we need to continue to use technology to our advantage and make sure that we're looking at these types of programs to make sure that we're doing everything we can to be in compliance with HUD which I know that's a huge priority in OECD and something that has to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 done and making sure that we're efficient . And I think that that checks both of those boxes. So that's why I'll be in favor of this. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to second that. I know that, you know, in the course of -- because all these things come in. They're in different accounts . So this will help consolidate that better. I know at one point, what, at the beginning of 2019 I think we still had money from 2014 that wasn't spent yet. You know, but we continuously worked on that over the last few years. I think now we're up to 17 or 18. But this will help, you know, organize that better moving forward . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree. You know, I think that the amount of money is reasonable and will be worth it in the end to increase that efficiency . You know, I know since Director Cipriani has been in that position , she's found, you know, a number of grant dollars that could be used and hadn't been. So, you know, we would hate to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 wasting those resources . And I think that this will help to keep them organized and tracking those grants and funds in a better way. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-G. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – ACCEPTING A DONATION PROVIDED TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON BY LAMAR ADVERTISING COMPANY FOR SIXTEEN (16) BILLBOARDS TO RELAY THE SCRANTON 311 MESSAGE . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , these signs have been up for quite sometime, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 haven't they? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't know. I believe so. I've seen them over the last maybe month or two. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I wasn't sure if there was a reason why we were getting this now or if anybody had any information on this. MR. GAUGHAN : I don't. But I know sometimes like in the past things have been donated to whether it's the police department or the fire department . And the person gives them the donation and then after the fact usually we would receive legislation accepting it just as kind of a formality . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Very good. On the question , I just wanted to mention that, you know, this Scranton 311 system I think has been really a good thing for the City in terms of making sure that there's kind of one place where people could go to ask questions , get information . It really improves the efficiency of the City. I really like seeing that over the last few years because often times in the past 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 you would call one department and get one answer and then they put you to another department . And it was confusing for people. I think the billboards are a good idea just so that people get an understanding of, you know, where they should go if they do have a question or they do need some kind of service or they do need something in their neighborhood . The one thing that I really -- and I think Councilman Donahue mentioned this or someone mentioned it last week or the week before, is the new design of the website which kind of ties in really nicely with Scranton 311. The website for years and years and years was kind of a mess. It was -- the front page of it and then everything was thrown on there. This categorizes everything really nice. It's just really good, you know, if you're a citizen and you want to come on, look for information , you could easily find it now which is really nice. So I want to give kudos to the administration on that. Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-H. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF DAVID E. FALCHEK , 1705 CHURCH AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18508 AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF ETHICS EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 17, 2021. MR. FALCHEK WILL BE REPLACING BRUCE REDDOCK WHO RESIGNED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2020. MR. FALCHEK WILL FILL THE UNEXPIRED TERM OF BRUCE REDDOCK WHICH IS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE AUGUST 31, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , you know, we struggled for quite 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 sometime in finding someone who would be interested in being on this board. So I want to thank Mr. Falchek for taking time out of his schedule and, you know, wanting to be involved in public service to the City. The board now has all -- will have all five members on it which is a great thing for the City. Just a few short years ago, this board was defunct. It was not operational . There was no attention paid really to the ethics in the City. And it took myself and this Council to stand up and get this board up and running again through completely revamp the Ethics Code. I believe there's a section now on the City's website for the Ethics Board where if you want to go and see somebody 's campaign finance report you could do that. The other thing that I thought was extremely important and that I pushed for and I know Councilman Donahue was on Council with me then pushed for was campaign contributions being limited and reined in. So now there's a limit. There's a cap where in the past one person could give a mayoral candidate , you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 know, 40, $50,000. And it's just not the way that business should be done in the City. So I'm very, very, very proud of the fact that we're at a point now where we have a fully functioning Ethics Board. And if something is going on in City Hall that is not above board, there's a place now where the employees and residents of the Scranton can go to and there's rules and regulations in place. So I wish all the board members the best of luck and again, thank Mr. Falchek for his willingness to serve the City of Scranton . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I also wanted to add that I'm happy to see that someone has stepped forward and applied for the position , you know, the work that the Ethics Board is doing is very important . And I've gotten to know Mr. Falchek over the years and to have some conversations with him about the City and, you know, transparency and the direction that we're headed in. And I feel that he'll be a great fit to serve on this board and have a lot of great things to bring to them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

BIDEN, JR. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm a broken record on this so I'll keep it very short. I mentioned in the caucus the committee members that we've brought together . So it would be myself and Councilman Donahue that are representing the Council ; Don King, our City Planner will be on the committee ; Leslie Collins , the Executive Director of Scranton Tomorrow ; Larry West, the Chief of Staff for Senator Blake; Roberta Jadick, the secretary for the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association ; Kevin Hayes our Solicitor ; and Mark Dougher , the Lackawanna County Director of Building and Maintenance . So I want to thank all of these people that are going to take time out of their busy schedule and their lives to serve on this committee . And I as I mentioned , I think it's very important that the City of Scranton do something -- formally do something to honor President Biden. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 As I mentioned the last couple weeks when this was on -- the last two weeks when this was on the agenda, it should really be whether you're a Democrat or Republican , an Independent or you're completely agnostic to politics , it should be a point of pride that the President of the United States is from the City of Scranton . He was born his first -- was born here and raised his first 10 years on North Washington Avenue and has always come back here and I believe represent s the City of Scranton on the national stage really well. And it's been extremely positive for us, all the attention that the City's gotten over the last few years and especially within the last year during the campaign and his eventual victory. So I think it's very -- obviously it's very rare that you have a President of the United States from your City. So we should capitalized on that and honor him in some way. And we'll do that and report back to Council from this committee . And thank you for your support . Anyone else on the question ?
