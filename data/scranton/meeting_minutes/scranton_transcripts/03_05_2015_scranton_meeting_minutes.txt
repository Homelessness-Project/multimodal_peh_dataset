MR.MCGOFF:Mr.Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.Onthe recovery planagain,I'mgoingtocircle backtothat,repeatedly Ihavesaidthatwe cannot pickandchoose thoseitemsthatwe likeordon'tlike.Infact,intheAmoroso1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 planit'sstated,"Itisvitally important thattheindividual elements oftheoverall strategy occuressentially intandem." Ihaveremained steadfastand consistent inmysupport fortheplan.I votedforAct205,thecommuter tax,because itwaspartoftheplanandconsistent with theplan.Ididn'tlikeitbutessentially Ivotedfortheplan.Ivotedagainst the police andfirecontracts formanyreasons , including thefactthatmanypartsofthe contract wereinconsistent andinviolation ofthelanguage intheprevious recovery planandtherevisedrecovery planbut, again,Ivotedfortheplan. DoIlikethisrecovery plan?Not byalongshot.It'satoughpillto swallow ,butthealternatives arelargetax increases andorreceivership orbankruptcy . Again,toremind everyone ofthe position Ispelled outduring thebudget discussions ,iftheanswer ismoredouble digittaxincreases onourproperty owners thenweshould petition theGovernor under Section 6and7ofAct47anddeclarea1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 fiscal emergency sooner thanlater.Again, I'mnotrecommending receivership or bankruptcy atthistime,butIbelieve that another significant property taxincrease or further increases inanyofourtaxeswill sendthecityintoaneconomic tailspin unlike anything wehaveseenduring our distressed status.Wecannolonger simply taxourwayoutofthissituation . Thetaxpayers cannolonger absorb largetaxincrease uponlargetaxincrease , fivepointmillion dollars indisability pension s,continuing structural deficits , unioncontracts withenhanced benefits anda government seemingly employee -centric when itshould betaxpayer andcitizen -centric .
