MINUTES OF THE COMPOSITE PENSION BOARD MEETING HELD MARCH 21, 2018. MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I have one comment . We have been talking the last three weeks about the recent Composite Pension Board meeting and the decision by the Composite Pension Board to divvy up the proceeds from the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority . I just want to read a letter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 into the record that I sent to Gerry Cross of the Pennsylvania Economy League April 19. "I am writing to you because of my concern over a recent vote taken by the Scranton Composite Pension Board. On Wednesday , April 4, 2018, the Composit e Pension Board voted to evenly split 90 percent of the 22.9 million in sewer sale proceeds between the fire and the police pension funds with the remaining 10 percent allocated towards the non-uniform fund. With an even split of 45 percent of the sewer sale proceeds designated in each fire and police fund, the funding for the fire pension fund would remain severely financially distressed at 38.2 percent . My concern is the long-term viability of the pension funds was not taken into full consideration by the board. As our Act 47 Recovery coordinator , I would like to know your opinion on this matter. Do you believe that the vote taken by the Composite Pension Board to evenly split the sewer proceeds between fire and police funds was a financially sound one for the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Scranton and its taxpayers ? Were you consulted on this matter by the city and did you have an opportunity to provide them your opinion on how the proceeds should be calculated ? I would appreciate a response as soon as possible ." I did ask the city administration regarding this meeting that took place by the Composite Pension Board meeting why the city abstained from the vote. I did receive an e-mail reply from Danielle Kennedy, who is the city's human resources director and she is the proxy for Mayor Courtright on the Composite Pension Board and she said the following : "The city came prepared to table the vote as it is the responsibility of the board to look at the soundness of each fund the comprises the composite fund itself. We needed additional time to review various allocation percentages and as such abstained from the vote because if it came up for reconsideration pursuant to Robert's Rules, we would be able to introduce a motion to change the allocation ." So I appreciate the response from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the administration . As I look through the minutes from the Composite Pension Board, I'm troubled because it does seem that the vote was rushed and the Pension Board did not take into consideration the additional analysis that was done that was requested and paid for by the City of Scranton so I don't know what the rush was, but I don't think at this point it was a good idea. I think they should have taken more time and investigated that additional analysis that was done. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MS. REED: 3-H.

If not, received and filed. Do any council members have announcements at this time? MR. PERRY: Yes, I have one announcement . The national prescription drug take back day will be held Saturday , this Saturday , the 28th, form 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. It provides an opportunity for Americans to prevent drug addiction and overdose deaths. The day aims to provide safe, convenient and responsible means of disposing of prescription drugs while also educating the public about potential for abuse of medications . Since the Drug Enforcement Administration first launched the take back day in 2010 more than 9 million pounds of medicine have been collected from the public. This is very close to my heart. As many of you have been effected by opioids in the city, county, state and this whole country of ours it's important and it's real. The damages are severe and any time we can get opioids out of the hands of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 people who don't absolutely need them the faster the better. There is no -- I've seen it happen, family close at hand to me, firsthand and it's awful and so please participate and this applies to you. The drop off center this year is going to be at the police headquarters at 100 South Washington Avenue, and again, the times are 2 a.m. to 2 p.m. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MS.

PERRY: Mr. Rogan, I have no motions at this time and all my comments are going to be held for the agenda items. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I just have a couple of comments . I brought up before that we did receive a response from the administration regarding the garbage fee and extending the discount period. They asked us that we put it in legislation so that will be on our agenda next week to extend the deadline to May 31. I'd also get a couple of complaints last week about the building on Hickory Street and South Webster that was recently destroyed by fire and the structural 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 integrity of that building so I did, you know, reach out to LIPS to see, you know, will this property be condemned and if so what's the status timeline for that demolition ? And in regards to the Lace Works project , we did get a response from Linda Aebli this week. The project , and I'm just going to read an e-mail written from Mrs. Aebli. "The project at Scranton Lace Works is moving along. The developer anticipates that the demolition of deteriorated buildings to begin on or about May 1. As the demolition starts, they will simultaneously begin the land development process with their contracted civil engineering consultant . That process will take approximately four to six months for all approvals and then they will immediately begin the site work and overall development including new construction and rehabilitation of the main historic building s. The project is very complex and involves many moving parts to transform the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 entire area into a very special community . The developers are very anxious to get this project completed for you one of which is the high cost of carrying the project onto which time it can generate revenue . The developers indicate d that they will be reaching out to the residents of the area in a couple of weeks to keep them fully informed on what would be happening ." And it just finishes , "I hope this answers any questions the public and city council may have." And that's all I have this evening . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments . MR. EVANS: Yes, thank you. Saturday I attended the funeral services this past weekend for my cousin's husband , a good friend of mine and a good man, Richie Pica, the former fire chief for the City of Scranton passed away last week. He loved to hunt and fish. He loved classic cars. He loved his family and friends and he fiercely loved his city. Years ago when Richie was the fire chief under Mayor Connors I was on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 the planning commission and when we crossed paths at family events I always had spirited debates on the city politics and the role of government . I always looked forward to seeing Richie. He had always had a big smile on for friends and family. The funeral procession was accompanied by Engine 10 from East Mountain and his pallbearers were all Scranton firefighters . The procession was attended for Elmhurst and Fairview Memorial Cemetery , but first there was a slight detour, a long route of vehicles first drove downtown and passed by fire headquarters on Mulberry Street. The firefighters on duty that day stopped , stood at attention and saluted their former chief as the hearse drove by a fitting and touching tribute to their former leader. It because of people like Richie Pica that the city will always survive . Like the city itself, he was good, strong, decent and humble. I wish I had said it while he was alive but I will say it now, thank you, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 On another front, not quite as -- well, in a different vein totally . Yesterday 's guest editorial in the Scranton Times by Attorney John McGovern titled, "City Tax Fairness Talk Empty" was not only an attempt to mislead the public about city council 's position on reassessment , but it is a failed and inaccurate attempt to link attack Act 511 litigation to the issue of reassessment . Mr. McGovern states in reference to the Act 511 case that the administration and city council publically claim their reassessment will solve the tax case. I'm not aware of one members of the city council ever having made that claim. Another claim stated is that this city council takes advice from a financial consultant as proposing a new payroll tax and he goes onto say, "If reassessment is about fair and equitable tax structure , then what is the elimination and reduction of the city's wage tax, realty transfer tax, local services tax, amusement tax, business privilege and mercantile tax?"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Again, what Mr. McGovern conveniently fails to include in his inaccurate assessment of reassessment is the following : The new payroll tax will be spread among many more business sectors is fair and equitable , is both revenue neutral and only occurs with the simultaneous elimination of the business privilege and the mercantile tax, a tax we have all agreed is anything but fair and equitable . Additional ly, he does not mention that this city council authored two reductions in the real estate transfer tax of 4.4 percent to 3.7 percent , and the parking tax that he mentioned is no longer in existence. He fails to mention that city council has requested that the administration hire an independent third party to review all fees from the top down with a view to reduce, consolidate and eliminate numerous nuisance fees. He also does not mention that the city council also offered a 10 percent discount in refuse fee saving taxpayers more of their hard earned money and increasing cash flow in the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 in the time of the year when real estate payments are limited . Mr. McGovern seemed content on bringing about a conclusion that ultimately could drive the city into bankruptcy or at the very least dramatically increase property taxes beyond the reach of most of our citizens . While city council and our intent is on bringing about solutions that avoid bankruptcy and creating a better climate for all to live and work in. I find it ironic that Mr. McGovern can claim indignation while fighting for this clients on Act 511 litigation , but he does not reserve the same outrage when Pennsylvania 's constitution relative to tax uniformity is being violated , ignored and trampled on by two Lackawanna County commissioners . All the while, county and city property owners are left with a broken system of inequities and values that favors the rich and well-connected and hurts the most vulnerable of property owners, our lower income families and seniors . In the future, if Mr. McGovern has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 the urge to continue to litigate from the pages of the Scranton Times editorial pages I would simply encourage him to save it for the Courts. That's all I have for now. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you, just a few. First, I just want to say that in the last two years the city has invested quite a large amount of money from the CDBG funds into McLain Park, otherwise known as Rockwell park over in North Scranton , and construction on the park started last week. So needless to say, the neighbors in that neighborhood are extremely pleased and excited about the developments . That park, for those of you who are not familiar , is in the heart of that neighborhood and I'm just glad that the city decided to invest in North Scranton and in that neighborhood and I think that, you know, that park hasn't seen really any significant funding in the last 25 years. So, again, I'm extremely pleased and I can't wait to see what the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 finished product looks like. Second thing, we received a complaint about abandoned vehicles in the 1400 block of West Locust Street and people parking this the alley around Woods Place so Mrs. Reed had sent a letter or sent an e-mail rather to the chief of police. And last thing I just want to mention , just to respond to Ms. Schumacher 's comment about the pension , just to be clear Mr. Rogan has a seat on the Pension Board. Mrs. Reed is his proxy. So Mr. Rogan does not speak for any other member of council . He doesn't confer with us on the votes that he takes, that's his seat on the pension board. So I don't have a vote, Mr. Evans doesn't have a vote, that is solely Mr. Rogan's vote and responsibility and also in his subcommittee I believe the pension review, so just to make that extremely clear. And, secondly , what I didn't mention -- I failed to mention earlier when I was commenting on the Composite Pension Board meeting and in response with what Mr. Foley 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 said, it may be true and I don't necessarily disagree with Mr. Foley that, you know, maybe it really doesn't matter what percentage funding from the sewer sale goes into the pension funds because the MMO was going to be high no matter what. Maybe the city can't afford that, and I know it can't afford it over the next few years, but the reality of the situation is they are going to divvy up the funds, $22.9 million from the sale of the Sewer Authority so I think it's important that it's done the right way and it's my belief, and especially after reading the minutes from the Composite Pension Board that the vote was rushed, and that all of the analysis was not looked at before the vote was taken. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just to follow up on that, Councilman Donahue mentioned earlier and Councilman Gaughan that's correct . It's the council president 's on the board. I did direct my proxy to vote the way she did. I do disagree that the vote was rushed. This was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 actually something I have been in discussions with members from the Pension Board for months prior so it's not something that was done at a last minute meeting . And as I mentioned before, these allocations were actually published in the newspaper weeks prior to this meeting and there weren't any objections to that allocation at that point in time, but as was mentioned , that is correct and I know some of my colleagues disagree with that decision and that's their right to their own opinion . Only one item and the rest I will hold for agenda items, I did ask last week for an update on the Novembrino pool complex and we did receive a letter from Linda Aebli and it says, "Mr. Casciano and my staff forwarded your e-mail dated April 13 regarding the status of the Novembrino pool. The final Novembrino splash park and recreation complex post-construction plans were submitted on April 5, 2018, through the Landscape Architect McLane and Associates and the Pennsylvania Department of the Conservation and Natural Resources for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 approval . This process generally takes four to six weeks to be followed by reviews from the Lackawanna County Conservation District , Northeast Independent Consultants , followed by HUD environmental review prepared by the city planner Don King. The splash park equipment and specific ations and costs for Recreation Inserts USA through the costar programs have been submitted for purchase through the Department of Parks and Recreation . Only after the approvals are in place the project will be ready to bid out. Following the legal review of the bids and the contractor selection , demolition of the pools, site preparation and construction will commence . Commencement and final completion of the project will be influenced by the fall winter weather conditions along with the practical timing of splash park equipment installation . This office will keep city council updated on this high priority project as we move forward . So I would like to thank Linda Aebli for getting back to us very quickly on this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 and I do like saying that it states that it's a high priority project . As I mentioned probably a hundred times, as a kid growing up in West Side this is where everyone -- you went to the Novembrino pool to swim and it's heartbreaking driving by there seeing it in it's current condition so I do think that, you know, this would be a great edition to that neighborhood in West Side and it's sorely needed. MR. GAUGHAN : I just have one additional thing if might, if I could add, Mr. Rogan. Just to clarify about the Composit e Pension Board meeting , and Mr. Rogan stated that it was in the newspaper about 45, 45, 10 split, but I just want to read a quick quote from one of the Pension Board's financial advisors , and again I quote, he says, "This is a template to begin looking at the project because nobody had anything to start talks about the allocation ." He wants to be very specific with everybody that they are not proposing that, he is not advocating a position on it, it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 was just a start up discussion at the city level because everyone has been asking about this to figure out how the funds are going to go in. He also says that he wants to be crystal clear that it was the start of a discussion and a model, it was not a proposal. So I think that's where the difference is that the city paid for another analysis and I don't see in here where that was actually discussed about different funding levels so that's where I was confused at looking at this whole issue that why would you only take a look at 45, 45, 10 and not look at the analysis that the city paid for, so that's where the confusion comes in. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: I would just state, I locked at a number of different -- there was a number of different proposals. It wasn't just the 45/45/10 that was considered . There were other proposals. I felt that was the most fair. It certainly wasn't rushed, it was something that weeks before the vote, you know, I felt that was the right decision to make. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MS.

ROGAN: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-C, what is your pleasure ? MR. PERRY: I move that Item 6-C pass reading by title. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I just want to thank Mr. Hinton from Licensing and Inspections for coming in and having a discussion on this agenda item in our caucus. The only thing that I would add to this, and it was discussed in our caucus, I do think that there needs to be some sort of language this the quality of the life ordinance that states that there should be a warning given by the inspector before they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 issue an actual fine. A lot of times, you know, maybe people aren't aware, they are new to the city, so I think we need to give them a chance. Mr. Hinton did explain that a lot of times they do give a warning but it's at the discretion of the inspector and I do think that we need to take that discretion away because we should give everybody a fair chance no matter what it is, and as somebody mentioned in the caucus it's not about collecting a fine it's about enforcing -- it's about cleaning up the city, so the goal here is not to collect $100 off of somebody , it's to make sure that their property is clean and the neighborhood looks nice. So hopefully within the next week we can work on that amendment . I do think -- Mr. Hinton also explained that if you are giving out a citation it's required that they give a chance for somebody to clean it up before they issue a fine but with a quality of the life ticket they don't necessarily have to do that. Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question , I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 agree with that. We all have a preconversation about that particular issue, now we have to sort of come up with the language that we all agree with. One of the things we would look at is there's a warning but it would probably for first time offenders only. Repeat offenders don't really need that courtesy , so we will work it out between now and next week. MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . I agree with Councilman Evans and Gaughan fully. I do thank Mr. Hinton for coming in and explaining this to us. But, yes, the discretion of the warnings that's where I have an issue with. Discretion is a slippery slope. Discretion is kind of what mood are you in today? I believe that this should not be punitive , this should be something to make the neighborhoods better and to get everybody on the same page when it comes to our rules and regulations . Everybody gets a fair shake. Some of the legislation I would like it to read that fines can be -- fines will be given after a warning is given. I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 like that warning to be held on file and I would like that warning to be signed, whether it's 24 hours or 48 hours they have the inspector come back and actually issue that fine. You know, we can discuss that, but, you know, I want somewhere where if they have to go back and they want to litigate this or mitigate this, you know, we have a signed warning saying, you know, you were presented with the issue, you were given a warning and given time, it hasn't been taken care of, and then or only then would I feel comfortable with some kind of punitive damage because , again, that's not what these regulations are about, it's just about getting everybody on the same page. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation for the Chair for the Committee on Public Works? MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I am going to be voting for this. I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 it's been in the newspaper and talked about quite extensively in the public and at these council meetings because this is related to Sheetz. I just want to make it clear, as I did in the caucus a week ago, that we are not voting on the Sheetz project , we are voting on upgrading the traffic signal so voting against this really wouldn't make much sense in my opinion because the alternative would not be to upgrade the traffic signal and it has to be done anyways. On the Sheetz project , however , I am in favor of it. You know, there was an initial concern that we wanted more information about the traffic set up because that is a heavily traveled area in the morning , especially during the school, but I think that new business and competition is a good thing for the city. I mean, we should be doing everything in our power to do whatever it takes to get new businesses in the City of Scranton , especially with the economic climate that we find ourselves this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 The argument that other gas stations or other, you know, companies might be effected by this in my opinion is a little ridiculous and disingenuous because let's just use the example of the Trader Joe's, everybody talks about Trader Joe's. If they want to move into the City of Scranton Gerrity 's I'm sure wouldn't like because they are a supermarket, too. Would we be against that because Gerrity 's was against it or because it would effect other businesses or invite more competition ? I just don't see that argument . The other argument that's been made about alcohol sales somebody said a week or two ago, and this is true, there is a bar right across the street from Memorial Stadium so I think you can shoot down that argument as well. So, again, I just wanted to comment on the Sheetz project overall . I think it's going to be a good thing for the city. We should be promoting business and competition wherever and whenever we can, but for these two pieces that we are going to vote on we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 are voting on upgrading the traffic signal, we are not voting on the Sheetz project . Thank you. MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . Yes, Mr. Gaughan is right the black and white of this legislation is the traffic signal and how we are going to make sure that there is safety and the flow of traffic is fit for that business on that corner. It's zoned properly and it has to go through the whole city planner and engineer division , but the only thing the city council is going to be voting on tonight is the traffic signal and the pattern of the flow of the traffic . That is it. So based on that and based on the discussions we have had with the city planner , the city engineer , I feel confident that the black and white of this legislation will be satisfied by the measures that are going to take for this project . So based on that I'm going to be voting "yes". MR. ROGAN: My colleagues are correct that we are only voting on traffic . We are not voting on whether you want Sheetz 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 to come to Scranton or you don't. I struggled with this quite a bit because I do want to see new businesses coming to the City of Scranton at all costs. I do not think this is the right location . I think there should be a Sheetz in Scranton but not in this location because of the traffic issues, specifically , at North Main Avenue where, as our city engineer mentioned , it is an older streetlight and I may be biased because I travel this route literally twice every day and I see the traffic that's there currently , I do think there will be traffic issues with this project in this location . That's not to say I'm against the Sheetz coming to Scranton . I certainly would support this project just in a different location . MR. EVANS: On the question , as has been stated our role and focus on this legislation is truly on voting on the traffic signalization and safety for vehicular and pedestrian traffic so the public caucus last week with Reilly Associates , the city engineer and the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 planner , I firmly believe that the design will be comprehensive and appropriate . This is really not a debate on, you know, small business versus large business , but I will say for the record, nobody is more probusiness and more small business than this councilman , but I will continue to advocate for that small business and work towards moving any and all impediments that will make Scranton once again the friendly city for all, including the business community , so I am supportive of this application and support ive of what we are doing tonight . What did we briefly with the caucus was simply a routine matter of bringing the engineer in and discuss what was happening with the traffic . I know it turned into something a little more than that, but we all didn't expect that to happen but I guess it was a good debate so we are going to vote tonight . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Roll call, please? MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Perry. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR.

REED: 7-F - PREVIOUSLY TABLED - FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 32-2018 - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH PETERS DESIGN GROUP, INC. FOR PROFESSIONAL ARCHITECTURAL AND ENGINEERING SERVICES FOR THE SERRENTI MEMORIAL ARMY RESERVE CENTER RENOVATION PROJECT . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-F. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I'm sure that Peters Design Group will do fantastic job. I'm certainly not questioning the company or the work that they do. My one major concern and the reason that I'll be voting against this is that in fee schedule Peters Design Group has stated at that this be a negotiated price for construction monitoring so that would be a separate price and a separate percentage of the overall contract and the final cost of the project . It's just my concern that the sky could be limit this. If it was going to be a negotiated price for construction monitoring , it should have been set in the contract . It should not be open for interpretation because we could be opening ourselves up to higher costs. Also, just as an aside, bidders were not allowed to see a proposed budget or at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 least an estimate of the budget. They were also not allowed to tour the entire facility , including the inside of the facility . This is highly unusual in my opinion and I'm not sure why that wasn't part of the RFQ so I'll be voting "no". Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question , I will also be voting against this. I have the same reservations Mr. Gaughan has and I just believe it's way to open ended and although this money will be coming from grant funding I believe it's our responsibility to spend that responsibly . Thank you. MR. EVANS: On the question , I first want to thank Councilman Gaughan about asking some important questions about this contract , but I am comfortable with the answers provide d Attorney Eskra, the city solicitor , and be voting "yes" on this legislation . I feel that because of the cost of the contract is limited and because of the grant requirements and the chance for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 cost order or change orders in my mind are limited and I would expect that the police department and the business administrator , whoever that may be in the future, would also protect or taxpayers making sure costs are contained . MR. ROGAN: And I believe the cost is limited to a total percentage of the total cost of the project , so that would put a cap on it. Anyone else? MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . I also had some questions on this project I believe it was tabled and for a good reason. My question was answered , it was is this project still on the books for grant funding and the answer was yes. The agreement was when we wanted to allocate this building and use it to hold our expensive police equipment was that they are not going to overspend their budget. They are going to get grants, use grant money to improve the project and I just wanted to make sure we weren't going out of bounds and spending money from the general fund and, you know, taking a loss and I was assured that it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 still a grant supplemented project and I also want to say on the record that I'm still on board with getting rid of our Ash Street locations and using that to further supplement the project as it goes forward .
