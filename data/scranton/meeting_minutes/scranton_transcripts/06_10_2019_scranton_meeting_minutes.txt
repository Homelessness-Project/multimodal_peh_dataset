Do any Council members have announcements at this time? I have a couple. Council again this year will hold daytime meeting s for the month of July. Council will meet weekly at 12:30 p.m., and hold caucus at 12 noon in the Clerk's Office or in Council Chambers , if necessary . New for this year we will move the weekly meeting s to Wednesday s due to work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 schedule s that conflict with the meeting on Monday during the day. Beginning Wednesday , July 3rd at 12:30 p.m., we will hold our first afternoon meeting for the month of July and continue with that schedule for the four remaining Wednesdays that follow. So again, that's for the month of July the meeting s will be during the day and they will also be on Wednesday , not on Monday. Secondly , two executive sessions were held prior to the meeting today. One was regarding a matter of potential litigation , and one was regarding a personnel issue. Prior to Citizens Participation , I would just like to remind everyone , please have some decorum . We're not going to tolerate what's happened in the past at these meetings. Council has discussed this as a group. If there is somebody who is out of line and they continue to go on, Council will take a short recess and then come right back in. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 public comment as follows : Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business and matters on general concern . Fay Franus spoke on matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on matters of general concern . (Council took brief recess.) MR. ROGAN: Call this meeting back to order. And just so for the rest of the speakers for the rest of the night, we do have a five-minute time limit. In the past we have been a little more lenient . But it is going to be strictly enforced the rest of the night. The following speakers offered public comment as follows : John Foley spoke on matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Les Spindler spoke on matters of general concern . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Glynis Johns spoke on matters of general concern . Jerry Healy spoke on matters of general concern . Alex Lotorto spoke on matters of general concern . Chris Gaydos spoke on matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business and matters of general concern . MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. Motions . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Thank you. I just want to start off by saying that June is Pride Month. And it's a month that honors those who resisted LGBTQ oppression and encourages all people to live their authentic selves. I wasn't here last week because I was out of town for my wedding . But I was utterly disgusted by what I saw take place in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 these chambers . Although there may still be ignorant bigots in our city, it's important to stress that as a whole, the City of Scranton is a place that has continued to make huge strides in becoming more inclusive for all. But we still have more work to do on that front. I am extremely proud that the Pride flag is currently flying outside of this building because it symbolizes that the city is open to all people regardless of their sexual orientation . And just a quick followup on two requests that I made over a month ago, I still have not received invoices for the refurbishment of the showmobile . And I also haven't received a copy of the denial letter from the city's insurance carrier regarding the federal lawsuit settlement involving the Director of Licensing and Inspection . So, Miss Reed, would you be able to send a followup regarding those two requests , please? And while I'm on the subject of License and Inspections , it seems we can't go more than a few weeks at a time without controversy surrounding that department and its 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 leadership as we've seen with the latest one regarding Mr. Sweeney . First, I'd like to know what sort of process would allow for a city employee to become aware of their termination through a reporter instead of from their superior ? Second, what century is this department operating in where only cash payment s are accepted ? You can't use a debit or credit card. And you're given a handwritten receipt out of a receipt book you could buy at Staples . This is exactly why contractors don't want to do business in the city. And although there's RFQ for an evaluation of the entire License and Inspection Department that should be going on in the next few weeks, we must begin to address this payment issue immediately . I'd also like to make a motion to request a briefing in an executive session , if necessary , from the City Solicitor and HR Director at our caucus next week to give us an explanation of the circumstances surrounding Mr. Sweeney 's termination , including how much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 money is missing and what evidence the Administration has to support their claims against Mr. Sweeney . The nonsense surrounding this department must stop. MR. ROGAN: Motion's been made. Is there a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I agree with what Councilman Donahue said. I have a ton of questions . I mean, the way this whole thing worked, Council received a letter from the Mayor telling us that he was appointing Don King as the acting zoning officer and then also in the letter it said that Mr. Sweeney had been terminated . There was no explanation as to why he was terminated . And then the next day just as all of you had read, we had read the news article in which Mr. Sweeney was surprised that he was terminated , which as Councilman Donahue had mentioned , I was surprised by. I don't know what organization or what governmental entity would terminate -- if that is true, would terminate an employee and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 not let them know. So that's number one. Number two, as Mr. Donahue had pointed out, I think it's very important to know if an investigation into this matter is still occurring , is the investigation complete , and if, in fact, Mr. Sweeney did misappropriate funds and he's the one that brought that up in the article , why wasn't there a warrant for his arrest? Why wasn't the police involved in that matter? So it seems to me that there needs to be -- there are a lot of question s that need to be answered . And it is concerning that according to Mr. Sweeney 's account , the amount was around 17,000 and then it went down. It just -- if you read the article , you were as confused as everyone on Council was. So I agree with Councilman Donahue 's motion. I think we need to figure out exactly what's going on here. And, you know, according to Mr. Sweeney there are -- according to his testimony in the newspaper , there is an awful lot of question s that need to be answered. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 question ? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so ordered . MR. DONAHUE : That's all I have at this time. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comment s? MR. EVANS: A couple comment s. First of all, Mrs. Reed, if you can send the list from Miss Franus to LIPS and see if they can review those properties on the list and see if they might be included into the Rental Escrow Program that we're going to be talking about later tonight through legislation in 5-A. That would be great. Also for some reason, there is some perception that City Council did not address certain remarks made last week. In fact, last week when it was our opportunity to speak I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 said the following on the issue of a speaker discussing a current City Council candidate , my brief comments are as follows : I happen to think that change is good. And different viewpoint s should be encouraged and fostered and listened to, especially in the government sector. Now, as I've repeatedly said over the years when situations like this arise, we are better than that. And in this situation I really hope we are. So that's all I have on that topic. I would like to bring back and circle around again to walkability . We have received four excellent responses to our RFQ on the conduct ivity study which as a major component of a walkability study that I have been pressing for for quite some time. I would expect that after a reasonable due diligence period we'll have a selection of a consultant relatively soon. But we that said, I'd like to offer a few more comments on walkability . Chis Leinberger , a professor at George Washington University has coined a new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 term for for walkable urban places. He calls them walkups. He defines walkups as a regionally significant walkable urban place in which job concentrations and civic concentrations and the wealth of the region is created . We should want that for our downtown to be a walkup as defined by Leinberger . And then we should want to foster additional walkups throughout the city. So I'm hopeful that we will look back at this conductivity as a watershed moment where we can put into place the ideas and concept s that will return us to that urban place that he describe s that urban place we once were where we were the wealth of an entire region. It all started here in Scranton . RMA is a Pompano Beach, Florida Planning and Consulting firm whose core business is urban revitalization . Through them, researchers have found that more attention is being paid to traffic counts both auto and foot traffic . And they want to measure walkability . What they found is when a use comes into an urban place that creates a walkable 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 environment often used -- other uses tend to follow. Then there are starts to be spinoffs and more spinoffs and changes among other things, the value of real estate goes up. The connection of those things, which is the walkability , that is what connect s the two of them is what drives economics . And as soon as an area gets defined in the walkable world and it's known that places are going to be connected through walkability , it changes the value of each property between them. Other researches have shown that the average rents in real estate, commercial and residential and walkup, those in -- the walkable places I've been talking about are over 100 percent higher per square foot than they are in the suburban real estate market. So it's safe to assume that other studies will conclude that sales prices will follow that same pattern . Another aspect to the urban place infrastructure , in urban area the infrastructure is mostly in place. But to build new development in the suburban model, it cost 10 to 20 times more per square foot to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 build that same infrastructure . So concentrated developments like downtown and neighborhood commercial areas are more efficient in terms of infrastructure and travel cost, housing and almost every other measure that you could think of. So we have a lot at stake with this conductivity study. First, we need to choose the right consult ant. We need to receive the right product in return with clearly defined and usable outcomes . And then we find the resources and the courage and the vision to implement those recommended changes . And then we can create a more walkable Scranton . If we do that, then I think personally we are on the very cusp of something great for our city. We all well-positioned for amazing things to happen, not just in the downtown but throughout all of our neighborhood s. So I hope you all stay tuned because I think it's going to happen soon. We hope to have that study out and somebody working on it sometime this summer. On that note, remember every day is your chance to make this city a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 little better. That's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comment s? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just wanted to announce that according to the city street sweeping schedule between June 10th and June 14th, the city street sweepers will be in the Hill Section , Wheeler Avenue to Matthew Avenue including the Oakmont section . The street sweeper came in my neighborhood not too long ago. And there was a noticeable difference . I actually noticed the machine going down my street when I was on my way to work in the morning . And they are doing a great job. However , I will reiterate once again that I do think in the future if there was an actual street sweeping program where alternate side of the street parking was enforced , I think that would make the program much more effective . So hopefully we will see that at some point in the future. 913-915 Eynon Street, I toured this property not too long ago. I asked several questions . Mr. Hinton had respond ed that this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 property was in -- tied up in the courts and that the city was going to go back to court. We had sent correspondence May 31st. I sent an additional followup e-mail to the City Solicitor on how that whole process works, where it is in the courts and what order the city needs to go back and try to take care of this property . I have not receive d a response yet. Councilman Evans, myself, and Councilman Donahue are going to meet again with the neighbors tomorrow . I know Councilman Rogan and Councilman Perry are going to meet with them also. So we're not going to, you know, let this issue die. Anyone who goes out and visits this property will see that it has to be one of the worst that I've seen since I've been on Council . And since I mentioned that last week there have been other people who have reached out with other problem properties . And I'm certainly not saying that or trying to favor one over the other. We have a major problem in the city obviously no surprise to anyone with blight. And as I mentioned in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 the caucus tonight , I personally do not believe that we at this time have any strategy , zero strategy to deal with condemned homes, homes that are severely blighted . As I mentioned two weeks ago the county actually held a blight task force. And no one from the city besides Councilman Evans had showed up. So I really think at some point this Administration has got to get on the ball with a coherent strategy to deal with blight in the city. Otherwise , you know, people are going to continue to come to this Council . And we're going to be in this process where we ask question s and we never get any answers . And it's extremely frustrating . We sent a request to the DPW about 431 Duncan Street on the side of this gentleman 's home on Kirst Court in Minooka that actually has turned into a swamp from the water runoff. I do realize that the DPW is backed up dealing with many stormwater issues. But, Mrs. Read, if you could send this once again and just let them know that it's gotten to the point where it's really difficult for this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 family to enjoy their home. It's seeping now onto their property . Also 813 Hampton Street, received a correspondence from a neighbor in the area that this home is possibly on the demolition list. They're not sure. The roof is caved in. The sides have mushroomed out to touch the house next door. And they believe the house in only being held up at this point by joists. So, Mrs. Reed, if we could please send something to Licensing and Inspection on that. Also just on the comments last week and this week, usually I wouldn't, you know, give this the time of day because I just don't think that we should entertain anyone who speaks in the manner that that gentleman spoke in. But I don't think this should be any place in these chambers or really anywhere for that matter for hateful bigoted comments . Who is anyone to judge anybody else? We are here sitting up here on this Council to do the business -- to conduct the business of the city, not to listen to somebody 's bizarre 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 political views or their bizarre rants on politics or national politics or things that have nothing to do with the City of Scranton . My children last week were brought into the conversation , which again I thought was gross and reprehensible along with the comments about Dr. Rothchild . And I just want to say that, you know, my wife and I are trying to raise our children to be kindhearted , decent people who do not judge other people. And I would hope that the gentleman that spoke -- I wish somebody would have taught him that. I really do. And I think this is a great -- what happened tonight and last week is a great lesson for everyone that one person could come up and spew that, the hatred and the violence and the anger that he does on a regular basis, that does not represent the vast majority of the people who live in the city. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. A couple quick comments . I know this was mentioned quite a bit at our meeting and a speaker brought it up as well regarding the rental registration property escrow. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 We do have legislation on our agenda tonight regarding setting up these escrow accounts for landlords that do not file the proper paperwork to register their properties where those rents can be taken by the city in that case. And rental registration isn't a real hot issue. But I know the garbage fees are. It's been brought up quite a bit that most of the properties that are delinquent on their garbage bills are also not register ed with the city. And in particular , many of them are out-of-town landlords . There's a lot of great landlords here in Scranton . And there's some good out-of-town landlords as well. But it seems that most of the abuses that we're seeing from folks not paying their bills are from out of town. And they are people who own multiple properties . I know we were just given a list tonight of probably 20 properties all owned by the same person. This person was a local person that hasn't paid any of their garbage bills. So that's something I think will start 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 to turn the tide in our favor to get people to register their properties and pay all of their fees. I know we talked about the garbage fee a little bit last week on some other actions that could be taken there. So I'm optimistic on that front that we can start getting these collection rates up because at the end of the day, if we get our collection rate up it's increasing our revenue . But the people that have been paying all along are still going to pay. It's getting everyone on a level playing field. And there's a lot more to come on that issue as well. A couple requests I know Councilman Donahue brought this up and I know others on East Mountain . I've been inundated with calls from people particularly on East Mountain , some on West Mountain as well with road issues. I know we had a ton of rain lately. This most recent one -- and I will send this to DPW. I don't want to read the address off. It's similar to a sinkhole. I know there's one in West Scranton as well. It's not just a pothole . And it's causing people to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 swerve all the way around and almost into a ditch. So these issues, especially with the weather we've been having really seem to keep creeping up particularly on East Mountain more so than other parts of the city. I know there was another resident that we sent in multiple requests for. And it was finally fixed. So we appreciate the DPW for that. And we know they are backed up. So I'll pass that one along as well. I'm glad the decorum was slightly better this week than in previous weeks. Obviously we have a set rules. In the past they've been much more lenient particularly regarding allowing citizens to speak six, seven, eight minutes. I would personally like to let people finish their thoughts , you know, as one of the speakers brought up. But if we go down the path that we went down the last couple weeks it's going to be a strict five minute rule. And again, the same thing with what's being allowed to -- we did have a discussion as a group with our solicitor on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 what is going to be allowed , not going to be allowed . I think we all agree that the statement s that were made last week and some this week are not representative of Scranton and certainly not representative of what this body stands for. Hopefully this is all we'll have to say on this matter and that is all. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE - CREATING AND ESTABLISHING SPECIAL CITY ESCROW ACCOUNT NO. 02.229640 ENTITLED “RENTAL REGISTRATION TENANT ESCROW” TO ACCEPT AND DISBURSE FUNDS RECEIVED FROM RENTAL PAYMENTS FROM TENANTS WHOSE LANDLORDS HAVE FAILED TO COMPLY WITH REGISTERING THEIR RENTAL PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON PURSUANT TO FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO.58, 2016 (AS AMENDED ). MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee. MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . In the caucus I had asked for us to get in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 touch with the city Law Department or the Licensing and Inspection Department just to find out now that we're establishing this escrow account , the legislation is in place to enforce this. Now I think we need to hear from the Law Department and the Licensing and Inspections Department on what this process will look like, how exactly it will be enforced , and when they will start enforcing it. So if they can provide a timeline to the Council on what that looks like I would appreciate it. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: Yeah, on the question I'm very happy to see this legislation on our agenda this evening . This is part of our Rental Registration Ordinance that's currently in effect drafted mostly by this City Council . The escrow account is a very significant tool in fighting back against absentee landlords that have not paid their garbage fee that have not paid their taxes or have not even registered their properties .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 So clearly if you learned anything it is that if you get the attention -- to get the attention of many landlords that operate in our city, you have to find a way into their pocketbooks. And that's what this does. By transfer ring tenant rent payment s to the city, depositing them into the escrow account until such a time that certain landlords accept the responsibility by paying their fees and taxes, that's when we will finally start making some progress on this issue as far as the refuse fee, taxes, and the rental registration process . So we are finally moving into a very positive direction with this and I certainly will be voting in the affirmative . MR. ROGAN: And just to follow up, as I mentioned before and as Councilman Evans just mentioned , it's not just the rental registration . But I would -- as much attention has been put on the fact that garbage fees haven't been paid, it wouldn't be going out on a limb to say that our collection rate on rental registrations is even significant ly lower than our garbage fee collection in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 city. So this is something that we really need to, you know, to get moving. And I really think once word gets around that the city is doing this, people that aren't in compliance will begin to come in compliance . Anyone else? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.
