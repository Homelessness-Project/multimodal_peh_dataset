MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON FIREFIGHTERS PENSION COMMISSION HEARING HELD ON FEBRUARY 16, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So first of all, I want to apologize for not being here last week. We had some family sickness . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 I just played it safe on behalf of everybody else. But I had a couple announcements last week that I will share with you this week. Two weeks ago we had three firefighter s that were injured . So I want to wish them well. I hope they're doing fine after they got injured at the Emmett's structure fire -- Emmett Street structure fire. And then we also had a trailblazer that was in the paper, Scranton woman first to hold high rank in the Fire Department . I would like to congratulate her, wish her best of luck. Her name is Scranton Fire Department Lieutenant Caroline Janczak. She, like I said earlier , she's the first women to earn this rank. So that's fantastic . We have another firefighter who retired -- who retired the other day, finished his last assignment at Truck 4. His name is Captain Bob Lucas. And he served the City for 30 years and I wish him well. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MS. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have one. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 made an announcement about it last week. But I did get a startup time. So the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association will be hosting a cleanup at the islands on Capouse Avenue and Electric Street. All volunteers are welcome . It starts at 9 am and it finishes either at noon or when they complete their work. So it will be this Saturday at 9 a.m. Thank you. MR. KING: I wanted to mention the diaper collection this weekend , May 6th and 7th. I'm going to ask Mrs. Jeffries if she would bring that up when she speaks because I left the sheet at home. I meant to bring it -- oh, here it is. Okay, so the Mother's Day Baby Pantry Collection , that's Saturday , May 7th and 8th from 10 to 3 p.m. at Nay Aug Park -- diapers sizes newborn , four, five, and six; Pull-Ups 4T, 5T, all sizes accepted; baby wipes, baby food, cereal and formula . And they're also receiving blankets , diaper bags, pacifiers , baby bottles , infant and toddler car seats. And no clothing , please. Okay. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just wanted to wish all the moms out there and caregiver s a Happy Mother's Day on Sunday. MR. KING: I better say that as well. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there. MS. SCHUSTER : Happy Mother's Day. MR. MCANDREW : And those that serve as the role as mother, thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I'd also like to wish everybody a Happy Mother's Day, congratulate Mr. Lucas on his retirement from the Fire Department . And also, today is Teacher Appreciation Day. So I'd like to thank all the teachers out there who play an important role in our children 's lives every day. And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Can you update us on the status of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the negotiations on the three union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : They are still ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : Did you get any feedback on the billable hours, anything , you know, how many times they met? When they've met? MR. DONAHUE : So we got it -- our Solicitor is going to touch base with Mr. Cotillo who is Acting City Solicitor to just make sure there is nothing that needs to be redacted before we're able to -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I just hope that this whole process would be wrapped up before Labor Day. But I doubt that it will. Item 5-C, the nomination of the Finance Director Attorney Matthew Domines -- I hope I pronounced that correctly . My understanding is, he's the only one who applied for the position . And I was looking at the backup, the list of qualifications that the City was looking for and his resume. And I'm not comfortable that he has the requisite skill set to fill that position . He's a lawyer. Nothing against 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 lawyers , Sean, do you hear that? Nothing against lawyers . You're welcome . But, you know, I have many physicians in my life and I wouldn't expect any of them to become the finance director as qualified as they are as doctors or lawyers or whatever . The backup says the preferred training , experience , knowledge , skill and abilities is a master's degree in accounting , finance , business , or public administration and one year of experience in public accounting . He doesn't have that. In fact, his resume ends in October of 2021. So I have to assume that for the last six months he's been unemployed . I know he's worked with PEL. But I don't -- there are many people who've worked with PEL that I don't think that alone qualifies them to be the finance director for the City. I hope we're not doing this because he's the only one that applied . But I think you need to take a long hard look at his qualifications . It's not the place for on-the-job training , especially for a position that's going to be there for one year. I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 know what he will contribute . 5-E, the ARPA plan, I found that to be a little confusing and a little bit disappointing . Looking at the backup, the purpose apparently is to quote, use the award funds that fit into one of the following four categories . Now, the first three categories have to do with the impact of COVID-19 on the City's finances and operations . And the fourth one which I found very interesting was to make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure . Now, when you look at the breakdown of the financing , the propose d budget allocation vice the actual cost, in the first four categories it seems to be approximately half the proposed budget, which makes sense since we're getting allocations in two lump sums. But for the fourth one on infrastructure , the proposed allocation is $21,730,897. But the actual cost is only one $1,142,500 or 5.3 percent of the allocation . That is like a red flag to me. One of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 reasons , of course, is one of the issues we've been kicking down the road for a long, long time since 2016 is stormwater . And so I would like some feedback down the road as to what you're all going to do about infrastructure , especially stormwater . And if during Fifth Order or Eighth Order you could give us the status of the zoning ordinance which has been kind of laying there in Eighth Order for many, many weeks. Hopefully that thing is going to be wrapped up before you go on recess in August. It's been a long, long time and hopefully there will be another session for public comment when you advertise the changing . MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . MS. HODOWANITZ : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Christine Xanthis . MS. XANTHIS : Good evening everyone . My name is Christine Xanthis . I'm here again in reference to the Pocket Park in downtown Scranton . I know the City Scranton , you know, many people probably think myself and my mother and everyone else in my house had gone away 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 from talking about the cement plant that was there. Just because the cement plant is gone because they moved to Archbald , doesn't mean that we are. I had a dog that died. My grandmother passed away. I, myself, including my mother and another family member have white lung because of the cement plant. Many previous administration that, you know, the Mayor at that time didn't see a problem with the building being put up there in a residential area. That is for an industrial park. I mean, you're talking about a cement plant. That goes in an industrial park, not in a neighborhood next to a bunch of houses. When I lost how much time of high school in 2007, 2008 because I couldn't sleep at night because all I heard were forklifts moving back and forth. People, you know, I understand some people don't speak English . I understand that. But, you know, when they weren't speaking English , they had no -- they acted like they didn't understand what I was saying when I told them it was about 11:00, 12:00 at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 night. I mean, I can't -- I still can't comprehend . I'm going to keep coming here. I know it's apparent ly set in stone that they are going to name it after previous administration , previous Mayor at that time. I can't see the logic to that. I mean, I don't know when this Pocket Park is going to be done or if they're going to have, like, you know, like at many places they have, you know, where they cut a ribbon for it, I guess you would say. I don't know if either one of you could tell me when this is going to finalize what -- if this year or the next year? MR. DONAHUE : So the plan right now is, they're testing the soil that's going to go in and fill it. And then once that's done, the bids are going to go out for work to be completed , hopefully by the end of this year. MS. XANTHIS : They want to test the soil. They should have came to where I live. It's still bad as it is there. I mean, this is a pocket park. I understand , you know, you don't want kids going there and getting hurt. That I understand . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, but because of the remediation that needed to be done on that property , they have to make sure there is clean fill going into the hole. MS. XANTHIS : I mean, right now where I live where the cement plant was, it was in Green Ridge. You know, at that time I think they should have tested the soil afterward s before they put in a senior high rise right to the left of where the building is. I mean, I don't know if they did. But, you know, there's another senior high rise going up there now. I think it would be in their best interest if they test the soil. I mean, I'll keep coming here every Tuesday . But I know it's, you know, it's not going to go anywhere . But if you guys read back in the papers many years ago, you will find articles about that building along with, you know, complaints from myself and my mother and a few other people there. I talked to a neighbor I think it was two days ago, a day ago that lives down the street from me. I don't -- they must not have heard; but they didn't know it was going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 renamed after that Mayor. They're not too happy about it just like I am. I mean, you know, I understand that they rename things after people. I understand that, you know, memorial people, you know, people that have helped in different ways or something they have done. But this is no laughing matter. Just because the cement plant is gone, doesn't mean the problem still exists. They still do. Thank you. Have a good evening . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening Council , Norma Jeffries . Thank you, Mr. King, for mentioning the drive that we're having this weekend at Nay Aug Park. I hope to see a lot of the residents of Scranton there. I will be there Saturday and Sunday afternoon . So we're looking for a great turnout and, you know, just to collect a lot of items for St. Joe's. One of the other things that I wanted to mention about the park is that we're always looking for volunteers . And if you go to the website -- the Nay Aug Park website 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 you'll -- if you scroll down, you'll see a slot there where you can volunteer . So, you know, take advantage of that. If anyone wants to know more about the website , I'm always willing to talk about it. But if you have any other questions on a Tuesday night I'll be glad to answer those questions . The second thing I wanted to talk about was our street cleaning . And, you know, the cinders that they put down in the wintertime, it's done its job. But it's very treacherous to a senior citizen when you step out of your car and you lose your foot because you slide on those cinders . So I thought , when is our street going to be cleaned ? So I went to the website to see exactly what the website said about cleaning. So I think I have enough time to read what it says. It says, "New 2022 Street Sweeping schedule . 2022 seasonal city street sweeping operations will be on a biweekly rotating basis during the recycling pickup schedule . Residents can expect street sweeping operations in their neighborhood s on a rotating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 basis on the days that recycling products are collected weather permitting . If for some reason sections are not cleaned , it will be revisited the following week by the operations team. We encourage the public to remove vehicles when possible on a rotating basis so the sweeping operations can be as effective as possible within each neighborhood . This activity will continuously rotate throughout the warmer months in an effort to keep city streets as clean as possible . We appreciate the public's cooperation and patience while we conduct the citywide effort." I don't understand what they're saying. I have no idea. What's a rotating basis? You know, recycling is every week. So are you going to have rotating -- anyway, I thought it was very confusing. So maybe whoever is in charge of DPW can get some clarification as to when we can expect our streets to be swept. And we'd more than happy to move our cars so they could do an effective job. But reading this, I can't tell when they are going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 to come to my street. That's all I have tonight . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Miss Jeffries . Next on the list is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council , you know, I've tried to be -- not to be too controversial . But I'd like to mention my two cents' worth about the abortion issue. I've stood here before and had my antiabortion segments -- sentiments . But abortion shouldn 't be used as a method of birth control . And these murder clinics , they exist on tax money. That shouldn 't be. As some of you know, Miss Rosie is an associate pastor. She got credentials . She's not just one of these people that goes nuts on you. Some time ago she told me about a local woman that's had eight abortions . If that's not murder, I don't know what is. And multiple abortions aren't unusual in these clinics . That's why we should all hope and pray that this is -- that rumor or whatever you want to call it is the truth that this is terminated . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 And secondly , this newspaper seems to love to print these letters of Senator Myers to keep us separate , Yost, Mosley, all of these people -- their hate-filled rhetoric week after week is the same thing. Now, there is a fellow named Dominick Sudan{phonetic } who is really just completely antiIsrael. It says in his opinion he's a racist and antiSemitic. His letters are pure hate. Now, he's found a guy in Honesdale to support him named Steve. I hope he stays up there for crying out loud. There's just no room in our world for people like this. That's just my opinion . Last week I took -- Rosie and me took our little puppy up to the Abington s and walked around for an hour in the park. And it is so nice. The very next day I went to Nay Aug. And it is in such dire need of repairs. That wooden bridge under the tree house got big -- places where they're trying to keep it going. I saw a metal banister laying there. There is no benches to sit on for people in that park. I saw the benches where the car 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 show is. Nay Aug is a -- to me, it's a jewel in our midst. I often go there and walk my little dog. While I think of it, I go almost every day up to Western Park. And I don't know if it's the City or the volunteers , but somebody 's been working awful hard to clean Weston Park and do work on it. And I appreciate it. And right down on the river where I walk the dog sometimes , I feed a fox and I leave the paper bags there. And I pick them up once in a while. Somebody picked up all my paper bags. And I don't know who it is that did it, but I thank them because it's -- I meant to do it. I just didn't because it was wintertime. I appreciate you letting me up here. I've decided not to come to these meeting s all the time. I just get all upset sometimes the things I read and hear and see in this City. And I love this City. I'm here by choice. And I was very fortunate that I had such a good employer , took care of me all of these years. And I hate hearing such ill things about him too. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. You know, just sitting here today listening to what Ron Ellman had to say, I don't know what the Supreme Court is going to do on the abortion issue. But I do know that when that case was determined , I don't know how the Court that heard that case decided the way they did because there is no basis for abortion in the Constitution at all. And everybody is entitled to their opinion , but the Constitution says life and liberty , not just some people but to everybody . And there's other reasons . But I don't want to spend a lot of time on that issue. You know, I watched the young lady walk up here today and talk about the cement plant. I believe that was done during Chris Doherty 's time and everybody knew it was wrong. And I just think it's time for people at home to realize one thing, the City of Scranton does not need leaders. And the City of Scranton what it really needs the most -- because we had leaders who decided to put Joe Biden sign up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 without any concern for the residents of the City and that cement plant. And don't forget that Mayor Doherty is the person who drove the City into distress ed status during the end of Connor's administration . And we also had leaders on the Scranton School Board who mismanaged it for 40 years that I -- or 30 -- between 30 or 40 years that I remember because the first School Board meeting I went to I was opposed to construction of the new school. And an old elderly woman came to a meeting with a babushka on, a house coat and a pair of sneakers and said she couldn't pay any more money. She was almost crying. But the government doesn't listen. It doesn't -- we don't need leaders . We need people who understand what the residents need and work for them. And we've had enough leaders . Take a look at the Scranton Sewer Authority . The Pennsylvania American Water is asking for a rate increase . But yet, during the last rain we had people with stormwater in their basements and sewage because the leaders of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 this City voted to sell the Scranton Sewer Authority . But the President of Council was opposed to it, yet he still introduced it. We have to question how the leaders of the City sold off the Scranton Parking Authority to a -- I call it sold off -- to a nonprofit who hired a for profit cooperation to run it. And they're making money and how we gave the owner of the mall a parking garage and million dollars to fix it with. And then we spent 30 years in distress . How much money did PEL make helping the City through that fiasco? These are the kind of leaders we've had, not just here. But look at some of the things that have happened in the state. The most expensive toll road in the world is the Pennsylvania Turnpike . Thank you, Mr. Rendell . And, you know, when talk -- when we see a person come in here that at one time was a high school girl who walks in here and now is a mature woman who has health issues and we have the leaders of the City who really have no concern for its residents because everybody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 knew that cement plant didn't belong there but nobody cared. Now we're debating how we're going to spend 68 million dollars of borrowed money and saddling all of that debt on the children in future generations . And nothing personal , I don't you're qualified to determine how to spend 68 million dollars and neither do I believe the Mayor is either. I think we need to have a talk to the resident s. We a lot of bridges that need to be done. We have a lot of infrastructure that needs to be done. We've got to stop paying these silly games. Okay, you go back to my time as a child, there were 103, maybe 110,000 people living here. This City is a ghost town. The majority of homes are run down. And it's not the owner's fault. They are being taxed right out of their property . And we're talking about reassessment . We need to cut the size of government , not because we're mean spirited, because there's nothing left. We need to start creating industry in our county and bringing people back to work 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 in America and stop worrying whether congressmen and senators in Washington are invested in China, okay, as people watch their 401Ks fall right through the floor and quit taxing Social Security at 85 percent because we're out of money. Think about it. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. That exhaust s the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , I happened to stop here on Thursday to the building -- to this building and was surprise d by a few things. One, there was a police vehicle parked out front sitting in the parking spot -- the 30 minute only parking spot. The other one was taken over by a truck that was in here evidently for some maintenance . I understand the truck who's -- who might do business in City Hall is an issue, but when I went and talked to the police officer and why they were taking up a 30-minute parking space in the front of this building when there were 10 parking spaces out behind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the building and that was the only location for the populous who has business here to park, I was told, well, the Mayor and the administration told us and we've been directed to park out front here. The 30-minute parking for City Hall business is not a reserved police parking space. If they park in any meter parking spaces or behind the building s, they are certain ly not going to get a ticket unlike the regular population . I understand there hasn't been a lot of business in City Hall since COVID hit. But there are two or three spaces out front. A police vehicle does not need to be taking up one of those, especially when there is parking in the back that was open for them. I was also surprised when I came in that City Hall seems to be an enclave now. I remember coming here when Jimmy Connors was here. You walked in. You saw the stained glass. You could wander around the building . You could look at the picture s. Now you go to the door down the front and you're met during business hours with a lock key card on the door 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 where you have to call on the phone to have someone come down and take a piece of paperwork from you because you're not allowed in your City Hall. This City Hall was paid for by the public. And these halls and these structures are the public's property . It should not be locked from the people it's supposed to serve. The Mayor and everyone else has offices which they could have private with people out front. But City Hall itself, should not be a locked enclave . Looking at Mariupol , two months people were trapped inside of the steel factory over there fighting for their own survival , women, children , and wounded . It took two months of negotiation s and the UN to get them out of there. Why do I bring this up? Because we cannot get funding that we already have here for the hungry in this city. We're sitting on it while other people negotiate and think about how we should spend money when we have money from the government that could go to charities and could go to people who are impacted by the food banks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 that have been severely impacted by this COVID and now this -- the increase in prices. This is not a small thing. In two months we were able to evacuate people out of a war zone entrapped behind enemy lines. Yet we cannot get money free to feed our own hungry in the City. There is something seriously wrong about that. And last week when they came in to show the screens , I wasn't sure -- I thought that I saw but I wanted to verify it. And the slides are quite correct . We have the community allocation was put forward and the City allocation on the other side from the surveys . And the final allocation put out there that we're going by is the City's allocation completely devoid of all the impact by the population . We're going to think about that later. It's opportunities for future alignment . Bull. You took a survey. You found out what the population wanted. And the people in charge said we don't care what the population of the City wants. We're going to do it our way. And that's wrong. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . First, I'd -- hoping that we will get a report on the outcome of the last Thursday 's meeting about the acoustics in this room. MR. DONAHUE : There's -- yes, Fifth Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then do we have the -- tonight the percent of property owners who have paid 100 percent of their taxes to date? MR. DONAHUE : I haven't been able to get that. But I'll work on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now again, we talked about the Pocket Park. And I didn't know that she would be back. But I have a tendency to agree with her because we have spent about $700,000 on that lot. We had to buy it back because Mayor Doherty did not do what he said he would do to the company who bought the property . And then we had to get the money for whatever 's been done and will be done turning it into a Pocket Park. But part of the funding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 for that was -- and I don't know what the amount was. I admit to that. But it was from the Mary and William Scranton Family Trust. And again, I don't know what percent it was. But it was in honor of Mary Scranton . Now the Scrantons have done a lot. And their names aren't around a lot of places. So the -- Mayor Doherty , that is, dumped a ton of money up in -- we borrowed what, 82 million dollars when he first came in? And a lot of it was spent at Nay Aug. You know, and it's paid off. But I think it would be nice to take the Wyoming and Linden park and make that in honor of Mary Scranton and find something up at Nay Aug to honor Mr. Doherty . I hope you will consider that. And then last week after the meeting , the Times-Tribune reported that Mr. Preambo was on a leave. Nobody said anything about that during the meeting . Is that going to be a long leave or is it personal ? MR. DONAHUE : It's a personal leave, yes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MS. SCHUMACHER : It's a personal leave, paid or unpaid? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then we get down to 5-E. We need a lot more meat on those bones. You have to put that in -- on the table until we can get more meat on what's behind that. That's a lot of money. We should spend it wisely. And we don't have nearly enough information . And one of the things that -- the other thing I don't understand is, are you going to and I would recommend that you do require any withdrawal from those funds come to Council first because otherwise , I don't know how you're going to keep it from going into the quarter . If you have another way it would be nice if you shared it. But the other thing I have in mind about these quarters , are we going to have to lease the space -- the 5 feet for the bike riders because the company that got those parking meters and they use the coins that are put into that to keep the parking garages open at a reasonable price; are we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 going to have to sort of buy them from them because they're really -- they're contracted to have those parking spaces. Do we know? MR. DONAHUE : In terms -- what are you -- what are you asking about? The -- MS. SCHUMACHER : The streets . If you create a bike lane, that's 5 feet from the curb usually . That means there's not going to go be any car parking there. But those parking meters were -- MR. DONAHUE : So that's going to be -- MS. SCHUMACHER : -- part of a lease. MR. DONAHUE : That's going to be something that hopefully comes out of our walkability study. But those parking spaces, you know, theoretically nothing set in stone, would move out. And they would still be there. They would just provide protection for a bike lane. MS. SCHUMACHER : Where are the cars going to go then? MR. DONAHUE : That's going to be part of the walkability and connect ivity study. We don't know what that's going to say coming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 back. But that's theoretically the idea I believe you are speaking of because then the cars provide protection . That's theoretically what the idea is there. I don't know if that's actually going to be the case. But that's going to come out of a walkability and connectivity study. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . I have a little newspaper article I want to drop off up here. The subject is about -- it's not in our state. But two parents are under arrest because they bought a firearm and let it lay around and the kid took it to school and shot of few of his fellow students . And I support it entirely . I think anybody that leaves an unsecured firearm around the house with incorrigible kids should be arrested for careless storage of a firearm . It could be more people that were alive if they have more common sense. You have gun safes and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 all kinds of lovely things to keep them secure. It would take two or three men to carry a gun safe out of the house. And they should be locked up away so somebody doesn't get -- you could at least in the case of school shooting s, eliminate school shootings with that type of enforcement . People should be put on notice. Okay, and once again, that Barron Industries that was down on Dixon Avenue were tax exempt. And they had bumper to bumper diesel trucks, flatbeds all times of the day and night waiting in line because a lot of diesel trucks are running around with bad batteries and bad charging systems . I worked on a few, not many because I got really tired of diesels. Anyway once again, we have our tax problems still. And they seem to be getting worse. So I'd like some day I guess I'll have to put it in writing to get a new percentage on how many -- the percentage of properties that are tax exempt in Scranton . And it is growing . Today in the paper Tyler Memorial out on Route 6 out of Tunkhannock is closing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 their ER. They promised not to close it a while back. And they are closing it anyway. Now, those people will have to either come to Scranton which is probably 20 or 25 miles. Route 307 is terrible . I think Route 92 might go from there. And that's not a really good route either. And there's a lot of concern about Commonwealth Health because they're not providing the service s that they bought the hospitals for in the first place. It's really a shame. And people are going to lose their lives. And we're going to have a chu chu train of ambulances from different parts of our regional countryside . The subject of choice came up and, yes, I would agree that multiple abortions are wrong. But women aren't provided contraceptive services . And men aren't concerned when they're in the mood. And it's really a shame that we can't raise our children and young adults to take responsibility for themselves for those intermittent amorous moments . At any rate, we had Chick-fil-A. And we had that Hobby Lobby and just about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 everybody else, the Sisters of the Poor would not sign a paper so the government could take up the slack for lack of birth control . And I recommend that everybody do it. And you really shouldn 't even have a pregnancy before you're married three years if you want a pregnancy . Myself, I was always a free agent and I'm glad for it. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Have a good evening . MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just something I mentioned earlier in caucus about the paving project s. I just want to make sure if we could contact Larry West down at DPW to make sure that the roads that are on that paving list that they address any of the issues as far as drainage , as far as water issues.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 I just -- I don't want to see them paving over areas that are just going to end up, you know, having a problem again immediate ly a year or two later. So I'm just hoping that maybe the City engineer -- and it appears as though in some of the areas that I've seen, it looks like they're going to be addressing some of the drainage and pipes underneath some of those roads, but if you could just contact I guess it would be Mr. West now at DPW. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : I guess the only comment s I have I did mention in caucus as well. We spoke with Solicitor Gallagher about reaching out to the City Solicitor about looking at the billing -- the billing request s that were made over the last two weeks to see what needed to be redacted and how Council could get ahold of those documents as it is public money that's being spent on labor counsel .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 And then the second thing is, I'll send it to Mr. Voldenberg afterward s. I did get a call from residents up in West Mountain about the drainage basins. I sent an e-mail over to DPW. And they said it would be on the list. But there hasn't been any action. And I think there's been some new things that occurred at DPW now that -- it might have got by them. So if we could send that e-mail or correspondence as well to DPW about the basins. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MS. SCHUSTER : That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few comments . There are a couple things I wanted to thank the DPW for. I know someone had brought up the street sweepers . And I did notice at least the street sweeper is going around in my neighborhood last week there were a couple days when I was home and I could hear them. And I looked out and sure enough that is what it was. So it was a happy sight 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 for sure, especially around this time of year when you want the streets to be nice and cleaned of all the debris and salt from over the winter. I had also noticed DPW vehicle and workers that were on Moosic Street as I was driving along one day. And I know that was a complaint of a previous resident . And it's a really treacherous area to walk. We certainly still need sidewalks on that side of the street. But at least now the cones and the trash and overgrown bushes and shrubs are now cleared , which should make it a little bit easier for people to walk along that way. And I have would stopped and actually said thank you but it's a busy road as you know and so that would not be good for me to pull over there. The other thing I wanted to bring up, a resident had asked me just today about how to obtain a handicap parking permit in front of their property . And they said that they couldn't find information on it anywhere on the website . So I had spoken with Mr. Voldenberg about this earlier and asked for him to contact IT to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 if we can get that information up on the website . And so the process we have if the complaint comes in through our office if the person provided their information , their address , then we can send that application to them. And then the application will get sent to the police department for review. And then from there it gets over to DPW so that they could create the sign if the application is approved . That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So back in April I made a motion -- it was passed -- to colleagues here to get a timeline and meeting dates for where there was actual physical negotiations where they actually sat down and negotiated , right? So I'm happy to report I have that. So what I can tell you and, you know, make note that these negotiations occurred after January 1st when the contract s were expired . So there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 wasn't a lot more negotiating going on before that -- prior to that. So what I can report to all of you is, the police, all right, they negotiated physically sat down with administration negotiated on 3/15 and 4/7. All right, so that was March and then April. Twice they've only sat down. And then the firefighters sat down and had a physical , you know, negotiations February 22nd and then on March 16th. So they only met twice. And then the Association of Machinist had three negotiations . One was January 13th, one was February 1st and February 23rd. So they are the dates and times where they actually sat down and negotiated . All right. Also about a year and a half, two years ago I asked if -- I asked a lot of questions ; but I asked about do we have employee handbooks. Employee handbooks , you can't hear me? Okay, I'm sorry. Are there employee handbooks for the employees , right? I also asked them a couple other questions but I'm focusing on this one with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 today with regards , you know, so I was told year and a half, two years ago, don't quote me on the date that we're working on them, right? So -- and the reason why I bring it up because as of recent, I'm getting a lot of question s, question s that I can't answer, question s that would be answered in an employee handbook, what about the actual City's policy for FMLA leave, right? I know different entities have different policies with regards to how the process starts, how you fill it out. FMLA is FMLA, you know, God forbid, people need it. But I'm being asked about the policy or the process . Mr. Voldenberg sent down that -- posed that question to administration . I did not receive that yet, right. So in addition to that, they want to know about COVID days. Do we get paid for them? We did, now we didn't. They're asking about different days, how many this, how many that. So they're asking me policy question s that should be in an employee handbook and posted on the website . So I don't know if you forgot about it, so let's remind them, Mr. Voldenberg . Can you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 send a correspondence down to administration saying how are we doing with the employee handbooks? And in addition to that, I did bring this up the past two years because around budget time they always come and say, well, you know, this one needs a raise, that deserve s a raise, he deserves a raise. And the past two years I asked if any formal evaluation s were conduct ed on any employee in City Hall. And I was told no that they would start that. So, you know, we're into the fifth month of the year. So could you also ask in tandem with the handbook because that should be in the handbook how many times you get observed or, you know, evaluated and if that's occurring this year or not. And that is all I have on that. So also I received an e-mail -- actually today so bear with me. Let me pull it up. And this is regards , Mr. Voldenberg , this gentleman is asking about the status in the Hill Section on the petition for permit parking in the 1500 block of Pine Street. I just don't remember where we're at with that. Could you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 answer that? MR. DONAHUE : So I also forwarded that over to Mr. Voldenberg yesterday because I got the same e-mail. And Mr. Voldenberg actually got one from -- the same e-mail from 311. So he was already looking into it when I forwarded it to him this morning . So hopefully we could get an update on that. MR. MCANDREW : And the stop sign? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I think we both got the same. MR. MCANDREW : Well, that's fine. It was only sent to me so I didn't know that. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, and the one was only sent to me too. But I guess it was sent to 311 as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, the traffic officer is going to report back to the Chief on both matters tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Well, that's great. It's being worked on. And then I have another one on Dale Drive, 800 block of Dale Drive in West Scranton there's a collapsed drain. And I guess, you know, I have a picture . I just got this yesterday . There 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 was, like, a metal -- a piece of metal put over it that is moved. And the collapsed drain is getting worse. It looks really, really bad. So, you know, that's near a school. It's a safety issue with automobile s and children . So could you just check on the status of that? It looks like there is an attempt to fix it. Can we just see where we're at with that? I have a picture on my phone that was sent to me that I will forward to you. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you. I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just some things that came up in Citizens Participation , in terms of the zoning ordinance , we are expecting a memo this week in terms of the changes that have been made to date on that. So that then once we receive that -- if we receive it by the end of the week it will go in Third Order for next week. But if we don't receive it until the beginning of next week, it won't be in until 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 the following week. But, you know, we're going to review that and then before we even -- it even gets sent out because with the changes that were made, it will have to be resent to the county for a 30-day review and then also go in front of the City Planning Commission again before it comes back to us. But as soon as we get that, it will be in Third Order for -- and then we'll review it and see where we go from there. In terms of the street cleaning , we'll request some clarification on that. I know that, you know, on my time on Council , I've been pushing for alternate side of the street parking with a schedule . You know, that hasn't happened yet. But there needs to be more clarification on when street -- the street sweeper comes out. I know I've seen it on -- them out randomly on streets. And the cars don't move so they go in and out and the whole street isn't necessarily clean. So we will reach out to DPW to get clarification on what's on the website in terms of the schedule there. In terms of an update on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 acoustics , so the sound guy that has -- that knows the sound system here is going to work with ECTV first to fix the equipment on the back end that needs to be changed out. And then develop a plan, you know, based off the working s of this room which way the floorboards work to reconfigure, get some permanent mics down there and then also reconfigure the speakers so that everyone in the audience is able to hear. From what he told me -- I'm not an expert on this and a lot of the stuff flew over my head, but at the same time if we move the speakers this way, you guys will be able to hear better but we might not necessarily . And my response to him was that was fine because I think that we could hear each other up here all right as long as, you know, people in the audience are able to hear. So we're hoping that that work can be done during our August recess. That's also dependent on, you know, supply chain and making sure that we get the equipment in in time to do the work. But that is the plan. And they're working with ECTV too to do some of the back 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 end stuff there because we could fix the sound in there but that might screw up the sound then on TV. And we want to make sure that it's all encompass ing and we're not screwing up one aspect to fix another . In terms of, Mr. Ellman, your complaint s in the past, this past week one of the speeding tracker apparatuses was put up on North Main Avenue between Parker Street and the Toyota dealership . That gets -- that captures every -- the speed of every car that goes by in both direction s and then get some data on how we could then address the issue of speeding there moving forward . In terms of some of the other complaint s you brought , Mr. Ellman, 2090 North Main Avenue, a rental registration warning letter was sent; 2812 North Main Avenue, a zoning violation letter has been sent; 120 Throop Street, zoning was scheduled to follow up last week. We're still waiting on what that follow up was; 122 Throop Street failed the initial site inspection , notice of violation was issued; the hundred block of Wells Street, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 that complaint was unfounded , no illegal junkyard ; and the 100 block of East Parker Street, the two tractor -trailer s were moved. Also, as I brought up in caucus, we're going to request for representatives to come in from PA American Water, the sewer aspect of it to give us an update on the Birch Street Project . I drove down there this past week. And it basically is a launching pad. If you're going over 20 miles per hour, you could get air born going down Birch Street. So the last update we got in I believe it was January , February was that work would be getting to fix the issues there once the construction season started . We're about a month into construction season. I haven't seen any updates there. But that's an issue that needs to be addressed and fixed. So we're going to request that they come in to give us -- for a caucus to give us an update on their progress there. We also discussed in caucus we got an e-mail yesterday I believe it was that PA American Water is going to be requesting rate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 hikes. So we're going to draft a letter in opposition to those rate hikes. They're going to be request ing those from the Pennsylvania Utility Commission . It was also brought up that we had gotten word that PP & L is raising their rates as well. I also have to look into if they could do that unilaterally or if they have to go in front of the Public Utility Commission for that rate hike too. But maybe we'll tie those both in after further review. Just to follow up on some of the requests that I made in the last few weeks, Mr. Voldenberg , I know with 337-339 Wheeler that they did put up -- it said Code Enforcement advised that the property partially passed inspection and sandbags have been placed. According to the neighbor , the sandbags haven't done anything except impede her access to the side of the property -- to her side of her property . But there is still water issues there. So if we can just pass that along. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And also, we reached out to PA American Water about manhole covers on Karen Drive and Debbie Drive up in the Oakmont section . There are literal holes in the manhole covers. The one on Karen Drive was fixed. And then we -- I followed up with that last week when we sent a request on Debbie Drive. And they came back and said that they weren't in bad condition , correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : All but one were in good condition . They repaired the one that was -- MR. DONAHUE : That was on Karen Drive, I believe , right? MR. VOLDENBERG : Debbie Drive. MR. DONAHUE : Debbie Drive. MR. VOLDENBERG : Karen Drive was fixed the prior week. MR. DONAHUE : So they will look at the one -- I'll get together with you after. I went up there today and took some pictures . And there is some rotting in the holes that it's not necessarily like something or someone is going to fall into it, but it could become an issue down the road. And that's all I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) GRANT FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF SIXTY-EIGHT MILLION , SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY-SIX THOUSAND AND FIFTY DOLLARS ($68,746,050.00). MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : On the question , when looking at this, it did come up in citizens comment there is 52 line items here on the list. And I don't think it would be a hard act to, you know, give us a little bit more of a breakdown on what it would be considered in some of these line items. For example , you know, software upgrades, heat, cooling , City Hall and Weston Field, $75,000. If they could just break that down and say this much will be spent on this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 and such and such, you know, Home Buyer Program $500,000. If they could just break it down, I think with 52 items, I don't think it would be a hard ask. MR. DONAHUE : So what's been conveyed to me is that, you know, in terms of any grants that are going out, those, you know, the parameters for that grant money will be sent up to us once, you know, that money is about to go out the door or even -- when it opens up to be applied for, right, and then also all contracts associate d with this will also come before Council . It's, you know, it's a breathing document basically that it's going to be adjusted based off alternative revenues and based off of cost. We don't know, you know, what something might cost today if that's what it's going to cost six months from now. So basically all this is, is just approving that this much is going to be put into those -- into boxes and then the details will be sent up to us as that is moved on. MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I mean, that was my understanding from the backup. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 understand that things do change. I mean, I would be able to consider it a draft document . But if we can get just a little bit more on each of those items on the list, I think it will be very helpful. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.
