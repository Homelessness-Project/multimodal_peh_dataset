DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. As Chairman for the Committee on Public Safety, I would like to offer my thought s and prayers and heartfelt condolences to the families of retired patrolman , Robert J. Gavern. Prior to his retirement he served our City as patrolman for 27 years and 8 years as head of the police union. He also worked as a Pennsylvania State Constable . Thank you for your service and may he rest in peace. That is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. KING: Mr. President , last week when I was sworn in I failed to mention former Council President Bill Gaughan . I just want to thank him for his eight years of service to the citizens of the City of Scranton and thank him for his leadership as well as Kevin Hayes, former Solicitor for City Council . I was remiss in not mentioning that last week. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 wanted to make sure I did this week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First speaker tonight , Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Did I hear you correctly during the caucus that we might have the 2020 audit next week? MR. DONAHUE : I was told that the Sewer Authority went to Rainey and Rainey -- the Sewer Authority either went to Rainey and Rainey and that it needs to be put into the audit -- the final audit by Kohanski and that we should have it. MS. HODOWANITZ : And if memory serves, Kohanski has another year. They're going to do the 2021 audit. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, there's one more year left on their contract . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I'm a little bit confused as to why they originally promised 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the 2020 audit by September 30th knowing the history of working with the Sewer Authority . But we'll see what they do this year. Speaking of statuses , what's going on with the union contracts ? They all expired on December 31st. Are they still in negotiations or are we heading into arbitration or what's their status? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they're all still in negotiations . They haven't gotten to arbitration yet. But we've inquired . It seems to be heading that way. MS. HODOWANITZ : What they agreed to in terms of personal compensation is going to have a direct impact on your 2022 budget. So that bears watching and that needs to be disclosed once we have that information available to the public. Item 3-M on the agenda, the overtime statistics . First of all, I was curious . It had the column for December filled out. So you would think this is for the entire year of 2021. And then I saw the date stamp on the front page, December 23rd. So I'm wondering if there's more overtime to be attribute d to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 December . Nevertheless , it was fascinating that we exceeded the overtime budget by 185 percent . So instead of the 1.4 million dollars that was budgeted , we have spent 2.678 million . And for 2022, we've only budgeted 1.852 million . So I can understand that some of that may be attributed to absences due to COVID-19, things of that nature for which we have no control . But that's an awful lot of money going down in overtime . And it's one of those things we've been wrestling with for years. And the Controller 's report, Item 3-F for the month of November , on the expenditure summary page, they show unpaid bills for $421,000. But I don't know how you could say what are those unpaid bills because , you know, you have to run around looking for it. I have asked before in the Controller 's report if you could -- since this is a report they do for you, ask them for substantial figures like that if they could footnote it saying this amount includes X, Y, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 and Z. That is a lot of money for a single month to go under the rubric of unpaid bills because everything is an unpaid bill. I also notice that Court Awards was a large number, $408,000 that now apparently we budgeted $700,000 for the entire year. That's a lot of money to be paying out in court awards. And I asked before the meeting what did we budget for 2022, 1 million dollars for court awards. So that's something that bears scrutiny . And last but not least, can you update the public what's going on with the Sewer Authority ? Are they eventually seeing the light at the end of the tunnel -- or should I say the City of Scranton seeing the light at the end of the tunnel? So you could answer that now or in Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : So with the Sewer Authority , there is still about I think 37 or 38 outstanding easements that still need to be obtained . There was the class action where a lot of them were settled . But these were 38 that opted out of that class action. So they have to be settled individually . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 And I was told yesterday by the Mayor that we're going to start seeing some of those settlement s coming down because we have to approve those individuals -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Do you think this -- MR. DONAHUE : I don't know how many of those 37 and 38 are in the City and how many are in Dunmore . But it seems like that it's starting to -- I'm hoping that this is the year that we're able to dissolve this Sewer Authority . MS. HODOWANITZ : Let's hope so. They ought to be in the Guinness Book of World Records . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening Council , Lee Morgan. You know, I come here tonight because I think it's time to get the residents of the City involved in what's taking place in the City. And I think it's time for the residents of the City to understand that they have an obligation to change what's taking place in this City government and in the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 of Scranton -- in the City of Scranton as a whole. So in the next Council , I'm going to come and I'm going to make another request for Council to put the Home Rule Charter on the ballot. And I'm also going to ask the Mayor to do the same thing in the hope that COVID somehow shifted it and it got lost. And if that's unsuccessful , then I guess it's time to start collecting signature s because I think it's time for the residents to understand quite a few things that they really haven't thought about over a very long extended period of time. You know, the City's been in distress for 30 years. And it's time to ask the question is the City in worse shape now than when it went into Act 47? That's a real legitimate question . I think the residents have to take control of the government and rewrite the charter so that all City information is on the internet at all times except for personnel . I think there's just a host of questions that have to be addressed by a commission to look at the functioning of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 City. The City's been in decline for 100 years plus. And to be honest with you, coming to Council meetings can be productive but when you have Council members telling you that they can't get answers to questions , it gets a little silly, okay? And the other thing is, we have to give the residents a voice in their City where grant money's spent, what laws are passed, what laws are presented to the Council . Does the City really need a Mayor or do we need two Council , an Executive Council and a City Council . Okay, I mean, it's a very complex issue that would be hard to compress in five minutes . But this is not a Democratic and Republican issue. It cuts across our whole country because we're a country that's basically leaderless . And I don't care if you're a Democrat or a Republican because the American people are just getting poorer and poorer and poorer. I think it goes back to what Thomas Jefferson said when we created the Federal Reserve. I really think that's a major 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 catalyst of America 's problems . But the problems we're experiencing in this City are just mind-boggling . I mean, we've named a City park after a former Mayor that did so much damage to the City that it's ridiculous . And the only reason that I could think of how that came up is, it was political . And things have to stop being political . And people have to start telling the residents of the City the truth, whether they like it or not. And, you know, maybe it's time for the residents to decide how many fire stations we should have, where they should be, how they pick the Chief of the Fire Department , how they pick the Chief of the Police Department . There's just -- there's so many issues that could be discussed by a commission and change this whole government and take it out of your hands and make a lot of it function in different ways and be much more productive and get the residents out of debt and rebuild the City in decline and maybe teach the rest of Pennsylvania ns and maybe people across this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 country that in America , the resident s have a right to self-determination . And when this Council had members who said they were even against putting it on the ballot, it's so un-American it's ridiculous . It's like letting non-Americans vote. You're telling Americans they have no right to determine their own government and not even to discuss it because you don't agree with it. That's what this Council said that they didn't think that the American people that live in Scranton have a right to determine the government they have and how it functions . And maybe you could take your time at the end of the meeting and explain to the people here how you reach that conclusion . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , City resident and taxpayer . I would like to ask that if I ask a question that you hold the answers until Fifth Order because you guys have been gone for a long time and there's a lot. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 know I'm not going to get through everything anyway. I was happy to see some pilot's money coming in. And I wonder if there was a letter sent out to all of the non-profits who do not pay property taxes that own property in the City. Is there a quick yes or no if anybody knows whether there was a letter sent out? MR. DONAHUE : There was a letter sent out not request ing -- not a (inaudible ) but there was a letter requesting pilots. I know that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Then I think if -- yeah, if yes, that's a disappointing response . I hope somebody will be following up with the ones who haven't read the letter and taken some action. On 3-Q, the City engineer , were there any other responses to that particular solicitation ? Do you know? MR. DONAHUE : There were. They'll be included when we get that legislation on our agenda. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 then Joan already talked about 3-M and the overtime issue. That one is really bad. How -- what is going to happen so that we don't have a repetition in 2022 of -- I probably should have checked to see how much was in the budget if that's been increased , but I don't know. I did not do that. And we heard Joan talking too about when are we going to, if ever, get out of that Sewer Authority . Remember , we've got Meadow Brook two coming up for stormwater . That has a number, a rather large number of rights of way that have to be obtained . So learning from the Sewer Authority I hope it has -- I would like to know if somebody has already been assigned to that and if there's a budget for that if that was included in the budget. MR. DONAHUE : So it was included in the budget, professional services under the BA. That was the increase there for legal and for appraisers for Meadow Brook. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. So there is somebody assigned to getting those rights of ways because otherwise -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. DONAHUE : I don't know if it's assigned yet but there's money budgeted for that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, because -- if that can hold up the whole project and God knows we need it. And stormwater as a whole, it's been many, many months since the HRG report came in and nothing . MR. DONAHUE : We have been -- there's been some preliminary meeting s with other municipalities in terms of creating a regional stormwater authority . MS. SCHUMACHER : Has anybody looked at the SAPA plan by any chance? MR. DONAHUE : SAPA is going to be coming down, I believe , the first week -- first or second week of February . There's a 45-day requirement for it to go to the County Planning Commission . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, because I don't know why that hasn't been brought up before. And in something I didn't make note of it, but there was a name that I never seen before, Alexis Santaniello if I'm reading it right. It is a project manager . Can somebody 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 tell me what project this woman manages ? MR. DONAHUE : All projects . She oversees all projects currently going on in the City. MS. SCHUMACHER : And how many projects active do we have at any -- MR. DONAHUE : I don't have a number. I don't want to -- but I could get that for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, I -- I think one thing I want to talk to you about -- oops -- next week are some metrics. There are positions that have specific duties. And I would really like to see a log of what they are doing. And then under 5-C, after last year and walking up on sidewalks where there were tables out on both sides, I think the pedestrians should have a specific assignment for those -- you know, I feel -- I felt as though I was interrupting their dinner. And -- so, okay, I'm out of time. I will try to come back next week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . At the close of the last session , I missed the very last session due to reaction from my booster shot. But it was talked about prior to that that all business in City Hall is being conducted as usual as in there are no virtual sessions . I was surprise d to find out that the Ethics Board is still and has been virtually meeting . Is there any time in particular -- I understand that they are thinking about, talking about discussing possibly returning to City Hall because they understand that there is an impact with the Ethics Board that limits the ability for the community to oversee and to communicate and be involved in a process . I was shocked when I saw it on line because I figured it was just another meeting that they did not hold at all. But it came -- but then not skipping a month they actually had a session . Unfortunately , it's difficult to participate in any of those meeting s when there is little announcement and for months they skip completely showing up and providing the feedback and the regular scheduled meeting that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 they are bound to. And I understand there is an issue with -- there were members that were missing . There was problems hitting quorums because of lack of memberships. But now that that's filled, that should not be a problem . They talk about the Governor 's room being available and considering going back there. And I figure if City Hall and the Mayor's office and City Council and the other government bodies who are representing the people are available to come into this building and hear from the public even on a limited business , then the Ethics Board should be in the building doing the same exact thing. They're here to represent the people's interest and it involves the employees ' interest in relation to ethics. Now for the IT Department , I had inquired whether or not there was a policy in place for data retention for e-mails and communications . And I was informed that there was none in place that they would be putting one together for the year 2022. This runs afoul of the federal acts that run on federal , state, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 and city governments for data retentions of a minimum of three years. If we have nothing in place and there are federal regulations that say there must be data retention for a period of time, if the City government does not have a policy in place with the IT Department , it is this body's responsibility to ensure that compliance with the laws is put in place by enacting an ordinance for that data retention for the minimum that they're required by federal law. It cannot be a policy will be made sometime in the future when an overseeing policy is already in place that obviously no one has been aware of or no one has followed . And last, I will circle back to the garbage tax -- garbage fee. In the last sessions I asked about whether or not there was a separate account . And I was told there was not. It was being handled and being put in the General Fund. Since this by the ordinance itself is designated and has been designated to put in a separate sequestered fund and has not been since the City has been made aware of it since 2017 when the City was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 sued for this part of the issue of overcharging , who decides that laws can be ignored ? Who decides that fiduciary responsibilities are something that can be ignored when their specific duty is fiduciary ? Who decides that a city law can be ignored ? Is there anyone out there with that power to say you don't need to follow that? Council ? MR. DONAHUE : I'll find out what the issue is there. MR. COYNE: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . Okay. Has our Sewer Authority been audited for any of this -- these issues? I know I'm kind of dissatisfied from the offset that it was ever even an issue or sold. MR. DONAHUE : The Sewer Authority is audited every year and that's included in our audit. MR. DOBRZYN : Um hum. You know, kind of need some changes over there if things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 don't get resolved . That's all there is to it. It's just not right with how long this has been going on. And too many things were left hanging open. I was not happy with the legal representation at all. Now, I see that our legal representation for Council seems to have decreased the funding for it. MR. DONAHUE : No, it's still the same. MR. DOBRZYN : I think Amil was paid 50 grand a year for representation . MR. DONAHUE : Who was that? MR. DOBRZYN : Amil Minora. MR. DONAHUE : No, it -- I mean, as long as I've been here it's been the same. MR. DOBRZYN : Okay. You know, if you -- I don't know how you would increase Council 's tally -- pay -- compensation because it's kind of confusing there. You have two people and then three people under election . And we have a rule that they can't vote themselves a raise. So I think in the future that should be looked into. There's some way where we can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 update pay. And, you know, I'm not interested in money being donated back like it was other years. I'm just more interested in the sincere job in keeping everybody in mind. Now, in Pennsylvania , we have an attempt tomorrow at passing their election restrictions and redistricting . Why in the heck is Scranton four different representatives going to represent Scranton ? I mean, I would hope that you folks would start barking about that and expressing your views. This is ridiculous . We have more people -- we'd have to relinquish people to another district here with if the average -- from what I read was 62,000, 63,000. And we're going to have four different representatives . You know, when I go out to the country around Christmas and New Years, I see flags displayed upside down. I see Trump signs still up. I see all kinds of disgraceful comments , Biden signs upside down. I don't want to be in with those people. I don't want anything to do with them politically . And it's a rotten shame that we're going to have four different districts in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Scranton . Some day we may not have anyone that really has to listen to us at all because it's only a couple thousand here and a couple thousand votes there. And it just -- it's getting split up. And I'm sure if you get further of Clarks Summit or Waverly, you're going to see a lot of consternation out there about voting and the issues. So this is really getting very concerning . And hopefully you people and the Mayor will agree and voice a few comments yourself. I don't know how we're going to overcome it because , you know, you have a -- unjust Republican majority because of redistrict ing. Thank you and have a great night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. You too. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council , Ronnie Ellman. You know, Dave and I both use the same barber as you could see. Before I alienate myself with the new Council members, I'd like to welcome you. I don't see the City in the rose colored glasses like most of you do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Our Mayor is not familiar with so many neighborhoods and the people, but I'm not -- I'm not anti-women. Oh, I don't know, I think when I was in ninth grade a required reading , I came across Eleanor Roosevelt 's history . That's one of the greatest American s that ever lived in my opinion and another one was a lady called Anne Sullivan . Anne Sullivan sort of got overlooked in history . But her achievement it just equals or surpasses the Kennedy 's and Edison and Henry Ford and other greats in history . She's the woman that taught Helen Keller how to survive . Helen Keller was like a vegetable as you might know. They both were teachers at the end. Helen Keller, I think she died in the 30s. She was known all over the world because of Anne Sullivan 's wonderful time she spent with this poor woman. I think Sullivan died right after 1900 or so. She didn't live to see the greatness that Helen Keller achieved . Now, I want to compare that to our Mayor. This woman seems to be devoid of any ability to govern. You know why, because she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 doesn't have an administration , period. This is a terrible administration . You know, starting with Harrisburg all the way with the two local commissioners for the county to the Mayor, things are just outrageously expensive . There's so much waste. Look what happened at the School Board. They couldn't leave well enough alone listening to a bunch of do-gooders . It will cost more than a million dollars . And that's just starting , people. The Mayor needs to ask for some help from Jimmy Connors, maybe. Mr. Doherty , he was a neophyte but he had a successful administration . It wasn't made up of friends and support ers. It was made up of people -- local people that were qualified . This town is not ready to leave the act, even Gerald Cross knows that. You people don't want to admit it, but you have a downtown that you brag about. It's like a few years ago when the governor come here, you took him down Cedar Avenue. Three quarter s of the businesses on Cedar Avenue weren't paying taxes. They were listed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 in the paper. Everyone was saying how nice it looks. They could fix up their houses when you don't have to pay taxes. How many times have I said my taxes are three times what they were when I bought the house. I don't know, people. It's real quick -- I told you my house insurance went up $33 for the car and the house. Then my gas went up $16. Right there, those two things is $1,000 more this year than I paid last year and multiply that by all the people in the City that are in the same shape. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: They're out of touch. You people -- I complained about my neighborhood , not a thing been done. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Ellman, I actually have responses to your thing. And I'll give them to you after the meeting . I'll mention them in Fifth Order. MR. ELLMAN: Well, I wish I'd see some of it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 anyone else like to address Council ? MR. NEWCOMER : My name is Charles Newcomer . I've been a citizen of Scranton a long time for years. I was here about two months ago and I didn't receive a response . Would you like to debate that? MR. DONAHUE : Excuse me? MR. NEWCOMER : I was here about two months ago. And I didn't receive a response for these losses and these ideas that I have for the City and for the United States. Would you like to -- MR. DONAHUE : Could you -- could you just give us a copy of those and we'll get you a response ? MR. NEWCOMER : I didn't get any response from you. MR. DONAHUE : I don't know what you are referring . MR. NEWCOMER : I was here about two months ago. And I didn't receive any response from the lawsuits about (inaudible ) my stuff being stolen, stem cell -- my bad time from Geisinger . And I'd like to know if you have any response for that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. DONAHUE : I mean, I don't think that's anything that we could -- MR. NEWCOMER : I think it is. MR. DONAHUE : Okay, well -- MR. NEWCOMER : Everybody -- the guy just said he got a response from you. MR. DONAHUE : I got a response about, yeah, about City issues regarding quality of life issues. MR. NEWCOMER : Yeah, I was here two months ago and didn't get a response from my podium responses . MR. DONAHUE : If you give us your e-mail address we'll -- MR. NEWCOMER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Send us an e-mail. MR. NEWCOMER : Okay. Enough said. Well, some concerns I have is Colts bus did not pick me up. I have an idea. There should be mass outside at St. Peters on the steps so that people don't fall. My benefits were not on time. The Department of Public Welfare dropped the ball on that. I don't think the Commissioner was (inaudible ) my phone was hacked, mistreatment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 at Geisinger . I think Scranton Counseling is not being upfront with me. Nobody would help at Scranton Council Authority . I was overcharged twice at Whiskey Dick's and Backyard Ale House, sexual harassment at CBHS, Scranton Counseling , some other places. Also there was inappropriate touching at Moses Taylor (inaudible .) And one more thing I'd like to ask now is if you saw the news President Biden is repeatedly with Kamala in inappropriate ways. That's unconstitutional . I would like to get something in writing or some public form of that with WNEP, WBRE. I complained about my mistreatment (inaudible ) hospital . I was -- my (inaudible ) was gone. I got diabetes up to 700, 1,000, 1,100 the other day and so forth. That's all. I'll give you my e-mail. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Please leave your e-mail address and we'll get -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, could you please provide your contact ? MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 to address Council ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. KING: Just briefly . I do want to commend DPW for the work that they did during the recent storms that we had and trying to do double duty there and get out and get the ice off the streets and collect all the garbage over the holiday . So I just want to thank them for their time and effort and being out in this freezing cold weather . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. SCHUSTER : So just two comment s with a request for Mr. Voldenberg . The first comment we discussed about a year ago exempt and nonexempt employees . And when we're looking at the departments and the overtime , we're seeing some department s going over 5 to 700 percent over. I'd like to ask Frank to send correspondence inquiring for a list of nonunion employees or salaried employees and whether 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 they are defined as exempt or nonexempt regarding overtime . The second comment , I'd like to make a motion to -- or I'd like to make a request to Frank to reach out to Eileen Cipriani to see if we can get an update of a list of all the grants that the City has applied for over the last two years. I know there's been many. And in that list including whether the designation as to whether these have been approve d or awarded and what grants are still pending . I'll send an e-mail after the meeting to clarify that but if we could get that correspondence out. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, not at this time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. So Mr. Coyne just brought up two topics. And it's not the first time he brought them up. One you said you'll address about the separate account for the garbage fee so you'll take care of that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 And then the second one he brought up about compliance for data retention . So supposedly I think you said that they're working on it or could you please inquire -- we approved Bedrock . Could we see who is going to be responsible for this and the reasons why it hasn't been done and the plan moving forward to do this? Do we have a copy of that plan or some direction so we know it's going to be done. And that is all I have. Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just some of the things that were brought up tonight , we will be getting the SAPA zoning legislation . I know it's in a 45-day waiting period with the County Planning Commission . Once it gets through those 45 days, we'll get legislation and we'll go through our process . So I believe we will have to have a public hearing on that as well. In terms of the Sewer Authority , there is about 38 properties out there that are opted out of easements -- the class action easements . So this -- we have to settle these individually . So we're going to start getting those in the next couple weeks to start winding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that down. And once all those easements are settled, then the Sewer Authority can cease to exist and then we can get the money that's still left in the account . I think it's a 80/20 split of what's left, 80 comes to the City, 20 goes to Dunmore . In terms -- I know one of the topics of discussion has been the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue and the garage that needs to be demoed. We did get notification this afternoon that that garage is scheduled to be demoed this Thursday at 9 a.m. So that's some good news. And I believe that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR.

SCHUSTER : I guess on the question , at that point in time I did make the request that Mrs. Cipriani pay the taxes of the City of Scranton and that was granted .
