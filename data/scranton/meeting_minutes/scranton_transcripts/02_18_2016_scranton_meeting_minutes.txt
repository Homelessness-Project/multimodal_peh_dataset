Afewitems.First,Iwanttoecho withwhatMr.Perrysaid,heisexactly rightonbothcounts thathebrought up. Regarding thecontract ordinances ,thereare manychanges thatarebeingmadeinthe legislation ,andIknowwetalked aboutthem alittle bitafewweeksago,I'mnotgoing togothough themallbecause obviously thereisquiteanumber ofsections onour sheetwereceived fromPatHinton withthe breakdownofthechanges andtheaverage citizen watching whoisnotacontractor , although thisdoesnoteffect them initially ,byallowing morecontractors to workinthecitythatincreased competition should result inlowerprices forhome improvement itemsthroughout thecityasfar1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 aselectrical workgoes,general home improvement work,andasMr.Perrymentioned thereareanumber ofcontractors thatwon't dobusiness inthecitybecause these licenses aredifficult toobtain andthere isalotofhoopstojumpthrough ,butthat ontopofotherissues withthebureaucracy inthecityitmakeitveryhardtodowork andIthinkthisisastepintheright direction to,onemakeiteasier for entrepreneurs ,people whowanttostarta smallconstruction business getintothat business andatthesametimeitstill provides protections thatsomebody like myself isn'trunning around doingelectrical workinthecity. SoIthinkitisaverygoodpiece oflegislation tomakeiteasier for contractors todobusiness butstillkeep thoseprotections inplace,andby increasing thatnumber theendresult should becheaper ratesfromcontractors inthe CityofScranton whentheyareallcompeting against oneanother soI'mlooking forward tovoting "yes"onthosetwoitems.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Next,lastweekIbrought upthe double pension scandal andwedidtalkabout thiswithAttorney Minora andIbrought up theideaafewtimesofsubpoenas andthere werequestions astowhether council does havethatauthority ordoesn'thavethat authority ,westillhavequestions ,butIdo wanttoturnitovertoAttorney Minora to report onthosefinding .

MR.ROGAN:Thankyou,Attorney Minora,forlooking intothatforus. Unfortunate ly,weprobably won'tknow whether wehavethatauthority unless wetry it. Regarding thepensions andthe double pension issue,asmentioned bysome speakers,thepension fundisobviously having a--themarkets areinroughshape andIcaution anyone touseonemonthorone weekasabenchmark,butifyoulookover thepast20yearsyouwillseethatthe fundsaredeclining .Evenwhenwehada goodstockmarket therewereissues.Weare drawing outmoremoneythanisgoinginand thatcan'tbesustained .Withallofthese1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 issues withthepension ,theonethingthat isevenmorescaryisifthatfundrunsdry thecitytaxpayers areonthehook.Not onlythepeople whohavepensions concerned thattheymaynotreceive theirpension that theywerepromised ,butwhatwouldbeeven worseifthatfunddryisaverage Scrantonians andmanyofthemsenior citizens whodidnothavepensions would thenbeforced topaythrough higher taxes forthosewhodohavethepensions . Ibelieve it'sinthecitycodethat thepensions ,andtherehasbeenlitigation thatpensions ifthatfundrunsdrythe pensions havetobepaidbefore thecity spends anickle onanyotherobligation s, alongwithsnowpicking up,garbage ,police protection ,fireprotection ,thatthose pensions havetobepaidsoit'savery dangerous roadandsomething needstobe done.Iknowmycolleagues havetalked, particularly Mr.Evans,aboutpension reform andchanges needtobemade.
