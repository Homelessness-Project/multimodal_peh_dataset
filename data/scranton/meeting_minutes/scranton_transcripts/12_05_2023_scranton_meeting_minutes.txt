HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . And what's the status of the 2022 audit? MR. KING: Frank, it's been received , right? MR. VOLDENBERG : It has. And it's under review by the auditor , CLP. And per the Business Administration Office, we expect that probably in a week or two. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. So you're going to pass the budget tonight without having a completed audit. This we do year after year, but who am I to criticize . What is the status of the firefighter and police union contracts that were suppose d to be on the website after the 120 days? MR. KING: The attorney s for both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 sides are still finalizing all the language and hopefully once that's complet ed we'll get them posted on the website . MS. HODOWANITZ : I understand you're looking for a new Council solicitor . Attorney Gallagher , you should look into becoming a labor counsel . There's a lot of money to be made. I'm serious . Speaking of money to be made, is there a cap on the contract with Ufberg for those police and firefighter contracts which date back to November of 2021 since we don't seem to have an end date? MR. KING: I don't believe there is a cap. MS. HODOWANITZ : Is there one? No? Well, see, that's why you should become a labor counsel and you could have these open-ended contracts and go cha-ching, cha-ching. Are you married ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : I am. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, damn, okay. The Honeywell contract , 5-C, I saw the cost was $489,000. And it's coming out of the city budget. Where in the city budget? I didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 see anything in the fire department or capital budget. Where is this $489,000 coming from? MR. KING: We are hopefully going to introduce that. We have a number of questions concerning that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, add that one. MR. KING: We'll add that one, Joan. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I do think that one is already on the list. MR. KING: I think it was on the list. MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. MR. SCHUSTER : It is coming out of the general fund. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yes, but where in the general fund? That's a lot of money, 489,000. MR. KING: I'm thinking maybe under salaries . I'm not sure, under the fire department . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. The article in the paper about the lawsuit with Scartelli Construction involving the Serrenti Center and the Novembrino Splash Pad, that thing has kind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 of hung fire for a long time. I know that Marie Schumacher has been asking repeatedly the status of the Serrenti Center. Now that we know this is involved in litigation , can we at least get a status of the Serrenti Center and Novembrino Splash Pad in terms of are they ready for prime time use, what short falls do they have, are we going to have to invest more money to get the short falls corrected ? Litigation aside, we should at least know where we stand with these two properties . Can we find that out? MR. KING: We'll see if we can get an update. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I don't need to know the details of the litigation because I know you won't give that to me. MR. KING: We haven't even been briefed on it. As far as I know, we haven't been briefed on that litigation . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. But I just want to know, I mean, what shape is the Serrenti Center in and what shape is the Novembrino Splash Pad in because those are city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 assets. Also, with regard to the changes I saw that you made to the proposed budget for 2024, I just have some basic comments . And one is that the current administration , there seems to have been almost a revolving door in terms of department heads. A lot of people pass through the doors of City Hall in the last three, four years. Yet you see a lot of proposed pay raises for those department heads. And my only comment is, I think pay raises are appropriate , not just for recruiting retention , but in recognition for performance and achievements and accomplishments . And considering the number of people that have come and gone, I'm not sure that major pay raises are justified . So I hope you keep that in mind because we'll see the same thing next year. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Joan. Cara Kennedy Ware. MS. WARE: Good evening , Scranton City Council . My name is Cara Kennedy Ware, local school administrator , resident and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 taxpayer . I come forward this evening with a sense of urgency as an advocate for all students residing in the Green Ridge section of Scranton . Over the past few months our neighborhood community has seen a rash of violent crime including carjackings , burglaries , reports of gunshots , vandalism and an incident where a local neighbor was beaten as she was trying to enter her home with her children in tow. As a lifelong resident of the neighborhood , I remember in the mid1990s the city deemed it no longer necessary to assign a car in Green Ridge due to low crime. Fast forward to 2023, that is no longer the case. We, the local residents of the neighborhood deserve to have this service that is funded by our taxes. As you are aware, when in the business of education , you are also in the business of marketing not only your school's programming but also the neighborhood where the schools reside. Prospective families that are looking to relocate to Scranton look at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 overall quality of life, safety, good housing stock, schools , parks, libraries and the ability to safely traverse within a community . Ensuring a police presence in the Green Ridge community will solidify your commitment to its residents . I appreciate your attention and support in this matter. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Ware. Christina Kennedy Donato. MS. DONATO: Good evening . I am here on behalf of the parents of the school that my son goes to St. Clare's, St. Paul's School. And I'm wondering how we designate the St. Clare's, St. Paul's School campus as a school zone. I have been in contact with the Mayor about getting crosswalks painted and designating it as a school zone. I have received confirmation from the Mayor and I was informed that crosswalks were painted in the 1600 block going into the 1500 block of Penn Avenue crossing over to Green Ridge. But that is not enough. My nine year-old-son along with many other student s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 walk to and from school every day. The crossing guard is there for approximately 15 to 20 minutes . She's a 75-year-old lady with no signage designating that area as a school zone. So she goes out with a stop sign and a prayer hoping that the cars are going to cross. I've been informed by my son and by other students that the cars are not stopping . They are slowing down and skimming by the students as they cross. This is not acceptable . So I'm here today to ask how Council can assist in designating this campus -- both of these campuses actually as a school zone so we could have the proper signage that designates speed limit and that allows traffic to understand they are coming up on a school zone that they are not just stopping at one particular crosswalk because both sides of the campus have to be designated . It needs more than one crosswalk because the student s are coming from more than one area. So I'm wondering and I'm asking you tonight how do we proceed ? How do we move forward with this? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. KING: I will contact the Chief. I've been in contact with the principal Mrs. Ware twice this week. And I have been on the phone with our police chief. I spoke to the Mayor this afternoon about these concerns . So I just took down some notes concern ing the -- it's the first time I heard -- asked for a designation as a school zone. So we'll look into seeing what needs to happen to make that happen. And believe me, it will be a priority . MS. DONATO: Because when I look -- thank you. I appreciate that because when I look at the University of Scranton and I look at Mulberry Street, that should be the standard . I feel that that is -- it's good enough for the University of Scranton , it should be good enough for the taxpayer s and the student s who walk to school on a daily basis. It definitely should be a standard and I'm asking for your support and your help in this matter. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you very much, Mrs. Donato. Mary Dempsey -- Judge Mary Dempsey . No, okay, Mary Dempsey .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MS. DEMPSEY : Mary Dempsey . Good evening , everyone . My name is Mary Dempsey . I'm here as a resident and taxpayer . I would like to make it clear I'm not here in any professional capacity whatsoever . I'm just here as a lifelong resident of the city and someone who immensely cares for it. I own my own home in Green Ridge for 28 years. And I was raised there before by my parents for most of my life. I'm one of the people, who with all due respect , has a choice where to live. I could choose to live outside the city. I could choose -- I choose not to. I care too much about the city. I've tried to do everything I can to make it better. I have one adult child who already bought a home three blocks away from me in Green Ridge. I have another adult child renting a home out there who wants to buy a home and steady reliable taxpayers to our tax base. I would also like to make it very clear to each of you tonight who I know and respect . Nothing here is adversarial . This is nothing more than a passionate plea by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 residents of the Green Ridge neighborhood to request a patrol car out in our neighborhood . I respect the police in Scranton very much. The few times I had needed them when my alarm went off mistakenly , they were very quick to respond and very kind and they were very respectful . I think many of you are familiar with our neighborhood . We house Marywood College . We house many nursing homes. We have two amazing grade schools . Principal Ware already spoke. And we have Robert Morris as well. We have churches . We have restaurant s. We have retail stores. We have two distinct business districts . We have the Green Ridge Corners and we have the other area over by Marion Street and Capouse Avenue with Nearra's Pizza, Nada and Company . There's a yoga studio and, of course, Zummo's coffee shop, and I believe there's a barber shop. This is exactly where the carjacking took place. For the most part, we're educated homeowners , okay, we have car alarms. We have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Ring doorbell s. We have extensive lighting . We keep it on at night. We have outdoor video cameras. We know to report incident s to the police so they have a record of it. And we know our neighbor s because it's a generation al neighborhood . We were raised there and we buy homes there. We but times are changing and we now need a patrol car to hopefully act as a deterrent and to hopefully pick up any suspicious activity before it becomes a crime. Now only from talking to my fellow neighbor s and only from reading the newspaper have I learned that we had five to six car thefts in about the last 60 to 90 days in a five to six block radius. I know that out on the end of North Washington Avenue by Marywood College , there's been blue paintball guns sprayed on white cars costing property damage and obviously the remedial cost to our homeowners . I know that there is an alleged drug house in the neighborhood that people have been talking about. I know that two weeks ago in the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 intersection of Wyoming and Delaware a neighbor was awakened to the sound of gunshot s. And I know when the cops came to investigate , only from what the neighbor told me, no other information , they did find the case shells. But I have no further information on that. I know about four weeks ago in the 1600 block Penn, one block away from Principal Ware's school and five blocks away Robert Morris School, a family member of mine who owns a home there called me and said there is about 10 police cars here right now. It was 10 at night. He was told that night by someone on the scene that there was an arrest and two guns were found in the 1600 of Penn. Something is changing and it is frightening . In fact, it's downright dangerous unless we do believe and we ask that a police presence must commence again after a long, long hiatus. If you allow me to act nostalgic for one minute, in the old days when I was being raised police cars were around all the time. You and your parents knew who the police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 officer was. We'd see them getting a Hank's hoagie. We'd see them at the Green Ridge Diner. If we were playing a kickball game, the truth be told, they'd stop and say, hey, what's the score? And if it was a good day, they'd take a kick for us. When I was raising my kids -- I'm taking you back a couple decades now. We had foot patrol. I do believe it was funded by a grant. And we also had a bike patrol for a couple summers . I do believe that was funded by a grant. But they stopped . And they talked to us and they heard our concern s and gave little gold badges to the kids and they created trust with our children and our residents . It also created a community policing environment and more important hopefully acted as a deterrent to future violent crime. I have to think that when criminals are staking or stalking out a neighborhood , if they see a police presence , it does act as a deterrent of sorts. To the other resident s of the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251520 and all other neighborhood s, we're in this together . I have to think that other areas of the city are manned with patrol cars, West Side, North Scranton , the Hill, South Side, Downtown , Keyser Avenue. So the question becomes why do we not have the same available services provided especially now that there was an article in the Scranton Times saying that our community is being targeted , the exact word. We were put on notice to be quite frank with you. I'm a pragmatic woman. I understand the allocation of resources . But I also understand the concept of quality and fundamental fairness for all. I'm here only to make an impassioned plea to you on behalf of myself that please, please consider a patrol car in Green Ridge before something tremendously tragic occurs. Thank you all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mary. Nancy Barrasse Soliman . MS. BARRASSE : Thank you. Nancy Barrasse Soliman , I live out in Green Ridge. I live on Olyphant Avenue. And I love the City of Scranton . I made a choice to come back here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251521 and to practice law here. I was a solicitor for the City of Scranton . I bought a home in the city. I bought another property . I bought another property and I bought another property . And I take care of my parents ' property which is two doors away from me. And now I have another property that I inherit ed in the City of Scranton . I don't want to sell those properties and move out of the city. It's a great town. Raising my son across the street from the Green Ridge Little League, it was a dream. He could walk over to the little league. He could walk up to St. Clare's to school. We could go to church. We could walk everywhere . It was never an issue. He could walk over to my parents' home that is only two doors away. And we didn't have fear anything . Now we have a fear. When my son was growing up we had a police officer that lived next door. He still lives next door. He's retired. I loved when he parked his car in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251522 his driveway . I used to tell my son he's coming for you. I truly believe that police presence , police cars are a deterrent . Our neighborhood is very diverse . We have people from all different cultures who all want the same thing. I have tenants who are moving out of a property . And I was very disappoint ed because they are wonderful tenants . They decided to stay because their son said he felt safe in Green Ridge. He didn't want to move to another neighborhood in Scranton . They don't feel the same way now. We had a neighbor who had a break-in in a car three weeks ago on Boulevard Avenue. It's right around the corner from my home. I would ask that you consider having some resources in the Green Ridge area. It's shocking when I hear now of all these break-ins. I'm concerned about whether or not, not only, well, the tenants not want to stay there but our property values will go down. When our property values go down, there's more stress on the city because your tax base is going to go down.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251523 And people who feel passionate about the city maybe they didn't run for office like you did, but they continue to stay in the city. I've noticed in our neighborhood we have a car that drives around every single week checking on quality of life in the city. They measure the grass height in the yards in the summer and you get a citation for $100 if your grass is higher than 8 inches. I would ask that we have a police patrol car going through to make sure there is no crime. Maybe we put a little more emphasis on that rather than the height of the grass. I see Officer Manning here tonight . I thought it's ironic that we're coming here to ask for an increase d police presence . I think we all feel safe in here. And I think I would have felt safe without a officer being present . But the fact that we have an officer present for a Council meeting I think we should have officers that are present in our neighborhood in Green Ridge. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Nancy. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251524 Council , Les Spindler , Scranton resident , homeowner . Joan mentioned the splash -- the Novembrino Splash Pad. I happened to drive by this Sunday and beautiful -- the playground is there too and the gate was wide open. And I heard it was open all weekend . There is no reason why that gate should be open all weekend . They should close it at least at night. There is always vandalism in this area. To have that brand new playground with the gate wide open all weekend , I don't think that is right. So -- MR. KING: Didn't we check on that, Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : That was sent out. MR. MCANDREW : I'll report out in Fifth. I asked about that last week and I got a response . So I'll do it in Fifth Order. MR. SPINDLER : Okay, next thing, Council , as I've spoken about this before, Bob Bolus presented an Israeli flag for the city and it hasn't been put up. And I wrote a letter to the editor and that wasn't put in the paper. I'm being ignored by everybody . So I'm going to read the letter that I sent to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251525 Times-Tribune now. "Recently Scranton businessman Bob Bolus presented Scranton City Council with the flags of Israel and Ukraine to raise on the flagpole to show support of the wars they are involved in. Two weeks passed and the flags were not displayed. I talked to Mayor Cognetti and asked her why the flags were not displayed . She said Ukraine flag was displayed when they were first attacked . I asked her why not the flag of Israel. Her answer was it is a sensitive situation . Being a person of the Jewish faith I was not happy with her answer. I said Israel was attacked without provocation and our city which has many Jewish residents should show support for Israel. In the past the city has flown flags of other countries but won't fly the flag of Israel. And I'm asking everyone in our community who supports Israel to call Mayor Cognetti and ask her to fly the flag of Israel because it's the right thing to do." And I think the Times-Tribune and Mayor Cognetti are both disrespecting the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251526 Jewish people of this city. I think it's wrong. And I hope they all remember when election day comes around when the Mayor wants to run again because I know I won't forget it. Next thing about the budget, I see you are probably going to pass it tonight . I'm glad to see that you lowered property from 3 and a half to 2 percent . But I'm not happy that you are going to okay the raises for the nonunion employees . I don't think people should be getting raises when citizens ' taxes are being raised all the time. I think that's wrong. And you shouldn 't vote for that. Lastly, I was happy to hear that City Council along with the city and now I heard you are getting in touch with Dunmore and to send a letter to the PUC about the outrageous water rate hike with Pennsylvania American Water. MR. KING: We're also going to attend a hearing . And we're going to be request ing that hearing be held here in Scranton as well. We're going to try to attend one in Harrisburg and have one here, Les. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251527 MR. SPINDLER : Okay. And you mention ed about the citizens filing complaint s. Do you know how we go about that yet or is that still in the works? MR. KING: That's going to be announced shortly . That's being coordinate d by Senator Flynn's office along with State Reps Kosierowski , Donahue and Kyle Mullins. MR. SPINDLER : I'll definitely file a complaint . I'm sure many, many other people will because the utilities are out of control . I said it for years. And I hope something is done. MR. KING: It's my understanding , Les, that they may be setting an office up across the street from the City Hall. And they're going to have the forms available for people to file formal complaints . I think we're looking to get 500 signature s -- 500 people to complain at least so that we could, you know, try to stop this outrageous increases . MR. SPINDLER : I think you'll get more than that. I hope so anyway. MR. KING: That would be great.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251528 MR. SPINDLER : All right. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Les. Laura Augustini . MS. AUGUSTINI : Good evening . I'm Laura Augustini I'm a resident of Green Ridge, Scranton as well as President of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . The last time I was here it was about a couple different things. And I just wanted to let you know that I did have a very good conversation with Scott Gassenmeyer that same week. We met over at Pretzel Park and he explain ed a lot of things to me. I think it was a good dialogue for both of us so that we increase d the communication . And I think there was a lot going on that week which kind of led to some of the miscommunication . But I just wanted to let you know that he did follow through on that and I appreciate d it. To address one of the issues that many of the Green Ridge neighborhood residents are here about is with regard to the police 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251529 presence or lack thereof in the neighborhood of Green Ridge. I know that we're not in a qualified census track and so we don't qualify for many federal funds or ARPA funds or anything like that. But we do pay a disproportionate percentage of the taxes in the City of Scranton of the property taxes. And I would request that some of those taxes that we pay be actually used to fund a car to patrol Green Ridge. It's -- the city can't afford for the property values in Green Ridge to decrease because as go the property value and taxes in Green Ridge, so goes the city. That is something that's been evident for a long time. The amount of taxes or at least the percentage of taxes that Green Ridge pays funds a lot of different things. And we'd like some of that money to be spent in Green Ridge rather than elsewhere . We know that we're being targeted as Mary Dempsey said because of the type of neighborhood we have. And we're really concerned as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251530 neighborhood association and as the residents about what could potentially happen in Green Ridge. It's a walkable area. It's always been a walkable area. We have parks. We have the business district s. Kids are all over the place. And also, we have many elderly residents . People are ageing in their homes. They're staying there longer and longer because of the neighborhood that it is. And so there is some concern about what could potentially happen, you know, if somebody sees a vulnerable area or vulnerable property or home that we could be looking not just at burglaries but potentially home invasions and things of that nature, which is very scarey to us. So I respect fully request that you look into it to see about having our taxes pay for our police protection . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Laura, you still have a couple minutes left. As Chairman on the Committee on Public Safety, during Fifth Order tonight I'll make a motion to bring back the patrol car. All right? MS. AUGUSTINI : I would appreciate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251531 that. I'm meeting with the Chief and with the Mayor next week to discuss this. So I would appreciate it being followed up on. Since my e-mail to a couple of different people, we have seen the police presence increase in Green Ridge. And we greatly appreciate those drive-bys and that we have more of a police presence . But I need it to be not just when I send an e-mail. I need it to be on a regular basis that this is something that, you know, that the car comes back, not that we're depending on North Scranton to come do a drive-by, you know, when resources are available . Well, I think we need to make the resources available to Green Ridge because we're seeing that it's becoming a problem . And we just don't want it to get any worse. Thank you. MR. KING: My conversation with the Chief yesterday I emphasized that to him as well. And it seems like they're very receptive to increasing the patrols in the Green Ridge area. We'll push for it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251532 MS. AUGUSTINI : Thank you very much. I do appreciate all of what you are doing and the communication that we're getting . I did hear from the Chief. Unfortunately , I think it was a little bit of a lip service . But, you know, we look forward to having more of a police presence . MR. KING: Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . I'd like to mention this obscenity about the tax increasing . They can't hide it no more. They can't conceal it like they've been doing, those that support it. You know, never in memory has Scranton allowed such a miserable wretched untrustworthy -- to oversee the city. Now the taxpayers have to suffer some more indignities after all of these lies from Wayne Evans and everybody else that promoted it. There wouldn't be any tax increase . I stood here two years ago. I'm the bad guy for arguing with everybody . I don't know if everybody read the short article in the paper today. But instead of being 20 percent increase they want to give -- the county wants 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251533 to allow some breathing room. Everybody 's property is going downhill . Like, there must be 10 years ago the values of the houses started declining. When I bought my house in '94 my neighborhood was really -- it was it. Now it's like a slum around there full of rentals , cars on the sidewalks , broken down cars in driveways . And your code enforcement doesn't see a thing wrong. He could go by my house 70 miles an hour and see a case of water sitting on a lawn chair that they gave me tickets for. But they don't see a broken down car in my backyard on Throop Street that's been there for over five years, two broken down cars, a school bus that doesn't run in the driveway . But he's worried about a case of water in my yard and like the lady said measuring your lawns. Somebody went in my garage last week. They took a little battery charger , 100 foot cord that you use to cut the hedge and five gallon can of gasoline , big plastic thing. Twenty-five years I've never had nobody do anything like that. That's how bad 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251534 my neighborhood 's gotten. And look at the house values. Gerard Cross said years ago the house values are dropping and dropping . The value of the city was off a couple million dollars . And all we get when you turn around this one going up. This one is going up. The school board wants to go up 8 percent . It doesn't stop. And then like it was said tonight , bonuses and raises for people that just don't deserve them. You have no respect for the taxpayers that are paying for everything . And when I talk to them, nobody votes. I just don't know what the apathy is. Well, it's a shame. It's a shame. The city's been allowed the past few years such poor people downstairs in the -- that oversee the city. You know, I don't -- I don't make no secret of it. Almost everything I come forth with I hear at the grocery store at Gerrity 's or the Dollar Store somebody will say things. This is a little letter I'm going to give you about somebody -- they want to know about these junky 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251535 electric cars where they're parked. It's a good question . Now there is jeeps aren't suppose d to be inside either. I'd like to know where they parked. I asked you a couple weeks ago -- two weeks ago. Nobody seemed to be interested . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. You know, the first thing I'd like to say here is that I really appreciate ECTV finally responding to my complaint in Federal Court. And I would like to thank Haggerty , Hinton, and Cosgrove for joining the party. And I really look forward to meeting Mr. Hinton when the hearings begin. But also I'd like to say that Les got up here and spoke about the flag that Mr. Bolus presented to the city. You know, it's the most amazing thing that as Americans , all my life we were taught to respect human rights and stand up for the underdog. And when you listen to the reports from the hostage s that were release d from Hamas and the crimes that took place on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251536 ground, you know, the media isn't really covering it. But Fox News is and Sky News and the rest of the world is. And when you got small children being raped and their hips broken and you're having women raped and shot in the street and then you've got a Mayor who can't seem to understand that this isn't a Jewish problem . It isn't an Israeli problem . It's a human rights problem . But as Americans , we've just given up on all that because we have the wrong man in the White House. We also have the wrong person down in the Mayor's office. And, you know, when you look at what's taking place in this world and the apathy here on the part of Council , instead of presenting an argument to the Mayor of why that flag should fly, you just sit there. The people have come here. They've discussed this issue. You've seen it. The Mayor's seen it. But you know the problem we have, the President of the United States doesn't support it, okay. He's done so much harm to us and to the Israelis it's amazing .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251537 And you know what I wonder? I wonder what's happening to our nine American s that are hostages of Hamas and what cruelties they are enduring because we have a president who doesn't bring that up. And, you know, to move onto a different subject , today we're listening about the problem s in Green Ridge. And, you know, when I remember my childhood , this city was much different . This city over a protracted period of time has elected failed leadership . And, you know, I think that Chris Doherty really sped the decline of the city up by his incompetence in office. And we've had just terrible councils . And one police car in Green Ridge isn't going to do a thing because the people driving around stealing everything , they see where the victims are. They take their time in picking who they're going to rob. One police car, that's a nice thing to send up. It makes people feel good. But it doesn't change the reality that America is rapidly becoming a third world country . All the cities are ringed by homeless people.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251538 We're being overrun by migrant s from other countries who walked across our border. We have incompetent government on every level. And it's just for people to come here and think that, well, to finally open their eyes and see that we're in trouble here. You know after 30 years of distress , you've got to ask yourself did everybody stick their head under a pillow or what? I mean, what did they do? When you take a look at ECTV it's a propaganda channel . There's no public access to it. These people can't go on ECTV and talk about any issue unless the Council , the Mayor or the government , you know, Scranton decides it's acceptable. There is no free discussion of ideas here. The only answer for this city is to rewrite the charter and change the way this city function s. And if it's necessary to remove the Council completely , so be it. If it's time to hire a business manager to run the city, so be it. If decisions should be made by neighborhood groups and passed onto a business manager to run the city, then that's what we need to do. But this decline cannot continue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251539 forever . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. MCGRATH : Good evening , Council . My name is Harry McGrath . I am a resident of the Green Ridge section of the City of Scranton . I'm just here to echo some of comments from my fellow neighbors earlier today. My wife Stephanie and I made a decision to purchase a home in Green Ridge and raise our four children there. And I think that the request to increase the police presence there is just good government and it's common sense. One of the great things about living in that neighborhood is that there is a lot of young families that have made a decision to come back there. And when you drive up and down the street during the day, you could see any number of kids playing in the front yard having a, you know, just nice childhood frankly . And the recent rash and the recent crime wave that we've seen has been particularly unsettling given that it's happening , you know, in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251540 really brazen fashion . There are cars being stolen out of people's driveway s. You know, there's obvious ly the carjacking at gun point that occurred right in front of Zummo's. And these are just not the kind of things that had occurred over, you know, the last several decades or maybe ever in the neighborhood . And I think that the city is lucky to have Green Ridge as a place where people could be proud to raise their family. And I think that allocating , you know, resources there is good investment for the city. And, you know, all of the other great points that were made earlier I won't reiterate , but I just want to go on record and just voice my support for that to be implement ed. So thank you and I hope you guys could make that happen. Appreciate it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McGrath . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOHERTY : Thank you, Council , for letting me speak. I'm Attorney Jim Doherty . And I'm also a resident of Green 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251541 Ridge. And I just want to give you my own personal input on why I think it's so important that we get increase d police protection and also if we could get increase d traffic control devices around or are near St. Paul's School. My wife's car was one of the ones that were carjacked. And they took it right in front of my son's house. We had it on videotape . As Harry said it was the most brazen thing I've ver seen. Two guys just walk right by the car and walked back again. And because she had -- the car was unlocked because she's in my son's house all the time in and out, they were able to observe that the outside mirrors were open and that told them that the car was unlocked . They jumped in the car. Two seconds later my son pulls into the driveway with one of his children . Now, my wife was in the house -- his house with one of his other children . As soon as he went down the driveway , they jumped the curb and took off and went down Delaware Street. A second after that I pulled in the driveway with my son's other son because we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251542 were going to have dinner that night. So within a five second period at 6:02 on a Monday evening they grabbed that car. And I will tell you this. The police -- we didn't know about it because we had dinner. My wife sends me home and then she was taking care of the house and she called around 9:00 and said where's the car? I said, well, I thought you walked up because we only live a half block away. We called the police. They were fantastic . And we were able to see on my son's cameras at 6:02 they stole it. And the particular officer , Officer Gilmartin who was fantastic took all the information , was pushing to try and see if they could track it. He said in all likely hood, it's part of a gang. It's probably in Newark. He called later that evening and said they got a hit on my wife's license plate and the hit was from Newark, New Jersey at 8:30. The car is stolen at 6:02. It's in Newark, New Jersey at 8:00 that evening . And they did it without any hesitation and without any fear. And then two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251543 and a half days later they robbed at gun point down across from Zummo's a gentleman 's car. And they had been walking in the parking lot of St. Paul's because St. Paul's had an event. There were cars there. Now, think of that. That's 200 children and their parents and kids there. Had they come out, what would have happened? And those two folks had guns. Now, when -- they were arrested because the cell phone was left in that car. And the police again did a fantastic job and with the State Police of Pennsylvania and the New Jersey State Police, they were able to get them. They've admitted to that crime. They've admitted to stealing my wife's car and they've admitted to stealing other cars over a four-month period. But the concern that everybody has is obviously police protection . I have no complaints . I thought Chief did a great job. Mr. Gilmartin was fantastic . The Mayor's office has been great. But think about those kids at St. Paul's. What if a parent just came out to leave that event early and saw someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251544 going by their car and confronted them, like, you say, hey, what's going on? And they pulled a gun at a little kid. So I would like to also encourage the entire city administration . And again, I have no complaint s. I think everybody 's been doing a fantastic job helping us. But I do, I think we need more protect ion. And I think we need more help down by St. Paul's because of the different traffic of people there. And if you are not a resident of Scranton or maybe a resident of Green Ridge, and you're travelling Green Ridge Street, you don't realize there's a school half block off Green Ridge Street where 200 kids are going in and out and there's parking on both sides. So if there is any way there could be an evaluation as to whether we could have move traffic control devices that would alert drivers that, hey, there's a school there. And because as all drivers are, you're going up that Green Ridge Street and there is three or four blocks between lights, you could end up, you know, going a little too fast for conditions and a child could dart out between 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251545 the car and there could be something unfortunate . So thank you for giving me the time and I do appreciate all the help you guys are doing. And I know it's a tough job you have. One personal thing I'd like to say. I want to congratulate Attorney Sean Gallagher because I assume this is his last meeting . He's going to be a judge and he's going continue serving the people well. MR. KING: We're going to put him to work for one more week, Attorney Doherty . Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Ron brought up and I'd actually keyed something off in my brain. The government needs more breathing room. We heard that from the county that they need more money because they don't have enough buffer that's recommended for the government to actually have. It's kind of amazing when the city needs more breathing room when the citizens are fighting for their last breath. The city needs more breathing room to operate as people are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251546 trying to hold onto their last dollar to feed themselves to pay the bills and to keep themselves in the home from not being homeless on railroad tracks because we know how much homeless is approved of. I think we have a problem with too much breathing room when the citizens cannot financially operate themselves . In those times city government , county government gets breathing room by tightening its belt reducing expenses and looking to where it can cut just as the citizens in the city and county have to cut to make that budget align because unlike bodies who could just tax more, they can't just say, I'm going to increase the amount of money I make by whatever I wish to by fiat because their budget doesn't change. The amount coming in, they can't say I want you to pay me 4 to 50 percent more just so I could be comfortable and make a little bit of bank room myself. In the review of the changes , I see that there isn't any -- there's budget cuts but there's nothing about the cuts for all of those budget increase s from the employee raises for administration from 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251547 percent to 50 percent in this budget. Seems that the raises are flowing through without opposition . And in that, I would like when that comes up that maybe one of the Council members could put a motion to put a pay freeze on non -- for all the administrative nonunion jobs so we could actually physically see as it gets voted down who approves of this and who doesn't rather than a behind the doors conversation of, well, we'll just let this pass. It would be nice to see it physically put on record on who thinks that everyone should deserve more money while the people in the City of Scranton are starving . The HUP test is in Eighth Order. I understand I brought forward that there was room for bargaining that was put in the document itself. But we've been waiting for feedback on that. And I'm concerned that the HUP test is going to stay in Eighth Order and dissolve away even though it's critical to this body. MR. KING: We're moving it out of Eighth Order next week and we're going to vote on it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251548 MR. COYNE: Awesome . Thank you very much. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, Mr. Coyne, President King did speak with the administration and there was a reduction from negotiations . MR. COYNE: Thank you. And last, tax forgiveness . We've talked about tax forgiveness from the impacted communities . I don't see anything before this board yet. MR. KING: We're getting very close to finalizing that. MR. COYNE: It's been September 9th and you've had two months to get very close and move forward and go forward . MR. KING: Just keep in mind we had to determine which homes were actually going to be condemned . So that took several months before we could determine who we're going to provide that tax relief to. MR. COYNE: Maybe you just need to do it on a limit of 25 percent damage or 25 percent impact rather than go and saying that to qualify you have to have lost everything . Maybe the human thing to do is to base it on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251549 the percentage of damage like I said last week doubled up to 50 percent . At 50 percent or more you get 100 percent tax relief for that year. If you have 10 percent , you get 20 percent . Everyone who is impacted with it deserves a slice of care and comfort . And unfortunately for this holiday season, it's dragging along towards the end of the year. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . While we're on the subject of tax relief, you know, it popped into my head last week how about if we explore tax relief for victims of fire? You know, not every house burns down every week. But it is pretty troubling when you get somebody walks up to you at work and tells you, oh, your house is on fire, you know? It happened to me 23 years ago. And it wasn't a fun winter going over there and trying to retrieve my belongings . I didn't have any property taxes due on the house. But I could only imagine what some people go through . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251550 Okay. I would say we should look into somebody said a week or two ago about a shortage on the police force. So if that's the problem it should be looked into and we can handle that later. And the water, I find it very egregious that they don't plan on having a hearing in Scranton . I was at one years ago and our two representa tives that were concerned with Scranton at the time were objecting to the rates. But they weren't objecting to what this business of paying for sewage plants outside the city and the fact that our money was going to be contributing to this for outlying areas and who knows where. Certainly everybody wants clean water and clean water is best started at the source. But that bill is totally egregious . My bill is 250 percent of what it was maybe 10 years ago. So, I mean, that's outrageous . And it is a necessity . And if an inspector came by and said, oh, Mr. Dobrzyn , you don't have water. Oh, well, he could put a condemned sticker on my house until I got whatever was wrong with the water supply corrected . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251551 So it's really important that we not have these utilities just gouging and tearing the town down around us. It's -- too many people are winding up on porchville for vacation . And all they could do and is sit there and wish they could pay their bills. And once again on taxes, now, I am not proposing that tax exempts pay taxes. What I'm proposing is that because the state constitution requires us to accept these entities irregardless and we have no recourse on it, we could only ask them for a pilot. And that's a pittance of what the taxes would be. One institution , I was at a school board meeting and Chris Phillips spoke. He's no longer in town here. And according to him from 1992 to about 2009 or 2011, that entity would have paid 29 million dollars to the school. So, I mean, the amount of money is just flabber gasting. I'm proposing that the state be barred forever more unless they want to replace the taxes that they could no longer do this to just push all of the tax exempts into one area and expect -- because that's where we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251552 are at. I mean, the police force and stuff like that, all of that costs money. And, you know, put a policeman on the street in a car and everything else, I mean, it has to be 120 grand a year even for a startup guy or a lady. So thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn , you too. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hello Council , Rick Little of Scranton . It seems like everything is going to hell and not only around here but all over the world. And you hear about this thing called woke, which is willingly overlooking known evil. There's a lot of fear and law is a business . People are paid very well to enforce laws. But America is supposed to go back to the original documents , the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution . But they don't even teach that in schools anymore. It's all like manipulated pretty much by the media. And it's really communism . I mean, I mean, we're not as bad as California , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251553 Chicago , New York City, Seattle , Portland , there's a great book to read by Andy Ngo{phonetic } about just what happened when all the anarchy happened in all of these places and the shutdown and, you know, now we got, you know, after George Floyd, the guy that was convicted , everybody is watching the Court case thinking they know what's going on. They don't. It's basically the judiciary and media and the devil is in the details. And people should know the details. Everybody says, oh, there's not enough money. But people they usually say that -- they're talking about the federal money. They've got their jobs. They got their people under them who have their jobs. And they are just waiting for the federal money. And this is, you know, I call it a Democrat thing even though I used to be a Democrat . I don't -- I see that as a problem . It's just a basic woke problem that because people are living 50, 60 years in the past. The money is not gone. It's being moved around to different places where people can't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251554 see it. And I think, you know, since the money has been moved around for Electric City TV and they are using it for government , why don't we make a law that Electric City TV, public access TV video the board meeting s of all 11 boards so people could see what's going on. Lots of times I tried to get into those meeting s and they have ways of shutting you out, locking the door. It's the bureaucracy . And when you see these boards, these agencies having TV commercials , everyone knows how much TV commercials cost. And yet, you know, Area Agency on Ageing, Lackawanna Pro Bono, Advocacy Alliance , Women's Resources , political judges and candidates . There's these adds. Who's paying for them. No one knows where the money is coming from. But, you know, they can't have it both ways. And people should have a little bit of transparency of how their government is working . It's just a lot of fear. There's a, like I said, everything is going to hell. You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251555 are watching the news and you're seeing the carjackings , the murders , the property declines . There's a general thing to attack sex, age, race. And behind it is equality and equity, something that I have looked into a lot. It basically changed in 1871 when we went into maritime law. That's why in the family courts you can't raise constitutional issues. And in most courts we're living under maritime law, the federal reserve, off shore bank. We have problems in America and people have to wake up. And this woke thing is willingly overlooking known evil. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. First, I was unaware that Green Ridge did not have a patrol car assigned to it. And I see that Councilman McAndrew is going to make a motion to replace 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251556 the car and whatever else we need to do there. I fully support that. And also the 4 and 500 block, Mr. Voldenberg , of Lackawanna Avenue there are a minimum of 12 streetlights out. And I have people that have called multiple times to have them repaired. I don't know if because we're going to be working on that street in the future we're not repairing them. But it's an unsafe condition . So if you could send that to -- I believe it's Director Pietreface if we could send that to him. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: And also, one other thing to send to code enforce ment. I call them phone tents. I see them around town now. Someone told me they hand out phones for free. I find that hard to believe , but nothing is free that I've ever seen. But are they a business ? Can we find out if they are a business ? If they hand out phones for free but are they selling internet access? If they are selling internet access, they certainly are not a nonprofit. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251557 believe they're a business . So if we can find out if they are. If they are, they need to be licensed and pay taxes like everyone else. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look it tomorrow , sir. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. And now the budget. I have few comment s on the budget. I did meet with Council President King to discuss this. We met a week or so ago and discussed a lot of the jobs and the cuts and stuff. But the increases that we must pay first due to all the contractual obligations , our Scranton Police Department is getting 3 percent raise actually this year and 3.5 percent 2024. Fire Department is 2 percent this year and 2.5 percent in 2024; DPW, 3.5 percent . Single Tax Office, 5 percent ; and our MMO is going up by 3.1 million dollars . The clerical union, the contract is up. I'm assuming there is going to be raises there also. So I expect increases . But when we went over the budget, we did not cut any jobs. A lot of the pay raises 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251558 were decreased. I'm not happy with that. But I won't eliminate raises for nonunion residents and people that work for the time City of Scranton while handing out raises to everyone else. I don't think that is fair to them. I don't think it's fair to anybody that gets up and goes to work every day for the City of Scranton to be denied a raise while everybody in the union gets a raise. So the reason I mention all of that is because if -- we got to pay for all of these jobs. And if we do not do a minimum tax increase every year, every other year, it seems that we may run into the future what we have run into in the past where my tax bills pretty much doubled . That's because we borrowed money to pay. We pay interest on borrowing money. We pay money just to pay for these loans to get these loans. So I don't believe that by not raising taxes is the right thing to do. I think we need that to keep us balanced . And that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251559 MR. SCHUSTER : I will keep my budget comments to on the question . We'll be voting on that tonight . So as Mr. Smurl did, my comment s on the budget I'll save for on the question . And I'm going to more so focus on this tonight . But two comment s here in Fifth Order, one was Mr. McAndrew if he makes a motion to add the police presence to Green Ridge I will be supporting him in that. And things I heard tonight , I grew up in Tripp Park as a child. And the neighborhood that you described is the neighborhood that I grew up in. And I've seen the crime that's coming across our city. I've seen shooting s on Hawthorne Street where I grew up. I think last year we had a shooting or murder in the city every month of the year. So crime is raising across the city. But budgetarily , I wish that there was more in the budget that was going for crime prevention and getting more presence on the streets . The second thing for Fifth Order is last night the Scranton Housing Authority , they had the opportunity -- it was brought up in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251560 public comment tonight about fund relief for the flood victims . There was some unrestricted funds that they could have utilized for flood victims last night and they chose to vote this down. I think it failed on a 2-2 vote. And I would just like to say I was disappoint ed to see that those funds couldn't be utilize d for flood victims. That is all I have tonight for Fifth Order. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few things. First, I definitely want to voice my support as well for there to be a patrol car in Green Ridge, especially with what's been going on and to prevent additional car thefts or highjacking or even an escalation of the crime that we're seeing there now. And I also wanted to bring up an update that I had seen today from our Scranton DPW and this is in reference to the flooding over on in Keyser Valley and we've had many resident s come to discuss that before especial ly the 24 inch pipe that there's been a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251561 particular issue with. And so today they got to work on it. They said exposed and are jetting to open it up, clean the debris from this 24 inch pipe; and they are hoping to have the pipe flowing before Christmas . So that would be really welcome d news for the residents there. I was really happy to see that that work is being done. And there is one additional thing that I wanted to bring up from some of the comment s in Citizens Participation . I've made this -- I thought I made this clear in the past and just wanted to reiterate again my support for Israel. I think I'm maybe the only Council member up here that could say that their blood is of Ashkenazi Jew. And some of the things that are happening there have, you know, I feel like affected me. And it's been on my mind a lot as well. And I would be supportive of us having the flag in front of the city too. So I know that's the Mayor's decision as to whether or not she wants to fly it. But I would, you know, just like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251562 be on the record that I would be in support of having that up there. And it's not that I'm anti Palestine . But I am anti Hamas and anti terrorism and pro human rights. So that's -- that's where I stand. Thank you. And I also hope that -- I don't think other Council members have spoken on it so, you know, if others feel strongly about that that we should have the flag in front of City Hall, I'd encourage them to do so. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So I have a couple things. I want to report out concern s that I brought forward last week. The Meadow Avenue traffic study because of concerns with the hotel, it's on review by the city engineer , DPW, and SPD. Also, the Blair Avenue issue with the house, the rear of 111 Blair Avenue is condemned . It's on the demolition list. But, you know, there's a rodent issue. There's windows open. The cellar doors are open. So my understand ing is we're still waiting on a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251563 response from that. And then also Mr. Spindler brought up which I brought up last week regarding the Novembrino gate being left open at night. So we're still awaiting a response from Parks and Recs, confirmation to ensure that Novembrino park gate is locked at dusk and a resolution for the Weston Field open window and fan during the day, which is beyond me. So we're still waiting on the answers for that. But I do have some answers . So the crosswalks , Miss Augustini, you were asking about let's get the list for next year. Let's see, you know -- so I did get the list. And I think they should be put on the website or at least you get a copy or on the website so everybody has a copy. I'm not going to go through the list of them. But I would like to see them -- but in addition to the crosswalk s that are on the list which Mr. Voldenberg will get to you and get the website , let's add the school zone that was spoke of tonight at St. Clare's, all right. Make that part of next year's crosswalks . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251564 added. MR. MCANDREW : Send that over. What else was -- so last week I also asked about the leaves that are piling up on mountain -- Yesu Lane. They've doubled since last week. We didn't get a response , right? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Right. And, you know, this is a concerned resident . And, you know, what, she was right. Like I said, residents are mostly right all the time. She said the leaves have doubled . We had beautiful weather in past week. Why weren't they vacuumed up? She said now they appear to come from the firehouse all the way down to Yesu Lane. So could you circle around and get some type of answer? We got a vac truck, spent a ton of money on it. All right. So in addition to that because we had some other people about leaf bag pickup issues that, you know, I put them out. They weren't picked up. I drove them myself, not meaning me, the resident , which was ridiculous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251565 over to DPW. So we reached out to Mr. Pietreface the Director . And what I'm happy to report out is this is an updated schedule . I only have for December . But the leaf bag pickup will follow recycling schedule is 12/4 through 12/8 and 12/18 through 12/22. And that means, you know, when your cardboard goes out so do the leaves. So let's hope they stay on track with this pickup. And then what else, last -- lastly, so not less than three weeks ago we had the departments in present ing their budgets and defending their, you know, their proposal s. And, you know, the police department was here obvious ly, you know, presenting his. And before it was over if there was any questions , I brought up questions that -- concerns that were brought to me by resident s. And they were either cars being stolen and/or carjacked. And the Chief told me well, you know, there is some cars being stolen, there's these models, these Hundai models that are easily able to steal. Kids are taking joyrides , you know, riding around and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251566 ditching them. But I said, well, you know, what about carjacking , I said, because I hear that it's happening and the outcome s are horrific throughout the country just reading the paper and watching TV. People are dying from carjackings . And he said, oh, that's not here yet. We're not there yet. Well, we were. I understood that we were. And I wish -- because my concern was that the public doesn't know that these aren't joyride rs. There's actually gang members from Newark coming here stealing cars with guns taking them to Newark. They're filing off the VIN numbers or whatever . They're putting them on ship container s and sending them to Africa. I found that out on my own. So that concerned me. So it is happening. And I'm thrilled that Green Ridge is here tonight and voicing their concerns because my concern was if you're not aware -- education awareness , you could walk out of your house and see two kids and think they're teenage rs and shoo them away where they are actually gang 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251567 members from Newark. So that needs to be out there. I'm glad it's out there. I'm glad you're here tonight as a group with your concern because , you know what, you are a target. It's not -- it's not any surprise that they are stealing -- not the joyrider s, the gang members are stealing upscale, you know, upscale cars. And guess where most of them reside in the city? Safe to say it's Green Ridge. It's not a surprise . So I'm thrilled that you came tonight as a force. And, you know, I also didn't know that you didn't have a patrol car. I live in West Side. There's West 1. I'm familiar with it. I didn't know you used to have one and didn't have one. So with that said and I promised as the Chairman of the Committee on Public Safety I will make a motion tonight . I'm going to do that right now. With that said, I'd like to make a motion to reinstate or replace in the Green Ridge section of Scranton a patrol car they once had because of the obvious need that now exists. MR. SCHUSTER : Second.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251568 DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: There's been a motion and a second to reinstate a patrol car in the Green Ridge section of Scranton . On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Thank you, Director McAndrew -- Councilman McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Let's not go back. MR. KING: Okay. So I have a few things. I got an e-mail from a constituent as well about leaves. This poor women waited and called and waited and ultimately she had to pay for a hauler to take the leaves. So I had to send an apologetic e-mail response to her that that happened that she had to experience this. And I forward the information to Scott Pietreface our DPW Director . This has been an issue this year for whatever reason. And I'm hoping that this can be corrected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251569 moving into 2024 because it's a big issue because , you know, this city, it's a beautiful city. We have tons of trees throughout the city and they create tons of leaves. And as Mr. McAndrew or someone -- I think it was Mr. McAndrew indicated during caucus wet leaves are basically the same as ice. You try to stop on wet leaves, you'll slide right through a stop sign. It's dangerous and I just think it's important that we make that a priority to make sure we have leaf -- consistent leaf pickup throughout the city. So I will encourage our DPW to continue to work on improving upon that. A few response s from last, 1024 Maple Street, Mr. Patrick LaFrance 's claim is under review by the Director of Licensing and Inspection . And Mr. LaFrance , we will advise as soon as we get a response back from the LIPS Department . 702, 708 Connell Street, neighbors claim that property owner is operating a painting business on the lot. Council forwarded this information to code enforce ment and to LIPS to investigate . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251570 On Snook Street and Seymour Avenue, this was Marie Schumacher brought this up. Council submitted that concern to DPW Director for review and action to remedy the water runoff issue that's occurring . We know that's part of the stormwater remediation project that's going to happen in the spring. But there's some pretty serious issues right now with that drainage and water runoff coming down Snook Street. So they are working on a solution to resolve that issue for the winter because that will quickly turn to ice. I will speak on the budget when that item comes up for vote later. I do too appreciate the fact that the members of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association have come here this evening just as I appreciated all the neighbors from West Scranton who came here and from North Scranton with their concerns about the flood. That shows that government is working and that the people, you know, have the opportunity to come in here and express their concern s. And then we as elected officials 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251571 are held responsible for trying to ameliorate whatever problems exist for the citizens . It's our job to try to, you know, make the city a better place for all of us to live. The vast majority of us up here were born and raised here in the city. We all care about the city. We all have our families here. We have children , grandchildren , grandparents , brothers , sisters , a long history in the city. And every one of us wants nothing more than to make the City of Scranton a great place to live, a safe place to live, a great place to raise our families and to make sure that we provide the resources necessary to make that happen as well. So I do appreciate everyone coming here. I mean, sometimes people feel like when you come here -- adversarial , that wasn't adversarial . That was doing your job as a citizen and a member of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . And as I said earlier when the people came here for the flooding, we appreciate when you come here and express your concerns because , you know, sometimes there's things going on that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251572 aren't even aware of. So it's important that the citizens come here and make us aware of them so that we could try to take some action to address those issues. So I appreciate that. And that's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

I don't know, Mr. Gallagher , if you would like to expand on that? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, in the body of the agreement that indicate s a service agreement , I would like to know if the service agreement is in addition to the $489,000 or is it included . There is -- in the RFP it indicated it's three years. The payment s for the lease are 3.75. The contract is for five. So if we could just get some clarification on that. And if -- it indicated in the RFP that if they change the scope, that the respond ent will be agreeable to the change and any price adjustment will be made in writing . If you are changing the scope of the agreement , I would think that you would have to reissue the RFP and/or the contract unless it's below the bidding threshold , so just those clarifications . MR.

KING: All those in favor of the amendments signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. KING: The ayes have it. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote of Item 7-B. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251591 tonight I said I would focus on the budget. So first, I would like to commend President King on the 2024 budget. He did make some expenditure cuts over the last few weeks. So what we have here tonight from Council totals about $182,470 of expenditure cuts from the original budget. When I took a look at the budget, I made some suggestion s. I made 29 suggestions for amendments and those suggestions totalled $875,555 in savings which did cover the total tax increase . The areas that I did target were professional service s between two line items. I decreased those by $436,285. Keep in mind last year we had two CBAs that we were negotiating and had arbitration this year. We only have one. The other area I targeted was salaries and new positions . And the third item that I targeted was city entities that didn't utilize their funding from the last two to three years. There was only three of these. They were smaller in number. But they've had line items sitting there for three years that hadn't been utilize d.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251592 And I felt they could have been removed since they hadn't been utilize d. With that said, my target areas were not cutting funds that affected the resident s of the city. So I hope I'm making that clear. They didn't affect the residents of the City of Scranton . Each year on Council I've abided by PEL with the recommendation s. And the concerns I've had were some of PEL's concerns that addition of personnel and additions of legacy costs add to future budget deficits . They've always stated that Scranton expenditure s, expenditure growth outpaces our revenue growth. And this is something that, you know, causes budget deficits down the road. As for the tax increase , I would support a modest annual tax increase . I don't have an issue with that if those increases are benefitting the resident s of the city. I think one thing that was said tonight was the increase of crime in Green Ridge and not only is it happening in Green Ridge, it's happening everywhere . I don't think the budget address es this. What I do see is some new positions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251593 that I feel we've added many positions over the last three years. And we've seen salary increases . And one thing -- initially did state a pay freeze. In my 28, 29 amendments I put forward , I did not freeze any salaries . I did have a 1.9 percent increase . And don't forget that over the last two to three years, we've seen major increases that have far outpaced what happens in the private sector. So tonight I will be voting no on the 2024 budget. MR. KING: Anyone else on the question ? On the question , I will be voting for this budget. I do appreciate all of my colleague s here on Council who helped contribute toward a lot work that went into trying to reduce the 3 and a half percent tax increase recommend by the Mayor to get it down to 2 percent . It wasn't easy. Any time you have five different people, you have five different opinions . I do -- the reasons why I'm supporting this tax increase are the fact that PEL has indicated that the City of Scranton having come out of Act 47 it's important that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251594 we do small incremental tax increase s over the next few years to ensure that we have continual funding to keep our city running and to support our, you know, our professional Scranton Fire Department , Scranton Police Department who were just had an arbitration award for their contracts along with the pension contribution s. This budget will go to fund nine major park project s going into this next year. It's important to note that we've had a million dollar loss evaluation and, you know, with the cost healthcare increasing and other costs, I felt it was important for us to do a small incremental tax increase . Don't enjoy having to impose a tax increase at all. But unfortunately I have seen our city get itself in big trouble when we did not, you know, typically it happens in election years where they'll say, well, we're not going to have a tax increase because I'm running this year. I don't want to get reelected -- or I want to make sure I get reelected so we won't do a tax increase . That's not the case here. I mean, this is the second year in a row. Last year it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251595 was recommended 3 percent increase . We got it down to 2 percent last year. This year 3 and a half percent . We got it down to 2 percent . I think it's a fair budget. I think it's a compromised budget. I think that it's important that we maintain these continual small incremental tax increases to keep our city moving forward . It does include two new position s which Council had asked for to attack blight in our city and really focus on those areas. And I appreciate being able to add those this year. So I will be supporting the amendments to this tax increase . Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I have a few things that I wanted to bring up with regards to the budget. So first, I take the budget process very seriously and any potential increase to our taxpayers . I know the first two years I was -- two or three years I was on Council we didn't increase the taxes. And last year there was the 2 percent increase . And I also do not enjoy having to consider that or increase taxes. And I understand the burden of not just the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251596 property taxes but then factoring in the school district and the county as well. I do believe that the budget is fair and was careful ly considered . I appreciate all the work that the Council members , especial ly Councilman King had put into the budget and in trying to lessen the propose d tax raise as much as possible . And I know Councilman Smurl also had brought up all the different increase costs that we have had to the city this year and this coming year that we need to be able to curtail with this budget. I also want to say I appreciate all of our city employees . I believe that we have hard working employees throughout all of our departments , not just one or two of them. And I think that there are justifications for raises for employees , for nonunion employees . And I believe that we adjusted to them to what we thought was going to be appropriate and fair. And you did see many of those changes in the amendments that were proposed tonight for the budget. I would like to see next year that the proposed raises for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251597 employees be considered based on the performance reviews and evaluation s that have been started this fall. I think that will be helpful in determining future raises. And I also don't believe that raises are equal to the tax increase . There's so much more that is incorporated into this budget. And I think that we will be doing for the city in 2024 and for the citizens that I'm excited about and thought that this budget allows us to do that. So I'll be supporting the amended budget tonight . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so I do appreciate the time and effort of my colleagues during this amended budget process and its tax hike reduction from 3.5 to 2 percent . I also realize that to be fiscally responsible because of recently exiting Act 47, we should do incremental tax increases . I would have liked to have seen the tax increase reduced to 1 percent to satisfy the unavoidable expenditures and without nice to have versus need to have new positions . And no one took into account every new possession 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251598 they presented to us with large salaries , you have to add 30 grand to it for benefits . So total compensation are close to 100 grand for some of these new positions that people didn't realize or should realize . I want to see lower across the board raises like what's seen in the industry , fair for all, okay? With inflation at its highest in 40 years and with the county raising taxes 5.9 percent , the school district proposing close to 2, and then now here 2 percent ; it's almost 10 increase for the resident s of Scranton that are struggling , not only with this, with water rate -- potential water rate increases , etc. Every year during budget time we hear from the city's administration about comparable cities and salaries and how we are lower. For the past two budgets , the same people received above average increases . Guess what, the cities that we were always being compared to did not just come out of Act 47 distressed status. They also don't have a shrinking population like we do. And they don't pay a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 251599 3.4 wage tax. This year's tax increase like last year's benefit a few of the city's employees and not the residents . Increases should benefit both the residents and the employees . If this year the administration presented an incremental tax increase that did not include new position and above average raises and instead proposed something like let's change every street and court sign in the city once and for all and pave every street that didn't make the paving list or that the one on the list and then taken off the list and have to wait indefinitely , I would have voted yes for an increase that would have benefitted the many and not the few. MR. KING: Is there anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR.

I hereby declare Item 7-B as amended legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : EIGHTH ORDER. 8-A. File of the Council No. 64, 2023. MR. KING: This ordinance is creating overtime reporting requirements for all city department s and employees . It has been tabled until we receive additional information from the administration . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-B. File of the Council No. 98, 2023. MR. KING: This ordinance is the operating budget for 2024. It has been taken from the table and voted on in Seventh Order this evening . 8-C. This resolution is to allow for city officials to enter into an easement by and between PPL Electric Utilities and the City of Scranton for property as noted located along Amelia Avenue. And 8-D, this resolution is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515101 contract with Rudolph Clarke, LLC, to perform a review of nontaxable properties for the city. It's been tabled until additional information is received and I expect that to be voted on next week. If there's no further business -- I have two things before we go. Yeah, thank you, Mark. So we talked about this during caucus the Pennsylvania Utility Commission , I have for all -- I have two copies on me right now. But in meeting with Senator Flynn and talking with Senator Flynn's office Brian Doughton (phonetic ) and also communicating with Kyle Donahue directly along with Tom Welby from Representative Kosierow ski's office and Kyle Mullins ' office, there is going to be a concerted effort to try to get at least 500 citizens in the City of Scranton to fill out a formal complaint to the Public Utility Commission . And it's my understand ing that they are going to set up an office across the street from City Hall and try to encourage people -- citizens to stop in, fill the forms out. They'll have them available and have them sign 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515102 them off and we'll send those in on top of the fact there is going to be I know a letter is going to go from City Council along with the Mayor of the city.
