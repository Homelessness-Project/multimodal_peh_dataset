ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, thank you. To start I want to thank Kane Warehouse . There is a donation tonight to the police department special forces for $500. I want to reach out and thank them for that. That's very appreciated and will be put to good use. Some housekeeping from last week, I haven't received an update from Parks and Rec on the tree house or the Novembrino situation . I'll make a phone call tomorrow and see if I can get some information . As was discussed , DNC and ABM will give us a presentation on a kiosk system that they want to install in the city in a couple of months. It was a good presentation . Councilmen had lots of questions for them. One of the things I wanted to make sure that if any reason there was going to be a kiosk that went down that they weren't going to prevent parking to that block, because it's not like when a meter goes down that spot is down. You know, what that kiosk is down that whole 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 half of the street is unavailable to pay for your parking , so based on their past practice if there is meters broken you can't park there, so if the kiosk is broke does that mean you can't park on that whole side of the street? That was something that was just unacceptable to see me. They said they will have a policy in place that will make sure that it will be used because it's just -- you can't tell a business owner that my equipment is down so nobody can park at your business that's not fair. That's something , you know, I'll drive this home. What else do we have? The city e-mail is still down so keep in touch though city council office, everything can go through there. Also, Mrs. Schumacher brought up the master list, if we can get somebody off PAWC to make sure they have that, I don't know if that's part of what they're going to be bringing , but just to give you a head's up to make sure they have that for us for the caucus when they come in. And that is all I have for today.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just to go back on a request that I made a couple of weeks ago, I still have not gotten anything from the pave cut inspector on Walnut Street. Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send another request to them on why a pave cut was allowed in a street that was paved a week before? I also got some complaints , some yesterday , on a house that caught fire on Palm Street on Saturday night. Some neighbors are worried about the structural integrity so I ask that we request from LIPS to send somebody out and determine that, and I'm also going to be a sending a letter to Lackawanna County Assessor 's Office asking following questions : Why was the Electric city garage tax classification changed from exempt to taxable ? Has a countywide review of all tax exempt properties to make sure they meet the requirements of the tax exempt classification ever been performed and what, if anything , is being done to recoup taxes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 that were not paid on the property for 2016 and 2017, and that letter is going to be going out to them tomorrow . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Just a few. First of all, the discovery last week that the Electric City garage was still classified as a tax exempt property certainly begs further questions , specifically , how many parcels are out there that are not paying taxes all because maybe they have been misidentified or they haven't been identified at all. So what is the best way to go about that to try and solve that problem ? It's called a countywide reassessment . What happened with the electric city garage is a systemic problem . You know how to fix that kind of problem ? You fix the system. You implement new systems and procedures that can only be done thoroughly and properly through a reassessment . A reassessment effective ly creates a blank slate, it's a complete do over, where discoveries like this should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 part of the process and not an exception . My final word on reassessment tonight is far as I'm concerned we are on the clock and if decisions are not made relevant to the reassessment before we adjourn in August, I think we should pass a resolution to sue the county to force a countywide reassessment at that time, send it to the mayor for his support or his veto. The time for this talk is slowly coming to an end. On the HUP test, as was mentioned tonight , I would like nothing better if the county with accept the responsibility . Actually it's their job, but I would like them to accept that responsibility as well. The only place that I even know of that ever did this was in Allegheny County and, of course, it was performed by the county, but if you do get involved in this it's something we need to share with the Scranton School District since they make up 55 percent of the property tax bill to begin with so I would like to look into that and see if they would like to com on board and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 discuss some opportunity to share possibility of working with us on the HUP test and surveying for the nonprofits . On decriminal ization of marijuana , Councilman Perry and I have been on the record that we would like to see a dialogue with the various stakeholders on this issue and hopefully that is something that we will see happen very, very soon. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First of all, the street sweeper is scheduled to be in the Bunker Hill section of East Scranton June 11 to June 15, Wheeler Avenue to Matthew Avenue including the Oakmont section of Scranton . Last week I asked about a $7,500 transfer from the Workers' Comp Fund for a personal cost adjustment . I'd like to thank Mr. Bulzoni for getting back to me fairly quickly . It is a market rate adjustment that the city agreed to pay to the Teamster employees employed by AMB for parking services and it is a contractual 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 obligation . The city's payroll responsibility is based on certain percentage increases identified in the contract not for the entire payroll . The budgeted amount may be found under account No. 6006 of the Human Resources budget so I want to thank him for that, and that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much, just two very brief items. I just want to give two thank yous, a lot of times people see the complaint s at the meeting but they don't hear about the results , so I want to thank a DPW employee , Larry Wynn, who delivered some recycle bins to a resident who had a complaint last week. And I also want to just update everyone , on the corner of Lackawanna Avenue where there was an overgrown brush by Buona Pizza, that was cleaned up the next day after our council meeting . After the meeting , I made a couple of phone calls and that was taken care of. So I just want to thank the people who actually got those items done. Small things, but they do add up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Regarding the reassessment , since it was brought up again, I can't help myself but comment , Councilman Evans is exactly right and reassessment would cure many of these problems that we are seeing. There are, I would guess, many other tax exempt properties that should be paying taxes in the city. Obviously , parking garages is a huge one and it was a glaring omission on the part of the county and some of my colleagues mentioned that money needs to be paid back from day one when that property was sold, there should be no forgiveness or forbearance on that. They should have known that it was taxable . So that is all. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING AND ESTABLISHING SPECIAL CITY ACCOUNT NO. 02.229630 ENTITLED “LSA GRANTS” FOR THE RECEIPT OF GRANT FUNDS FROM THE LOCAL SHARE ACCOUNT FUNDS THROUGH THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS AS GRANT FUNDS ARE MADE AVAILABLE . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING AND ESTABLISHING SPECIAL CITY ACCOUNT NO. 02.229631 ENTITLED “STORM WATER” FOR THE RECEIPT OF FUNDS FROM THE SEWER SYSTEM ESCROWED SALES PROCEEDS SPECIFICALLY ALLOCATED FOR STORM WATER EXPENSES . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I did have a few questions about this piece of legislation and the creation of this account for storm water expenses . Mr. Bulzoni did get back to me. I just want to read his response here. One of the components of the proceeds from the sale of the Sewer Authority was a $500,000 allocation . The fund costs associated with storm water. Until this legislation that creates this account , the account was basically a component of the general fund. The city wanted to make sure the use of those funds was exclusive to storm water needs, hence the legislation . The city believes the Arcadis report will provide sufficient financial information to delineate the use of those funds. The city recently authorized Arcadis to complete the digital mapping needed to complete the report and he just suggested that we have patience . The use of those funds for future needs will be explained in detail through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 the Arcadis report, so that is the response I received . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 37 OF 2016, AN ORDINANCE “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS WITH COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES , SCRANTON , INC. (THE “CONCESSIONAIRE ”) WITH RESPECT TO METERED PARKING IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON (THE “CITY”) AND THE GARAGES OWNED BY THE PARKING AUTHORITY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA (THE “AUTHORITY ”) PURSUANT TO THE SCRANTON METERED PARKING SYSTEM CONCESSION AGREEMENT (THE “METERED SYSTEM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 CONCESSION AGREEMENT ”) AND SCRANTON PARKING FACILITIES SYSTEM CONCESSION AND LEASE AGREEMENT (THE “FACILITIES CONCESSION AGREEMENT ”), AND TO AUTHORIZE CERTAIN ACTIONS AND ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE METERED SYSTEM CONCESSION AGREEMENT ” TO AUTHORIZE THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO THE SECOND AMENDMENT TO CONCESSION AND LEASE AGREEMENT . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . You know, this is going to be on our agenda for the next two weeks so I'm going to take time to digest all of the information that we received in the caucus, but one of my concerns based on the response that we received from NDC would be actually in regards to the Electric City garage. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could send a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 letter to Mr. Basalyga asking him when the Electric City garage will be renovated and repaired . As I mentioned in the caucus, I was under the assumption , and it was baked into the agreement , that Steamtown 300 was supposed to spend $2.25 million for immediate capital expenditure costs, so that would be 45 percent , and the Parking Authority was supposed to spend $2.85 towards immediate capital expenditure costs and that would be 55 percent . There were a few other of my questions that were not answered because they did not have the information so I will be submitting that to NDC and ask that they provide those before final passage . And then an additional question that I did not get to and I actually didn't think of until all of the information came out, the city and NDC they are going to have to go to PennDOT to petition them to ask for an expanded scope of the projects under the multi-modal transportation agreement and the grant funding to utilize that grant to the maximum extent possible so my question is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 what is the plan if PennDOT does not extend the scope of the project and where does the onus fall here, so that's one of my concerns . I may have additional questions so I will forward those to NDC before final passage here in two weeks. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? I'd just like to reiterate some of my comments during the caucus, and I do apologize to anyone if they were having a hard time hearing , we only have limited microphone . Obviously there is a lot to digest here with this agreement , but I will say on the whole I'm very support ive of the idea of moving from the old fashioned meter system to a kiosk system which will bring us in line with many other cities. If you go visit another city in surrounding areas meters are a dying breed. I know myself many times I go up to a meter and didn't have change so what do you do? Chance it. You go in, if you don't get a ticket the city lost out on all that money, if you get a ticket well then you're made and you might not patronize that business again. So moving to a kiosk system 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 will take cash for those who carry cash, take credit for those who take credit, and for those who to want to pay on their phone can pay on their phone. It will modernize our system quite a bit. There are a number of moving parts within this agreement , but to me changing from the old fashioned meter system to a more modern system is something that's very important . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-E. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES PROGRAM GRANT IN THE AMOUNT OF 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 $125,000.00 FOR THE MEADOWBROOK CREEK CULVERT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Mrs. Reed, if we could just get clarification from the administration on Mr. Young and Mr. Kennedy's questions and, you know, I've said this a million times over the last two years since I have been involved with this issue, but I really hope that this is taken care of before the end of the summer, and I would urge the mayor and the city solicitor to get on the ball and get this thing done, hammer out an agreement , work with these people and help them be able to live a quality of life that we would all want to live in our own homes. It's often frustrating , one of the speakers brought up a problem with an abandoned car. Council , I know myself, I try my best to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 take care of the issues that people bring in front of us. Often times, we are not in lock step with the administration . There is a break down in communication or, you know, they are busy and they try to get to it as fast as possible . So, again, I hope that we can clarify those questions that Mr. Young and Mr. Kennedy had and put this issue behind us once and for all. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: On the question , obviously , this is a very, very important step to finally putting this behind the Young family, the Kennedy family and everybody else in that neighborhood so I enthusiastically will be supporting this resolution . Hopefully we can tighten up the definition as far as the work that is being done, but I'm comfortable with the some of the description s, they've pinned it down to that location , the 1700 block of Wyoming , but it's important to get this moving forward so we can get this out of the way and work on the rest of the details . MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 don't think the words in the legislation were meant to be gray. I definitely support Mr. Gaughan 's letter just for clarification , just for peace of mind and everybody else involved because I know this project has gone on for longer than any of us care to remember . I remember when you first came up, Mr. Young, and you asked for help and we were able to get you some emergency funding and that was how long ago and we are still here trying to get it taken care of. I know there has been some legal hoops that we were jumping through back and forth and it's just very unfortunate , but I'm very, very hopeful that light at the end of the tunnel is the train and it's actually going to get this finished for you.
