MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away recently in our community , especially Frank Burke. Frank was a personal friend of mine and my brother , long time employee of the Scranton School District Maintenance Department , revered member of the St. Patrick 's Day Committee and a friend to literally hundreds and hundreds of people across our City and our region. The parade which will be held this Saturday will not be the same. The world will not be the same without Frank Burke. So we want to send a special -- special prayers out to his family and his friends at this time and God bless him. We also want to pray for all the people who are suffering because of the COVID-19 pandemic . May they have protection and peace. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster .

GAUGHAN : Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one quickly . As President Gaughan mentioned the St. Patrick 's Day Parade -- Halfway to St. Patrick 's Day Parade will kick off on Saturday at 11:45 outside the Cathedral . If you can't make it downtown , it can be viewed on WBRE at noon. There will be one change just for this year to the route of the parade. Instead of going around Lackawanna by the Radison and coming down Biden Street, it will be -- it will take a left onto Adams in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 front of the Hilton and then a left onto Biden Street. And also as Mr. Gaughan also mention ed, you know, we'll be marching this year with a heavy heart. For those of who you that didn't have the pleasure of meeting Frank Burke, he's probably one of the best friends anyone could have and no one would ever walk away from him and not love him and not know that he wouldn't do anything . So we will be marching with a heavy heart this year. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I would also like to offer my condolences to the Burke family. Frank was bigger than life and a kind soul and will be sadly missed. Also, tomorrow Wednesday , September 15th Friends of the Poor -- oh, I'm sorry, Family to Family and Weinberg Food Bank will have a COVID-19 emergency drivethrough food giveaway. It will be at McDade Park, 1 Bald Mountain Road, Scranton , PA 18507. Thank you -- from 2:30 to 4:30, I'm sorry. That's all I have. Thanks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? There will be a capital budget hearing . It's 6-A on our agenda tonight . The hearing will be next week on Tuesday at 5:45 p.m. Members of the public are encouraged if they have any comments on the capital budget to come and make those comments at the public hearing . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler . Does the mask have to be worn up here also? Okay, my favorite subject pave cuts. The pave cuts that were done on the 1400 block of Bulwer where I live were repaired about a week or two ago. But they just repaired the spots that they dug up. I was told that someone who works in the pave cut department that with all the pave cuts they made that should have been done curb to curb and not each one done separately . So it was UGI that did it. And I know they didn't do it correctly . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 And I know Main Avenue is PennDOT 's responsibility . But they dug up three or four blocks. I went by last week and they made those cuts where they got to dig it up again. They're just going to do the whole line that they dug up originally . Main Avenue was paved only about three or four years ago. I think they should do the whole curb to curb the length of whatever they dug up. That's PennDOT . I don't know if the City has any control over it. MR. DONAHUE : So it's just my understanding that once -- because they're putting in new hookups along Main Avenue. And as soon as they finish doing that, they're going to pave it all at once. That is my understanding of it. MR. SPINDLER : Oh, okay, because I know they made those cuts. MR. DONAHUE : Um hum. MR. SPINDLER : All right. Lastly, when they paved Bulwer Street about three or four years ago, I live on the corner. And they made a curb there with the blacktop. And some of it has worn away over the years with those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 heavy rain storms that we had the last couple weeks my sidewalks were getting flooded like crazy. I couldn't walk down my front steps. You would be walking in a lake. So maybe DPW could come and take a look at that. It's on the corner of Bulwer and North Rebecca . So that's all I got tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Mr. Voldenberg , can you followup with DPW? Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . Some of the things I'll ask about and were discuss ed in caucus. But for the benefit of the general public, do you have a date yet for a public caucus on the Serrenti Center with regard to its cost and future funding? MR. GAUGHAN : Would you like me to answer that now? MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, but you had said before that -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, we don't have a date yet. We just heard back from the administration on that. I'm trying to pull it up here. I did mention this in the caucus. Let me see. They're preparing a summary regarding all the question s that we asked. And they are going to get back to us this week with the best date options for a caucus with all the required parties . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And do you have a due date for the 2020 audit? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't think we have -- MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding that the auditor is going to be in the building this week to finish up one thing that's outstanding . So I believe we should have it by the end of September . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I'll be looking forward to that. With regard to the Times-Tribune article on August 20th, DPW driver in gruesome crash also in hit and run. My concern is that the City may be facing a major lawsuit . I realize that these incidents are still under investigation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 But when those investigation s are complete , will the findings be made public or will citizens have to submit a Right To Know request to get some answers ? If I lost four fingers in an accident at work, I would seek out the area's best injury law firm and ask it to advise me on the options as the injured party. And if a lawsuit is filed against the City, will the City's insurance carrier cover any monetary damages or will the taxpayer have to pick up the tab? You can give me an answer in Fifth Order. Next, firefighter 's basic Collective Bargaining Agreements still not have been posted to the website . Will it be posted before the next contract is signed? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : I hope so. Next, I see that the City wants to use a 2.6 million dollar SAFER Grant to hire 10 more firefighter s for the next three years. I agree with the Times-Tribune 's concerns . How will we pay for these firefighters once the SAFER Grant runs out? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 We are talking about increasing the Fire Department 's payroll and benefits by a minimum of 87 -- $867,000 a year. So we need to account for that money. Next, speaking of firefighters , couldn't the City find other employee s to supervise and monitor the Novembrino Splash Pad? Do we really have to pay off-duty firefighters $46 an hour in overtime ? Now that next year's budget discussions are under way, shouldn 't we plan for less costly staffing ? I could think of far better uses for pandemic funding . Can't you? Next, with regard to Item 5-F, the resolution to preserve and enhance instruments of communication , the backup says that this $50,000 project will enable employees and constituent s to hear each other better in meetings . And that's about time. However , the sound system acoustic panels, table microphone s and podium with microphone will be located not here in Council Chambers but in the Governor 's room down the hall. What are we, chopped liver? We have been asking for you to improve the acoustics 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 here since before the pandemic . So please take a look at getting this room fixed. And finally , the 5 percent administration fee that the City charges for the LSA grants, is that money only charged if the grant is approved ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, because then they have to administer the grant. So it's only if it's -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Check the paperwork on Item 5-F. The math on that last page does not add up. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. ATTY. HAYES: -- on the injury with the DPW worker, I would just advise Council that's an internal personnel matter that is under investigation and that we should refrain from commenting on it at the time. There could be a time and place to address those issues, but now is not the time. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Solicitor Hayes. Next speaker is Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I'm here tonight because I'd like the City of Scranton to remove President Joe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Biden's name from anything that was named in his honor. After listening to the Senate and the Congress hearing -- Congressional hearings today and from former people in the Defense Department and secretaries of state of our nation, they're stating that President Biden has caused more harm to the United States than any president in our history and militarily also. And he's left Americans behind in Afghanistan . They're killing the people that helped the US Military in Afghanistan . The Congressional and Senatorial hearings have determined that he has lied to the American people. And I just don't think that we should have anything named after that man. As a matter of fact when this Council was debating that issue, I told the Council that he was a train wreck without tracks. And, you know, he's the President of the United States. And he says to the American people that he works for that his patience with us is running thin. He answers no question s from the podium. He's like a dictator . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Now in my opinion , the Democratic party knew that he couldn't do the job as President . And, you know, it's not just Republicans that are questioning this. He gave the Taliban 82 million dollars worth of military equipment . And he withdrew the U.S. military before he got American s out of Afghanistan . And not only did he do that, but he abandoned our allies there. There's a man that has embarrassed our country beyond my wildest imagination and is totally incompetent and can't do this job and yet this Council has named things in his honor. And I just think it's disgraceful . I mean, they are executing the people in public that fought along side America for 20 years. I mean, they are executing female police officers in the street that worked as employees . Pilots, they're killing in the street. They are taking advisors and interpreters and killing them and killing their whole family. He abandoned all of these people in Afghanistan . And not only did he do that, he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 pulled all the contractors that were keeping their planes flying. He just wholeheartedly surrendered that country to the Taliban . Now, I'm going to make a request to the Mayor and to this Council . And I'm going to drop it off next week in writing . And the other thing I'm going to do is, I'm going to ask the Council again to consider putting the Home Rule Charter on the ballot because I think that the resident s in the City of Scranton have a right to self-determination on how their Government is going to function . And I'd like to hear what the Mayor has to say. I'd like her to come here and express to the residents of the City why they shouldn 't be able to determine what changes they might want to make to their government . And, Mr. Gaughan , you should feel free to voice your opinion and the rest of the Council . But I really think that this whole thing with Joseph Biden needs to be reverse d because it's a black eye to the residents of this City. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Scott Thomas. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. WILLIAMS : I'm Scott Thomas the CEO of the Scranton Public Library . And we have two items on the agenda today. One of them is Betsy Moylan's reappointment to the Authority Board and we're grateful to have her. So thank you. And we also have a LSA resolution in there. I'm not going to belabor the roof because you have all the details with it. It is approaching 130 years old. It's original slate tile roof and it has copper flashing s, a lot of other details. But it's also starting to leak. And we're concern ed about the restorative woodwork in the building and all the other work that's been done. So, you know, it needs to be done. And we think we will have a very competitive grant application , you know, for the City of Scranton . But what I really want to talk about is that I know that the City is planning on putting a lot of Government services on line. And we want the library to be a partner with the City when you do that. We have a 30 year history of rolling out new technology to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 public. Many people who are non digital natives in the 1990s first learned to use a mouse at the library . And that continues to this day. When ABM was going to put out parking kiosks, I made an offer to them and I said why don't you put a -- before you -- put a kiosk in the library . Put it in test mode. Show the staff how to use it. People could come in and learn how to use it. And we could get the press in and we can do videos. And they did not take me up on that. However , the offer still stands. I made it to the Mayor as well that we'll assist you in any way when rolling out new technology to the public. So that's all I have to say. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Thomas, one thing. I think you're doing a wonderful job in charge of the library . MR. THOMAS: Well, thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I've said this before I think when you've been here. But I really do believe that that is one of the greatest assets that we have in the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Scranton and in all of Lackawanna County. And the people that work for the library do a wonderful , wonderful job. I had to use the library in several instance s and they're phenomenal . MR. THOMAS: Thank you. And we are very proud of our staff. I appreciate that and thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a great night. The next speaker is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And it's good to be back at a Council meeting after the summer. And I spent some of my time during the summer replaying some of the videos that were on either ECTV or YouTube . And it concerned me of the attitude of Council and their response to some of the residents and the business owners when they were up here and they were voicing their concerns about Spruce Street being changed . There was sort of turt responses and I was a little bit surprised when I looked at them. So as I give my speech and talk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 tonight , I hope that I don't get the kind of response that I saw on YouTube . And I know that it's probably a closed subject . But things can be changed. And I'm talking and referring to Spruce Street being changed . Laws can be reversed . As I watched the videos I could not help to think about we the people. We the people of Scranton tried to have a voice in the renaming of Spruce Street and it went nowhere . We the people who are the business owners came. They were -- present ed their concern s and their objections . And unfortunately , they were told by Council that it was too late, too late to voice their concerns . So I tried to find out and rerunning the videos exactly what were the business men and people on Spruce Street told. I was trying to find did they receive a letter that this was going to happen? I guess they did. I couldn't find it on video. But I did think I said, okay, it was announced in the papers. It was announced at Council meeting s. And I know that it's there because I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 attend Council meeting s. But if you don't attend Council meeting s and if you don't get the newspaper and if you don't have access to public means or media, how do we, we let the public know that things are happening that you have to pay attention that things are going on? So I realize that, like I said, by me coming to Council meetings I know. I try to know and keep up on things that are happening in the City. But that's not all the case with the people. A lot of people don't get the newspaper . And I think ECTV is probably available to everyone . I don't know if it's available whether you have Comcast or any of the other cable networks . I guess they do. But my big concern after looking at all of those things, we have to come up with a better way to let the public know what's going on. Letters were promptly sent. I know we discuss ed it here at Council . I know it was in the paper. And I know that what other media did I see -- ECTV. So I know that it was out there. But there has to be another way to let the public know when there are important items 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 like this are coming up that it's going to affect your life. It's going to affect possibly your income because I do patronize some of the stores on Spruce Street. And I sure would hate to see them leave the City all because of not -- of the street being changed because it's going to change over to another name. So I just ask that going forward if we could somehow come up with a better means and we have to -- think tank to think about, okay, this worked in the past. Maybe it's not going to work in the future. So we have to somehow think of a better way to let people know. So I'm just here to say -- and I read the preamble to the Constitution . I was reading all kinds of stuff. We the people, and we the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union and it goes on. We all know that. I think we learned it in 8th grade or something like that. So we all know about we the people. So I just ask that going forward that we try to come up with some better way to let the public know all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 that's going on here at City Council . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Ms. Jeffries , I just want to respond in 25 seconds to one thing that you said and thank you for your comment s tonight . I teach American Government . And I actually teach Citizenship to 11th graders. And one of the things that I teach them is that, yes, I agree with the things that you're saying tonight . But also, there is a responsibility that we have as citizens of Scranton and Americans to be involved and to pay attention . And all of those meeting s about changing the name of the street were highly publicized . We can't help if people don't buy the newspaper and don't pay attention to local news. I think that is incumbent upon them and the people in our City to pay attention . And we put it out on ECTV. I mention ed it several times at the meeting. It was not only were there front page articles on it, but it was also advertise d in the newspaper several times as well. So I agree with part of what you are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 saying. But I do think that, you know, the buck doesn't stop with the government . There's also a responsibility with the citizens as well to pay attention . And, you know, I don't know many other ways than being publicized on television , every major news network, here on ECTV, in the newspaper . If people don't read the newspaper and don't pay attention to it, I think they have to do a better job of paying attention because it was out there. MS. JEFFRIES : Do I have an opportunity to -- MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MS. JEFFRIES : Everything you said is true. I agree with that somewhat . But we could use our website more to say these are the upcoming bullet points. These are the upcoming items. You don't have to give a full blown explanation . But as soon as we go to our website , the public should be able to see it. These are the things that are a really happening bullet points of things that are important here in the City of Scranton and that I just think should 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 have been addressed . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Next speaker is Marie Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , a citizen in this City. First, I'd like to start out tonight with thanking the DPW because some vandals managed to go up to the lookout and use terrible -- I don't know what they wrote -- thank you -- but certainly a terrible color paint. They did a lot of damage and DPW was there this morning and with water and pressure washing the graffiti out. And so I hope that that is -- that place is considered in the -- adequately in the capital budget because it needs help. And it needs help now not just because of the graffiti because the stones are old and people don't even know what the WPA means. So moving on, Mr. Donahue , you were a member of the Mayor's Tax Task Force? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Was there a meeting today? MR. DONAHUE : No, I believe there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 was a meeting not -- last Wednesday . I wasn't able to attend it but there was one last Wednesday , I believe . MS. SCHUMACHER : I don't know why the Mayor's Office didn't know that since it's hers. They gave me a time of 5:00 today for a meeting and supposedly a code where I could get onto the Zoom. So I'll have to take that up with the Mayor's Office tomorrow . MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I believe it was last Wednesday . But I will double-check and get back to you after the meeting . MS. SCHUMACHER : I can do that tomorrow I guess. Again, have we done anything to put leachate sensors in the Green Ridge area where the leachate had the problem a couple years ago? MR. GAUGHAN : When you say we, who are you referring to? MS. SCHUMACHER : The City. MR. GAUGHAN : No, I don't believe so. I don't even know what that would involve . I don't believe that's ever been mentioned as being something that they were going to do. If it was, it's never came before Council .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, it was. I mean, there are sensors that could be used that when there is water -- not water but leachate flowing down that -- MR. GAUGHAN : And what I'm saying I don't recall hearing any updates on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, I think that is something else that could be added to the other budget. And I want to agree with the people who say the acoustics need to be helped in this room. I don't think it has to be a big thing. You might even ask David to help you. He's -- I know when the tax group was still operating and he was working with that group to improve the acoustics . So he might have some ideas and he's good about it. Then the rescue dollars, our 69 million dollar gift of federal debt which is going to be split I understand half this year and half next year, I believe that there should be some kind of group that's put together that includes some people who are not elected officials to see what they think or to make a poll of how that money should be spent. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 But I mean, personal ly I think it should be on the stormwater and on the potholes . This City is really in bad shape with the stormwater . And again, also spoken of tonight , the Home Rule Charter . I don't know if Dr. Rothchild will be having a request . But if it's not tonight , I hope it's very soon so we can proceed . I think that's very important . And then the firefighters , do we -- we used to get a listing of how many were eligible for retirement in the next couple of years. And maybe we could get that for at least the next three years and see if that is going to be any help. And -- MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Miss Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, I'm sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MS. SCHUMACHER : Next week. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Voldenberg , if you could follow up with those questions . Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Communication is part of the issue. And the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 website as we know is not being used at all to its fullest potential . I had -- I drove in here last month to go to the ethics meeting -- the Ethics Board meeting . And surprisingly enough when I got to the front door, City Hall was closed. Yes, it was in the newspaper . But I do not get the newspaper . She said -- as people say, sometimes one does not get the local newspaper . I had gone to the website beforehand where it says when the meeting s are being held for the Ethics Board and nothing was there. I sent an e-mail to the Ethics Board and it took a month to get a response back because it seems the Ethics Board does not check their junk e-mail. And so somehow my e-mail wound up in junk e-mail. I suspect that I had also sent to Tom Preambo , an e-mail. It might actually be in his junk e-mail box as well if the City happens to be routing my e-mail to junk e-mail. But what I asked for is a slight curve increase in front of 3242 Oak Avenue, the driveway and the sidewalk cut out. And 3244 Oak Avenue the sidewalk cut 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 out just boosting it up about an quarter of an inch. As the other speaker said, during heavy rain storms because -- three of the water drains are completely blocked in our -- they're complete ly blocked , some of them having cinder blocks and bricks actually in the stormwater drains themselves . When the water comes down, two blocks' worth of water is actually (inaudible ) onto a small section between Phinney and Nancy Drive and all that comes streaming down winds up hopping the curb, going onto the sidewalk of the neighbor 's house going down between the neighbor and my house and flooding the properties directly below us to the point that Mr. Walsh is my backyard neighbor has to go out before storms and put up water bags outside of his property constantly and has a Shop Vac ready to constantly pump out his basement from water because this is a constant battle all the time. The water drains, it would be fantastic to have them fixed. But as a temporary fix if the curbs could be just lifted up about a quarter of an inch over the two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 cutouts -- well, three cutouts , two sidewalk cutouts and one driveway cutout. It would probably remedy a lot of the problems for that section , temporary . The Home Rule Charter , I think before hopping into a Home Rule Charter we should go back to at least putting in a governing board or advisory board as we originally did but when we were adopting a charter 50 years ago. Having a committee come together if you're going to go in that route and do a plan for how citizens actually want the Home Rule Charter to be put in place. Have a guiding map by the citizens laid out and talked about beforehand between citizens and between Council before going to the voters and putting it forth as a referendum makes eminent sense. Last week I had talked about the 7-A for the Civil Disturbance Unit. And I think there was an error made in interpretation . I was not in protest to them having funds to fix their equipment . That is all reasonable . What I called into question is the logic of the name. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 In days of sensitivity now and having deescalation by police departments having something listed as Civil Disturbance Unit sounds a little harsh -- civil intervention unit, maybe; the police wireless surveillance system; maybe police wireless public safety system. It's not so much what they do. It's what those words present . They present an adversarial action against the community who they are supposed to protect and serve. Last is 4-B. It surprises me when I read through it that the City is approving a Government grant for double the tax granted in lieu of taxes to a religious institution that's a byproduct of horse racing and gambling . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Here I am again with my mask. I'm going to talk about City issues first. The water parks, we do need definitely a plan for the end of the year now but they need an attendant there. You can't have a bunch of kids running around unsupervised .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 They have to have attendants at them. And that's all there is to it. This can't go on. Somebody is liable to get into a little scuffle or get too roughhouse and get hurt. The taxes came up tonight . And I don't know, are you aware of it, Mr. Donahue , that Geisinger is trying to buy an entire block of Prescott Avenue? What block would that be if I may ask? It's possibly the block that they tore down the school. That would stand to reason. I mean, I'm not against anything . But time and time again -- DR. ROTHCHILD : That's Colfax Avenue. MR. DOBRZYN : -- I've come up here and stated that the state needs to come in and start compensating us for these tax losses. They were going to close Tyler Memorial out in Tunkhannock -- not the ICU but the emergency unit and that would have been more ambulances coming down to into Scranton and people from outer counties paying less taxes than ever and taking -- bringing people here. And that's okay. But we sure could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 do with a little better than 36 percent tax exempt, you know. And I'm not complaining about a hospital at all. I'd be dead if that hospital wasn't there but, you know. Now, okay, on our wearing masks and COVID, a man named Ray -- I forget his last name. But he was the auction eer in Sweet Home Alabama . And he took a heart attack and they called 43 hospitals in three states before he was taken in. And he died nine days later. Maybe that hospital wasn't as good as where he tried to go. But it was all loaded up with COVID patients . Have all Governors , you know -- I got a new name for them the American Taliban . It's just ridiculous . Like, how much science can you reject? And then the voting we have a recall on our Governor out in California which isn't here. But we're not an island. And his main opponent is already calling the election fraudulent . So we have to keep on it, keep calling out there in TV land. Don't get tired. Call your government offices . And I think they're already tired of hearing it because you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 can't seem to get anything but a recorded message anymore. It's just ridiculous . But our democracy is being handed away, just handed away. And it's a shame. We heard a lot of stuff about Joe Biden. Well, you know, he's okay with me. I felt we could have, you know, a few conversations with friends. I heard Bernie was too old in 2016. Well, Joe Biden is 18 months younger , you know, that's okay. He got elected president . And I wasn't really happy with the way we left Afghanistan . But that was negotiated by the Donald. So when somebody comes up here and states these things, then I feel I have to counter it. We were in there four months longer than what Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo agreed before they agreed to leave. And whether they had any intention of honoring that agreement if they were reelected , who knows. But it's getting -- it gets a little tiring hearing that nonsense too. Thank you and have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenb erg. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple things. So I would first like to report out that there was some issues with a property on South Irving over the past couple months. And I'm happy to report that because of concern ed citizens in code enforcement that this property has greatly improved. So that's a positive . But there's still a lingering concern that was brought up a couple of times. So I don't know if it's clear to the resident s that live by this property . But part of this remodeling job that, you know, finally coming up and progressing ; the concern is the asbestos siding and if there's a safety issue or not. So I don't think that concern was address ed with them, Mr. Voldenberg . So if you could just please just have, you know, the same people that had been in contact with these resident s, just clarify that with them. That's just one lingering thing that they are concerned about. But they're very happy with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 everything else. All right. And then on behalf of Mr. Schuster , can you follow up on the past request about the property at 1434-1436 Dorothy Street? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Get an update. And the last week -- so last week I brought up the separation or it's referred to now the divorce of NRS. I know that we've had conversations with the administration far back as September of 2020. We had executive sessions discussing this. And our last meeting with any information or actually there was no further information since June 9th. What I would like to do is make a motion for an official update asking if the decision has been made that Council is unaware of because I think we should be aware of because the last communications were in June. Are they being paid that they feel that they're owed that we disagreed with? Or are they going to be paid? So I would like to make a motion for an official update, an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 explanation and has a decision been made that we're not aware of. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Motion and a second. On the question ? Can you restate what the purpose of this is again? MR. MCANDREW : I want to know what the final separation or so called divorce , has it occurred with NRS. We were told that, you know, data was transferred to the new contractor collect ing the delinquent s. We know that. But there was some discrepancy as to whether the contract was breached and they are owed money. So it was never clarified to us. It was brought to us. I know I wasn't in favor of paying them -- people that are identified by, you know, the FBI. So we were never given a final answer as to are they going to be paid? Were they paid as a final separation ? MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion, signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. MR. MCANDREW : That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few. First, Mr. Voldenberg , I would like to request that we send correspondence to DPW. There is a traffic light at Cedar and Alder over in South Side that I was made aware of today that the red light is out that is facing the 300 block of Alder Street. And I also wanted to request if we could send correspondence to SPD to our police department because I also am interested in respect fully requesting that they consider changing the name of the Civil Disturbance Unit to reflect some updated and more appropriate language . And something else that I wanted to bring up that I wanted to ask if Solicitor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Hayes could respond to regarding the Home Rule Charter just to inform the public on the process for the formation of a commission . I wasn't sure if you were prepare d to give that tonight . Okay, so we can expect for -- ATTY. HAYES: I could give you verbally if you want. So basically because we're a Home Rule Charter city, we're subject to the state law -- the Home Rule Charter law which sets forth the procedure for amending or repealing and replacing the Home Rule Charter . Basically it could be done through two procedures . It could be done by way of petition . The petition -- it has to be -- in order to replace a home rule charter , write a new home rule charter , ultimately a commission has to be impaneled to do that. There's two ways to get that referendum on the ballot either through petition by the citizens , the petition has to be signed by at least five -- what comprise s of 5 percent of the number of electors who voted for the office of Governor in the last gubernatorial election or it could be done by way of ordinance with Council and the Mayor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 signing it. The matter would then be placed -- the referendum would then be placed on the ballot and the question really would be shall a government study commission be elected to study the existing form of Government . If the City -- if that referendum was to pass, then a commission -- members of the commission would have to be elected . They would have to be impaneled . They would have to draft a Home Rule Charter . And ultimately the Home Rule Charter would have to be -- if they draft a new one would have to be approved by the majority of -- by way of popular vote. So it's a drawn out process , but I prepare d a memo so you have the whole step by step process . But that's a summary of it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you for providing that. And last thing I want to say, I know tonight in Fifth Order we'll be having the LSA application s that we'll be voting on. And I'm just excited to see all the applications . I think that these are all very worthy causes and organization s that I've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 supported . And I wish them the best of luck in receiving these grants. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few things. Just to touch for a minute and this was reported in the newspaper and I had asked questions about previously about the use of firemen at the Novembrino Splash Pad. And we are apparently going to use ARP funds to pay them for being in attendance at the splash pad. As I stated to the newspaper and last week, I do not agree with this. I think there definitely is a better way. We do not need to utilize firemen at a splash park. I actually don't think we need a lifeguard at a splash park. There's is no standing water. I take my children or took my children sometimes to the splash park in the Abingtons and also the one at Sherwood Park in Dunmore . There was no lifeguards there because there is no standing water. Now I could understand wanting someone there when the park 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 is brand new, totally understand that. I just don't agree with using firemen there. That to me makes absolutely zero cents. I do think because in the past we know at Novembrino Park when there was a pool there, there were issues there. We could send a police officer over on that beat to check. The Parks Department employees can go over intermittently and check. There is no need to pay City employees overtime to sit there all day. That does not make any sense. I also read in the newspaper that the splash park was closed Saturday and Sunday I believe last week because of staffing shortage s. Can we find out, Mr. Voldenberg , exactly why that was? This is a new splash pad. I can't imagine why we would have to close it during a weekend when the weather was nice. So if we can ask to clarify that. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : President Gaughan , if I could also add that I had actually wanted to go there on Sunday. And I was looking to find out and I sought if it was still open or not. And there wasn't any notification of its 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 closure . And I was actually glad that it didn't end up working out that day for us. But I was glad that we didn't get all prepare d to go there to find out that it was closed. So I do think that the City needs to better communicate with the residents as to the opening s and closures of our parks because I'm sure there are other families that might have been affected that way. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay. I'd like to make a motion to send correspondence to the Mayor and the Business Administrator to pose several questions regarding the use of the recently awarded SAFER Grant for the hiring of 10 new fireman . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion and a second. On the question ? There was an announcement the other day in the newspaper where Council learned that the City received a 2.6 million dollar federal grant that will allow the fire department or the City rather to hire 10 new firemen . This grant covers salary and benefit s for three years according to the press 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 release in the newspaper article . We currently have a complement of 135 firemen in the department . And I do have some question s that I think need to be answered before the Mayor considers officially accepting this grant. When I read the article I believe it was last Friday, I immediately sent an e-mail to the Mayor and to Mr. West and I have not receive d a response as of yet. My first question is very simple. How is the City going to pay for the additional 10 firemen once the SAFER Grant runs out? Keep in mind that the City is not guaranteed this funding in year four. And in the past, we have applied for SAFER grants. We have received SAFER grants. And then we have applied again and not receive d it. So that's a concern . If the Mayor does end up accepting this grant and the City ends up hiring 10 firemen and in year four and we don't get another SAFER Grant and can't afford to keep paying them, there is a chance that the City would lay those firemen off. And there is a cost to this as well because I've heard people say, well, we get the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 grant and then can't pay, we'll lay them off. And I don't want to see that happen. But there is a cost to that as well. The City would have to pay unemployment benefits to those laid off firemen . And we would be responsible I think for covering 66 percent of the firemen 's salary. The City is self-insured for unemployment compensation insurance meaning that we pay all unemployment claims. So I do think that in a time of budget constraints and every year towards the end of the year we do find ourselves, you know, crunching the numbers here especially during this pandemic that we do not want to get into a situation where we become shortsighted . This is not free money. Year four will come to roost. And if we cannot afford the 10 firemen , we will be in a bind. It has happened before. I believe under the Courtright administration , they were awarded a SAFER Grant. And I think they hired 14 firemen under the SAFER Grant in 2016. And that grant ran through 2018. I don't think we received another SAFER Grant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 after that. I could be wrong. But I did have very similar questions when that happened . I also sent an e-mail and spoke briefly today to Jerry Cross from the Pennsylvania Economy League. I didn't get a chance to read his response . But I know there is language in the Recovery Plan which states that we do have constant reoccurring issues with legacy costs. So if we were to hire 10 additional firemen and we were not able to pay for them in year four, again, that is adding to the legacy cost. And I don't think that we should base hiring an additional 10 solely on the fact that a temporary grant is available . That's -- to me, that's poor planning . So I would hope that since there had to be some thought put into this because they put the application together and submitted it that the Mayor would have a plan prepared . I haven't seen one yet. But if there is not one, I would like to see it before anyone signs off and accepts this. And, of course, Council will -- I'm assuming that this will have to be include d in the 2022 budget. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 So we will have a hand in that. But again, if there's a plan there and we can see it and makes sense, I would certainly entertain it. But until that time, I'm very skeptical about this and would like further information on it. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. The second thing that I'd like to mention tonight and we discussed this in caucus is the Meadow Brook Creek Project . I mentioned this last week. We were told, Mr. Voldenberg and Councilman Donahue were told today that we have a tentative meeting set I believe for September 28th at 5 p.m. That is not set in stone yet. We're waiting for final confirmation . But that will be in chambers . It would be publicized on ECTV. And we will inform the neighbors of that so that they can hopefully be here or watch on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 TV. So they're going to give us a full update. To piggyback on that as Councilman Donahue explained to me before when he was speaking to Mr. West, they also as a part of that meeting want to bring in HRG who is the company that performed the stormwater study. If you remember from the last time they were in, they gave us a partial look at their plan. Their final plan was not complete . It is complete . And they will bring that and they will present the whole plan and give us an update. So we have them penciled in for the 28th. If that changes , of course, we'll let everyone know. And when it's confirmed , we'll get that out to everybody . As I also mention ed to Miss Hodowanitz earlier this evening , there were several question s on the Serrenti Center. There's been a lot of grant money put in up there and that building is -- there's, I believe work being done or will be done in that building . So we were advised -- or Mr. Voldenberg was advised by the administration that they are preparing a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 summary regarding the questions that we asked and they're trying to firm up a date when they will come in and have a caucus with us and give us an update. Also, I mentioned in the caucus that Council would like the department heads to attend a public caucus as soon as possible prior to the 2022 budget so that we can get an idea of what has been done this year, where they're efficient , where they're not efficient and just general updates on the departments . I know I mentioned this before. But this is done across other government al bodies, the county, the school district . And I think it's a very good practice to get into here between the administration and Council whether it be quarterly or whatever . And the Mayor agrees with me. We've had conversation s about it. She thinks it's good government as well as I do and so does the Business Administrator . So I have asked again Mr. Voldenberg to check in with them so that we can actually get dates and get this moving this along. DR. ROTHCHILD : President Gaughan , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 was the IT Department included in that because I would like an update on where we are at with the website and Opengov ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, every department . Also, one other thing I wanted to mention was -- we did not get a response yet. But I did want -- and again, I think this would be a good practice moving forward , all the new position s that were put in the 2021 budget, we would like a breakdown of how those positions panned out over the last year. For example , we have a project manager . So what has the project manager done over the last year? How efficient were they? Did they bring revenue to the City, all these questions they have about these new positions . That will help us in formulating in discussions with 2022 budget. And also I asked earlier this evening , what is the plan for the 2022 budget? It is now September 14th. As we know here things move very quickly . We'll blink and it will be November and we'll have the budget in front of us. Last year was difficult because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 things came down late to us and there were mistake s. And as I mentioned earlier , I would like to avoid that this year. So I do think that Council needs to be brought in on that process as soon as possible . The administration is set to give tentative or a budget framework to the Pennsylvania Economy League I believe in mid-October . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could check with the Business Administrator on when Council is going to be involved in this. Also, we did send a request on the Nay Aug Pool. I continue to be antsy about this I guess you could say. I know the Mayor and the administration had this on their radar. But if we could send another note as to whether or not they have contacted PFM regarding the potential of funding this project through financing . I will say it again, I do not believe that we should have this be a multiyear project . This is a major project at Nay Aug and there is no way that we're going to get 8 million dollars in grants soon. And I don't think we should leave the pool and the pool 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 complex empty with standing water there, looks terrible . I think we have to move on this thing and make the investment . And however we have to do that, I think we should -- whether that's a mix of grant funding and financing , I don't know. But I think they need to move quickly on it. And I'd like an update on that. Also, Mr. Voldenberg , a gentleman contact ed me this morning about the pavement marking s coming out of the Green Ridge plaza. The marking s are faded or almost gone at Green Ridge Street and Ross Avenue. And this gentleman witness ed a near accident while waiting for the light to change actually on more than one occasion he stated. So he's asking when the DPW gets a chance if they can repaint the pavement marking arrows and the lanes. He thinks that that will help. And I frequent that area and I would agree. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I do have a question about this. The study is going to help move five blighted properties from the land bank and that's -- viable properties which should bring tax dollars back to the City. Mr. Voldenberg , if you could just check, I'd like to know the addresses of these properties on Luzerne Street. Luzerne Street is a very -- as all of you know, it's a very important street in West Scranton . And it is sad to drive on certain parts of Luzerne Street 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 because of the condition of some of these properties . So I was thrilled to see this grant application on the agenda tonight . And I do think that NeighborWorks does a wonderful job and is trying to do a very good job in West Scranton particularly in this neighborhood for long-term revitalization which I think is sorely needed. There is too many important things on Luzerne Street, the high school, neighbors , you name it. So this is a welcome relief if they could get the grant. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I agree, I mean, Luzerne Street has always been a great artery in West Scranton . And I'm thrilled with the work that NeighborW orks is doing in West Side. And this will be a great boost to that part of Luzerne Street. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR.

DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question quickly , in terms of the acoustics in this room which were brought up tonight, I have made it a point over the last few months to get the gentleman in here that knows more about sound that -- I've never met anyone that knows more about acoustic s and sound than this gentleman who's done it a very long time and has a lot to do with the upgrades in this room years ago. And he was in here. Mr. Voldenberg is going to contact him again to put together a proposal on how we could fix the acoustics in here which as you all know and have pointed out are not the best. The speakers are not in the right place and there are other issues in here. So we do want to see that happen. We're just waiting for the assessment to see how we would move forward . And I do think it's a great idea that the Mayor and her administration is trying to do the same thing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 to the Governor 's room. As you all know, we've had meeting s over there or caucuses , the Sewer Authority meetings and it's extremely hard to hear anyone in there. So I think upgrading that room is very beneficial . I do also agree with the kiosks being in City Hall -- information al kiosks. I think that's a wonderful idea. One of the things that I pushed along with other Council members years ago was the Smart City Concept . We had a company in here. We voted on legislation to put kiosks across -- in some strategic location s in the downtown to push out different events, information about the City, emergency alerts. And actually in that proposal that we were given, the City was supposed to receive a pretty significant amount of revenue -- ad revenue because they were going to put advertise ments on the kiosk. So I did ask Mr. Voldenberg to check with the administration on where that project is because it kind of fell off the map. And I think we had asked a few times. Thank you. Anyone else?
