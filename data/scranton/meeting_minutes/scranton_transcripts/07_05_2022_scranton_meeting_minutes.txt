SCRANTON -LACKAWANNA HEALTH AND WELFARE AUTHORITY 2021 COMBINED AUDIT REPORT. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So on Tuesday , July 12th from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., there will be a car seat roundup and car seat checkup event. Where it's at, it's going to be at the Department of Transportation up in Dunmore . And it's the NEPA child passenger safety task force is rounding up old, broken, and used car seats to help keep children safe. They will also be available to check car seats for proper use and look for any recalls on your current car seat. Over time car seats can break down and not be as effective in saving and protecting children . Here's your chance to clean out your garage, basement , or attic and finally get rid of these safely at no charge as well. No appointment is necessary . That is all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? I just have one. Next week July 12th, we'll be having a public hearing on the 2022 Community Development Block Grant program , the Home Investment Partnership Program and the Emergency Solution Grants Program . That's in Sixth Order tonight . So after Sixth Order tonight we'll table this legislation . We'll hold the public hearing and then there's a 30-day public comment period. So we'll bring that back the first week of September then. And that's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list tonight is John Thomas. MR. THOMAS: John Thomas, 75-year-old city resident all my life. Well, here we go round the merry-go-round again. Friday afternoon I got a copy of the City noise ordinance . I took it over to Levels Bar. I talked to the manager for five minutes , yada, yada, yada. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 We're going to play music to 2 a.m., walked away. Sunday I'm going over to listen to the orchestra a few feet away from Levels Bar, how lucky can you get. The door is open. I got within 2 feet in the bar and this man came running and put a chain link across. I couldn't go any further . He didn't touch me. He didn't threaten me. He said come outside and talk. I said sure. I'm not going to talk in front of a big crowd. That doesn't do me any good. It don't serve the purpose why I'm here again. He went on and on about going to see -- Geneva House management where I live. I told him three times, three times. Geneva House does not take care of noise ordinance even for residents . That is a City issue. The City has to take care. You have to discuss things with the City. Yada, yada, yada, we have to work with you, yada, yada, yada, yada. We'll probably play maybe later than 2 a.m. We might go to three or four, yada, yada, yada. So I just walked away, end of story. Council , I hope you have a safe and good summer. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Thomas. We did ask for -- MR. THOMAS: One more quick thing. Orange face makes Richard Nixon look like a choir boy. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And we did ask for an update from code enforcement and the police department . Once we get one, we'll pass it along to you. Next on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . What's the current status of the union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they are still being negotiated . MS. HODOWANITZ : We're in day 186. We're now on the downhill side of 2022. I'm surprised I have not yet seen legislation come forward on the labor -- special labor of counsel contract which expired in March. And I'm wondering , you know, you got Ufberg continuing to negotiate , yet there's no contract . I would hope that that's completed before you go for your August recess. And this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 is interesting to say the least. And it will also be interest ing to see how much money Ufberg Associates makes on this contract deal. What's the status of the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you want to give an update? MS. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so I met with the Finance Department on Thursday to get an update on the audit. The auditors at Kohanski gave a June 20th deadline , 95 percent of the items that they required were given to them on the 29th or the 30th of June. So at this point in time they have 95 percent of what they needed for their June 20th deadline . There is a piece that the HR Department has to complete . It does need to go out for a third-party person before it comes back for their August 1st deadline . So Kohanski has an August 1st deadline . And as long as the City gets them the information by August 1st, we should have an audit that's on time. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, okay, we shall see. And I haven't heard anything on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Payroll Preparation Tax. The question s that Mr. Lazor and Mr. McGovern had posed with regard to rental income and the self-employed , when are taxpayers going to get those answers ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding that a meeting is being set up. MS. HODOWANITZ : I would also assume that in the interim , taxpayer s just got to fork over the money now if you are self-employed . That will be interesting . There also was a curious article in the newspaper this week. The Borough of Blakely has taken action on signs on utility poles. People put them up and never take them down. I would hope we would do something like that in the City of Scranton . And hopefully it would get enforced . Many times when I'm riding the bus you see yard signs and, you know, for sale signs, you know, they're up on utility poles. And downtown for some reason various organizations love to tie ribbons around utility poles and then they never take them down. It makes the place look a little bit trashy. One thing I would like to bring up and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 I don't know if other people have had this problem , but when are we going to open up City Hall to the public again? Does anybody know? Has the Mayor said anything ? I know it was closed because of the pandemic . But when is this going to come to an end that a citizen can walk into City Hall, request information , conduct business ? Anybody know? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding you could do that now. Am I wrong there? MS. HODOWANITZ : You don't really walk in unfettered into City Hall. You get as far as the first floor entrance then you have to genuflect before the queen and say, oh, I would like to see so and so and then they'll say, well, we'll call and they'll send someone down. I don't know, you know, I mean, I was talking to Frank earlier . And he said part of it was the pandemic . And there is also some kind of security issue. What's the security issue? I haven't heard anything in the press about it. Is there a security issue about people roaming through the halls of City Hall? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. DONAHUE : Not that I'm aware of. But we'll look into that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I will say one thing. After my last Firefighter 's Pension Board meeting in June I wanted to request an appointment with the Mayor over an issue that came up during the pension board meeting . But the office was locked. And it was dark and there's suppose d to be four people working down there. So I have been calling last week and this week and I left a message . No one has called me back. Don't they forward the phone calls if people are working remotely ? Are people still working remotely ? What is going on in City Hall, you know, that you have to request entrance . I wish we'd go back to the old ways where you could walk in and conduct your business . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . Two weeks ago when I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 here I said that we haven't seen a street sweeper in Tripp Park this year. And much to my delight , the next day when I was getting home from work, I was driving up Euclid Avenue and there was the street sweeper . A couple minutes later it came around, made the -- came up Bulwer Street and made the turn on Rebecca . And I was right there. And the gentleman stopped and got out. And he said I was watching the meeting last night and he said I saw you and the man in the wheelchair talking about not seeing a street sweeper . And he told me they have three street sweepers. And he's the only driver. Why do we only have one driver with three street sweepers? And he was a very nice young man. He was only in his 20s maybe. He said when he heard us talking, he said to himself , I got to get up there and help these people, very courteous , very nice young man. But maybe if you people didn't pass that legislation about hiring a different company to get funding for us, we could have hired more street sweeper drivers . That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 $48,000 a year where we could have given it to a street sweeper driver instead of hiring a company to see if we they could get us funding , which I said was wrong. Anyway moving on, also when I was here two weeks ago I said about putting my ash cans out with grass clippings and weeds and this and that and the garbage men kept taking them. Well, today they took my third one. This is ridiculous . It's cans I paid for and they're taking them. Last week I wrote a note and they didn't take it. I have to write a note for them not to take the stuff that belongs to me? It's ridiculous . I mean, they weren't brand new. But they should be emptying them out and just leave them like the garbage cans. It's ridiculous . Another thing, once again, terrible news yesterday , another mass shooting in our country . It's awful. I spoke about this before. It's these high powered rifles. And last night on the news there was a former worker for the CIA on the news. And he talked about how we had bipartisan legislation to help 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 with the gun control . As I said, that's like putting a band-aid on a heart surgery . He said what they fail to address is the real issue is these high powered military style rifles. And I said that for years we got to get them off the streets . As long as we have Republicans in office, that's not going to happen. So in November remember vote all these Republicans out. Put Dr. Oz back on TV where he belongs . Another thing he said was in Asia and Europe, they don't have these problems because they don't have these weapons . They don't allow these weapons in Asia anymore . Maybe we should, you know, see what they're doing and do the same thing. Lastly, fireworks , talked about this last year. If it's one day that's fine. But it's like days before the fourth, days after the fourth. My 15-month-old granddaughter was in this weekend . Saturday night it's 10:30 and they're still going off. She was terrorized . I called the police and explained . I said, you know, they could buy them, yeah, but you can't blow them off in the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 They're breaking the law. He said, okay, we'll send a car up, whether they did or not I don't know because they didn't come to see me. And then last night it was ridiculous . I couldn't get my dog out of the house for him to go to the bathroom . She was terrorize d. I put her harness on. I tried pulling her out. The thing was terrorized . Something 's got to be done. And I have an idea I said last year. All the police officers should be on duty 4th of July. Put a certain amount of officers in each section of the city and let them sit there. Put one at my house. You could see all over Tripp Park. You could see where they're coming from. Go find them like they are suppose d to -- and, first of all, maybe they'll stop doing it and the City can make a lot of money too. It's out of control . I bet tonight they're going to do it again even though the holiday is over. Something 's got to be done. All right. That's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Mr. Spindler . Next on the list, Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . First off, last week when I was in here I asked about if you could look into why they didn't finish the paving on East Mountain on Birch Street and Derby Avenue. There's about 300 feet on Birch Street to the intersection that wasn't even touched . It was paved on both sides of it. And it seemed kind of funny. Also, I don't know why they are not paving Lackawanna Avenue. It's the main street we have in this City. One of the things that really bugs me a lot, I've travelled and I'm all over the country is the comments made about us, the people how we're support ing and advertising Joe Biden. Each and every one of us in this room know he's an international worldwide embarrassment to each and every one of us, not just one individual or the other. What I'd like to do is ask you guys, one of you anyway, to make a motion to remove the Biden signs until he earns the right to be on a sign. It's already up in Green Ridge. You need him off the interstate because people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 that don't live here travel through here. And I hear these comment s. I hear them in Florida . I hear them in Texas. And it's a shame that you people took our voice away and put up the signs. That's with the Mayor included and didn't give a damn about what we believe and what we think. Remember , we own the City, not Council , not the Mayor. We're the ones that make it happen. We pay taxes. We call ourselves Scrantonians . And yet we're embarrassed . And I would like to see one of you make the motion to remove the sign, put them on referendum and see who has the courage to stand up and really do what's right for the people, not for you guys individually or your political aspirations . You know, when you're in a position to do what you do, you got to remember wholeheartedly you represent us but you don't own us. And that's the difference here. When you take that oath to represent the people, it's exactly what it means, represent the people, not yourselves not for a pat on the back or anything else like that. And I think you need to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 something happen to show who we are. You filled the pool in up Nay Aug Park. Yet you let Geisinger park there for a 100,000 a year which I raised lawsuit s and challenged the free parking that they are basically getting when it's $2 an hour in front of the hospital . Why didn't you go to Geisinger and ask them to fill the pool, take care of the pool. I'm sure they would have been happy to. They are throwing millions around like Hershey candy around the city. I'm sure they would have entertain ed the thought to have their name on something that's worthwhile that benefits the people in this community . Reach out to them. Open the pool up the way it was when it used to be called Lake Lincoln . I'm sure some of you guys never even remember that. That's back in my age group. And that's what the lake was about. It was about our families , the camaraderie . They had the cars Father's Day. That was a joke to take them from where they were where people could walk around, now you had to go down over the bank. You had to walk here. That's not the way it should be done. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 And the Recreation Authority at Nay Aug should be disbanded. And it should be put under the Recreation Authority in the City of Scranton . You're allowing too many politician s and people that are owned by other people to do what they are doing. And that is one of the things they shouldn 't have did. And out front here, June is over. How about putting the flags in the area that are to be respected where they belong. You fly them -- had the flags flying in June. Now it's July. Let's put up another flag maybe for the Italians , the Irish, the Pols, the Welsh, the Syrians , and I could go on and on and on if that's where we're heading here. And the fireworks display that they had this year, well, I've watched them for many, many years. I thought was substandard when they shot off -- what they were doing. Yeah, we had a fireworks display . But in the past, we really had a hell of a display . The grand finale was like, what was that and it was over. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Council , before I get everybody mad at me, two young ladies stopped me at the -- outside the parking lot at Gerrity 's and they asked me to ask Council to pursue some tennis courts that they don't have access to them at high schools or -- I don't play tennis and I didn't know that. I thought the colleges or somebody had tennis courts. But they said there aren't any for them. These are little -- you know, smaller people. Well, my friends , when you mess with my pocketbook it makes me most irritable . In January of 2021, inflation was 1 percent . In December of 2021, it was 7 percent . And now I think it's 8 percent . Mr. Biden blames the Russian offensive for all our ills. But actually there's no doubt about it his first act of stupidity was terminating all our gas contracts and production . Inflation took off from that. And besides the Russian invasion was I think February 21st of this year. I picked on the poor guy enough. You think inflation is going to be bad right now, wait until diesel fuel gets 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 shortaged . Am I not right? We are facing a shortage of diesel fuel. This is a deliberate action from this administration little by little to control Americans if you ask me. I think I'll pick on Mr. Wolf a second or two. Thank goodness that he'll be out of here but not soon enough. But his policies seem to be supported by Shapiro and Fetterman. And I like them but not their politics I think. We're becoming known as the marijuana capital of the country right here in town. We got a growing organization off Market and Main Avenue. It shouldn 't have been allowed . Now with his policies , we'll become the abortion center of the country . I don't think it's a good policy to make taxpayers pay for the social activities of young women. Children don't grow up in a democracy . What we have here is a bunch of whores on my dime. They don't have the -- from what I've read, if this is a state's rights issue and I see signs for Black Lives Matter and people walking around don't seem to have an idea in the world what's going on. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 And as far as Mr. Biden's sign in the City, I talk all the time to my friends down south. And he's not leaving a favorable impression for the people of this city. And he's not supported like our Mayor and Council and some other seem to want us to believe . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have is Mr. Thomas came up here and spoke about a situation he's having with someone over loud music and it's a business . I think he's absolutely wasting his time here, no disrespect to the Council or to him. He should go downtown to the Lackawanna County Courthouse , ask for the paperwork to file in forma pauperis , read the laws, read the case law, petition the Court and bring the party forward . And then we'll find out exactly where we are and that will be the end of it or the beginning of it. But you'll get your answer. Now, the other thing is, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 people -- I think it was Mr. Bolus. I'm not sure -- got up and spoke about owning the City. No, the people in this City don't own this City. The political machine owns this City. That's why Mr. Biden's name is up there. You know, that's one of the reasons why we have to craft a Home Rule Charter because we have to give the people in this City a voice not, you know, over the 30 years that I've come here I've watched so many Council men smirk and laugh. They've got no respect for the people in this City. It's almost beyond belief. Okay, so I just think the people should go back since the 4th of July was just yesterday . They need to go back and look at what the founders of this nation wanted. You know, we have people talking about guns and about all kinds of situation s and government funding of this and that, all kinds of things. And when you read what the founders wanted, we're so far away from that it's beyond ridiculous . It makes us a weak country , a very weak country . And to be honest with you, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 anybody who spends some time and educated themselves would find out that America is not the arsenal of democracy . We have no manufacturing base. We can't even put drones together or give the Ukraini ans the weapons they need to fight the Russians . We're bleeding into our stockpile s. We can't even give them the equipment they need to fight Russia. And the Europeans don't have anything either. So if a war does come, there's going to be a lot of dying wholesale . And then the American people are going to figure out they've been lied to after their cities have been bombed into just -- you can't even use the word to describe what's going to happen. We're funding our own demise and who did that, the Democratic and Republican political parties when they decided to deindustrialize America so they wouldn't have to fight China some day in the future that our economies would be intertwined. And where is all China's technology coming from? Well, we sold it to them. So when they build fighter planes and aircraft 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 carriers , they're not starting off from scratch . They are using all of our technology . So we're going to be fighting our own equipment . And if you didn't learn anything from the second World War, open a history book. The Germans had the best equipment , absolute best. And they were beat with numbers . So we might have the first wave. But I don't know what we'll have left after the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth and no manufacturing base. You know, the American people really need to wake up. And the people in this country need to wake up. And hopefully the people in Scranton will wake up when we start discussing the Home Rule Charter because ECTV is going to give us an opportunity to start doing that on Friday. But we need a complete rewrite of city government and county government and the reorganization of the Scranton School District . And maybe the people in this City can come together and this county can come together and we can have a discussion , not what I want but what we need because obvious ly we don't have a government that can furnish us with the things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 we need. And getting elected to a higher office or any office is meaningless if you can't do anything for the people that you represent . MR. DONAHUE : That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening, Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . You know, a lot of people get bashed up here. And as far as politics , the only thing I can go to vote on because it's rare that unless you're a dictator you achieve everything that you say you are going to achieve or -- but the most important thing to me is, A, is the person honest and do they try? That's what's important to me. So if somebody doesn't achieve something or just takes a little bit of a wrong turn on a name of a city street, I have other fish to fry. And that's all there is to it. I paid my taxes a couple weeks ago -- two weeks ago. And it's the first time I saw our tax collector present in 20 years. It's -- we elected Cathy Wechsler to the Tax 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Office. And I seen her in there and present . And I seen that the Tax Office was being well run so my compliments there. I never seen anyone that was elected tax collector in the office in nearly 20 years. Now, on this walkability , I don't trust stop signs. I get most people stop and I've noticed this and they're polite and whatever . And some people are always in a hurry. And there's no way to argue that the stop light or a stop sign that they stopped or whatever . I've actually had people in some big old raunchy pickup truck gun their engine when I obviously waited for people that were there before me at the other intersection . And they get aggressive and even if you have the right of way. So I do not think that two-way streets are advisable unless you're willing to put a four-way stop in. And in addition too, have a period of time that a pedestrian can cross the street without worrying about one way or the other traffic . And that's all there is to it. And as far as bike paths, maybe after 5:00 on Friday or any night of the week. But we don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 need bikes in the mix with a two-way street and stop signs. And wow, it's a little much. I'd like to read the 13th Amendment . I always wondered why all of these states were out for whacky laws, you know, always in somebody else's business . This one doesn't want to have a family so she uses birth control or that one might be funny the other way or whatever . “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction ." Now, in the southern states in Georgia they used to have roundups of vagrants. And they were just people without jobs during the 30s. And if you were picked up for vagrancy , you were put on a chain gang. The average stay was three years. And you stood a 27 percent chance of being taken out of that prison in a box, 27 out of 100 prisoner s died in prison over vagrancy on that chain gang. So we better be ware with these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 fancy decisions . And by the way, on guns, the Supreme Court said it's okay to carry a concealed weapon. Well, guess what, you could be told some day you want a Supreme Court decision on that go to the Supreme Court -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . What I always find startling that I've watched these meeting s now for a number of years is the people who come before this body who speak the loudest who want change in government, who want things to change, who say that things have been wronged and we need the community to step up never stay here to listen to the input of any of the other participants in this body. We have a gallery here of active citizens who come forward and give their opinion , whether I agree with it or not, if my opinion is to be heard so was theirs. But I find it startling that the people who yell the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 loudest are the ones who come up to this podium, say their word, say they want to listen and get together -- gather everyone together and then as soon as they are off this podium walk out, leave this building and ignore the words of every other citizen who has come here before this body to give input. I just don't understand that disconnect of wanting to be heard yet not wanting or having the courtesy to listen to anyone else. Now, for the police officers , I understand that some of them are on administrative leave. I understand that there was an executive meeting two weeks ago I believe on people who were out on administrative leave. Do we have any idea how many of our police officers are out on administrative leave? Out of that group, how many of them are on paid administrative leave? I'm not asking for the details of the name. It's not a personnel matter. If I'm forced to, I mean, I can go and get the payroll logs from the police department because they are open for audit as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 well. All I want to know is, how many members of our police department are on leave? We have the right to know how many of them that we're paying for. And out of the few that we have since we do have a problem with the number of police forces since they obviously wanted to increase numbers , what number of those aren't on the job? We want this community policed properly . To understand that we need to understand how many police officers are out because of improper action. We don't need the details. But we deserve to know that. That's all I have to say tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to ask the administration if they could give us a total number of officers on administrative leave both paid and unpaid, please? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. GUZIEWICZ : Last week I know there was some discussion over whether or not I had the right to speak here. And I had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 responded to your objection s, Mr. Donahue , with a snide comment . And I wanted to apologize publically to you for that. I was very much in the wrong and I should have treated both you as a person and the Council in general with far more respect than I did. And I apologize . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Last week I asked if anybody on the Council was active in the reassessment of the county and it was -- Tom, was it you that said why would -- what would we do and then later -- oh, it was Mr. Donahue . Okay. Did you agree with what Mr. Coyne had to say last week? MR. DONAHUE : Regarding reassessment ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Um hum. MR. DONAHUE : I don't remember what Mr. Coyne had to say. Can you just -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, he was talking about comparative prices and going back 30 months and what's changed from 30 months to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 now and what the future is likely to look like. MR. KING: I think he mentioned the escalation -- the recent escalation , if I'm correct , in cost. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, that was certainly a part of it. I think somebody who is there -- particularly , do you know -- have you done any analysis on what -- how Scranton stands with respect to the rest of Lackawanna County? MR. DONAHUE : I believe that all their data gathering at the moment is still preliminary . It's still preliminary , the data gathering I believe that the company is doing at the moment. But I'll see if they have those answers , yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, do you not think it would be good to have one of you in attendance and able to speak for the biggest city in the county? MR. DONAHUE : At the moment? I mean, until they get their data, I don't know what you want members of Council to do. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well -- MR. DONAHUE : Like, show up every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 day and go out and help them reassess or -- MS. SCHUMACHER : No, just go when they have meeting s so you can have -- we can have input. We represent a rather large portion of the county. MR. DONAHUE : I'll find out if they are having meetings of the sort. To my knowledge they aren't. We haven't been invited if they are. MS. SCHUMACHER : Speaking of that, does anybody on this go to the appeals of the property tax meetings ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe the City does send a legal representative , I believe . I'm not sure but I'll find out. I know that they started doing that. But I don't know if they've continue d doing that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Could you find out? MR. DONAHUE : You're talking about the assessment appeals currently , right? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. MS. SCHUSTER : At one point in time I think the City and the School District were sharing that back and forth. But since the pandemic , I'm don't know. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MS. SCHUMACHER : You don't know. MR. SCHUSTER : I'm not sure at this point. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, well, my time is up. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to reach out to the Law Department to see if the Law Department sends anyone to represent the City in terms of assessment appeals ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe they do, sir, but I'll check. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments . I mentioned earlier in the caucus I'm looking forward to the Mayor and the administration coming back with hopefully some new ideas for the pool at Nay Aug, hopefully something different than a 3 foot wading pool. Something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that adults and kids can swim in. Also, just a reminder about the administration . I want to make sure that they have that meeting with Mr. Lazor. After we receive d that letter from John McGovern and Bill Lazor, I'm just hoping that the City can kind of expedite that meeting so that if there are issues, you know, with the rental properties and people that are self-employed that they are addressed sooner rather than later. Other than that, that's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MS. SCHUSTER : I'd just like to echo Mr. King on both of those topics that he just spoke about. Also, I did plan on giving an audit update at this point in time, but we handled that during public comment . I do have a few address es, Mr. Voldenberg , that I'll send over to send to code enforce ment. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MS. SCHUSTER : Other than that, that's it. Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do have a comment . I would like to just say that I am greatly offended by Mr. Ellman's comments earlier during the public comment period. And I will not stay silent and shame on anyone else who sits up here on Council and does. I am -- I prefer that people come here and talk about local issues that pertain to Council and to the City and for things that we can actually do something about. I love it when people do. But please tell us that we need more tennis courts. That's great. That's the kind of stuff that we need. But many people do come here to also discuss national issues, which is fine. But do not come here and tell women what they can do with their bodies, do not. And do not use disgusting vile language here in this body. It is disrespectful . It is breaking Council 's rules of decorum . And I'm tired it. It should not have to cross this line. I should not have to be the only one saying something and yet here I am. And I'm -- I think I'm normally fairly soft spoken. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 understand that. But when something like this, it's make we very irate but also to the public it's just greatly offensive to over 50 percent of our population to women but to also anyone who knows women who or people with uteruses who have had to go through the experience of an abortion or miscarriage or just needed gynecological care and health services . And this, like I said, is not the place that I feel should be for this discussion but here we are. And I please ask that no one use such language here in front of this body because it's unacceptable . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. I wasn't happy with that language either having three daughter s. And I don't appreciate it. And I don't want to hear it again. So secondly , Mrs. Hodowanitz made a great point. She's not the first person to bring up having access to City Hall. I understand -- you know, I get the point where during COVID it was a safety measure . But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 don't think it should be forever . I mean, the vestibule you have to stop there. I get the complaints that you really can't get past that. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please reach out to administration and say is this a permanent thing and why? I mean, Mrs. Hodowanitz heard a couple things. I've heard a couple things from residents but, you know, hearsay is hearsay . I'd like to know is it going to be limited access to the resident s of Scranton to come to City Hall. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Just a simple answer and then I want the rational e if it's a no. Let's see, what else do I have here. So, you know, I'm very disappoint ed hearing that I think right now we don't have any pools open in the City. It's July 5th. Dog days of summer are ahead of us. I know repairs are needed. I just don't understand why we weren't prepared for this. I know we're talking about the big pool for three years. And that's not coming any time soon which I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 upset about that too. But we for god's sake, we should have at least one or two pools open in the City. I know we saw some postings that, you know, we're working this one or there's some issues with maintenance . So could you please provide an update -- not just for me but for the residents of Scranton and post it somewhere are we going to have a pool this year, when, how, when are they going to be fixed, a timeline, please so the residents can get through the summer. Okay, and then so last week I made a motion, right, to investigate the missing power washer. And I appreciated the support from my fellow colleague s here on Council supporting that motion. So with that said, I'd like to update you the best I can because I think the public deserves it. So I on last Friday -- if I could open up -- hang on a second, guys. So I sent an e-mail to the Mayor with some questions -- if I could just get this open. I'm sorry. What's going on here? All right. So last week I said, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 know, good morning , Mayor and Mr. West. I would like to request all documents related to the dual tank power washer the City owns. These documents I seek are to include when it was purchased , when it was used, supporting work orders or work tracking sheets that the DPW may use instead of a work order. My understanding is the fleet manager will send out equipment and a person and they track that. So I'm asking for that, also any maintenance related information such as when and where maintenance was completed on this piece of equipment and receipts because last year it was brought to my attention -- and it was explained it was out for maintenance . So it was a brand new piece of equipment . So I'd like receipts for that. And then I said in addition , I would like to receive any counter usage data on the machine . The machine has this counter on it that will say how long it's being used, all right, which is pretty cool. This is a big machine . This isn't something from Lowe's. This is on a trailer, dual tanks. It's a very substantial machine . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And I said I believe the fleet manager would have this information at hand and I would like an update by Tuesday , if possible . So I kind of received an update today. So the Mayor stopped by right before our meeting . And she said there is an investigation , which I'm glad to hear. And the questions that I posed are still part of the collection of data that I requested . So I was updated that I'm still going to get an update. All right? So I'm just happy to report that out that there is an active investigation . But in addition to that so because I was told last week -- and this was all brought to me by concern ed residents . That's why I brought it forth, the picture s that I received and sent to administration . But I was also told that last week after the meeting the machine which was at someone 's residence was there until about, I don't know, 9:30, 10:30, whatever . And then the next day it ended up at the Serrenti Center. And I think some people were claiming it was there the whole time. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 I'm patiently waiting for the questions I posed answered in an update. And I was glad the Mayor came in and said she's still working on it. So, you know, we can remind them I still want them answers. But in addition to that for my own personal -- as Chairman of the Public Safety Committee , I think I have the right to ask for the surveillance of the Serrenti Center. It was last Tuesday the 28th, say from 9:30 until 10:30 in the morning on the 29th, which was Wednesday . So that will -- you know, because of -- that's based on what residents came forward to me with this information . I just want to verify that the machine was brought there then and it wasn't there for the past two months. So if you could please reach out to the police department , I think that would in their purview to provide me with that surveillance . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Can you do that for me, please? Thank you. And I have one more issue or concern . I apologize , I'm having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 trouble pulling this up. A gentleman reached out to me regarding the Scranton Police Department Crime Stats Portal. All right. I guess his concern is it's been an issue for eight months. He's had some conversations with President Donahue who has done a great job providing with updates. And this gentleman said, you know, since you're public safety, I'm going to forward this to you and I said, sure, I'll take a look into it. And I promised I'd bring it up in caucus which I did. And I promised I'd bring it up at the meeting. So with that said, Mr. Voldenberg , there is a chain of e-mails. I don't know if you have all of them. You know, the last one I think was May. And if could you please find out where we're at because this software we paid for. It's not working . You know, it was said -- you know, I was told it was an IT issue. And it will be resolved and they're working on it, working on it, working on it. So and this started eight months ago. So could you please reach out -- and if you need this e-mail chain, I'll provide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 it to you but reach out and see where we're really at with this because eight months is a long time. MR. VOLDENBERG : I have them, sir, and I'll reach out in the morning . MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thank you very much. And I think that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just in terms of ignorant comments that are made from the podium, in my five years on Council I've heard a lot of ignorant comment s made from the podium and some of them border disgust ing like Mr. Ellman's. But at the same time, if we're to just respond to every ignorant comment that's made there, we'd be wasting too much time doing that. And they are usually made to garner a reaction which is what they try to use, but we'll let that be at that. Mr. Voldenberg , we've requested a couple times for information from the Fire Department regarding calls that they respond to outside the City if they have intermunicipality agreement in terms of respond ing and providing that assistance . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 we haven't receive d a response yet, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, the Chief was still compiling the information . MR. DONAHUE : Would you be able to request that information again? I think we're going on about six weeks now. It should be able to be pulled rather quickly I would think. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : And then that's all I have for this evening . MR. KING: Mr. President -- MR. DONAHUE : Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. King. MR. KING: If I could just add, I fully support what my fellow Council person Jessica Rothchild had indicated . And, you know, in the short time that I've been here I feel like Council , we try to be very respectful to the public. And for the most part, the vast majority of the most part the public is very respectful to all of us as we sit up here. And I just -- I would ask that people really consider some of the things that they say here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 at the podium that are, you know, completely inappropriate , inappropriate language and insulting to women and people in general , not just to a single Councilman , all of us and all of us who are sitting here in these chambers . We're not always going to agree on things and we certainly don't. But we disagree respect fully. And I would appreciate if we could maintain a decorum and continue on and treat each other with the utmost respect . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
