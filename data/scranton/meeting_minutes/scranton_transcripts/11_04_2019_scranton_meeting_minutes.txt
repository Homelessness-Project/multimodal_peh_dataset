CITIZENS PARTICIPATION .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 (The following speakers spoke on agenda items and matters of general concern : Joan Hodowanitz Dorothy Dietrick John Bravo Robert Bolus Les Spindler Scott Thomas Ron Ellman Marie Schumacher Norma Jefferies Unidentified man Glynis Johns Dave Dobrzyn ) ATTY. EGAN: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly I just want to pass along some complaints I received this week. I'm going to pass these along to Licensing and Inspections Department . The first one is at -- the address is 2208 Prospect Avenue. A neighbor has called multiple times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 to complain about multiple cars in the backyard . Grass is only being cut once per year. The neighbor , like I said, the neighbors called multiple times and has been told the complaint was with the magistrate . So can we ask LIPS for a status update on that property ? Also 1121-1123 Stafford Avenue, I received complaints from multiple neighbors . Neighbors say that the property is owned by the City but is never maintained . So can we check with LIPS to see if the property is owned by the City? Is it on a demolition list? And if so, is there an estimated timetable for when it will be demoed? And the last property is 623 Crown Avenue. Neighbors have complained multiple times about water runoff disturbing their property . That's on the part of Crown Avenue where there's retaining walls in the front and water runoff is really bad there. They have called LIPS to complain multiple times. Can we also request an update from LIPS to see if anything has been done regarding this issue? And I'd also like to just bring up the referendum that's going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 on the ballot to allow the school district to consider the conversion from a Business Privilege to Mercantile Tax to a Payroll Prep Tax. I urge everyone to vote in favor of it. It's a more modern tax that allows for more organic growth. It's more fairly distributed . You know, and it's -- the Business Privilege and Mercantile is just been pushing businesses out of the City for way too long. So I do urge everyone to vote for it. And that's all I have tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Attorney Dempsey , any motions or comments ? ATTY. DEMPSEY : Yes, thank you, Mr. Rogan. Let me start with a quick reminder going forward . We do have our Rules of Council . And under Article five it explicitly states that no person including members of Council shall use their time during Citizens Participation to personally insult or to attack any individual . Name calling , profanity , racial or ethnic slurs or any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall not be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 permitted . We were a little more liberal tonight than I would have liked to have seen. I would like to say henceforth going forward hopefully we'll enact that a little bit more. It's just not consistent with our purpose here. And it's not consistent with our rules and I don't think it serves any legitimate business purpose . To the people who came here from the Houdini Museum thank you for your time. I sympathize with what you're going through . I'm hopeful that the connection we attempt to make with Licensing and Inspection tomorrow will be assistive to you. I do want to let you know that in our caucus this evening we were actually dealing with a consultant regarding trying to make that system work better, more automated and more up-to-date. I'm hopeful going forward in the future after that consultant comes in these problems will decrease substantially . I was away for a few weeks visiting my daughter and I do have a couple more comments than usual if you can bear with me. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 have been provided with a copy of the budget that was provided to the Pennsylvania Economy League. I have not had a full opportunity to review that. But I will review it in detail before the meeting which is in two weeks. I have talked to my Council mates previously in caucus and I would like to make a motion at this time that we send a letter to Mr. Bulzoni asking him to set aside two hours to meet with Council and answer our questions at a mutually convenient date and time and at least ten days in advance of the budget vote. MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Thank you. The second thing someone had mentioned the audit. I know that is a point of contention for many people including me to be quite frank. All I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 could say is I was given the same date and time that Mr. Donahue spoke of in the last week which was 11/1/19. I do not have it in my hands as we sit here today. I will repeat the explanation that I was given which is it was a new auditing company and henceforth putting additional information in was taking more time. The only good news I can give you is if that explanation is true which I have no reason to disbelieve it at this moment, next year assuming we're using the same auditing company I would hope we would not see this type of delay. I would like to briefly update people on the garbage delinquencies . As most people know when I came in here including my interview with Council , I wanted to make that a top priority . There was an attempt during one of the meeting s in the last couple weeks to introduce a letter. I'm not going to discuss anything confidential . But I think it's very fair for me to give an update regarding a meeting I participated in with both Mr. Bulzoni , the Mayor, Solicitor Eskra, a representative of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 NRS, the City Treasurer was there I believe and there may have been one other person. And it was a very good meeting where the City made its thoughts known to NRS. The gentleman from NRS was quite the gentleman . He accepted it and received it well. The one thing that came out of that meeting to me is actually two-fold I should say. The matter is now in the hands of lawyers who are going to deal with how to put this officially to an end. And it's also going to be a large chore for the IT Department . I myself was somewhat surprised by the lack of automation . I had hoped or I had assumed that the City and the Treasury Department , in fact, were more automated than they really are. And I understand there is going to be a large transfer of information and/or data that is going to take place. I'm hopeful that could be done on a timely basis although it did sound like it was a much larger project than even I had hoped. Following up on that it is also our intent to issue an RFQ. I reviewed that today when I returned to my office. Solicitor Eskra had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 provided me a copy of that. I was very pleased to see in there that it includes the obtaining of a firm or a company that is going to have a legal services component to it who can aggressively and almost automatically seek some sort of repercussions against these chronic offenders . Those who have listened to me about this know I find this highly inequitable and highly unfair to the people who specifically year in and year out put aside that $300 to make sure they pay their garbage fee. And I know those people are out there because I've spoken to them. And for the other people to just look at that fee and chronically not pay it is just inequitable to me and I cannot stand for it much longer. So I'm hopeful that that RFQ will be sent out in the very, very near future. One of the other issues we're dealing with on this is we obviously cannot go without the monthly income that the trash delinquencies revenues do bring in. So we're throwing that around as well. I did consider that a good meeting . I was happy to be at that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 table. And I will repeat that it is now as far as I'm concerned in the hands of City Solicitor and our IT Department in order to make this transition as seamless as possible . Kathy, if you wouldn't on my behalf, please, would you send a letter to the Solicitor for the Scranton Civil Service Commission ? I think it might be Paul Kelly but I'm not quite sure to be quite frank with you to see when the last time our civil service rules were updated . I recently attended a legal seminar on this for one of my private clients regarding the same issue and I was advised that these should be updated at least every two to three years. I was also advised that new regulations have come down as well. And going forward and making any additional hiring decisions , this is going to be very important for us, so I would just like to know if and when changes and/or amendments have been made. And contrary to what Mr. Bolus said, I'm going back to the gas cards because I was not here for two weeks and I do have a couple things I'd like to say about them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 What we know at the present time is that there is a complete lack of internal controls at multiple levels which is concerning . I might even go so far as to call it carelessness , neglect , mismanagement and clearly inattention . That having been said I will say this. It may be a minority opinion at this time. I'm not sure. I do not have any proof as I sit here today that there is any criminal behavior . If the audit does come back and shows me otherwise we're going to need to make difficult decisions or the administration is going to need to make difficult decisions . That having been said, I did go back and watch the two meetings that I missed. And Mr. Rogan, I agree with you a hundred percent . I as well am sick of hearing excuses from the Controller 's Office, and I've only been here eight to ten weeks. One of the excuses we were given was that the job was done away with and it is no longer there the job that was going to take care of this. I asked for a copy of that job description . And I actually have it here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And it's called a record's coordinator . And that job had three typical examples of work, log all repairs, parts and other expenses for City vehicles , file and distribute all approved vouchers and requisition s for processing and answer telephone and route calls or messages . That is not enough of an excuse for me that there was no oversight on these gas cards. It's actually incredulous to me to be quite frank that that would be the excuse. In the private world that I work in and I think most of us work in, if a job is done away with the tasks are reassigned . People work harder. They stay later. They work longer. They put their nose to the ground and they make sure that the job gets done. I really refuse to accept that as an excuse anymore . That having been said, I'm going to go back to what was one of my original opinions and I think I voiced it to at least all of my Councilmates on at least one occasion . I am not sure that this audit is ever going to be able to fully prove to us as much as I support 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 it and I do support it 100 percent , fully prove to us whether the gas cards were used for personal use. It may. And if it does it does. But the one thing that can prove that to us is going to be my next motion and that is going to be videotape evidence . What we have found out to date is that the purchases don't include VIN numbers and in many instances don't include pin numbers because the cards were being exchanged . So I think it is judicious at that point in time and very sensible to make the following motion and that would be that our solicitor -- City Council Solicitor send letters within the next seven business days to the five gas stations where there were house accounts or where there were City gas cards utilized to ask them to preserve any and all videotape evidence in the event it is needed for a future City Council investigation . MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Thank you. I will also like to say I agree with Mr. Donahue 's comments made in his 10/21 meeting that there's been a lot of rhetoric about this audit including from me. But we're not getting there just yet. And I agree with you, Mr. Donahue , if it requires a special meeting I will make myself available at any time and any place to make sure that this gets started . I would like to see this through to fruition . And I'm only going to be here eight more weeks. I think in the RFP that we got they expect it will take four weeks. So again, I want the rhetoric to end on the audit and I want the action to start. Joan, I want to thank you and the whole Ethics Board. I know this is not easy work. I read the minutes . There's a lot that goes into starting this. Granted we had it in the past but I think I should say recreating it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 and not only the Ethics Board but anyone and everyone who helps the City. Someone mentioned here today at the podium someone was up picking up bottles at Nay Aug and picking up trash. Thank you. You're very passionate . People care. This City really does have super and great potential . We just all have to work together in order to get that far. Briefly , Mr. Donahue commented on this, the payroll tax. And I have been going to the PEL meetings with Mr. Donahue as much as I can with my work schedule . And in addition to the conversion to the payroll tax, they are recommending that debt management policy. I think Mr. Gaughan is working on trying to see what the status of that is. I have asked Mr. Bulzoni for a timeline because what I don't want to do is run up against the clock on this. There seems to be some sort of a precedent here that we go as far as we can to the timeline and then maybe need extensions . I'd rather be ahead of the game on this to be quite frank. And he did tell me to go watch a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 video that he was in. I had watched that video. I do have further questions . I will talk to him about those tomorrow when I call him on a separate issue. But I do believe that the conversion to the payroll tax and the conversion to the debt management policy are some of the final steps that are going to put us forward again on the right track as we exit Act 47. I believe the time has come and gone. And I had not got an update on this as to Chief DeSarno was supposed to update the Mayor with regard to his expenses . I'll follow up on that unless anybody else has any status on that. Mr. Thomas, thank you for coming. Yes, you and I have been in pretty much constant communication since I started here. I think the most recent thing I was able to provide to you was the e-mail last week from Mr. Pocius our City Engineer which stated that at least part of that project is on the agenda for 2020. I will try to find out when. I anticipate it is not going to be the first quarter because of weather . And maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Mr. Pocius can be of more assistance to you and I as we move forward . Marie, you spoke last week or one of the last two weeks and it was supported by Norma. And I just -- and it was also spoken about tonight . I just want everyone to know that I couldn't agree any more about transparency . There's no reason the collective bargaining agreements aren't online. There's no reason the bids aren't online. With regard to policies and handbooks, I'm a huge believer in them. That's what I do for a living. I'm an employment lawyer. I sent a sample handbook to the City Solicitor I think within my first two weeks of starting the position . And with regard to policies , I'm willing and able to help with regard to those as well. It's actually what I do for a living. And I would just remind everyone that although we do have multiple Collective Bargaining Agreements we do also have something called management rights. And many of those things including the vehicle policy that we spoke about this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 evening , personally I don't see any reason why it could not be applied to Collective Bargaining Agreements as well. Okay, I have one final motion. This is going back to our Ethics Board. We have been advised that the City has sent out the acknowledge ment for our City employees to sign that they have, indeed, received the Ethics Code that they have read it that they understand it and that they agree to abide by it, which I am thrilled with. I would like to make a motion at this time that we send a letter to Solicitor Eskra who is our interim HR Director asking her to please advise us of the following : Number one, what is the established deadline for the employees to sign this acknowledgement and, number two, what action, if any, will the City take to enforce the signing of this document and what actions and discipline , if any, will the City take against employees who may refuse to sign this document ? MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : And again, I would clarify with regard to the Collective Bargaining Agreements if that is, in fact, an issue at all Section 1E of the Ethics Code does say in the event there is a conflict with existing labor rights, the statute or the CBA supersedes the Ethics Codes. To me, this is a non issue. Mr. Gaughan had asked over the last two weeks and I think it's an excellent question for listing of the contracts . I would like to follow up on that as well. And I would be most interested in receiving these and reviewing them in detail. I for one -- and again, I only have about eight weeks left here am not ruling out a full forensic audit based on what we see with regard to those contracts . And we had one other issue with regarding contracts and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 believe -- I don't know who spoke about it to be candid with you. But I was watching both the meetings . And it was in the previous -- past I should say, previous Councils had approved all contracts . And there seems to be a recommendation I think by Mr. Bulzoni that we return back to that. And I would just like to be clear that I am of the adamant opinion that that must be done in the future and preferably January 1 of 2020. I think it also prevent s the type of corruption that we recently saw. And it also adds an extra layer of checks and balances . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Last week I had mentioned that this week I would make a motion regarding having City Council and our clerk's office put any and all reports or communications from the Mayor, department heads, and other interested parties along with any communications from Council to those parties in our Third Order to be placed on our agenda. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I did bring this up again in the caucus earlier tonight . And we do after discussing this want to iron a few things out. But just as a matter of transparency and I know I've talked about this before, any -- it's just my belief that any communication we get from the Mayor, department heads, any interested parties that we would discuss up here that would be a public document really should be placed in Third Order for the public to see. Third Order literally states reports and communications from the Mayor and heads of departments and interested parties and City Clerk's notes. So for one example , I gave to my colleagues tonight we received information this afternoon from the Mayor on agenda items. So that should be automatically placed in Third Order then for next week so that people can view it and see what the Mayor has to say because there's really good information there. And it would make people more knowledgeable about -- and Council people more knowledgeable about the legislation . So again, hopefully we can iron out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 some concerns that were brought up about that. But I hope to make a motion before the end of the year. On the gas card issue, Mr. Gallagher , the DPW Director did respond to our questions which I appreciate it. There was one question that Council had posed regarding unusually high gas card usage on two different occasions using one employees pin number or card. Mr. Gallagher responded by saying that the garbage truck fillups were on both dates. There was either an issue with the pump system at DPW or they did not get delivery of fuel at DPW. So I -- and I appreciate that response . But as we discussed in caucus and there was unanimous agreement that at this time I would like to make a motion that we request from Mr. Gallagher or whoever the appropriate department head would be that we receive actual backup verification whether it's receipts or any other type of information to verify that claim. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Also it was discussed and again, there was unanimous agreement in the caucus that at this point rather than continue to go back and forth with questions , I believe Mr. Gallagher provided a decent amount in writing that we ask for a caucus with Mr. Gallagher to go over some of these lingering questions and some other issues that we have including the gas card. So at this time I'd like to make a motion to request the DPW Director , Mr. Gallagher to come and meet with City Council . ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. GAUGHAN : I do have an opportunity to -- on Friday of last week to speak to Mr. Bulzoni , the Business Administrator regarding the audit of the gas cards. It was his belief at that time he told me I think this week or early next week he'll be sending down a recommendation for the firm to go with. But it was his belief that picking a firm who had the ability to conduct a forensic audit of the gas card usage would be best. And I would agree with that statement . Also, I did have an opportunity , back and forth with Mr. Gallagher regarding FEMA projects . A gentleman was here last week who had questions about that. So he suggested that Council request a caucus with Chris Jenkins who is a foreman with the DPW and is very knowledgeable about these projects . So I would like to ask Miss Carrera -- and if my colleagues don't object that we sometime before the end of the year set up a caucus with Mr. Jenkins . Thank you. Also, Miss Hodowanitz asked about the MS4 permit. And the deadline I believe Miss Schumacher asked about that as well. As I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 mentioned to you earlier and I'll reiterate this, Mr. Bulzoni informed me that we did -- we are not meeting the deadline of October 31. We did request a 20 day extension with DEP. I did not receive notification on whether or not we were approved for that extension . Mr. King, our City Planner informed me that we did submit the application as a whole in the spring. DEP requested additional information with the help of the company that we have helping us with pollution reduction plan. HRG, Herbert , Rowland and Grubic submitted some preliminary data to DEP and they are still waiting for feedback . I do want to make one point though because I continue to hear this in the Council meeting and from citizens , the rain tax. And people don't want the rain tax which I do understand . But I think we all have to be very clear that this is a mandate from the federal government . So whether or not anyone likes it and I doubt anyone does including all members of Council , we have to be responsible and make sure that we're prepared for this because if we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 don't do it and we don't following the rules and we don't either create a stormwater authority or put it in with our DPW, create a regional authority , we're going to go end up getting fined -- heavily fined by the DEP. So these are not things that we really have any control over. We do have some control over maybe how we do it and what the mechanisms are that take place but we don't have any control over a yes or no on the rain tax. If we don't, again, take this seriously , then we're going to end up on the receiving end of heavy fines from the DEP. I also wanted to take a second and read correspondence that we received from Mike Dempsey who is a Dunmore City Council President . And he's also on the Scranton Sewer Authority . We received this today at 3:09 p.m. And I want to read this into the record. Mr. Dempsey who is the President of Dunmore Borough Council and the Vice Chairman of the Scranton Sewer Authority said the following to Council : This e-mail will serve to confirm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 receipt of your letter dated October 22nd, 2019. In that letter you requested that the Scranton Sewer Authority invite the Auditor General to perform an audit on the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority to Pennsylvania American Water and also perform an audit on the Scranton Sewer Authority . As some of you may know, I am the president of Dunmore Borough Council and Dunmore Borough Council has made the same request of the Scranton Sewer Authority . As a member of the Sewer Authority in 2017, I previously made a motion to invite the Auditor General to perform an audit on the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority in the May 24th, 2017 meeting . Unfortunately that motion failed one to three. In response to your recent request and the request of Dunmore Borough Council , I intend to again make the same motion to invite the Auditor General to perform an audit on the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority and an audit of the Scranton Sewer Authority at our next scheduled meeting which is currently scheduled for November 21st, 2019. Thank you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 for your time and attention to this matter. So I want to thank Mr. Dempsey . He plans on making that motion, which as I stated in the last few weeks I think is extremely , extremely important . I also want to -- Councilman Donahue and I had met with Mayor Evans at 4:30 this afternoon . And I want to thank Mayor Evans for providing correspondence to us that really provided great detail on the legislation that we have on our agenda tonight and also shed light on a few other things. One of the updates that the Mayor had given us was on the LERTA Program . The LERTA Program has really not taken off all that much as Councilman Donahue can attest to. But Mayor Evans has got together with the Office of Economic and Community Development . And they're taking some what I believe to be aggressive steps to market that more and really get that out to people. So I think that because of their actions this program is going to be more successful . So I want to thank him for that. And I do just want to end on a note that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 received in a conversation that I had with a gentleman on East Mountain on the condition of Wintermantle Avenue. Conditions up there are very dangerous . Two cars cannot pass at the same time. So again, we'll forward that to the DPW. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just one brief item and then I'll save the rest for agenda items. I know some of my colleagues brought this up as well. Obviously tomorrow is Election Day. And I know the races for Mayor, Council , they seem to get all of the attention . But there is a very important ballot question that's on the ballot that you will all be voting on as well tomorrow . And that's the conversion from a Mercantile and Business Privilege Tax to a Payroll Tax. Unfortunately the school district had decided to go this route instead of just voting on it. So the City of Scranton has long talked about eliminating the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax which has been a hindrance to growth within our City for a very long time. In order for Scranton , in my opinion , to effectively eliminate these taxes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 and transition to a payroll tax, which again is paid by the employer , it's not an additional tax to the residents . So that's something I really want to be out there. But in order for the City to make this change it has to be done, in my opinion , in conjunction with the school district . If the City were to make a change and the school district were to keep the current system in place, it would just seem like an additional tax to residents . This tax has to be revenue neutral , which means the City and the school district cannot bring in a dime more next year on this tax than we did on the business privilege and Mercantile Tax last year. And people may say, well, what's the advantage of doing it then? And the advantage is it's spread across more entities and more people. The Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax is only paid by some businesses , businesses that have a product to sell. Banks, for example , do not pay some of these taxes. On a payroll tax, a bank would be contributing towards that tax. So what that does is, it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 allows -- it allows us to have a broader base so we can have a lower rate. So I would urge everyone to do the research . I know there's not much time left at this point and to vote yes on allowing the school district to eliminate the Business Privilege Mercantile Tax and convert to payroll tax. These ballot questions are always very tricky because I think when it's a long-worded question people's instinct is just to vote no. But I hope that people would do the research and vote the way that they think is appropriate . And I believe Council unanimously supports this change. If the school district does not make the change, I do not know if it's in the City's best interest to do it alone. So that is all. I have some comments on agenda items as they come up. ATTY. EGAN: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 45, 1996, AS AMENDED BY FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 110, 2005 UPDATING THE LIST OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES IN THE CITY OF SCRANTON , BY CREATING “THE LOCAL DOWNTOWN HISTORIC DISTRICT ” TO EXPAND THE LIST OF HISTORIC PROPERTIES TO 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 INCLUDE ALL BUILDINGS LOCATED WITHIN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT AND AMENDING THE PROCESS FOR LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE REVIEW BOARD. MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : Second. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? I have a lot of concerns about this legislation . I will vote yes to introduce it so we can debate and listen more. And I want to make reference for the long narrative he gave us on three items that are coming up tonight . This legislation only affects the downtown and particularly downtown business owners. Currently any historical building if you want to make a change on the outside of your building , you have to go in front of what's called the HARP, Historical Architectural Review Committee where they will allow you or deny you to do certain improvements to your property . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 And on historical buildings I do think that makes sense. What this legislation would do would effectively make the entire downtown business district a historic district where business owners if they wanted to make a change in the exterior of their property would then have to go in front of the HARP, the Historical Review Board. So a building that was built in 2018 if it's located in this district would then have to go in front of this Historical Architectural Review Board. I think it's redundant . I think it's bureaucracy . I think it's a step that's not needed to -- for downtown business owners to improve their properties . I am willing to hear other opinions on it. So like I said, I will vote to introduce this this week. I have already talked to a couple downtown business people. And they have mixed feelings on it. But I would like to hear more opinions . But I am very skeptical of creating any extra bureaucracy , especially when it comes to people improving their properties . We see every week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 complaints about the Licensing Inspections Department for getting permits . We don't need to add another layer that shouldn 't be there. Again, historical buildings that are truly historical have to go through this process . But not every building in the downtown should. MR. GAUGHAN : The one comment I would like to make is I'm still obviously reviewing this legislation . But in Mayor Evans' explanation he says and in our conversation this afternoon , he stated that the City of Reading and the City of Bethlehem have done what Mayor Evans is proposing with great success . So what I would like to do in the interim time before we vote on this -- a final vote, would be maybe to reach out to Reading and Bethlehem and get many more information on how this was successful and what their stories were like before we go ahead and approve this. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. EGAN: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – REGULATING THE OPERATION OF BYOB CLUBS, PROHIBITING THE BUSINESS OF BYOB CLUBS BETWEEN THE HOURS OF 2:00 A.M. AND 8:00 A.M., AND PROVIDING FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THESE PROVISIONS , INCLUDING PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS . MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I was really pleased to see this legislation on our agenda for a number of different reasons . This was something that I had brought up months and months ago after the Castle Nightclub in North Scranton , there was a shooting over there. And that establishment is a BYOB open until late hours in the night and there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 always seems to be problems at those type of establishments . So again, I was really pleased to see that this was on our agenda. I think this is going to regulate this type of establishment , make things safer for our neighborhoods , especially in that area of North Scranton where on that block other business owners have constantly complained about that type of establishment . As Mayor Evans said in his note to Council , the major change in this legislation is that enforcement will be done by the Scranton Police Department rather than by a single zoning officer , which would be unrealistic to enforce a violation at a BYOB club at three in the morning . He's also had conversations with Chief Graziano who I know is fully supportive of this legislation and who has pushed this for the last couple months. And he also says that he has conversations with the district attorney who is also supportive of the efforts here. So again, I want to thank the Mayor and the administration . I think this is a step in the right direction . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. ROGAN: Just to piggyback on that, I agree completely . And from my conversations with the Mayor earlier , the biggest issue with these bottle clubs was during those hours it was not the Police Department that was in charge of regulating the zoning aspect of it. So at 2:30 in the morning if there's a club that's open that should be closed, we don't have a zoning officer that's 24/7. We do have a number of police officers that are available 24/7. And they do a great job and I think that this will hopefully address a big part of the problem that there's been particularly with the Castle but across all BYOBs throughout the City. It's not specific just to the Castle which prompted much of this legislation . But if another one were to pop up in another section of town they would have to abide by these regulations as well. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ?

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH SPECK AND ASSOCIATES AND BARRY ISETT AND ASSOCIATES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 (SPECK/ISETT PARTNERSHIP ) FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON DOWNTOWN SCRANTON CONNECTIVITY PLAN. MR. ROGAN: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on question . I relayed my concerns about this legislation to the Mayor earlier this afternoon and the fact that I'm concerned here that this is -- while I don't disagree with what the administration and the Mayor is trying to do here, in the overall concept and goal we're choosing the highest bidder by far. And we're going to pay them $218,000 here. The next highest bidder is $154,755 and the lowest bidder is $90,050. Now, to their credit there is a lengthy explanation and rational e for why they're choosing them. But as I said to the Mayor today, it's going to be very hard for me to choose a firm to do this work for $218,000. Also, as Miss Schumacher had noted, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 then what comes after that? There's more -- there's going to be more costs if we decided to implement this. So again, I'm still reviewing it. But right now my main concern is choosing the highest bidder by an awful lot. MR. ROGAN: I spoke with the Mayor on this quite a bit. And normally I would feel the same way that Councilman Gaughan does. But I know Mayor Evans has been an advocate for the walkability study in the downtown for quite some time. I know I am certainly not an expert on this subject matter. But I know that Mayor Evans has put more time into this issue than I think the rest of us on Council combined . He's really been an advocate for this. And as somebody who lives in the downtown I think he has firsthand experience that others don't, you know. And I do appreciate the Mayor and the Business Administrator giving an explanation on why a higher bidder was picked for this. And, you know, sometimes cheapest isn't the best. I think this is one of those situations . So I commend the Mayor on his work on this issue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 And it's something that's not talked about quite a bit, but over the last 10 years there has been a transformation of our downtown where people are now living in the downtown with their businesses that are coming back towards the downtown . And it really is becoming a community . And the walkability study in the downtown throughout the City is something that is really very important . It may not have the appeal of paving a road that you -- something that could you physically see. But this is something that is very important . And I do support this legislation . Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. ATTY. EGAN: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.

ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I just wanted to make a note to Miss Jefferies ' comments before about, you know, how the money is spent. I was just looking again through the backup. And with all of these types of grants with the local share account if they do get that grant funding from the state, there is a thousand dollars baked in here where an audit has to be performed . So it's not like they're just getting a blank check if they do get it and they could spend it in any way they want. MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Public Works? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 ATTY. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-F. ATTY. DEMPSEY : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . As I mentioned last week, I fully support the Recreation Authority of the City of Scranton . I think they are doing an absolutely fantastic job. Under the, you know, misinformation and false information that continually gets put out here every week, I do think as mentioned in the backup here that the overall plan that the administration , the Mayor and the Recreation Authority has for Nay Aug Park is a step in the right direction . As I mentioned last week, I know there some people who are upset that the one pool is going to be filled in. But you have to remember the bigger picture here that there are continuous maintenance problems . Every single year there's maintenance problems . The pool is old. It's very difficult to maintain and take care of. And quite frankly , as somebody who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 has young children a splash park is the way to go. They have a splash park in Dunmore , a splash park in Clarks Summit and there's constantly young children there. It's safe. It's relatively maintenance free. You don't need lifeguards. We're still keeping the one pool with the slides. I think this is a good thing and hopefully with more grant dollars it will come to fruition . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: I would concur. And I would just add even a lot of people will say, when we were kids it was just pools. And they didn't have the technology for these types of splash pads back then. As Councilman Gaughan mentioned , they are cheaper to run. And it provides a better experience , especially for younger children . So I agree the Rec Authority is doing a great job. And just to clear up because this comes up year in and year out, the City does not control Nay Aug Park. The Scranton Recreation Authority runs that park. And I agree they are doing a very good job. And hopefully in a couple years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 we'll have this pool straightened out and a nice splash pad for younger kids. Roll call, please.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Public Works? MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-J. ATTY.

I don't believe we received that response yet. Did we? I'm sorry. I must have missed it. But besides that, this project in the first page of the legislation as I mentioned last week, the bridge right now is at a sufficiency rating of 15.5 out of 100. I think I mentioned about a month or two ago there are actually several bridges throughout the City who have a very low sufficiency ratings . And in a meeting this past summer with Representative Flynn, Mr. Pocius, Mr. Bulzoni , Mr. Gallagher among many other representatives of the City, County, and State, they're doing everything in their power to make sure that these other bridges including the Ash Street bridge get in the pipeline and get grant funding and state funding to get fixed. So I'm very hopeful on that. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Roll call, please. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes.
