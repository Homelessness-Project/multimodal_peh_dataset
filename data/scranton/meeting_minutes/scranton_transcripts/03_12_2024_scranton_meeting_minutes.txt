No business at the time. MR. SMURL: Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. President . I would just like to thank the Scranton Police Department along with DPW for all of their help this past weekend during the Scranton St. Patrick 's Day Parade. I thought they did an outstanding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 job keeping all of the people safe out on the parade route and all the marchers and a everybody , a lot of young families even though it wasn't the best day. It was a little rainy. There were a lot of people that were out there. And I thought our police department and DPW did a great job helping with cleanup afterward s and help set some things up prior to the parade. So I want to thank them. MR. SCHUSTER : I would also like to echo those sentiment s. I do work with the race prior to the parade. And they helped to clear the streets and keep the streets free of cars so the racers are safe and helped with a lot of the cleanup and everything as Mr. King said. So thank you very much to Police, DPW, Fire and all the city workers . MR. MCANDREW : I also like to echo those sentiments. But I also have two quick announcements . So the Ukrainian Club on Railroad Avenue, Scranton , Sunday, March 24th from two to five is going to have their second annual Easter Ham and Kielbasa raffle. It will be -- they'll have 15 raffle rounds, which means 15 winners will win one 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 pound ham and two rings of kielbasa . And then also our friends at Friends of the Poor will have their annual Easter Food Basket Giveaway. It will be held Tuesday , March, 26th. We'll have two spots -- I'm sorry, the Scranton Cultural Center and then the drivethrough distribution ; maximum of four families per car and one Easter basket per family. That's all I have, Mr. President . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. President , I have one other one. This was sent to us from Channel Kearse who is the Outreach Coordinator for the City of Scranton . This coming Saturday there will be as part of the Sprucin up Scranton project , Saturday , March 16th, there will be a cleanup . And they're meeting at Tripp Park at 2199 Dorothy Street. I believe they're meeting at 10:15 a.m. If anyone is interested in volunteering to help out with the cleanup over in that section -- Tripp Park section of Scranton . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : You know what, while 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 we're talking about Tripp Park section of Scranton , Frank, can you reach out to maybe the Business Administrator Eileen Cipriani , see if the Tripp Park Community Center has reached out to them for any Community Center money. I know they replaced half of their roof that needed repairs a year or so ago. And they were looking for some money to complete the rest of the roof. So if we could just find out an update on if that is occurring or if any communication is happening with the Community Center. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to them. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Union contracts are still not on the website . For the firefighters it's now 344 days and for the police it's 228 days. And speaking of things that are over due, is the pocket park ready for prime time? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. SMURL: I know it was open, but I don't -- the one downtown ? MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah. MR. SMURL: I know they opened it right before the parade. I don't know if it's 100 percent . I know they were suppose d to put in a couple other benches or something was supposed to be -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Just a suggestion , I saw somewhere in the paper I believe that it was going to be opened or dedicated to Mayor Doherty . I think I have a different idea. I mean, if there needs to be ribbon cutting and, you know, pictures taken, you know, that's fine. But why don't we dedicate that park to our hometown heros, our first respond ers, people who have died, you know, serving their country . You could even get banners and put them up, you know, Captain Robeson , a firefighter ; John Wilding , a police officer ; and there are others. And I just think that would be a nice gesture and also it would be an opportunity to educate the, you know, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Scranton public, especially our children about the legacy they've inherited , so just a thought . I was very pleased to see in the paper that the credit rating for the city has gone up two notches . That's excellent . I also saw in the story that S and P, Standard and Poors still has words of caution . One of the things they pointed out was the 7 million dollar damage to our infrastructure and last year's flooding events. And, you know, one of the problems the city's had systemically has been the long-term neglect of its infrastructure . This building is a case in point, okay. The firehouse s were neglected over time. Our park system was neglected over time, Nay Aug pool. So I'm hoping that, you know, in the euphoria of this good news that we still have leaders who are willing to, you know, look down the road. And as difficult as it may be to dedicate funding towards some of these long-term infrastructure project s, we start doing it. I also saw in the paper, you know, that the Mayor is looking to increase the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 number of electronic vehicle charging station s in the Linden Parking Garage. And I think that's a very good thing. I no longer drive so I don't really have skin in this game. But I wonder has anybody been thinking about the number of downtown residents who do drive and are going to need a place to charge their vehicles 10, 20 years from now when they've converted over to electronic vehicles ? Maybe this is a conversation the city can start having with the aid of the Chamber of Commerce with all of these private developer s. They need to be coming up with a plan of how they're going to provide a charging station opportunity for all of these downtown residents . You know, you've got all of these medical student s and student s from, you know, the University of Scranton . You're going to turn around twice. There's going to be a lot of electric vehicles in the city. And this could impact, you know, who wants to rent downtown or buy a downtown apartment . So I'd like to see that happen. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Has there been any further information on the pollution of Roaring Brook and the Lackawanna River and any attempts by DEP and Pennsylvania American Water to initiate a cleanup? Nothing yet? MR. SMURL: I've heard nothing yet on the cleanup. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, I'd hate to see that thing, you now, go to the back burner because so much work was done to clean up the Lackawanna River. And finally , do we have any takers or have you made a decision on the RFP for financial forecasting ? I know we had something like five bids come in. They were due on February 29th. Have we gotten any further on that? Anybody -- anything from the administration ? MR. SMURL: I did watch it online, the bid opening s but nothing on if they've chosen anybody . MS. HODOWANITZ : Have the property tax bills gone out yet? MR. SMURL: I don't know. MS. HODOWANITZ : Does anybody know when they're due to go out? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. MCANDREW : I thought it was the end of February . MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm sorry? MR. MCANDREW : My understanding was, like, the end of February , early March the last I heard. That was the last I heard. MS. HODOWANITZ : You haven't received yours because I still want to see tax relief for the flood victims. MR. KING: I got mine. I don't know, my tax bill for 2024. MR. SMURL: Oh. MS. HODOWANITZ : You did? MR. KING: Yeah. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, I don't own property so I don't see them anymore . But I am concern ed about tax relief for flood victims . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Joan. MR. SMURL: Joan, I think that was all completed by Friday -- by the ninth. We had six months to do that. And I believe the paperwork is all finished . MR. KING: Frank, can we check with Scranton Tomorrow and ask them about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 dedication of the pocket park, get and update at least? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a date, yes. MR. SMURL: Next is Ramalda Lovely. MS. LOVELY: Hi, everyone . My name is Rashida Lovely. And I'm the Director of Operations for the Black Chamber of Commerce as well as the Director of Operations for NEPA PAC. I'm also the CEO of a nonprofit called A Free Foundation . And what I was hoping to discuss today was this affordable housing issue that we have in Scranton , not low income but affordable housing . So as a person that runs a lot of social programs , juvenile reaffirmation, emergency rent payments , bereavement services , we find that there's a lot of commonality in a lot of the issues and it seems to lead back to housing and security . So according to the data, the average single -- the median single income in Scranton is $23,000 a year and the median household income is $44,800 a year. Rent on average is about $700. But that is pretty much 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 stagnant . No one is moving out of their $700 a month rent property and so rent's moving toward upwards of $1,200 to $1,500 a month which is unaffordable . So what we would like to do is we would like to affect real change. We're not interested in having developers come in and try to do the same 80/20 models that they've been doing for decades . That doesn't work. We don't need 20 percent affordable and 80 percent luxury. What we need is true affordable housing . So how do we get there? Thanks to Congress man Cartwright, his vision, he wants to see green affordable housing with partnerships with Nebula, which is finally here in the Luzerne County area. And we would like to do this right here in the City of Scranton . We don't want to look to other cities to figure out our issues. We want to figure them out for ourselves. We need to be progressive in how we approach it. And so one of the ways that we would like to see this done is we would like to go into the poor areas. We don't want to continue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 revitalizing downtown . We want to go to the poorest areas of the city and we want to revitalize that area. We want to do gentrification but the right way. So how do we do it? We want to be green technology and initial build -- infrastructure built to 18505 zip code. And we would like the Council to consider partner ing with us on this, the municipality . We have the partnership with Nebula to begin this project using the community change grant along with the community -- not community . It's the Climate Reduction Act grants that are going to be available . And it's upwards of 2 billion dollars . So all we're asking for is for the Council people to please consider supporting our efforts to do real affordable housing here. We are going to peg them to median incomes . We're not going to let -- allow it to be market rates. And we're also asking if you look at where we have our ask, we only have two simple asks. We would like you to partner with us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 and the municipality to partner with us and we would like to use the land and properties that's on the land bank to start a pilot program . We don't have a lot of time because our deadlines if you could see at the bottom of the sheet, our deadline s for the Climate Reduction Grant is April 1st. And the Community Change Grant is November -- it's a rolling grant. And it ends November 23rd of this year. We don't have time. What we would like is your support . And we're hoping by next week we could get some kind of answers. And if not, we could still move forward with our initiative but we would like to do it in partnership because again, we need to be partner s in everything together . We want to move the City of Scranton forward together . We don't want to try to do what didn't work before. We don't want that outside developer s doing the same models they've been doing and working on downtown and revitalizing downtown over and over again. We want to represent the entire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 city. So I hope you stand with us to get this thing done and hopefully we'll we get it done pretty soon. MR. SMURL: Thank you. I apologize for your first name. Will you leave your e-mail address and contact with Kathy? Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And last week when I was speaking about the street signs, you know, when you stand here you have no idea what you're saying. You think you know what you're saying. But when I went home and I thought what did I say? So then I listened to the replay and one of the things that I did hear -- that I did not hear while I was here and, you know, Mr. Schuster , I think I heard you say that the $330,000 is spent. And I thought what? It's spent on what? What was the $330 and some-odd dollars spent on? MR. SCHUSTER : So, yeah, I do have -- MS. JEFFRIES : Can you just do that in your time and not mine? I thought about it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 because I lose time when I discuss -- MR. SCHUSTER : I'll have it for you tonight . I do have it here. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay, thank you. So I thought of that of what you had said and I thought where's the money. I think that's a game, where's the money. So that was what I wanted to say. And I also received information from other people about what I had said last week and what I've been saying for six years is that not only are the residents of Scranton at a disadvantage as we ride around and drive around Scranton , but what about the police and fire, our emergency , our Pennsylvania ambulance services ? And I see a Red Responders or something that looks like a new one. You know, these are people that are in an emergency situation to get to people. So I wonder how they're making out. And I know you have a GPS. Most of us have GPS. But you have to think when the GPS says take a right at the left corner, you know, it would be so much better to see the sign up there. So I just wanted to add 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 that too. And I'll wait for your response , Mr. Schuster , on that. Another thing that I -- of a concern of mine. I'm sorry I was late getting here. I do tutor kids after school on Tuesdays so that throws me a little bit late getting here for caucuses . So when I saw that it was on the Pennsylvania -- the parking , that's another thing. I do use the Pango app when I'm downtown . And, Mr. King, no, it doesn't tell you that it's after 5:00. I've had people tell me that -- ask me that. Well, come to Council and tell them about it. It does not anywhere on the app tell you that it's no longer valid after 5:00. Also with everything being just such technology , I don't understand why they just can't program the system. I worked with computers and programming all my career. They could program that computer to just turn it off because they know that they run around there with their, you know, their little guns, you know, to say when we've expired on our parking . So it should be an easy fix for them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 to put and turn those parking meters off at 5:00. Also, their app if anyone uses it, needs improve ment. I'm sorry I wasn't here to see if they did speak on their app. It needs improvement because when you pull up to the kiosk and you take out your app, the first thing it's going to ask you -- it shows you the map of the businesses that you're around. Well, that's good. But then you go to the next screen and it asks you for the zone. What zone are you in? I don't know. So now I got to back up and look up to the zone that's on the little placard over the kiosk. And it will have two or three different zones. I don't know what zone I'm in. You know, I push the first one. Fortunately I've never gotten a ticket. So I guess I'm pushing the right zone. And you're right. You could leave that zone and go to another zone in the city and you don't get charged for that, you know. One of the things that you had said is that it's $1 to park in the garages . I think it's $2 an hour on the street, you know, and I thought I'm paying $2 an hour to park on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the street. And I come down a lot because I like that Commonwealth Coffee Shop down there. So I do come to town a lot to frequent those places. So when I saw that you said $2, and I thought $2, a dollar, well, there is a parking garage across the street. I said maybe I should start going there. But I don't feel safe going into the parking garages . So that was a concern and a aha moment for me when you said that it was $2 in the garage -- I'm sorry, $1 in the garage and I pay two on the street. So that was a concern . So maybe you could just find out, you know, I'm retired. I'm on a fixed income. And, you know, every dollar that I spend is very valuable to me. Now for the newspaper , I'm sorry that Les isn't here tonight when he mentioned about the sports section of the paper not being there and it's all local sports. Well, today they did a quite a big spread on Barkley coming to the Philadelphia Eagles. So as a football fan, I was thrilled to see that. And I'm sure he was as well. So had it not appeared in the paper, I think there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 would have been an uproar with us football fans that they didn't cover it. But they did cover it. And it was in the paper. So I'm sorry -- I'm sure that Les saw it as well. So that's my concerns for tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Laura Augustini. MS. AUGUSTINI : Good evening , Laura Augustini. I live over in Green Ridge. And I'm President of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . I'm here for several different items. The first one is the ordinance that you're looking to pass regarding Deacon Street, the one way to two way on Deacon Street to Sanderson . We are very happy that the Post is doing well. They've been a fabulous asset to our community . And I understand why they want that section to be two way. What I'm requesting is that they add two more stop signs that it's not just the stop signs on Deacon Street but there's also stop signs on Sanderson Avenue. We have people who are coming up from the plot racing to get to the corners and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 either beat the light or they're coming from the corners and heading down to the plot so they could, you know, bypass it to get up to Main Avenue. And I really think that a four-way stop would be extremely appropriate at that location . MR. KING: Excuse me, Laura, you're asking for a four-way stop. MS. AUGUSTINI : At Deacon and Sanderson . MR. KING: Oh, okay. So the (inaudible ) is right there, right? MS. AUGUSTINI : Yeah, that one. Currently it's one way from Sanderson toward the Post. And they've requested -- we have an ordinance to make it two way only from the Post back towards Sanderson . The rest of it would still stay one way. But I think on their end then there will be a stop sign on Deacon facing Sanderson and the same way coming the other way. But I do think that additional stop signs need to be added there. We have had an increase in traffic . I, myself was in a little accident at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 that location . And I did a right to know and found out that there had been 20 accidents over the past 20 years. And there have been four accidents in the past four months. So there is an increase in traffic and an increase in accident s at that location . I also think about no parking for about 30 feet from that intersection would be advantageous ; again, opening up sight lines for safety. The second item I have is on 1615 Monsey Street. We've been trying to get information from zoning and from various people in the administration regarding what is a perceived violation of a zoning ruling. And I've had a really hard time getting anything . I did submit -- I first submitted my request to 311. I then submitted a right-to-know request , you know, getting violations , citations , etc. But it had nothing that occurred in the past year. And it's been reported to 311 and zoning in the past three months that there is perceived violation of the zoning variance that was denied for that location . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I just want to know and the neighbors in that area want to know has somebody checked it out? Was a citation issued, a violation issued? Like, what's going on with that property ? And I just haven't been able to get any answers . Next, as the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association , we look to have the street closed for our Easter egg hunt. I went online to do the event planning form to submit all the -- whatever needed to be done. But there's nothing in the front of that application that tells you all of the items that you need to submit for that event request . So I get to a point, oh, you need insurance , okay. Off we go we get insurance . I can't go any further until I put the insurance in. Next one I get, oh, you need a site plan and an evacuation plan and an emergency plan and all of these other things. I don't even know what else you need because I couldn't get past that. Suggestion , put some kind of a list. You need a million dollars in insurance . You need a site plan. You need an emergency plan and whatever else is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 needed so that when people go to apply for these things, they have them all together and you could go right through the application . We decided not to request a street closure because it became difficult for us to do and I did not have time for it to get to the right people in a timely manner. We did get insurance which was a good thing. And last but not least, the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association is hosting an egg hunt on Saturday , March 23rd at Pretzel Park at 1:00 p.m., all are invited . We do request preregistration . And you could do that by e-mailing the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . That's it. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we contact the zoning office and find out what's going on with that 1615 Monsey Street? MR. VOLDENBERG : I made note of it. I'll reach out in the morning . MR. SMURL: And also, might as well do a traffic -- see if they're doing a traffic study at Deacon and Sanderson if there hasn't been one there for a four-way stop sign. MR. VOLDENBERG : Yeah, I'll have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 city engineer do a traffic study. And I'm not sure. He might be able to amend the legislation if it's approved . MR. SMURL: And one last thing, I believe Scott Gassenmeyer , Director of Parks has a list when they do different events at the parks. I believe there is a list put together . If you would e-mail him and if there is, would you e-mail it to the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Mark Margavitch . MR. MARGAVITCH : All right. Good evening . I want to talk about the rental ordinance of 2022. Mr. Smurl, I know this was the week before you were appointed . But I just was wondering , does anyone know how the rental registrations are being handled from the new ordinance that was passed, past years are being handled ? Does anyone know? Prior years? Because the way it looks like -- and first of all, I think it's unfortunate that you got hit in 2023 with everything from the old ordinance . I don't think it's fair to be hit back from many years. You know, I got a bill 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 for $970 when I never got a bill before. That was the first bill I got. Second, I believe this ordinance says it will -- repealed the old one but doesn't state anything about old -- old rental registrations from past years. So I don't even know if it's enforceable anymore. It doesn't even say anything about the old whatever was existing . Does anyone have an idea because I have three other properties in the City of Scranton . I got one from 2016 and up. I got one from 2019 and up. And I got one from 2020 and up. So does anyone know when that was voted on or what the current -- I guess what they're doing in the rental registration ? MR. MCANDREW : I'm trying to recall. I'm not guaranteeing that I'm right. But I thought they were exonerated , the previous ones. Was that our understanding that the ones prior would -- MR. MARGAVITCH : I just recently got a third one, you know, I was waiting for it. MR. MCANDREW : Like I said, I'm not sure. It's in my mind. I might have heard it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 that way or read it that way. But I knew that past ones might have been exonerated . But that is something we could check, someone could check. MR. MARGAVITCH : No one else knows about that? MR. MCANDREW : I just recall that. I might be wrong. It might go back farther or before that. But I do remember seeing something to that effect. MR. MARGAVITCH : Okay, because I do have an idea actually . I made something today. I think this is how they might be doing the rental registrations . I'm not sure. But as you could see, 2016 is a pretty big piece of the pie. So I think they just give it a spin. I owe 2017 and up. So I'm not sure. It's just a hunch. But if someone could look into that seriously . I do have -- I'm going to court this week. So if I could find out, reach out to someone and find out before I go to court I'm actually responsibile for because I got three different properties with three different amounts . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. SCHUSTER : So each of those properties , they go back to a different year. MR. MARGAVITCH : Yes, and they were all owned prior to 2016. So it wasn't like I just bought the property only from that year on. So they were owned prior to 2016. So if we could get some answers . Is there anyone I could follow up with before the 15th before I go to the magistrate so I could have something when I go there? MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Voldenberg , could reach out and ask, I mean, or take a dive into the ordinance . But like I said, I'm not sure what I remember . I just remember there was some dialogue in there where they might have been satisfied . Maybe I'm wrong. But it sticks if my head a little bit. MR. MARGAVITCH : Even the 2022 ordinance . MR. MCANDREW : No, the ones prior to the updated ordinance . That's all -- I don't have it in front of me. But I kind of remember something to that effect. The actual dates I don't remember , just prior to the new ordinance and the new process .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. MARGAVITCH : Now, when you say -- was that in the ordinance of 2022 or no? MR. MCANDREW : I'm not sure. It might have been part of a dialogue we had maybe in caucus or maybe when it was presented to us. I just remember something to that effect. I'm not positive . I can't say yes to you and be wrong. It's a possibility . That's why I said, you know, we could look at it. MR. MARGAVITCH : I did actually -- I ran into a few other people that owned houses prior and they only got 2023 and up. So there is a lot of inconsistency with -- MR. SCHUSTER : Frank -- Mr. Voldenberg , all of that's going through Robin Selemba , correct , because she's the rental -- what's her title -- her actual title? MR. VOLDENBERG : Rental Registration Manager . MR. SCHUSTER : And she would be handling all of this. Is she taking -- have you reached out to her? MR. MARGAVITCH : No. No. I don't feel too comfortable with that office. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. That would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the office that would handle that. I would think you would get a clear answer from that office. MR. MARGAVITCH : No, I understand . But even when I tried to get my permit back in January , I was told about a letter of recommendation and that's nowhere on the website either that I needed a letter of recommendation but I was told that. MR. SCHUSTER : So I think the rental is -- it may be all through the -- rental is one piece. They're just doing rentals. And then you're talking Licensing and Inspections . MR. MARGAVITCH : I'm just saying in general I don't like to go left when I walk into the building . MR. SCHUSTER : Gotcha. MR. MARGAVITCH : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Brian Skutnick . MR. SKUTNICK : So a whole bunch of right to knows I did basically for the performance logs that they do. The first one you'll see, this is the employee that resigned that you guys had a seven-page letter from a while back that you guys obviously remember .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 If you look at it from 10:40 to 11:00 a.m., this employee had another member of code enforce ment go to her house taking pictures of her at home during his shift to report back what she was doing. She was later brought in and questioned by the city's HR, the HR assistant, two attorneys , two union representatives there, Oleski, and I believe Selena at the time before you guys got rid of her. Okay, so let's just keep that in mind for that -- the 20 minutes there. Next you'll see a picture of a vehicle from the city parked at Nay Aug. MR. SCHUSTER : So she was questioned about that -- MR. SKUTNICK : Why was there a 20 minute lapse in her day? They tried to discipline her. They were going to suspend her, everything . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thanks. MR. SKUTNICK : So just to keep that in mind there. So next you'll see a vehicle parked at Nay Aug. After that you'll see what looks like an individual digging in a garbage 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 can at Nay Aug, a little weird to you guys? No, even better, are you ready for that one? Next, you'll see the activity log for that inspector . Now let me just point out the pictures are not mine since the city claims victim on everything and it's, oh, we were being stalked in a public park. So Mike over there will talk in a little bit where he took the pictures and watched . Next, you'll see the activity log where this inspector document ed they did nothing from 9:55 to 11:05, an hour and 10 minutes no questions asked. Why? Because they parked their vehicle , took off their city attire and went digging recyclables out of the garbage cans at Nay Aug. The same inspector was reported to be going to the University of Scranton on Monday mornings with his city vehicle to pick up the used kegs from the beer parties at the university because he's using them for scrap. That's the inspector that is going to look into see what another one is doing for a 19 minute lapse so they could go home and change a tampon? But that's the conduct . So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 now we'll continue there. Next you'll see another one for another inspector . This one is actually -- they are all stapled together . There's several . And you'll see perfect night for Virgil to be here because he could attest to it. A whole bunch of city cars were parked at a restaurant in South Side a month back. I submitted a right to know because I have a garage right there where I keep all of my toys. City tells me when I talk to Selena, there's no misconduct in this department . So I did a right to know. They fought me and told me it was safety concern for me to know where the city inspect ors were. It's not a safety concern for me to know two months ago where the city inspector was where I have the picture s of it. So where were they? If you look at those activity logs, they all stopped working around 11 and didn't return to work until about 2:00 because they enjoyed a 3-hour lunch at Sacco's. That's everybody in here paying for that lunch. MR. SMURL: Please, no outburst s or I'll have you removed . Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. SKUTNICK : So you have Andrew Sunday who's the manager over there submitted an affidavit as part of one of my right to knows on February 8th. And his affidavit stated it is my personal practice to gauge general productivity when it came to the right to know -- or the activity logs. What is he gauging because he's clearly not looking at activity logs if there is three hour lapses. It's theft. So how about some legislature and maybe hire an auditor like you did with the gas receipts years back where the city did their own internal audit and couldn't find anything . But miraculously we hire an outside auditor and there's thousands missing for gas years ago. So next you'll see another activity log for an inspector 1:20 to 2:20 on a day, an hour to look for violations . Every single person could leave here, go a different direction and find a violation in this city in 3 minutes . But for an hour this one couldn't find one in a vehicle ? You know what I mean? Virgil posts them every day. Does he want -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 can he do a ride along, maybe teach them how to do their job because they can't find anything . So what do you do? When you report them, code enforcement gets aggravate d and claims they're being harassed , they're being stalked because they're being called out by the misconduct . So you see next another picture and an activity log to go with it that says this employee was on lunch from 12 to 1:00. So what do they do with their lunch break, well, they're the South Side inspector . They did a call before their lunch on Prospect , a call after their lunch on Beech Street. But they make sure to come and park at my house for their lunch break. That's not harassing a citizen because they're reporting what you are doing? So, I mean, there needs to be oversight . There's clearly not oversight . Every time you file a right to know it's denied because it's a safety concern or it doesn't exist. And then it goes through the appeal process and the city looks like fools. I have nine appeals. I've won every single one so far 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 that's been returned back because the city just lies consistently to hide the misconduct instead of saying, hey, we have a problem here. I mean, you have four activity logs that confirm they were all doing nothing for three hours together . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Sean McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : How are you? Sean McAndrew , taxpayer . I'm also a Scranton School Board Director . So I first want to say I'm speaking on my behalf, not on behalf of the entire board. I spoke here a few months ago regarding the homeless camps on Olive Street and the Heritage Trial. I first want to ask City Council has anything been done to address this issue? Okay. I also attended a meeting with Police Chief, Fire Chief, administrators from the district and representative s from Council . I did ask to look into maybe an ordinance banning homeless camps at least maybe a thousand feet from school property . So I was wondering if that has been complet ed or has been looked at all by any chance? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. SMURL: Sean, I haven't heard anything about that at all, sorry. MR. KING: Sean, I will tell you we -- I forwarded some information on a potential ordinance today to our Solicitor that could hopefully address some of the concerns you're expressing now. MR. MCANDREW : Awesome . I appreciate that. MR. SCHUSTER : Sean, last night or yesterday at about 4:00, me and Mr. Smurl met with the police department , the railroad , some of the city administration , the Solicitor from the city. So it's been -- there's been conversation . MR. MCANDREW : It's moving, okay. I ask because when I spoke with Council I express ed my concern s regarding , you know, the issues that are going on there. Every day our student s walk by and then it's a dangerous area, especially when they go to and from Scranton High. I also express ed the safety issues for our resident s who enjoy walking or running the trail but also our cross county runners who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 use it for practice . And unfortunately it was brought to my attention last night that either Thursday or Friday one of our cross country members was harassed and almost assaulted by an individual around the homeless camps. The safety of our student s have always and will always be my number one priority . And I know the safety of our resident s and our student s are definitely , you know, everybody 's priority up here. So I'm begging for an ordinance to be looked into banning it from all properties for schools , day cares, colleges and other measurement s taken in place, maybe more patrol. I don't know. We would probably have to talk to the police department because I feel like enough is enough. I'm not sure if any of you have visited those areas yet. But if you have to, you know, I definitely suggest you do because it's very eye opening . You know, I did -- when I did speak with administration , I was told that, you know, they can't just take down -- the tents or they can't go through them because of they have rights and you need warrant s. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 But I do ask, you know, if that was a taxpayer 's property , you know, the code official s would be there. We would be getting fines and tickets and quality of life citations . So I'm wondering, you know, if that's going to be people -- we're saying that's the residents , why aren't we doing the same, because again, if it was my property or your property or anybody else's property , I'm sure they would be having a field day with writing tickets . To me this is just the tip of the iceberg . It's just a matter of, you know, if, not when something more tragic happens . And I'm hoping we could work together as a community to look into this and try to stop this. You know, the trail was built for our residents and our student s to enjoy it, not fear it. And, you know, begging for the Council , the administration , and school district to work together to come up with a solution because , you know, this is unsanitary and it's unsafe and our kids and our community deserve a little bit better. So if you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 any questions for me, you know, I could talk to you after. MR. MCANDREW : Because of contractual -- an event that I had to stay yesterday at work, I was unable to go to the homeless meeting . Was it discussed about -- because I know we've thrown this around about creating an ordinance -- and, guess what, cities across the county have done it with success creating an ordinance that prevents homeless camps near day cares, schools. And I agree with you, it's not if. It's just when. It's getting very close to that. And I know these meetings are probably going to be productive and I hope they are. But these meeting s like every other meeting is we got to form a committee . We got to do a study. We got to start planning . We got to, you know, provide housing . That takes months, maybe years. But it only takes a second to hurt a student . And if that almost happened the other day, it's unacceptable. So in Fifth Order, I'll make a motion that we explore an ordinance -- and I know Mr. King spoke earlier with regards to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 river, an ordinance to protect our rivers. But I think this needs to be part of that. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, it did happen. I mean, our student was physically -- I believe a phone was slapped out of their hands when they were trying to walk away. So again, yes, it could have been a lot worse. And hopefully , God bless, it will never will be. Another thing I know we talked -- somebody spoke about affordable housing . I completely understand . But I do think a lot of these times when these discussion s are happening, I don't think the school district is ever invited or have a seat at the table because wherever that location will be, a lot of families might be living there. There might be student s. So depending on the area, who knows what school in that vicinity that they would go to if there's capacity or not. So I think maybe when those discussions are taking place if our superintendent or our administration could be invited because we could definitely put some input if -- in case schooling -- obviously schooling would be needed to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 sure we have room for everybody . MR. SCHUSTER : So, Mr. McAndrew , you may or may not know this. So I've been asking questions about homeless encampments for over a year now. I've been getting different answers all over the place. The last time the Mayor was here, she did let us know that she's had a task force that's been around for over a year which was news to me. This task force is going to be meeting I think next. And some of the question s that came up last night they said they were going to bring back to the task force. It's yet to be seen what this task force is going to accomplish . But do you know if the school district has any representative s on that task force? MR. MCANDREW : I've never heard of a task force. Is it a safety task force overall ? I'm not sure what -- MR. SCHUSTER : A task force to address the homeless . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, no, I would love the district to have a seat at the table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 because again, it surrounds , especially on Olive Street surrounds our school. But I have not been made aware of that. But again, I know, but again I know if we're contact ed, I'm sure our district would love to participate and help out as much as we can because we succeed , you succeed and vice versa. We're all here together . And, you know, a positive community would bring more families in here and put more kids in our district . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I know some of the makeup that we were told on that task force is some of the -- I don't know if you want to call them nonprofit s, but some of the groups that are -- some of the agencies that are helping with the issue, social services , the Keystone Mission , things like that. But I didn't hear if there was a school district representative -- MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, no, I mean, again, as much as we could help I would love to help. I just hope we're more helping than enabling and I think we need to come together and make some real change here. So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 appreciate everybody 's time. Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That is all for the sign-in sheet. Anybody else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I just wanted to touch back quickly . About a year ago we had the request from the landfill from the leachate and possibly putting the leachate into the creeks. And there was a big hubbub about the -- whether or not it would go to the Scranton Sewer Authority -- the former Scranton Sewer Authority and be treated there or else it would be reverse osmosis treated and then dumped into our rivers that go through Nay Aug Park. Has there been any feedback whatsoever , followup on the request for dumping large amounts of leachate into our waterways? MR. SMURL: Not that I know of. MR. COYNE: Okay. Now to move on, tonight instead of the normal subject s I'm going to go off kilter from them. What I want to talk about is a group called Be The Match. No, that's not a dating site. That's the old name for the national marrow donor program .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 A number of years ago I signed up for the program . There was a kid down in Maryland who needed a donor and I went in with a bunch of other people. And we all did the cheek swabs. Well, I was not the match for that one. But I went on vacation . I was out at Crater of Diamonds Park digging for diamond s and I got a phone call. I actually matched a person with six of their antigens , which is what they use to search to see whether or not you're compatible . From that point I came back, had a blood test done. And I wound up being a match for the donor. This was a lady in Germany who had Acute myelodysplastic leukemia . To give you an idea of what that is, the body starts kicking out malformed blood cells, which blood cells, red blood cells that don't have the capability to fight infection or to carry oxygen. And what happens as these malformed cells continue to produce , they actually block out the cells that are doing the real good job on the body and slowly but surely they lose the capability of transmitting oxygen through iron 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 and fighting infections and eventually they die. It was a scary thought when I got that call. But I learned a lot of things in the process . First part of it is a cheek swab. That's all that it is. That gives six leukocyte antigens , HLAs, which are -- they use for initial matching . And you get a blood draw when you are selected as one of those few people who might be a match. And they look for ten matching -- the ten matching segments . The more matches , the less likely there's going to be rejection . At that point when you are confirmed, you get scheduled . They schedule a person to have their bone marrow destroyed . And your bone marrow is basically put into that person's body. The old way that used to be done that everyone fears about is used to chuck into the hip, take bone marrow out of the leg. And it was a process where they had to break into the leg bone and all of that stuff. So there's a lot of fear behind it. But that's not how it's actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 done these days. Ninety percent of the time what is done is they put forth a product called filgrastim into your system. You get five injections five days before donating . It causes the stem cells in your marrow to flood your blood system. And just like donating blood or more of like donating blood plasma, they take the blood out of the arm. It gets filtered in a machine , return back into the other arm minus those stem cells. For five days you feel like an old man with arthritis because of the superproduction of the stem cells. They secrete and bend over. But after that, it's done. The process for donating you sit in a chair for five to eight hours, watch TV, listen to the radio or sleep, in one arm, out the other. A sandwich size package is all that winds up being taken out. And from that one action, you can save a life. It costs absolutely nothing to get on the registry to get a cheek swab and to be out there so that anyone in the community can have the ability 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 not only to save any member of this community but anyone else in the world. And I would ask that people take the time out knowing it is no longer an evasive situation that all it is is the same as donating blood to take the time out and be a donor to save someone else's life. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . This morning in the paper there was an announcement . There was a robbery up on Main Avenue where there was some shooting and the one victim succumbed to his injuries . So I don't know, it kind of sounds like that guy might have been a schizophrenic off of his meds or something . I don't know why you have to shoot somebody but -- if you have a gun and you're going to rob them anyway. But it's just a shame. Hopefully -- hopefully things will work out better in the future. PA Water -- and Tommy also brought up about the DeNaples dumping water over that would run under 380 area and for the entrance to it and down into Nay Aug creek which runs into the gorge. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 I don't think that is entirely necessary . I think they're making enough money that they could pay to send that water down to the sewage treatment plant. If they don't like that, raise the rates for New Jersey and New York trash. As far as the big spill with all of that sludge that they flushed out of the dam, you know, fining them you're just going to pay more. You're going to pay more for your water. They'll figure in their operating costs and a good time will be had by all except for the ratepayers. So my point is maybe what we should do is go over the board of directors and they should be kicked off the board of director s at PA American Water and someone take it over that is willing to run it responsibly . You know, probably millions of dollars , maybe millions a month are spent on water bills in Scranton for clean water and to preserve nature and everything else. And a good time's had by all except one again the ratepayers, double bills, destroyed sidewalks , destroyed curbs. They 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 took my hundred year old curb out which my biggest problem was some ya-ya from cross the street with his fat mobile parking up -- trying to park up on my sidewalk . He got told about it. So fortunately he moved because then he was throwing garbage out of his car in the front. And I'm glad he's gone. But, you know, there's a big chunk of the curb missing . And somebody will see that modified stone laying there and that they just threw on top of it all and, oh, that looks like a driveway , ooh, yeah. You know, and some day maybe a city inspector will come by and see it (inaudible .) And a good time will be had by me. And once again, 501C3s and C4s, please do your work. And a lot of it's very admirable . But there's a few that want to come up with bright ideas that are going to cost a lot of money and just result in a little ornamentation here and there or a streetscape. Don't run my life. Don't run my town. Not needed. If you want to contribute , then work in your area and that's it. And by the way, don't rag over flags up here. Call 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 your representatives . Call representatives out of the area and ask for Ukraine rescue immediately . Putin is taking over. He has 25 percent of the world grain production . Ukraine is another 20 percent . The more he has the more he uses to just cause trouble . Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher , citizen of the city. Norma is big on this first item that I have because of the corner -- the corner that has the Salvation Army, catty-corner Great Temptations , wonderful bakery. And then there is an electronic store and catty-corner from that is a warehouse . Now, I came home and I pulled out a map so I could find out what those streets are. Now that's a pretty big I think corner. And there wasn't a single sign. It turns out that they are Hickory Street, South Washington , and I don't know what the other two were -- remember what the other two were. But I would think it would be nice to have some identification there. But then on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 the -- I'll go further and it used to be before they did some work, I think it was all -- I don't know all what they did. But they took the -- when you're coming from Bellevue and crossing that street, they used to have signs. One was turn right, go left, or go ahead. Now there's nothing up there. So, I almost got my car and I almost got smashed one day because I was going straight out and so was somebody else. And, you know, it just -- it needs something . And the drain that is at the corner where Great Temptations is, is we had some rain and you have to swim. I don't know when the last time that drain was cleaned out. It was well over a whole lane. And that leads me to the drainage . Do we -- do we have a schedule for when the drains are cleaned out? I mean, I remember one of the big things in for the summer when I was a kid was seeing the guy come down with a big thing and they would take the grill off the stormwater basin and go in there and then get out all kinds of stuff and put it in a garbage truck.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 And I don't know if they even do that at all anymore. I think that has to be looked into because there's too many -- too many drains that make you have to walk down the block to get back onto the sidewalk . And now, have we received any recent reports from our lobbyist and from our nurse that -- MR. SCHUSTER : I had asked I think two weeks ago and I just got the answer yesterday . So I could report that out. MS. SCHUMACHER : So that will -- are you going to do that now or is it going to be in Third Order next week? MR. SCHUSTER : Actually I'm thinking some of the answers are long. So maybe, Frank, if we could get it into Third Order next week. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And do we have something on the Licensing and Inspections ? I mean, for the last I don't know how many weeks that's what we've been talking about. I'm surprised we haven't heard anything tonight yet. But do we have any statistics , like, how many of the people that went out and did things were not qualified to do it? Do we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 know how many there are? MR. SCHUSTER : I'd say a week ago we got some dates when that one inspector was given his license . And we got an answer that the inspector s operate under Mr. Oleski and Mr. Sunday. MR. SMURL: All of the inspectors are license d. And they all passed the test -- all of our current inspectors . Unless there's a new hire. I don't know if -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, I hope we keep on that. And I will see you next week. Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can we see if we could contact DPW about the schedule for drainage cleanout when they do that? And we should probably also look into -- I agree with Mrs. Schumacher . When you're coming from Bellevue West Side, it used to be delineated exactly which lane was turning and which one was right. Now, I can't even remember which one was the turning lane and which one is the straight lane. So it's potluck. MR. SCHUSTER : When it comes to -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 it's South Washington that when you come across that bridge there coming from Bellevue , the South Washington intersection we got -- actually we got a couple of different people. I think we got an e-mail quite a while back and then I think someone brought it up here. But didn't we get an answer back saying that that was going to be paved and the lines would be put back once it was paved? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . It will be paved. And it has to be 45 degrees and warmer to do the line markings . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, but we did get that. We didn't get a date on -- MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we didn't. MR. SCHUSTER : And then the drain was I think Marie might have bought it up once before. Did we ever get an answer on the drain or do we know if they went down at that -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I could check. I don't believe so. But I could have them go out on that drain. MR. SCHUSTER : I feel like that was probably in the fall. Thank you, Frank. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. LAFRANCE : Good evening , Council , Pat LaFrance , city resident . I was hoping Mr. Scutnick would have stayed because he has some document ation on what I wanted to ask about tonight . Back on the February -- two weeks ago on the February 27th meeting , Mr. Smurl, Mr. Scutnick provided a picture of your Smurl plumbing truck in Mr. Oleski's detail shop. And I would like to know because of my further dealing s with the city down the road, I need to know about did you lie to the public at that meeting ? MR. SMURL: About what? MR. LAFRANCE : Well, what had happened is, the picture of your truck in Tom Oleski's detail appeared and Mr. Scutnick -- your response to Mr. Scutnick was, oh, Tom Oleski owns a -- and I think you said body shop first but then you said detail. You were unaware of it. Mr. Scutnick has some documents of an e-mail to Council from him and also another person who complained about this before that truck was in the shop. And you were involved 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 in that e-mail and everybody else in Council was involve d in that e-mail. And that e-mail went from Council to Mr. Voldenberg and back to the two and it was told this is a personnel affair so you can't get involved . So you knew about that shop in August. And you told the people at the City Council meeting , oh, he has a body shop? Oh, he has a detail shop? Did you lie to the people? MR. SMURL: I still don't believe it's his detail shop. MR. LAFRANCE : Oh, if it's not, and I'm wrong and I will say that. Is that -- is there further details the public should know about that? MR. SMURL: Well, I don't believe I should explain where I have my trucks detailed and where the work is done. That was my partner 's truck for one. And the -- I can't remember the name of it, nor would I say it on Council because -- but what's the problem with having a truck detailed -- MR. LAFRANCE : Well, it's not a problem with me, sir. It's not a problem with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 me. How long have you been in Scranton , 20 years let's say, 15 years? For 15, 20 years in South Scranton I watched Gerald Smurl Plumbing and Heating , Gerald Smurl Plumbing and Heating , City of Scranton , Gerald Smurl Plumbing and Heating . All of a sudden -- somebody brings up a questionable ethic's agreement -- situation . And all of a sudden, no, that's my partner . It's Gerald Smurl and partner . This is an ethic's situation , sir. Do you have a personal relationship with Tom Oleski? MR. SMURL: Personal relationship , no, I do not. MR. LAFRANCE : No? Do you have a business relationship with Gerald Smurl Plumbing and Tom Oleski supposed body shop? MR. SMURL: I have no idea who owns the shop. I don't believe it's him. MR. LAFRANCE : Okay. Well, I'll look into that because that's the first I'm hearing it. So I will, you know, because I don't want to blame anybody who's not at fault. So I will look into that. But I just wanted to ask you. I noticed that while it was going on. And I'm, like, wait a second. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. And if I'm wrong I'll look into and I'll apologize to you. But that's what I saw at the Council meeting so I figured I'd question it. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Sure. Anyone else? MS. LABROSKY : Good evening , Council , Lynn Labrosky , Scranton homeowner and business owner. I didn't come really prepared with anything tonight . I've been listening to the last few couple months of the City Council meetings . And in last few weeks I've been hearing a lot about code enforcement . I've been up here several times back in 2022. And we had some code enforcement issues, zoning issues and nothing ever got done. My husband and I ended up having to seek an injunction , hire a lawyer, spend thousands of dollars out of pocket which we never recovered . And even after zoning weighed in our favor, the property is still being used as the person wants to use it for. So you could go back in your records and check on that. I, myself also have written to Right to Know. There's no records . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 I received photos from the Right to Know which were photos I took. All the times I reached out to 311 or code enforcement , no one ever went out and took photos. The only photos unless you could find some are the ones that again, I took. I took the liberty the other day of going the way I normally go to work and between my home and my business it's 1.6 miles. So luckily for me I save a little gas there. But I couldn't go a block without seeing a code violation , not one block. And the garbage is just -- it's starting to look like Philadelphia . There's garbage everywhere in this city. It's really disrespectful . So the next day I went a different route to work. And again, 1.6 miles; and I couldn't go a block in the other direction without seeing a code violation . I happen to live one block away from Tom Oleski, the Code Enforcement Director . And I know for a fact that the person I had the issue with, they know each other. When I tried to present that to Mayor Cognetti 's office and City Council , I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 called a conspiracy theorist . I was actually told a while back by Mayor Cognetti 's at the time assistant he kept, saying we, we, we. And I said, Who's we? And he said, You know, we, the royal we. So that's our government. They think they're royal. And this -- the residents of Scranton don't matter. I'm a lifelong resident of the City of Scranton . I went to school here. I raised four children here. All four of my children moved out of Scranton . My oldest son bought a home. He has two children . I have two grandchildren . And I warned him not to buy a house in Scranton . Two years later he moved to Pittston . None of my kids are in Scranton anymore. It's just sad. It just makes me sad the corruption that goes on, especial ly in code enforcement because again, I live a block away from the Director . The house on the right of him is code violations . The house on the left of him is code violation s. The whole back alley is filled with garbage and debris and code violations . Cars parked on the corner where 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 the bank is and you can't see to get out to make the turn. There's some furniture on the other side. I believe I saw Mr. Oleski put some -- looked like maybe some dressers out there the other day right in front of his house. And when I came back through a little while later, some of that furniture was on the other side of the street in front of the home where there was a murder. Now, I heard from some neighbors in my block that Mr. Oleski knew what was going on at that house. There was people dancing in the street in their underwear high on meth in the middle of the hours of the morning . And you would think that the Code Enforcement Director would have done something about that before the murder happened . So it's just very dishearten ing to know that somebody that's a director of a department can't do their job. And I guess that's why I came tonight because I've been hearing a lot of this. And I'm sure there's more people in the City of Scranton that would agree with the things that are going on. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 I, myself have seen Mr. Oleski detailing vehicle s out of his back alley. And I'm sure most people wouldn't get away with that or whatever he does back there. I don't know. I would just think that you'd want a code enforcer that is going to enforce the codes. So I'm out of time, but thank you. Appreciate it. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. LITTLE: Hello. I'm Rick Little. Why do we have a court reporter here? MR. SMURL: That's our stenographer . MR. LITTLE: Pardon me? MR. SMURL: They may be doing it from here tonight . I don't know -- MR. SCHUSTER : It's our Council stenographer . She does all of our meetings . She had a Civil Service Commission meeting next door. So she decided to stay for our meeting . So this is the first time -- might be the first time you're seeing her in person. MR. LITTLE: You're doing it live tonight . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah. MR. LITTLE: Well, that's good. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 That's good because the thing everybody needs most is transparency . Transparenc y in the government, city, county, state, national and in our courts. Lots of times people get scared of the Courts because they can't afford them. Courts are actually a business -- became a business around the time bar association s came in around the time of the 14th Amendment , around the time when big setup for equality was being set up which is going onto this day. I'm 33 days homeless . And it's freezing to death. It's you get out of the Catholic Services filter and you're just hoping that a bus will come and you realize it's Sunday and there's no buses on Sunday. You just lose all sense of time. But it lets you focus on recurring sites and people, like the court reporter . There's something wrong in them evicting a 71-year-old man from Scranton Housing Authority in the courts. And I know exactly why because people got student loans and went to law school, went to the bar association . There's a lot of work to become a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 lawyer. I learned the law in New York State trying to save my child. It's really not that hard. In New York is one book called New York Practice . But that's the key to it all. It's in the practice . So it's who you know. And I was an idiot thinking I could defend myself from Scranton Housing Authority even though they're a not for profit. They're immensely rich. So they could hire the best law firm in Scranton , the same one that defends the school board, Scanlon , Howley, and Doherty to evict me. And in no small part in them being used to evicting people for about 28 years going back to like 1996 when they made the lease. We could evict you if you don't follow our rules. Yet, the main rule of HUD, of the field office of HUD is to make sure that people are not homeless and to find funding for them if they can't afford homelessness . And I guess I'm out of time. So I hope the movie theater comes through . I hope we get our public access back. And this is a great idea, great idea, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 accurate transparency of whatever everybody says at a point in time. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Little, those minutes are all online. They're posted online. They are all posted online, the City Council minutes . MR. LITTLE: Okay. MR. KING: She typically does this remotely . But she was here tonight so she just came in at a seat. MR. LITTLE: All right. She does good work over there at the courthouse . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . I too have a count, 154 days. That's the amount of time that I've been waiting for the documents pertaining to the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority , the Scranton Parking Authority . Earlier during caucus you met with parking officials and you had question s for them but you never even saw the agreement for the sale of the Parking Authority itself. Those documents are to be retained for the life of the contract . And I've been informed prior to this meeting that this body still does not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 have those documents . Instead of asking, how about demanding once in a while. Seems like when you demand and you put this administration on importance , you get results . I was here last Tuesday . I spoke about all the decorations that were still at the Nay Aug Park, all right? They were finally taken down the next day. This body needs to hold this administration accountable . All right. You hear about the permits . This is the first line as far as blight is concerned . I mentioned this several times about the railway authority coming through . You have to have somebody here from the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association talking about 1615 Moltke. I remember the address . All right. I didn't even have to write it down. This operation knew about that property for well over a year. As that property diminishes , all the properties look to refinance , some look to purchase . This property becomes an exterior obsolescence . What that means is it brings down the value of properties around it. These 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 properties are popping up all over the city. This administration doesn't see the blight because she's from Oregon. So blight to her is a little bit. But to me, Mr. King, Mr. Schuster , Mr. Smurl, Mr. McAndrew , we see that. We grew up here. We see these corners , these streets turn, okay. And as they turn, so do the people. All right. We've come to a point where you cannot even go into a mini market safely without having a problem . Okay, she's putting our lives at risk. She's putting the officers who protect us on a daily basis at risk because there is only 80 percent . All right. I've had the opportunity over the last 154 days to take a look at the budget. You're looking at between 6.8 and 8.3 million dollars shortfall. That's because this administration does not know how to articulate time management , okay? You're only as good as the people you surround yourself with. Unfortunately , this mayor is a know-it-all with a whole bunch of no-nothings . When you have -- you like that, huh? When you have your Business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 Administrator from outside of the city, doesn't even drive down the streets , swerve missing the potholes , missing the manhole covers. Where is the intent at trying to fix things, just pure arrogance from top to bottom. You have it with the park's director who sits his butt down in an office instead of being certified to allow kids to swim and our elderly. We pay for that seven days a week. It's utilized , what, one day a week? This is ridiculous . All right. And if you can actually sit here and say things are okay, you're just as much responsible for the problem . All right. It's time that we take our city back. It's time to give the city back to its people, all right. There is no money that can come from out of state that will get her reelected. And I assure you of that. Your arrogance will become your downfall. That pool has been closed for five years, just imagine kids growing up from age 12 to 17, okay, not being able to utilize that pool, not being able to get down to Weston Field or up to Connell , right? What do they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 do? As we take things away from our kids it's easier for them to go in a different direction . And we're seeing it far too often. We have over a 100 kids in our Scranton school system that are considered gang active, okay? And as we have three administrations , our last three that faltered , we see our blight going out to other areas of the county, Nicholson , Old Forge, Mayfield . That's where these individuals got pulled from, okay. I apologize to those from out of the area for three bad administrations . But I assure you, Pickleball Paige will be gone. Have a good evening . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I just want to highlight something good that has gone on in the city that was just highlighted recently that our S and P rating did go from minus BBB to -- it skipped by BBB rating and is now BBB plus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 That didn't happen by accident . I know that we had to make some tough decision s over the last few years which included having to raise -- do some small incremental tax increases over the last few years. We voted to refinance the bond which resulted in this increase S and P rating that will result in well over a million dollars savings to the city over the life of the bond. And we've recently started developing a capital fund something was mention ed earlier we need to start doing. And it's the first time in I don't know -- a long time that we're actually investing in a capital fund. So I think there are some good things happening. I don't disagree that there are many challenges that we have in the city that need to be address ed and we'll continue to push the administration to try to make those things happen. But I do think it's a great thing that our credit worthiness has increased to the point of BBB plus. And that is good for our city. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I do have a few. We did get a lot of questions -- well, we had questions -- answers for questions over the last two weeks back. I'm going to try to get through some of them. There is quite a lot. But if we could get it into Third Order for next week. First thing I want to start off with was Ferdinand Street. A while back some of the residents came in for the top of Ferdinand Street above the ten hundred block. And I know that the administration said they were going to get out to fix some of the issues that were going on there. But I've been up there several times since then. And I haven't seen much done. Can we just reach out and see what -- any updates are for the top of Ferdinand Street? MR. VOLDENBERG : Would that be the 1800 block, sir? MR. SCHUSTER : It's definitely above 10. I don't know what the addresses go up as it goes up the hill. But it goes from Keyser 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Avenue up to the dead end. MR. VOLDENBERG : It was schedul ed to be paved. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you, Frank. We did have a meeting yesterday about -- that I had called because I was speaking with the railroad about addressing homelessness in the City of Scranton . They did say they were going to go back. There was a task force that's been formed that we found out about I'd say two weeks ago. But if we could reach out to see if Council could get some kind of update once they have their next meeting , what our legal steps forward , what our Law Department is doing and updates from that meeting that they have. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Norma, I don't know if you're going to be happy about the answer I got, but I'll give you the answer that I received . MS. JEFFRIES : (Inaudible .) MR. SCHUSTER : I wish that was the answer. So it said that the project totaled 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 $306,000. That was the piece that you had here from last week. The grant funds were expended per that multimodal grant. And they did signage -- street signage in South Scranton is what the administration gave me. MR. KING: But apparently not South Washington and Hickory . MR. SCHUSTER : Correct . Some of the signs in South Side that I cannot read on the names on them there are a lot of faded signs in the South Scranton area. The question was answered twice. It said, "May Council please have an update on the Street Sign Project and any related funding secured for the projects in '23 and '24?" The city's awaiting the state's decision on the multimodal grant that was applied for in September of '23. The city has entered into a contract with a third party Mack Signs to install street signs in West Scranton this spring. Now, I know when I reached out about some signs that I got calls about, I was originally told that the city was addressing Hill Section signs first. So I just -- since we've started on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 this journey I've heard we're addressing the Hill Section . I just heard we're addressing South Side. And then the new recent one will be addressing West Side. Last week I asked for a breakdown of that $306,000. But we didn't get a breakdown of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did not. MR. SCHUSTER : If we could maybe reach back out and get that breakdown of how that money was spent. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Rubicon rollout, we did have a meeting about Rubicon . They told us the rollout was going to happen in January . In that meeting they did let us know that it wasn't going to happen in January but it would be happening soon. So on March 6, we had a review call with Rubicon for the submission required for optimization . We have to make two documented adjustments based on the date and requirements for formatting for the alleys and a unique identifi er for the addresses . We'll have another review next week to know of the acceptance of the date it's set 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 to be in optimization . We'll send guidance on the expected delivery date at that time. There is also two more paragraph s here but I'll leave it at that. I asked how we funded -- we were told about a housing needs assessment that was done at our caucus two weeks ago. And I asked how that was funded. So the Scranton Area Foundation was contracted with Forsite{phonetic } to develop a housing needs assessment for Scranton . While the city has been at the table helping to guide the scope of the work, the city is not providing the funding . The housing needs assessment is funded through 75 percent from the Weinberg Foundation and 25 percent from the Scranton Area Foundation itself. We got an update on Nossaman . So the services to the city and their project s and performance since the last report, Nossaman , LLP, has been in touch with the administration on the following opportunities : EV chargers slash LCCC programs , recompete grant, hydrogen hub possibilities for Scranton , addressing 243 million plus up at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 SAAP, abandoned mine issues, the EPA and PA American Water 200 million for Pennsylvania drinking water improvements , the Amtrak line to Scranton and the SAAP. So those are the eight things that they have helped the city with since our last update. Council billing , it appears the answer I got back was I have expanded the scope of my questions so they are going to be looking at that and probably looking for some more clarification on what I want there. So that's going to take -- I'm probably never going to see those documents to be honest with you. For FEMA, there is 53 FEMA project s that the flooding in 2018 that need to be complete and 25 of the 53 have been completed . The deadline for that I think it was in 2023. They got an extension to 2024. And then recently they got an extension to October . So of those 53 original project s that were identified in 2018, 25 of the 53 have been complet e. That's my update for tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I don't have any motions or comments . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. So to start off, we've been talking about homeless for over a year. It's not an issue that just happened this year. It's getting worse. We understand . We sympathize . I sympathize . I know there's a task force that met a couple times. We need an update from them. I know there was a meeting the other day. Like I said, contractually I had an obligation at work. I couldn't make it. I got a little summary that, you know, we're going to see grants. We're going to look for low income housing . But that's fine and we need to have a plan. I'm glad there's a plan. But we also need to plan how we're going to protect the resident s and the student s of our city. So and we've discussed this for a little bit, not much. But we did discuss that something might 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 happen. It's not, you know, it's not if. It's when. And when is here. Something almost happened the other day. So with that said, I'm thrilled -- like I said, I'm thrilled there's plans to provide housing . I'm thrilled there's plans to address the issues but they take time. I don't think we should take time when it comes to the safety of our students and residents . So with that said, I would like to make a motion for Solicitor Gilbride to explore and research an ordinance that prohibits homeless camps within so many feet of education facilities , like the high school, of course, day cares and any other educational facility related to that. I know it's been done. I've read a couple articles about it. So I don't think it's that difficult . So with that said, that's my motion. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second that motion. I do think we need to explore some of the options in terms of an ordinance to address some of the situations that I do think we need to research that and come to a conclusion . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 MR. SMURL: Okay. We have a motion and second on the floor. On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , I'm fully in support of researching this. I have been doing some -- just a little research myself. You may find that there's a lot of protections out there for the homeless and they have been challenged . So we need to tread lightly . I think, you know, obviously this is a huge problem . And there are no easy solutions because it exists everywhere across -- if there were easy solutions , it would be resolved . But Portland , San Francisco , Scranton , New York City, Philadelphia . It doesn't matter where you go. There are homeless and there is homeless encampments . And it does seem to be growing . And it's absolutely an issue and concern . I'm all for it. Let's look into this and see if there's a possibility to develop an ordinance that could address it around schools and any type of education institutions . And also want to pursue -- I sent you an ordinance , Attorney Gilbride , that has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 passed out in Colorado , you know, around waterways. We happen to have a waterway that travels very closely to Scranton High School. So perhaps I believe that that ordinance has not been challenged . And it seems like it's working to address the issues of encampments near our waterways. You know, hopefully there will be some ordinances out there that have, you know, hold up against any challenges to prevent homeless camps near and around the schools . I'm all for that as well. I also want to pursue that other ordinance as well. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Anyone else? No? I'll say I'm also for anything that will try to alleviate the problem we're having with homeless people. I don't believe anything would hurt having Attorney Gilbride research and see if there is anything that we can do or find to actually try to keep our students safe from all of this and our neighborhood also. So with that said, we have a motion and second. All those in favor of having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 Attorney Gilbride research an ordinance for the homeless signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So secondly , I had another issue that was brought to my attention actually today. Let's see. Where is it? It was about the park. Let me see. I'm missing some of it or part of it. But the concern was someone went to Nay Aug Park and one area where -- this was an issue last year I think so too where the swing sets are. There is rusty nails and there is very dangerous pieces of that area that need to be addressed . A kid's going to get hurt. Of course, we're talking about kids' safety again. So could you reach out to the Park's Director and make sure that he goes up there and takes a look at that and does whatever he needs to do to prevent our kids from getting hurt up there? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Also, I received multiple complaints about the ANZ Hotel. It's formally known as the Sheridan Inn on Meadow Avenue. I know there was a recent drug bust there. But prior to the drug bust and since then, resident s have informed me of very suspicious activity going on in the parking lot and the hotel they believe itself. I know there might be an ongoing investigation and that's fine. Sometimes , you know, we don't hear back because it's being investigated . And, of course, that's -- we don't want any compromising information reported back. But can we please get an incident slash call report from the police department as this also might relate to our nuisance ordinance . Also, since changing ownership -- this hotel, I would like to request or know if there was a health inspection done because that is the normal procedure when business changes hands. And also in addition to that from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 the Fire Department , was a fire code inspection when the business changed hands because I'm hearing a lot of sanitary issues are being relayed to me and very suspicious behavior by a few people. Also, since we're talking about that, a few months ago back -- same residents brought concerns about a traffic safety issue in that same block. And I requested a traffic study. Can we please get an update on the traffic study? Also, I know we were told part of the, you know, the safety issue there is the lines and crosswalk s that would be repainted this spring. So we'd like an update on when that will be done and if they proceed ed with the traffic study. If not, we still need that. Also, I would like an update on the work that was done in front of and on the side of a property on 300 -- no, I'm sorry -- 3100 Atlanta Drive. It's at the corner of Reese and Atlanta . I notice even by driving by there every day from work that there was a lot of work done by DPW and the water company . So the problem is now that property 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 remains -- it's not finished . So -- and I'm not sure who is responsible to complete the paving of it. The poor guy who lives there in front of his garage was torn up and not filled, he can't even get in his garage. And it's very visible , the other part to that road when I'm trying to go home. So, Mr. Voldenberg , will you please reach out to both DPW and the water company for clarification as to who is responsible for paving it and when it will be addressed ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. So in addition to that, I had received quality of life concerns on the property of the 1400 Schimpf Court and Fisher Place. It's right off 300 Fig. And, you know, would you please alert code enforcement of these concerns ? I guess there's a lot of rubbish and there's -- and it's been there for a while. So they really need, that needs to be looked at. Also, so I got some answers to questions I posed over the past couple weeks. So and I've asked this question before in the past. One of the concern ed resident s asked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 if we complete background checks. And the response I got from administration , we are currently working with our fire and police department s to increase the rigger of our current background checks for any director level positions . Note, this cost is approximately $15 for a basic level check. Fifteen dollars is not a bad investment if we keep these employees because we seem to have a lot of them that are, you know, a lot of turnover. So if we do it right, maybe it's worth the investment . Also, Mr. Spindler is not here tonight but I wish he was. So he asked about -- first he asked me about, you know, how they patch pothole s in Wilkes-Barre. They have a hot patch machine . I never saw one. It sounds pretty cool. It sounds like it's a great idea. I brought that up last week. And then I heard prior to me bringing it up that the city had one at one time. So my question was inquiring about that. So the response from the question -- may the administration please explain the reason and timeframe surround ing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 the damaged pothole patch machine -- I didn't even know it was damaged -- that was not repaired and moved from use by the DPW. Resident s at Council meeting have expressed the success -- Mr. Spindler -- of the one in Wilkes-Barre. So the answer we received from administration is, we are exploring pothole patch process es that would be more effective than those currently employed including the new hot patch process that Wilkes-Barre started . So that's the answer to that. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I also inquired about the machine -- that pothole machine of the city. It was many years ago. I'm thinking about 9 or 10 years ago I remember it. And I believe it was shared between Scranton and Dunmore . And then after that I heard it was pretty much -- it was just gone. And that's all I have on that because there isn't anything else about it. Another thing, on Cedar Avenue, 512 Cedar Avenue I guess we've had numerous complaint s about there. Code enforcement is still involved and the zoning officer is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 involved in that also. And our HUP test is continuing . And there are still many -- a large amount of nontaxable properties that need additional research . So we still have to go to the County Assessor 's Office with them. But we can't just dump them all at one time. So it's going to take a little bit of time but that has not ceased. It is still in the works. That's all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CONVERTING A CERTAIN PORTION OF THE 600 BLOCK OF DEACON STREET FROM A ONE-WAY STREET TO A TWO-WAY STREET FROM 625-628 DEACON STREET TO ITS INTERSECTION WITH SANDERSON AVENUE. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , I'm all for introducing this this evening. But obviously we want to explore some of those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 concerns that were express ed by Miss Augustini . So at least this gives us time. We'll introduce it tonight and hopefully if we get some information back it could possibly be amended to address the concerns by the resident s. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , I think if a traffic study is completed it should be able to address what was brought up tonight . MR. MCANDREW : I agree. And you your request is a reasonable one. Two more stop signs, that's reasonable . MS. AUGUSTINI : (Inaudible .) MR. SCHUSTER : That would be the way I would drive. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so we're taking the interest -- correct me if I'm wrong. We're taking the interest and we're putting it in the Capital Fund, right? So if we do that, does that money that we go to use again have to be, like, follow the ARPA criteria or ARPA driven? MR. KING: I believe that by moving it into a capital reserve fund, that's a qualified -- I don't think we would be doing it unless it fell under, you know, qualified , you know, option. MR. MCANDREW : Even though it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 interest versus the actual -- MR. KING: I guess we can ask our Solicitor to look into that. But I believe that -- MR. MCANDREW : I just want clarification . MR. KING: Sure. MR. SMURL: All right. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed have it -- The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D.

MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , it's my understanding that we have to do this from time to time to upgrade these systems . But while we're at, Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to ask one more request . Could we get an update on the Green Light Go project s that are to be completed in the city? I know a couple weeks ago we asked but did we get an update? MR. VOLDENBERG : By coincidence I asked that question today. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : And I will have the answer. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. It's been several weeks now since we've heard. And we had a speaker that came in that was fearful that we were going to lose those grant monies for those necessary upgrades so if we could stay on top of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : It's present ly with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 Baker International , PennDOT 's engineer . But my question is out. So I should have an answer tomorrow . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much, Frank. MR. SMURL: And I believe they said it was out for bid. And one more thing on this, Mr. Voldenberg , it says for the address of this where it is, it says Cedar Avenue and Cherry Street. Wouldn't it be South Washington Avenue and Cherry Street that the train crossing there, the railroad crossing there just to see if the address is correct . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir.

READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 COUNCIL NO. 11, 2024 – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING A CAPITAL RESERVE FUND TO ACCUMULATE AND DISBURSE MONEYS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS PART OF THE CITY’S LONG-TERM CAPITAL PLANNING AND TO PROVIDE FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF SAID CAPITAL RESERVE FUND BY: PROVIDING FOR SOURCES OF FUNDS TO SUSTAIN THE CAPITAL RESERVE FUND; PRESCRIBING THE USE OF CAPITAL RESERVE FUNDS; AND AUTHORIZING THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPITAL RESERVE FUND SPENDING PLAN. MR. SMURL: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , this is another example of making wise financial decisions . We haven't had a Capital Reserve Fund in years -- 30 years in Act 47 financial distress . And in the past two years we just approve d or introduced resolutions to move 3 million dollars into a Capital Reserve Fund. Our credit rating just went up. We refinanced a bond which is going to return well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 over a million dollars to the city in savings. And, you know, we've wisely done some small incremental tax increases for over the past few years. So I feel as though financially these are wise decision s that are being made by the administration along with approval from City Council . So I'm happy to support this. MR. SMURL: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 13, 2024 – AN ORDINANCE – ENACTING THE “TOWING ORDINANCE OF 2024” BY REPEALING AND REPLACING THE CITY’S TOWING AND STORAGE CODE. MR. SMURL: You've heard reading by title of Item 6-C. What is your pleasure ? MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-C pass reading by title. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm sure other people are going to speak on this; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 but some concerns were brought to light with Council . And I think they need to be -- we need to look into those concerns before we pass this in Seventh Order. MR. SMURL: I did forward them back to Mr. Voldenberg . And he informed me he sent them back to the administration all of the questions I received this morning . I would have hoped that they would have gotten them in a little bit more -- a timely fashion than four hours before we're doing this. But hopefully if there are more questions we could get them in sooner. MR. KING: On the question , as the administration reviews the answer to some of those concerns expressed , I'm not necessarily in agreement with everything that was submitted three or four hours ago. But I believe some of the request s by the group are reasonable requests that may not have been included , you know, by the original committee who participated in trying to shape this new ordinance . So we'll let the administration review some of the things that were requested 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 really by just two individuals , I believe . And if we feel as though they're reasonable , then hopefully we would pass a new towing ordinance next week. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I too received the concerns . We got them late. I was working . I didn't take a good dive into them or a deep dive into them. But I'm glad they were sent onto administration . I hope there's a little dialogue between now and next week for final passage . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? I also was involve d in bidding this. And I do hope that we could come to a conclusion by next week. I know not everyone is going to be happy with every part of it. You're not going to have 18 towing companies that are going be happy with every detail of it. But most of it that had come down so far looked favorable for the city taxpayers . So that's all I have. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR.
