That'sallIhaverightnow. MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou. Mr.Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes,anumber ofitems. First,I'dliketostartoffagainby thanking twoofourdepartments ,thepolice department andthefiredepartment .This weekinWestScranton anindividual went1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 missing andboththepolice department and thefiredepartment allkicked intogearand theyreally helpeveryone search the neighborhood sandhewasfoundsafely soI wanttothankboththepolice andfire department fortheirgreatworkwithhelping thatindividual out. Mr.Evansalready brought upthe reassessment earlier ,Idothinkbudget time forthecounty iswhenwereally should be putting onafullcourtpresstogetthe county tolookatreassessment .The taxpayers inScranton wouldbenefit tremendously fromanoverall reassessment because manyproperties ,especially inthe HillSection andIknowEastMountain ,West Mountain areassessed extremely highandwe seethelistofappeals coming infrontour deskeveryweekandit'saracetothe clock.Thereneedstobefairness inall theproperties thataretaxedinthecity andreassessment woulddothat. Regarding theLaceWorks,Councilman Perryalready addressed anumber ofthese issues,butjusttoreiterate ,Iunderstand1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 whenMr.Sbaraglia worked attheLaceWorks manyyearsagoitwasafloodplain.There aremanyareasinthecitythatwereflood plains.Luckily ,because ofhelpwithlevy systems throughout thecitythatthefederal projects andfederal government hasdone theseareasarenolonger atriskofthese devastating floods andthelowerGreenridge areabytheLaceWorkprojects thereare hundreds ofpeople thatliveinthat neighborhood .It'sanice,quietlittle neighborhood inlowerGreenridge andIknow theneighbors inthatareadesperately want toseetheLaceWorksrestored .It'sbeen aneyesoreforoveradecade andit'sbeen really beenabigissuedownthereandas Mr.Perrymentioned aswell,thereis-- thereisnotonedimeofcitydollars or stateorfederal dollars thatweare approving togivetothedeveloper ofthis project .Allweareallowing isthatthe improvements thataremadearenottaxedfor aperiod oftime.Thecurrent taxesthat arepaidontheproperty willcontinue tobe paid.Thecityisnotgoingtoloseone1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 centofrevenue bydoingthis,butwedo needtoencourage thedevelopment .

MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou.Mr. Evans? MR.EVANS:Thankyou.Toanswer1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 Joan'squestion alittle bitaboutthe500 blockofLackawanna Avenue andtheempty lot,ifIrecall itwaspurchased fromthe SRAtobepartofthatentire project ,and asCouncilman Roganmentioned ,BuonaPizza wasn'tpartofitandConeyIsland wasn't partofitsothislotbecame a non-developed lotforthatproject .Now, personally Ithinkthatthefailure atthis pointisprobably inthehandsoftheSRA because according tothewayitwaswritten ifitwasn'tdeveloped inatimely manner theyshould havetakenitback,andI'mnot sureifthat'swhythetaxesarebeingpaid ornot,butwewillcontact Mr.Rinaldi to getananswer astowhythetaxesaren't paidfrom2014,butthewayit'ssupposed to workhewassupposed togivethema reasonable amount oftimetodevelop itand iftheydon'tdevelop itwetakeitbackand that'swhatshould havehappened .Itshould havewentbacktothehandsoftheSRAand theycouldhaveturned around andfound another developer sothatmayhappen yet, butwe'llfindoutandgetananswer foryou1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 hopefully nextweek. Iwasgladtoseethatthe demolition of1021Richmont Streetwasput onholdbythecity.Ihadseveral conversations withLicense andInspection director PatHinton aswellasCommunity Champions .Community Champions isacompany thatregistered ourforeclosed properties so Icontacted themaswell.Theyimmediately wenttoworkonthisandfoundoutthat,of course,it'snotinforeclosure ,thereisno pre-foreclosure papers eminent ,butthey alsooffered theirhelptheyhavecontact s withbanksthroughout thecountry toseeif theycouldgetacontact andsomebody responsible fortheproperties soifthat happens Ithinkit'ssomewhat ofa breakthrough togetthatsituation straightened out. Butthissituation leadstoalarger issue,anditwasbrought upagainst byone ofourspeakersisthecurrent condemnation policy.Asanyrealtor willattest,when thatorange placard thatreads"Condemned " isattached toaproperty thatbuilding in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 manycaseshasjustreceived adeath sentence thatcanalsoleadtodemolition , andifthatdoesn'thappen attheveryleast thevalueofthatproperty inmanycasescan bereducedbyalmost 50percent .The property values ofneighbor inghomesare reducedandtheproperty values onthat blockarereduced .Sothisisthe conversation Ithinkweneedtohavetocome upwithbetter solution sthandriving down property values anddemolishing buildings . Insomecases,demolition maybetheonly answer butinmanycasesthehomemaybe rehabilitated ,putbackonthemarketfor saleandthatsimply isnothappening because thepolicies wehaveinplacedoes notfoster redevelopment orencourage home ownership. Itismyhopethatintheverynear future thiscouncil andadministration will takeagoodhard,honest lookatthisissue andaddress itheadon.Ithasalways been ourplanandourintentthatoncewe complete dourrental registration ordinance , whichwillbeontheagenda nextweek,that1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 we'llmovedirectly tothecondemnation policy,that'sthestilltheplanwehavein placesohopefullywewillseesomeaction onthataswell.That'sallIhave.Thank you.
