CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Here. Please let the record reflect that I did talk to Mr. Perry earlier . He is unable to attend tonight 's meeting . Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MS. REED: THIRD ORDER. 3-A. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON LACKAWANNA HEALTH & WELFARE AUTHORITY MEETING HELD OCTOBER 19, 2017. MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any council members have announcements at this time? I have just one. I did receive -- I was copies on letter from Mayor Courtright to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 Governor Wolf asking the governor to look into naming Scranton as one of the zones for the economic opportunity -- an economic opportunities zone. This is part of the Federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act that passed last year in Washington . I will talk about this program a little bit more under motions , but I did want to mention it. This was -- I was copied on this last week and the mayor has sent correspondence to the state looking for this designation so it sounds like it would be a good program and definitely something good for the city. Anyone else? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment : BOB SHERIDAN . MARY ELLEN GARIGO. CAROL OSEWEGO . JOAN HODOWANITZ . Dave DOBRZYN . MARIE SCHUMACHER .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : The only comments I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 have tonight is that we are continuing to work with the school district to figure out how we are going to actually set up the shared services and I think that the main goal is to get everyone in a room to actually sit down and start talking about this, but besides that that's the only thing I have this evening. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Very briefly . I want to comment on the public caucus, while we all appreciate the investment the utility companies invest in our infrastructure structure , we need the streets , we need the utilities to appreciate the frustration of our citizens as to what is happening on the surface of the streets and the neighbor hoods so hopefully this is the beginning of a dialogue that we haven't before with utilities and the neighbors . They need to step up their game, they did a little bit tonight , but hopefully that will happen very, very soon. And my last comment is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles, the 2018 Super Bowl champions . Go Eagles. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I received several complaints about a property in the 800 block of Pittston Avenue, a storefront property . That backyard is filled with garbage and other debris. Residents have called several times about this property and nothing has been done to date so I did ask Mrs. Reed to look into that with the Licensing and Inspections Department . Also, a property on Church Avenue. Residents are concerned about water pooling on the sidewalk when it rains. Neighbors are concerned that the catch basin is higher than the lowest point in the road so we did reach out to DPW on that. Also, some concerns about the intersection of South Washington Avenue and Birch Street. And my last comment is about the public caucus that we had tonight . You know, the first thing I'd like to say is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that I think it's clear with this specific project , not with, you know, they are starting to do in the future, but the notification system is shoddy at best. You know, having somebody go around and knocking on the door and somebody is not there and just leave a letter on the porch that's not good enough when you have these big Bobcats and you are drilling trenches in people's yards and that's not enough. I think if the utility company should -- especially with the neighbors who are here tonight , should personally sit down in their homes with them and explain the project . You know, this woman that is here tonight , and this gentleman , can't even get had their driveway . So it doesn't seem that there is enough concern on the part of the utility companies with the, you know, degradation of the quality of life for these residents and, you know, no regard really for the people that live in that area. I also think that these residents , especially the woman that got up, should be compensated monetarily for the issues that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 they have to go through . I understand the project has to be done, but I wouldn't want to live there, you wouldn't want to live there, anybody up here wouldn't want to live there. So there has to be something else whether it's a reduction in taxes or, you know, Mr. Hoover from the water company said that they spent, I don't know 15 or 16 million dollars and then they had a couple of extra dollars to spend, they told them to spend more money, how about giving some of that money to the resident s here that's effected by that. So they are doing something but they are not doing enough. So I will look forward to meeting with you and going out and taking a tour of the site. And that's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just following up on those comments regarding our public caucus, I would like to thank everyone that did attend the caucus from the neighbor hoods, and I do want to apologize to Mr. Sheridan and his association for not getting the invite. Thank you for coming and glad to you have you at the table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 tonight . It's a very frustrating situation because , obviously , everyone knows that these water lines have to be done to deliver water to our city, there is no question , but the communication between utilities company and the residents needs to be much better. You know, as Councilman Gaughan mentioned , some of the items that were mentioned to us on how people are notified certainly isn't acceptable and the cost of sending a letter or doing an automated phone call to residents is minimal . That's very the very least that these utilities should be doing well in advance of the projects , not days before, I'm talking months prior. And I also agree that going out into the neighborhood association s is the right place for these meetings because , you know, each neighborhood in Scranton is effected different ly by utility work. Just last year, last winter, my neighborhood was cut up the entire winter. You probably heard me complain about it at council meetings a number of time, by a utility , all winter. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 That effected west side. This project is effecting South Side. So I think it would be wise for the utility companies to take these type of meetings right into those neighborhoods , into the neighborhood associations and just do an automated call to let people know that the meeting is going on and to invite them to the meeting . I think that will help alleviate a lot of these problems if communication is made better. One other item that I wanted to mention , I did mention this as an announcement , my Courtright did send a letter on February 2 to Governor Wolf asking that Scranton becomes part of the EOZ program , which is the economic opportunities zone. This was part of the Federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act that passed just last year by President Trump in Washington . I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the program, but the goal is, and this is right from the mayor's letter, "We are interested in working with you to think through the possibilities presented in the investment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 side of the program , and our reading of the program the opportunity funds invested in the EOZ could be tailored towards particular policy goals. For example , an opportunity fund that invests in advanced manufacturing , infrastructure or women and/or minority -owned businesses in Pennsylvania ." This is a program that until discussing it with the mayor over the last few weeks was very little known, and in doing some research the New York Times did a very good article on this, for anyone who is interested , the headline is "Tucked Into the Tax Bill a Plan to Help Distressed America ." And it goes onto say, "A little notice section in the 1.5 trillion tax cut that President Trump signed into law late last month is drawing attention to many venture capitalists , state government and mayors all across America ." The core to this program is providing tax breaks to those who invest within certain parts of these communities . Now, the communities have to be selected by the state so it is up to Governor Wolf to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 decide whether Scranton can anticipate in this tax incentive or not. Sense Scranton has not received a CRIZ designation as of yet, I think this is something that we all should get behind and it really is a true public private partnership leveraging those dollars to try and help create economic development within our city and particularly within the distressed neighborhoods . So this is something I will hopefully be talking about more in the coming weeks, but it sounds to be a very good idea and something in the tax bill that I think very few of use knew about. That is all. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – A RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF A CITIZENS COMMISSION FOR LEGISLATIVE AND CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. EVANS: On the question , anyone who has followed my comments these past several years will realize that I have been a major proponent of reform in/PH Harrisburg , that is why I most definitely am opposed to the practice of gerrymandering and support ive of an independent initiative to look at this issue, but I also view this as part of a larger conversation and real reform in Harrisburg , but if I could I'd like to take a brief minute to discuss reforms that I think also are important on this just to get some of them out there and get real reform in Harrisburg . Number one, reduce the size of the state legislature . Two, eliminate gerrymandering . Three, institute term limits for the State Senate and State House. Four, offer real municipal pension reform. Five, address the taxing discrepancy with cities like ours that have an overabundance of nonprofit properties . And, six, either mandate reassessments or help pay for them or both or change the rules and allow for progressive rolling reassessments , a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 strategy that is used statewide in many other states outside of Pennsylvania . That's six ideas in 60 seconds . But I also know that government can only expect a change to occur at a glacial pace and not at the pace that all of us can see it happen in, but tonight I think we have an opportunity to address at least one of those issues I mentioned , an issue that as time has come should be consistent with the resolution s intent, so I would like to offer the following friendly amendment that would make another statement on where we stand on reform in Harrisburg . Paragraph six in the resolution reads: Now, therefore , be it resolved that Scranton City Council does hereby support legislative efforts to amend the Pennsylvania constitution to assign the decennial task of both legislative and congressional redistrict to Independent Citizens Redistricting Commission . That's easy to say. At this point, I would like to add the following, and that Scranton City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Council also hereby support legislative efforts to amend the Pennsylvania constitution to reduce the size and number of state representatives and the state house from 203 members to 151 members . Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? This vote is on the amendment . I would agree with what Councilman Evans just mentioned , and, obviously , gerrymandering is a problem but this is another issues that are facing the state and I think term limits and I believe most of local representatives have signed on in favor of -- not of term limits but of reducing the size of the state legislature and I think term limits are appropriate as well, so I certainly will support the amendment . MR. DONAHUE : On the question , Wayne, I believe there is a bill that's currently in front of the state legislature that needs to be passed through a second session for a constitutional amendment so would we be able to include that bill in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that bill number into the resolution because I believe do we have a -- is there -- I thought I saw, there is something in our current resolution about that. MR. EVANS: That references that? MR. DONAHUE : That references the gerrymandering resolution . MR. EVANS: Yeah. Yeah, we can do that. We can do that after the fact if you want. MR. DONAHUE : Okay, well, I just have it here. I know it's House Bill 153. MR. EVANS: All right, well, we can add that language to the amendment . HB what? MR. DONAHUE : 153. MR. EVANS: 153. MR. DONAHUE : And that's the constitutional amendment to decrease the size of the legislature . MR. EVANS: We could make it after the state house from 203 members to 153 members per HB -- MR. DONAHUE : 153. MR. EVANS: 153.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question on the amendment ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. So at this time I'll entertain that Item 5-B, as amended , be introduced into it's proper committee . MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye? MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A.
