GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So I don't know if you're all aware, the Jewish Food Fest at Nay Aug, it continues until tomorrow and put out by the Jewish Discovery Center. I'm going try to get there tomorrow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 for a corned beef and pastrami sandwich so, yeah. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, with that being said, I also was going to mention the Jewish Food Festival went on another day until tomorrow . The Electric City Steel Drum Project will perform free at a concert tomorrow night at Nay Aug Park, Wednesday , July 7th at 6 p.m. The group is a nonprofit organization offering performance opportunities to area residents . Members of the Steel of Honor Military Veterans Group will perform a free arrangement as well. And there will also be a limbo concert for the kids. So bring a lawn chair and few friends and pick up a bite to eat at the food festival . DR. ROTHCHILD : I could attest to the great food at the Jewish Food Festival . I was there yesterday . And so it would be good for people to stop by. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? Okay. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. Voldenberg : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. GAUGHAN : Our first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . I just want to start by saying the Friends of the Scranton Public Library will be holding another sidewalk book sale Saturday from 10 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon . We're selling books, CDs, DVDs, audiobooks, a whole lot of stuff for both children and adults. The prices are 25 cents to two dollars . It's a win/win. So come on by and get a good book. All right. First, I'm still waiting for the Collective Bargaining Agreements for Firefighters ' Union and the Single Tax Office to be posted on the City's website . They were there once and they got deleted . And I don't know why. And I checked as late as 5:30 this afternoon . They are not there. In my opinion all financial type documents that involve taxpayer dollars should automatically be posted on the website and not deleted . Next, I want to know how much money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 we've spent on the Serrenti Center and how much more we're going to spend. And is there going to be a public caucus on the status of that center? It reminds me of the old joke how many lawyers does it take to change a light bulb. How many years and how much money does it take to renovate the Serrenti Center. It's been going on for years. Next, with regard to Carl Deeley's appointment as IT Director , I don't believe he has the technical training or work experience to hold that position . Also, the City is never going to find a qualified IT Director if it pays an annual salary of only $64,000. After all, we pay our Fire Chief $89,500 a year and the Police Chief $105,165.64 a year. And that's before overtime . Our newly appointed public health coordinator will make $120,000 a year for the next three years. Bethlehem which has a population of 75,461 according to the U.S. Census is close to our population pays its computer system manager $109,134 a year. So anyone who is qualified to serve as IT Director is worth far more than $64,000. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 I hope the administration increases the salary for this position in its 2022 budget and searches for a fully qualified candidate . You get what you pay for. And the IT Department is too important to have someone leading it that's not qualified . Everything depends on IT. It's your infrastructure for government . And if you can't have it run properly and that department 's been having systemic problems , you're always contracting and bidding out services for it. If it can't be run properly you might as well close this building down and everybody go home. Either do it right or don't do it at all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Jack White. MR. WHITE: Hi fellow citizens , fellow participants and government by the people and for the people of the people. I hope everyone is well in your family and you and all of that. I apologize for my hacking and sneezing and wheezing . It only hurts when I breathe . So I should get over it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 There's a construct -- a government construct that goes something like this. It's got to do with micro and macro things. And micro being, you know, the individual , a small group, the neighborhood , the gangs, small groups, individuals . Macro has to do with larger groups, organizations , budgets , stuff like that. And we the speakers bring micro and macro issues to you and then you mix them up and throw them up and around and somehow come out to with a, you know, some kind of marriage between the micro and macro. And as the theory goes, if the micro part of government is going well and running efficiently then it will benefit the macro so the macro can run more efficiently and competently and effectively . And if the macro end of things is going well, then that will have an influence on the individual and the small smaller groups and the family and things like that. So I thought I'd throw that out tonight . I don't have much else tonight . However , I don't want to seem rude 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 at the end of this. But if I don't see an indication that Council is going to address the speakers tonight , their concerns , our concerns then I'm probably going to leave. And again, I'm not hostile . It's not passive aggressive . But I think if the speakers weren't here during Citizens Participation , then you probably wouldn't be here. So it's not a hostile kind of thing. It's just kind of an authentic thing. And I don't want to seem rude. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Thank you, Mr. White. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner. 5-B naming of Scranton Central Expressway for President Joe Biden and also Spruce Street, I for one am very proud to say I live in a city that the President of United States was born in. And I think it's a great idea. Does that mean all of Spruce Street or just the one block? MR. GAUGHAN : All of Spruce. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. Again, I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 it's a great idea. And I'm very proud to know that the President is from the City that I live in. Some people are against it. But I'm very proud to say that. Next thing, fireworks again. Something 's got to be done. It's just ridiculous . It's out of control . They're dangerous . They're illegal . When people are doing it, it has to be 150 feet from a residence . I live in Tripp Park. They're all over the place. And people are so inconsiderate they don't care about anything . My daughter is in with our four-month-old granddaughter from out of town. And she couldn't get her to sleep the last three, four nights. So inconsiderate it's unbelievable . And we need more police on the road. They should be driving all over a day or two before the fourth and after, especially on the fourth. And they're so dangerous . Like I said, a Scranton resident was killed last year. Two fires in Wilkes-Barre were caused by fireworks . I don't know if you saw it on the news. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 And I'm sure you heard about the hockey player that was killed by a firework, professional hockey player killed by like a mortar style fireworks . It's ridiculous . These things should not be allowed in the City. They should outlaw that sale but they go to other states and get them anyway. Lastly, on the corner of Dorothy Street and James Robeson Way where you turn in the Isaac Tripp School, the stop sign there is faded so bad you could barely make out it's a stop sign. So DPW maybe could look into that changing the sign. And that's all I have. Thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , can you contact DPW for that faded stop sign? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Ronnie Ellman from Scranton . Since our governor gave us some freedom I just have been running around like the good ol' days and maybe run into a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 people that I hadn't seen for a year or so. I wasn't out there to win friends and influence people, of course. I wrote down a bunch of things on an envelope and things I remember ed what they told me. I'd like to state some of them. Now, I talk to quite a few people not -- I mean not more than -- I mean a bunch of people. You ready? The worst mayor Scranton has ever suffered under because of her administration . Now I heard this dozens of times. But everybody said they had some hope for her. It wasn't forever . The worst two commissioners whose incompetent policies are going to do nothing but cost us foreclosures and abandonments . The state needs to come in and run the school system and get rid of Finan, get rid of Shapiro , very, very disliked man. I mean, very unpleasant things said about Shapiro , sort of surprised me. Everyone was adamant about the name a street after Mr. Biden -- President Biden solely because of the expense and problems involved . And they think if you want to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 through with it that the local Democratic party should have to pay for everything , not the taxpayers , the Democratic party which I thought was a good idea. This was way at the bottom. It says elect a whole new City Council . But it was way down there. Then I heard this a lot. Kyle should have run for the Mayor. He was only about a thousand votes less than Paige for his Council seat, which I didn't keep up with that. But I thought she had a whole lot more votes than -- was it six or are eight thousand or something ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. MR. ELLMAN: And I don't know how Courtright got elected . I didn't hear one good thing from anybody about him, giving all that money to the eight colleges , universities when they have endowment s and then giving the Munley Law Firm saying they were so diminished and impoverished that they qualified for 350 to a million dollar loan right when there was a mile long line of vehicles to get food, you know, very bad choice. And the rain tax, of course. That 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 would be turned into an authority probably and end up a hundred dollar house tax before everybody is finished with it. And then you got the reassessment . You know, how far can taxes go? Now, if you people -- everybody is so dedicate d to downtown , you don't know what's happening in our neighborhoods . You want to see the future of Scranton with all of these LLCs and New Jersey and New York realtors buying up everything , go to the 400 block of South Main Street and look. You can't use a sidewalk because it's full of cars. The houses are just dilapidated as can be. Across the street there is a bad crowd that hangs out at the Walgreens parking lot. No matter what they do, they can't seem to get rid of them. If you don't do something about the people buying all of this abandoned properties and houses that's what's going to happen to half of Scranton while you're just so dedicated on downtown you don't realize it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Next speaker Nick Fallon. MR. FALLON: My name is Nick Fallon. I am a homeowner on Farr Street. I haven't been -- I appreciate the -- all the graduations for veterans and things of that nature. I'm a veteran . I did my four years in the military , got out, went back to school. So what I would like to bring up today is the topic that was already somewhat covered with the fireworks . On -- what was it the 4th, I woken up probably around 12:00. And I had heard like industrial -- like commercial fireworks out in front of my house. The next day I went out, there was firework debris right on my porch. So I have a picture of it. It's, like I said, it's kind of getting out of hand with the fireworks and I know that Mayor Cognetti has been working on I think it was Act 43 to try to get that regulated . I had a suggestion for, like, parking I guess on Farr Street. A lot of my neighbors are elderly. One of my neighbors is 97 years old, one of them is 83. Like, there are houses that are on that street park like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 eight vehicle s or more for one household , which is ridiculous . It shouldn 't happen. I have experience as local government individual , I interned for Swatara Township when I went to Pennsylvania State Harrisburg for Public Policies . I know that downtown we have the meters and everything . I wanted to suggest possibly reviewing , like, permits per household . I think that that would minimize that. I think a good thing that would come out of that maybe less violence , crime because there are people flat out abandoning cars. Like, you could see cars all over the place. The officers don't really have the recourse due to the current ordinance s to be able to kind of take care of some of this stuff. I called yesterday . I had one of the neighbors parks and blocks an elderly individual 's driveway . It's a private driveway . They will park right in front of it, put their four ways on them. And I said something to them. Like, I'm done with this because I know that it was the neighbors across the street that had set off the fireworks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 because , like, they've just been very brash, I guess, lately with COVID. I'm not a combat veteran but like that's something that like somebody that has PTSD, things like that, like, I know there's being work done. But my big suggestion would be kind of reviewing parking permits because I think that that would help the City cut down on crime. You wouldn't have as many abandoned vehicles on the roads. It's really mostly all that I had to talk about. I know you guys have other people. I didn't want to take up a bunch of your time. But I figured that's a good suggestion for maybe even not just Farr Street but other streets because sometimes there are people going like 40, 50 miles an hour up my street. Isaac Tripp is right up the road. There's kids that live on the street. So I figured I would suggest that and I really appreciate your guy's time and thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Fallon, if you want to leave your number or your e-mail with Miss Herbster , we can get you -- there's a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 process for permit parking . So if you were interested in exploring that on Farr Street, there is paperwork that you have to fill out. It comes to Council and then the City will send official s out to assess the area. So if you were interested in that if you want to leave your information with her we can get you that. MR. FALLON: Definitely . I appreciate that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Have a nice night. MR. FALLON: You too. MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is David Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I have a question on this IT. There is no way that could you boost the salary of the IT Department at this time, right? So we have to kind of grant Mayor Paige some leeway there and maybe she's doing the best with what she's got to work with too. It shouldn 't be so condescending about her. The fireworks , I was out of town for the day. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 I often wondered if we couldn't get a field and the Fire Department and Police Department and let all of these crazies go into this big field and pay a fee to set off their fireworks and keep them out of the neighborhood . It's -- I would be a little disturbed with somebody if they set my house on fire. Although , I didn't really have a lot really close to my house. So it's not a problem with me. I would urge once again everybody , please if you're not vaccinated , vaccinate as soon as possible . And a thought occurred to me about the school district and the lack of money which could be as high conservatively as 300 million dollars over the last 10 years. Maybe they should be complimented by being able to at least keep the schools open and together somewhat . I know they have a debt. But that debt would be easily payable if we ever got that kind of money that the state is obligated to pay. And I am a little disturbed about the county charging all these extra fees. I felt that they were somewhat deceptive and I'm a little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 disappoint ed in that. I was under the impression that it was going to be 5 percent . And apparently we're adding plenty to it. I'd like to approach you guys and pass out something here. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. DOBRZYN : I'm like a big old hound dog with a rabbit on this. I'm very disturbed . Mr. Mastriano , a State Senator and by reading the article , it seems like he may have the power to subpoena the voting machines and ballots from Pittsburgh and Philadelphia . That's going to cause quite a bit of expense . It's been settled quite a while. I mean, we didn't have a lot of violence over 2000 which was obviously , obviously a stolen election in Florida . Those ballots weren't counted , hanging chads weren't counted . If the chad was hanging , it obviously was the intent of the voter to vote for that person. And countless ballots weren't counted and, of course, we wound up with one necessary war, another unnecessary war and then a huge recession at the end of it and run up on fuel prices and everything else, people sitting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 around in the cold. They couldn't pay 350, 375 a gallon for heating oil. So these things do affect us. And it's -- to call and complain it's 188-453-3211; 202-224-3121 and 202-225-3121. Let your Senators know and your Congress man. And needless to say, I'm real tired of hearing about a stolen election and people marching in Philadelphia . And they're entitle d to their own opinion but not their own facts. And that's all there is to it. It's time to wake up and start acting like Americans , not unAmericans . Thank you and have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is I think Mr. Lawrence but I'm not positive . I think it's you but I don't want to mispronounce your last name. MR. NARCOONIS : Good evening , gentlemen . My name is Paul Narcoonis , City of Scranton . I had two strokes so I have a tough time talking . MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MR. NARCOONIS : The Linden Street bridge it's deteriorating . It's on the north 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 side. It's all deteriorating , exposed rebar, concrete coming down. I had a case to be dropped off on Pittston Avenue on top when you walk down, I counted 21 houses that have are filled with liter, junk, unboarded up, wires hanging down. That's a serious problem . There's a lot graffiti downtown . There's a lot of liter downtown . I'm against renaming the streets for Biden. I'm a christian man. He's pro abortion . He has no morals or values. That's my opinion . You can't name streets after of people like that. You just can't. (Inaudible ) you can't go down there. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. And, Mr. Voldenberg , can you address his concerns with the appropriate departments ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : That exhaust s the sign-in sheet for today. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 resident of Scranton . And I'm going to speak tonight about our program . And I think I spoke with Mr. Schuster at the last meeting that I was at and I wasn't quite satisfied with how we proceed through all of these final resolutions . So I wasn't here last week to address what final resolution s there are. But in reading these, we have -- you know, final resolution s start and I think there is nine of them -- final resolution s that are going to affect the City of Scranton . And I know that we elect you to have the City residents ' interest at heart. And I know that we should go by what you say and what you do that when you vote on these things that it's for our best interest . However , I think I, Norma Jeffries need a class 101 on how you proceed with these items here. My biggest concern is that there is no one's name here. You know, like, how do we, the citizens of Scranton know who these people are that these are going to Director of Public Works. Well, I know that is Mr. Preambo . The other one is the City of -- the Committee on Rules. Who is that? Committee on Finance ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Committee on Finance , and they're going through and they are going to -- let's see number -- service and maintenance fee for the payment of department ladder trucks and repairs. Where are they? Can we read, the citizens , read about those things and what's going on with those? I have been on our website and it leaves a lot to be desired . I still, you know, keep going through , going through looking for things to help me understand what's going on here when we have different things. I also wondered why are we transferring money? For why? You know, why? You know, just explain to us somewhere before we come up to final resolution s. And like I spoke to Mr. Schuster last time I was here, it was too late because once you adopt it, it's too late. It's done. But I just think that we as citizens of Scranton need to know more than what's shown on this little piece of paper. Also, when the grant money, you know, the grant money is given. And it's awarded. What happens to it? Isn't somebody accountable to us as to what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 happens with that grant money, what was bought and so they could tell us, oh, that grant money was spent for this, that or the other. And then we know that the grant money went for what it was intended for and that we can really see a difference in the City of Scranton with all the grant money. That's all I have to say. MR. GAUGHAN : I could address some of your questions . So I think to address your first question about what's behind the legislation , in other words if you just read that pamphlet there, you're correct . You would want more information . So if you go on the City's website under the Council page and you click on the agenda for tonight 's meeting , you could click on the piece of legislation and see all the backup. One of the things that I had asked the administration to do and that they have done is to provide a simple fact sheet with several questions , where did this legislation originate from, who is responsible for this, what impact on the budget, why should Council unanimously support this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 So they do fill that out and that's all there. So if you go on the City's website you could see that. MS. JEFFRIES : I wasn't able to find anything . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, Miss Herbster could show you. We can send you an e-mail with a link to it so that you could see it. But I checked it today and I know that you should be able to access it. So that should take care of those concerns about, okay, what is this and what's behind it. MS. JEFFRIES : So for those people that don't have access to a computer then what do, you know, what do they do? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, so if you don't have access to the internet which I know some residents don't, you could request a copy of the agenda and all the backup through our office. We can mail it out to you. You could come down and pick it up. Now, under our rules of Council , it is 25 cents a copy because there is a cost to that. That's why I made an effort to make sure that we got everything online because in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 past when I first got on Council people would come down and have to pay for it which I thought was ridiculous . So that's why we put everything on the internet . And in terms of your question about the resolution s and the ordinances , we follow the rules of Council which we approve every two years every time we reorganize . Kevin, do you want to take a second and explain what's behind the -- why it's a resolution and why it's an ordinance ? ATTY. HAYES: So, Mrs. Jeffries, resolution s are typically reserved for items that won't be part of the permanent code of the City. Ordinances are, well, essentially the regulation s and the law of the City. So they require additional reading s under our Rules of Council . That way, it gives citizens like you additional time to review and offer your opinions and reactions regarding those ordinances . So ordinances become part of the official code, the law. Resolution s are more or less formal actions by Council to appoint members to the Mayor's administration , to take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 other action like that. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay, thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : And resolution s would be on the agenda for two weeks and ordinance s would be on for three weeks. And that's just conforming to the Rules of Council . And the Rules of Council are posted on the City's website under that Council page. But if you have trouble accessing it, just call and we'll walk you through it. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. Now, my final question about the grants, I'm always curious when I see that the City is granted , you know, where is it going? I don't see a difference . So just like the street signs, I still don't see a difference . MR. GAUGHAN : We can get you an answer on that as well. I'm sorry, but your time is up. MS. JEFFRIES : Well, he took it up too. Okay. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : We'll get you an -- we're suppose d to receive a report on the signs. I talked to Mr. Preambo a couple days ago. So he's going to provide I think a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 six-month report on what's been done and what they're going to do, okay? MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Gaughan -- Frank, was it last week or was it the week before I did ask for a breakdown of all the grants that the City has applied for since January . Can we just follow up on that to see if we can get that information to see what grants have been applied for and what grants have been approved ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker , Mr. Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . City taxes collected by the county, so the law firm decided under pressure it was making too much at the 10 percent . So to remedy that the majority of the county commissioners decided excess fees would not be returned to the City, nor the taxpayer s but the 5 percent would be returned to the county. So we have a no bid contract with a law office that in return pays half of its fees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 back to the contracting agency. From the dictionary , some common kickback warning signs. MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, excuse me one second, Mr. Coyne. Can you just -- with the clock. That's okay. We gave you a couple extra seconds. We'll let you go on that. We'll take it away next week. No, kidding . MR. COYNE: So common kickback warning signs, no competitive bidding process , lack of appropriate supervision during the process , higher than the average prices for goods and services , vendors that are in industries where kickbacks are common. The county hires a law firm, no bid and then has them return not to the taxpayer but to the county 50 percent of the earnings . Smells like a kickback . Lawrence West. His experience noted is more targeted towards the DPW as it relates to stormwater , flood control , department of engineers , heavy equipment s and he even has a CDL so he could move most of the equipment that's physically out there. His resume lists he is currently and has been a board member of Scranton Tomorrow . It lists him as a board member of Valley in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Motion. Though on the actual site it lists him as a regional director . With Scranton Tomorrow he'll probably have to recuse himself from those processes because it does have an appearance of a conflict of interest which was reflected under the advisory opinion 21004 that when you're transacting business with an official capacity with other -- any other business entity or public where you're a public officer , director , or agent or member who has a material interest . And he actually kicks the material interest as even something that is self promotion for yourself and political means. Onto the Avero contract , Avero contracts for 688 hours at $113,487. That works out to be a $194 an hour on average . To put that in context , an employee on average has 2087 work hours per calendar year. The IT Department paid for the year at the equivalent of the Avero pay would earn $404,878. Availability , the IT Director would be available for an extra 399 hours for a year or over two thirds more availability and no overtime . And it would not cause overruns as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 contract is minimum for an IT Director salary. To use Mr. Deeley as IT Director , a position he's not qualified for requires more outside party contracting to do the work an IT Director would. The argument is set -- a set number $64,000 a year is what the position offered . And increasing it outside the budget is not proper. But we are not only increasing it, but we are compounding it by filling the position and then subcontracting those same duties to outside vendors for an additional expense . We have a director position at $64,000 along with an IT support contract at 12,750 a month. We're looking at an additional contract for 50,000 for this year and a minimum of 63 for next year. Looking at the total prices to assure that we do not exceed the $64,000 for the IT Director , we're, in fact, paying $222,000 to secure that position . Bedrock alone has cost from April to now $38,250 which is roughly half the amount of your IT Director in three months. It's a half a year of what your IT Director would cost. It was noted Mr. Deeley would work with Bedrock to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 determine the City needs recently . I thought this was the job of an IT Director . I would suggest with Mr. Deeley is not qualified but I would ask the Council to consider with Mr. West tabling the motion this week for his position and kicking it back to the Mayor and giving her the option of retaining Mr. Deeley in his old position of Business Administrator which he does have the position or moving forward with Lawrence West giving her the opportunity to choose the best qualified candidate to continue with the government rather than pushing forward the director for Lawrence West today. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. I was going to -- I wanted Mr. Voldenberg to reach out. I do have a City property that I got a complaint about. The address is 738 Prescott Avenue, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 just to get an update on the property where it stands. I do believe it's a City-owned property . And right now I'm seeing that the neighbor s are telling me there's a lot of dumping going on at the site and just let's get an update to see who owns it and if we can get some maintenance on that property . That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, Mr. Voldenberg , we have been in great discussion with the property 814 to 816 Luzerne Street. And you provided me an update. Thank you very much. And for the most part, the update stated we're waiting for the magistrate . Since that update, the resident that is facing, you know, that has all of these concerns and has been bringing them forward to me for months now understands that we're waiting for, you know, the magistrate to do his piece and fine -- actually fine the owner of this court property . What still continue s is the amount of garbage that is there. There's still since we first brought it forward syringes all over 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 this property or near the property . So, of course, like I said he understands and appreciates , you know, that we're waiting on the magistrate . But all the other health-related issues and blight issues still remain. If you could please circle around and help us out with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll escalate that tomorrow morning , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. What else? What else? Okay, so last week I brought up the Hometown Hero Banners Program that, you know, a lot of banners were in rough shape. So I would like to thank Mr. Preambo from DPW because I reached out to him. And he reached out to Urban Electric who was the group that installed them. So they took care of all of that and fixed everything . So I'm very happy to hear and thank them. And now that Officer Butler's back, we know that he was away and that's fantastic . Can we check on and get an update on the traffic study on St. Ann street for angled parking ? And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few. First, I'd like to touch again on the firework issue which I know I brought up last week. Many residents have brought up to me as being a major concern for them and their quality of life in the City of Scranton . I would like for us to send correspondence to the SPD to ask them how much we've given in tickets for breaking the ordinance for fireworks because there is suppose d to be a $300 citation . I want to ensure that the ordinance is being enforced because right now I know too many people it doesn't appear that it is with how frequent they hear the fireworks going off in their neighborhoods and also an ordinance we have that, you know, we have the exceptions for just a few holiday s, 4th of July being one them. But it's for one day. It's not for every day leading up to that holiday and then every day afterwards . So, you know, I think most people are understanding about the holidays . But it's all the other days that the fireworks have continued that it's really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 disruptive and very frustrating . If we can find out, you know, how the ordinance is being enforced and how much citations have been given. I know that the police have a very important job to do and there are many issues they need to address when they're working in the City but, you know, this isn't a victimless crime. There is people who are, you know, do suffer from the fireworks by getting injured or, you know, maybe issue with their properties . And the other thing, I know that the Mayor along with other local mayors sent a letter to the state to request a repeal of Act 43. I would like to make a motion for Council to do the same and send a letter. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Motion and a second. On the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And the -- one other issue I wanted to bring up once again was Harrison Avenue which we continue to get complaint s about which I have to drive on every day as well. And I'm very close to going on a walk up the entire street to take pictures of all the problem residences . And I don't want to have to do that but I would like to do that with an inspector perhaps . So I would like to make a request of the LIPS Department that I set up a date with one of their inspectors to do a walkthrough of Harrison Avenue and to come up with a plan for that roadway . And that's everything that I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comment s tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have two comments . So the Serrenti Center was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 brought up tonight . A caucus is being scheduled with the Chief of Police and other City official s to give us an update on the Serrenti Center. And we've also asked for another breakdown of how much money has been spent and what the future looks like with the building . And also Meadow Brook, the Meadow Brook Creek Project we do have legislation on the agenda tonight . That caucus is also being scheduled with City officials , the engineers , DEP, the state to give not only Council an update but also the residents and the public an update on that project . It is a very, very large and very involved project . Also, I received an update today that Council will be receiving legislation on several of the Act 47 recommendation s included in the Exit Plan; for example , the debt management policy and other policies that were recommended in our Exit Plan. I was told today that those should be coming down within next few weeks. So I was glad to hear that. Also, I wanted to double-check, Mr. Voldenberg . I don't believe we receive d a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 response to the question I raised on casual -- the $50,000 for the causals in the budget for the Parks and Recreation department . MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . We have not. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So if we can just follow up by the end of the week on that. Again, we're getting towards the end of the summer. But we -- Council made sure to put money in the Parks and Recreation budget for part time workers like they've had in the past to go out and cut grass. As everyone knows, we have 30-some parks in the City. And it's very, very hard to cover all of that ground with the limited number of employees we have. So I am disappointed that we have not used that money yet and have not used that program . I hope that if it's not going to be done this year at least it will be done next year. And that's all I have for today. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE RENAMING OF SPRUCE STREET AND THE CENTRAL 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 SCRANTON EXPRESSWAY IN HONOR OF UNITED STATES PRESIDENT JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I first want to thank the committee members who helped put this all together . This committee formed back in February of this year. It is an idea I had when President Biden was inaugurated in January . The members who are on the committee were Councilman Donahue ; Kevin Hayes our Council Solicitor who drafted the -- and wrote the report that's in Third Order tonight , Larry West, the Mayor's Business Administrator ; Don King, the Mayor's City Planner ; Mark Dougher who works for the County Parks and Recreation Department ; Leslie Collins who is the Executive Director of Scranton Tomorrow and Roberta Jadick who is a member of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 I really appreciate it. We met several times over the last few months. And I appreciated all their input and their help. I am not sure if we would be able to say again in our lifetime that not only did we have a Vice President but we also had a President who grew up for the first 10 years of his life on North Washington Avenue in Green Ridge. And as we know, Scranton played a tremendous role in the life of Joe Biden and the life of his family members . And let's not forget that Joe Biden's ancestor s, the Blewitts immigrated to Scranton from Ballina , County Mayo, Ireland where the Gaughan s are also from, my ancestors , in the mid 1800s and made greats contributions to our city. So not only did Joe Biden make a contribution to our city, but his family members throughout our city's history also did. So it's fitting that we honor a man who embodies the spirit of Scranton which I believe can be summed up by what his father told him when he was a young boy growing up in Green Ridge. And that is, "When you get knocked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 down, you get back up." Scranton like President Biden has seen its share of trials and tribulations . But we always get up. We always fight back. And we always persevere . President Biden through his conduct and through his Scranton spirit has given us hope that our brightest days are ahead of us. He has given literally , almost his entire life to public service . And during that time, he has never once forgotten about the City of Scranton where he was born and raised. It is an honor and a privilege to be able to vote on this legislation tonight . And I truly believe that it will have a positive impact on the City of Scranton and will allow future generation s of Scranton ians to know to never give up on their dreams. Thank you.

GAUGHAN : On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so my position hasn't changed on the appointment of this position since last week. Over a week ago I requested from the HR Department a job description . I thought it was a valid and reasonable request . It's over a week. Guess what I received ? Crickets . So and again, it's nothing personal . We talked in caucus about, you know, not having experience or the skill set for IT. And this is the same. There's zero experience , nothing personal . We didn't exit Act 47 yet. So there is a lot of unknowns . I can't comfortably vote yes for this or the next position . And it's funny, back in 5-C for the public health coordinator which was posted back in January , guess what's written in there? There's a job description with roles and responsibilities , preferred expertise and an application process . None of this was followed for this Business Administrator appointment . And this is for a private contract with its grant funding . So as I said last week, you know, I might upset a couple people in City Hall. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 I would rather upset a couple people in City Hall than 70,000 taxpayers . You know, I'm looking out for their best interest . This doesn't work for me. So I'll be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , my opinion from last week still stands as well. You know, in the past -- well, like we said we're exiting Act 47. I do feel someone in finance of city planning would be better suited for this position . In the past and the last few Business Administrator s we had, had a background in city planning and finance . I think that's got us to the point where we're at right now with the exit of Act 47. I think it was said in public comment tonight that not having the right person or the right credentials in education and experience for the position also compounds the fact that we're running over when it comes to budget line items. So the pattern in the City that I'm seeing is that we're using contract ors to make up for the experience and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 education that some of these people may not have. So I'll also be voting no tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? As I stated last week, I'm going to be voting for Mr. West. I have had many interactions with him and dealing s with him over the last eight years as he was the Chief of Staff for State Senator John Blake. I am confident that he will be able to perform the job as Business Administrator . So I will be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-D legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-E. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 181, 2021 – APPOINTMENT OF CARL DEELEY, 711 NORTH WEBSTER AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18510, TO THE POSITION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) DIRECTOR WITHIN THE OFFICE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend a final vote on Item 7-E. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I guess I'll start on the question . So we talked in great detail about the IT Department . The budget is almost exhaust ed. And Mr. Deeley who was the Business Administrator who prepared the budget last year got moved over there. He had the skill set to be the Business Administrator . Now he's moved over to the IT Department . He actually admits that he doesn't have the experience . So this is another example where I can't vote for it. This is not in the best interest of -- but, you know, almost exceeding the budget this issue was -- this issue was known in January . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 So like I said in caucus, you know, it was poor planning . So there's an old saying if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. So that's what happened with this department . And I feel it's going to happen again with what I just voted on, the other appointment . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question , so the IT Department is a perfect example of using profession al services and contracted services to make up for some of the things that the City doesn't have. And at this point in time I think it's about 92 percent of the IT professional services budget has been utilized . There's going to be a budget transfer for that to cover costs moving forward . But I think it's a perfect example of why we have to have the correct people with the correct education , experience in these positions . And nothing personal to Mr. Deeley. He has a great resume, just not suited for this position . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 question , I'll also be voting no on this appointment tonight . And as the gentlemen to my right stated, nothing personal . My interactions with Mr. Deeley have been very good over the last two or so years. He's been a gentleman and also responsive to Council . But it does come down to qualifications . Mr. Deeley is not qualified to be the IT Director , period. The IT Department Director require s a very specific skill set which the Mayor herself laid out in the job posting that went out months and months ago that was issued by the Human Resources Department . And unfortunately , Mr. Deeley does not meet most of the basic requirements , one of which is a degree in information technology . That is not anything anyone up here created. That is coming directly from the Mayor and her administration . My other concern with this besides Mr. Deeley not being qualified to be the IT Director and not really having a robust background in IT which is, as I said, a very specific field and very technical field is that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 the fact that on top of that, the Mayor is asking Mr. Deeley to not only be the IT Director but to also perform the functions of Office of Business Administrator . I had a meeting with the Mayor and several other City official s in which I questioned this and asked point-blank whether or not within the memo where it states that the IT Director will also still be responsible for basically the budget preparation and financial planning , would that just be for this year because I could understand that since there would be a transition . And I was told no that that would be the way it was going to be moving forward . I have a major concern with that. First of all, as I stated, Mr. Deeley is not technically qualified to be the IT Director . So now you're taking a person who is not technically qualified to be in that position and he's not only doing that position which he's not qualified for, but he's also still performing some of the functions of the Business Administrator . We went down this road before in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 2017 under the Courtright administration . I have a copy of the Act 47 Recovery Plan. And one of the recommendations in the Act 47 Recovery Plan from the Pennsylvania Economy League was under financial management the allocation of administrative responsibilitie s. And what the Pennsylvania Economy League was recommending to the Courtright administration was to disperse -- the dispersion of non financial or department specific responsibilities away from the Office of Business Administrator and to the responsible City department . It states the fundamental objective of the operation of the Office of Business Administration should remain the administration of the yearly budget and completion of the audit on a timely basis. The Business Administrator 's office presently assumes responsibility for the departmental initiatives outside of its administrative code responsibilities . So essentially in my opinion what this administration is doing is reversing that to the IT Department . You have an IT Director 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 now who is also going to be doing some of these responsibilities . We all understand that we have a strong mayor form of government and the, Mayor has -- should have the ability to choose her team and run the City as she sees fit. However , when this comes before Council and it's very clear that he's not qualified for this position , we cannot in good conscience vote for him although I do like him as a person and as an individual . The other thing I'll say to break it down for everyone is I would not hire an electrician to do plumbing work in my house. I would not hire a plumber to cut my hair. The IT Department is very important as we all know. Since Mr. Swietnicki left, we have seen a lot of problems , a lot of problems . We had to hire -- not Council the Mayor through a no-bid contract hired a third party company at 12,750 a month. We've been asking for a timeline on when that's going to end, when that's going to be bid out. And we're being told that they're still assessing the situation . The bills are racking up. It's very expensive . We did not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 create this problem . This problem was present ed to us and we cannot -- I don't think we can in good conscience vote for someone who is really just not qualified for the position . So that's why I'll be voting no. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just briefly on the question . I do agree with what my colleagues said about Mr. Deeley, his qualifications for information technology , especially the director . I do believe that Mr. Deeley has the best interest of the City at heart. I do believe that he brings a certain skill set and certain experience and qualifications that do add value. With that being said, it's hard to justify an open-ended appointment to the position of Director of Information Technology . If this was sent down with a sun set date of the end of the year to develop a plan for the IT Department to oversee the transition to OpenGov , you know, I would be willing to consider that. And I more than likely would vote for it. This is open ended. Once you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 approve this, it is -- it's good. It's good for as long as the Mayor is the Mayor. And I have a problem with that in terms of long term. If there was -- if this came down as a short-term solution to this issue, I would be fine with that because at the end of the day we did approve -- before this year there was only three positions in the City's IT Department . We did approve the addition of two additional position s that the Mayor had proposed in her 2021 budget. And that's where the salary rate was set at. We've lowered it maybe by a thousand or two I think on -- for two positions . But it wasn't like, you know, we lowered it so much that now we can't hire an IT Department . This was what came down from the administration . So for those reasons I'm going to vote no. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I'm in agreement with my colleagues here. And I don't want to rehash what's already been said. But I did mention last week that I did find it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 problematic this appointment and that I was understanding we're in a position where we don't have an IT Director . And we haven't been able to get one I think primarily because of the salary. So I could also understand if this was for a short period of time. And I truly do appreciate the great work that Mr. Deeley has done as BA for our City. He's always been very easy to work with and very responsive . And, you know, I felt that he fit well in that position . However , you know, I don't think that is the same for the IT Director position . And I'd also like to see more of a plan for where our IT Department is going. We all know that we needed the new website , the operation system and we need to further develop just our City's technology as a whole to catch up. That's very important in today's age. But I believe that we need to find someone else for the job. MR. GAUGHAN : I just want to add one more thing too. The notion that may be out there that the administration or the Mayor's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 back is against the wall, there is no other option; this is a self-inflicted wound. Back in January they decided for whatever reason to move Mr. Swietnicki who had been the department director for a number of years into another position whether you want to call that a demotion or not, it's up for debate and then didn't have anyone lined up to take his position as the IT Director . That position has been open since I believe January or February . Now all of a sudden, everyone 's pants are on fire and you need to hire someone who's not qualified . Unfortunately , that is not our problem . We cannot, as I said, in good conscience let someone be in that position that does not have the skills and the technical requirement s that this -- the administration put out and said they needed that you would need to be in that position . So part of this I think is a self-inflicted wound. I think we're all committed to making sure that the IT Department is functional and does a good job moving forward . But Mr. Deeley unfortunately outside 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 of his accomplishment s which I agree with Dr. Rothchild as Business Administrator is not fit for this position .

SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of 7-F. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , this is an important step in terms of transparency . And also on the accounting perspective , we're going to get the huge influx of ARP money in. We have to justify how we spend that. So instead of that going into the City's General Fund, it will first go into this account as a special city's account . And then as we're drawing down or paying out programs , it will be put into the general fund or whatever fund that that program needs to be -- that it needs to be put into. And also moving forward , there will be an RFQ going out for an auditor to do both, do preaudit and postaudit of all of these funds so we make sure that the way we spend is completely above board and meets the regulation set forth by the Federal government .

SCHUSTER : On the question , Mr. Voldenberg , over the course of about four weeks I've asked on two occasions whether this retrofitting was being done at the recommendation of the old study that was contracted between I think it was contracted in January of 2019. That question did go to the administration . It made it through the proper channel s and we haven't received an answer yet, correct ? MR.

MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-I. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? I'm hoping that we can use some of the American Rescue Package funds for an investment into our park system. Very soon we'll be receiving a report from McLane Associates on a comprehensive park study. And there are parks throughout the City that like Oakmont and Robinson Park which need major upgrades . Nay Aug Park is another example . So I'm hoping as part of this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 conversation on the use of these funds if we might be able to use a portion of them towards not only the rehabilitation of these parks but the ongoing maintenance as well. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just to add to that, I mean, I remember growing up and spending time at both of these parks that are on our list. And they were two of the best parks in the City. And they didn't go into disrepair out of the blue. It was because of a lack of maintenance . So we absolutely need a maintenance program to, you know, going forward toward to upkeep -- do the proper upkeep on all of our parks. MR. GAUGHAN : And I would add to that as well that the -- I want to thank the Parks and Recreation Department . There are not a lot of employee s in the Parks and Recreation Department . I think there is one or two, maybe one station ed up at Nay Aug Park. McDade Park has 9 or 10 for an example . The men that we have in the Parks and Recreation Department do a phenomenal job. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 live across the street from a park. They go to extreme lengths to make sure that the park is maintained . The grass is cut. Garbage is picked up. I see them constantly and in other parks throughout the City. But they are stretched thin. It's very difficult to cover 30-some parks. And what we alluded to before with the $50,000 funding that we put in the budget for a program where casual employee s would go out as they have in the past and help to cut the grass and maintain the parks. I hope to see that happen. But I do think we need to make a significant , significant contribution and investment in our parks system. I live over by McLane Park in North Scranton . When they rehabbed that park, the whole entire neighbor hood changed . It was a great neighborhood to begin with. But it strengthen ed the neighborhood . When these two projects go through , God willing , and the funding is awarded, hopefully those parks will change that neighborhood as well for the better. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ?
