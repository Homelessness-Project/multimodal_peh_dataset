SCRANTON SEWER AUTHORITY ESCROW ACCOUNT BALANCE AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2022. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King, I just have one comment on Item 3-N. So for overtime , at the last meeting I did ask Mr. Voldenberg to reach out to the Business Administrator , Larry West to inquire about the $81,490 in the month of November for overtime . I know, Mr. Voldenberg , you've reached out several times at this point. Have we heard anything back as of this point? MR. VOLDENBERG : I was advised this afternoon that we would have the items in writing for next week's meeting . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 I was asked to announce that the Scranton Municipal Rec Authority meeting will not be happening this Thursday due to lack of quorum. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Any other Council members ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: First speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Happy New Year. And on that note, can somebody give me an update on the 2021 audit? Okey-dokey. I still strongly recommend that you have a public caucus in which you bring in Kohanski , Rainey and Rainey, and the BA. And keep in mind that the audit was due on the 30th of September . It's 95 days late. You can do a 10 percent penalty on Kohanski . They've been late all four years, by the way. And if you were following the Home Rule Charter , it is 187 days late. It should have been done on May 31st. Do we have an update on the firefighter and police union 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 negotiations for their contracts ? No update? MR. KING: Nothing yet. MS. HODOWANTIZ : That's -- those two contracts expired on December 31st, 2021. So they're now 368 days without a contract . And if they go to arbitration , you know, that's going to cost the City a lot of money. When the 2023 budget was passed it was level funding for those two departments . So if they get a wage hike of any amount, that's money you did not budget. The City's website , I know that IT's had a lot of challenges , but really, we still don't have a single 2021 monthly Controller 's report reposted , only five months for 2022, all kinds of missing financial documents . Speaking of missing data, several people have asked me to ask you what are we doing for a 2023 recycle schedule ? On the website it's the schedule for 2022. Didn't you used to mail something out to the residents so they knew about the recycling schedule ? People are asking now what's the schedule . DR. ROTHCHILD : They were mailed out. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MS. HODOWANITZ : When's it going out? DR. ROTHCHILD : They were mailed out, but I don't think everyone has received them yet. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, can you get the website update and put a 2023 calendar up? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : And also, it's kind of embarrassing that the home page has a picture of the clock on the 500 block of Lackawanna Avenue. That clock has been broken for years. It's there at 11:20 a.m. Maybe you want a new picture for the website . The website , somebody needs to take a hard look at it because it's just missing so many things. The DPW contract which was finalized in September , they still got the one previous posted. You know, who is managing the website ? Do you need a third-party contractor to get it done? You could try to get some interns from the University of Scranton . I think they could do it for you for free. So you need to do something about that. Thank you, Frank, for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the Payroll Preparation Tax update that you gave me. I see we haven't made much progress for the fourth quarter . And overtime , well, we over spend overtime budget by $581,801.71. That's 31 percent more than we thought we needed. And I'd like to know why the police, they over spend their budget by 41.5 percent . Now, I remember sitting here listening to the Chief of Police talking about how he could not get people to try to become cops. Is this a staffing shortage that we're looking at? What's going on? Do you know when -- they budgeted for 2023 for overtime . They only increase d it by $1,150, yet you overspend it by $581,802. Somebody 's not looking at these numbers up in the BA's office very closely . You need to get to the root of this problem . And don't forget that the water in the budget, level funding even though in January the water rate went up I think for residents 14.5 percent . So I think we're going to have a little shortfall with the water. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is, President King, I'd be interested in having an opportunity to have a discussion with you on ECTV in regards to some issues that are pertinent at this time in regards to the removal of the pool at Nay Aug, the removal of the water slide. And, Mr. Smurl, I'd like the opportunity for you to be there too because I've done a host of right to knows, and I've received no answers in regards to so many issues that I think that the residents have a right to have an understanding of in regards to did the Rec Authority ask the City of Scranton to come forward and remove the pool or the pool house or the slide? I mean, where did the funding come from? I mean, these are all legitimate issues that the City and the residents -- the residents of the City should have answers to since the Rec Authority was in possession of these assets that belong to the City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 And it's my opinion that the City just couldn't go up there and remove them because they didn't own them, the Rec Authority did. And I had hoped to go to the Rec Authority meeting in January , but as we see now that's not going to take place. I've done a series of right to knows in regards to ECTV and a host of other issues. I did get a contact information for a person on the Board of Directors of ECTV because I would also like to sit down on their channel and have an opportunity to have a discussion with them too because I think it's time for transparency in city government. And I think the residents should know a host of different things that really this Council doesn't spend any time addressing . We need to know where -- and I'd like to follow that format through and set up some additional meeting s on ECTV because , President King and the Council , I think you should tell the residents of the city where all of this grant money is going to and why it's a good deal for the residents and why it's moving through nonprofit s.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And I think we have to bring the Mayor forward . I mean, I tried to talk to the Mayor here. She wanted to talk like I said here previously about where she lives. And what I really want to talk to her about is what she's doing to this City. And I think it's important for the Council itself to come to one of these meeting s and sit at a table like this and let's have a discussion . Let's not hide behind five-minute time intervals and let's have a real wide open discussion on what actually happened at Nay Aug Park and how does the City have the authority to remove the pool, okay, and how did that format take place and how did the money move through the Council to make that happen and how did the Rec Authority surrender those assets to the City? I mean, these are all real issues that the residents I think should be able to ask because I think this is an issue of public safety. That's what I really think it is because we've taken a pool off the children . Now, if we have a fatality down at the pool or the children are swimming someplace else -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the other thing is, it's time for the residents of Scranton to realize they're not serfs. And now we're talking about a stormwater authority ? I mean, this city has gone 100 percent off in left field. We've just left distressed status and we have a Mayor making terrible decision s and a Council that is not being forthright with its residents by telling them the truth on the way these events occurred , okay, and how they let them occur. And when you do right to knows and the City tells you that it's not in possession of those records , it doesn't have this record, it doesn't have that record, how can you deny any resident of this city an open dialogue to know what happened to their park. Don't forget Mayor Doherty spent 6 million dollars up there. I want you to go find that money. And we just had somebody stand here and talk about the clock on Lackawanna Avenue. That was 50 million dollars in that project . And when you look at the decay of our city and what's taking place here, it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 time for the Council to step forward , sit at a table and talk to the residents instead of acting like you're better than us and sitting there. You know, the big problem -- one thing that I see right off the bat today is, you know, you open the meeting and talk about the minutes of meeting s that took place and things that are happening in government . How about explain ing to the resident s because just glazing over them doesn't help them. Okay, you saw what happened to our pension plan. And then when you realize what Mayor Doherty did to the pension plan when he removed it from Mellon Bank when he was mayor and it lost millions of dollars; and in the end, it cost us the Sewer Authority . So I don't know if you're going to accept my offer, but I made it publicly . And I would -- more than likely if you want the question s in writing I would give them to you because I don't need to pushback anybody . We need a real discussion of what's taking place in the city and it has to come from you. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Lee Spindler . Excuse me, Les. I apologize . MR. SPINDLER : I was going to correct you. Les Spindler , Scranton resident . First off, congratulations , Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SPINDLER : I've known you for quite a while. I think you'll do a good job. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SPINDLER : First thing, I'm sure everybody heard the tragic comment s on the football game last night in Cincinnati . My thought s and prayers -- I hope everybody 's thoughts and prayers are with Damar Hamlin and his family. I hope he has a safe recovery and a successful recovery . Maybe he'll play again. I don't know. On the happy side of sports, I would like to congratulate Penn State on a great win yesterday . For all of those people that say coach Franklin can't win a big one, I think yesterday was a pretty big win. And I think there is more big wins in the future with all the young freshmen they had this year and more coming in next year. So for all the doubters, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 just keep an eye on Penn State for the next couple years. Next thing I was glad to hear the news about Vincenzo 's. They're going to get their license finally . I frequent there a lot. My daughter loves it. My daughter in Pittston . She used to go there all the time. She was in for Christmas and we all went there for dinner. And I'm glad to see -- hopefully when they open their patio next summer, hopefully they'll do a good job. They do a good business there. It's a great place. So I hope people frequent it. Next thing, in the paper today John Basalyga is offering parking for $50 a month in his lot on Franklin Avenue. I think that's great. I think that the Parking Authority should take heed to that and, like, lower their prices, $92 a month and $50. I hope everybody leaves the Parking Authority and goes park where Mr. Basalyga 's place is. I think the Parking Authority is ripping off this city. They didn't give us free parking for the Christmas season when in Wilkes-Barre they gave their citizens free 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 parking for Christmas . And before the new authority took over there was always free parking downtown for Christmas . I think that's a crime. You want people to come downtown and spend money, why should you charge them to park during Christmas season. I think that's ridiculous . Lastly, on my travels on my part-time retirement job I said I deliver auto parts. I go through Moosic a lot. I was there, recycling Pak Masters have two sections . I think the city should look into something like that. I think that might be able to save us money because they won't have to go out as often if you have two different sections and pick up cans and bottles and cardboard and papers on the same day. I think that is something worth looking into. Lastly, this really isn't City business . My daughter is going to kill me for saying this. I told before, maybe you all don't know she's a professional wrestler . And for people that think wrestling is fake, go talk to her because on December 11th she was in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 a match at Troop and she broke her collarbone and she needed surgery . So on January 15th, two Sundays from now, Classics Bar and Grill on Bryn Mawr Street is having a benefit for her. And she has a hefty hospital bill. And she's going to have to go for therapy . But she's eventually going to wrestle again. They said in three months she could go. I tell her to pump the brakes. She'd rather go sooner than later. Hopefully she does the right thing. And that benefit starts at 5:00. There's going to be bands. Again, it's Classics Bar on Bryn Mawr Street. So hopefully we'll get a good turnout. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . Next Tuesday if I'm absent is because Mr. Oleski put me in jail for my rubbish . I go to Mr. Ware Tuesday morning . As I related last year, the rubbish was at the house next door but nobody seems to acknowledge that. Mr. Sunday abused his position and power and deliberate ly, vindictively has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 targeted me because of my constant complaints of the deliberate abuse and deterioration in my neighborhood . It's gone downhill something terrible . Nothing is done. On my block, I have an abandoned house across the street. The roof fell in. I got a house on the corner that people have seven cars, three of them don't run. They're just sitting on a piece of land and made a big muddy mess the last couple weeks. Next door to me where the slumlord bought the house a few months ago, the first tenant he threw out. That's where all the rubbish comes from. The second tenant is just deplorable . He got two cars he parks in the front lawn like a used car lot. And, of course, the past couple weeks it's turned into a nasty muddy mess and diminishes the value of everybody around there. And it doesn't make sense because the whole back of the house is paved, probably a dozen cars can sit there. That's just the thinking of a slumlord . It seems like Mr. Oleski gives more credit to somebody of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 that caliber than me. I've been there 25 years and have three pieces of property in my name, two of them aren't in town in Scranton . It's been going on for three or four months with -- the house next door was a credit to the neighborhood . The man that owned it had a lawn business . So you could imagine how nice it was then. This situation to me it seems like the buck should stop with our incompetent Mayor and administration , both of them lack any ability to govern this city. Why the Mayor and the Council are reluctant or fearful to confront Mr. Oleski doesn't make any sense when he's waived taxes. He has no authority whatsoever to do so. Nobody seems to care what he does. He must be like Hunter Biden of Scranton or something . Maybe he knows who gave Debbie the key and holds it over everybody . There's something going on. You know, truth be told Paige has to be a mayor for all us. And she just chose to become a mayor for this little area downtown full of turncoat 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 developers . You have to almost sue them to get some tax money from them. Now, today's paper talks about it looks like they're going to have a parking lot war. That's the thanks she gets from the dollar sale of the parking garage. This town I said it a month ago, this town still thinks from the sour stench of (inaudible ) and corruption starting with the sewer sale. It's been going on and on and on and nobody seems to confront anybody that does something . Mr. Oleski ought to have been brought up before you people and made to explain why he waives taxes. That's how his salary is paid but, you know, not a word has been said against him except by me. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Let me ask you one thing real quick. On that slide for Nay Aug, I don't know who gave permission ; but when it was sold scrap was 8 cents a pound. That was a $200,000 investment that must have went for scrap for 8 cents a pound. This is senseless for somebody to have the authority to do that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 to the taxpayers of this city. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Is there anyone else who would like to address Council ? MS. KOLOSKI : Hi, Doris Koloski , Colfax Avenue. I'm here about the hospital expansion again and zoning. So basically what I really need to know is where we are sitting because while Mr. Donahue was still on, we were trying to get Don King to come and explain things how certain things happen. A group of us, the neighbors have meeting s usually on Monday night if somebody from Council and Don King wants to come maybe and explain it all to us because I actually don't know where it lies now. I know it was tabled. I know it was going to -- why -- we couldn't understand why we didn't see when it went up to supposedly Lackawanna County again that Don King changed institution al but left the 200 block as civic of Colfax. MR. KING: Doris, it will be reintroduced next week. MS. KOLOSKI : I'm sorry, what?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. KING: It will be reintroduced at next week's meeting . MS. KOLOSKI : What does that mean by reintroduced ? MR. KING: Reintroduced , it will be tabled until we can have City Engineer Don King to come in. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, so that will be the next step. Okay, I have one question to ask you and I don't want you to get upset or take it the wrong way or something . But rumor had it that, like, you work for the company , Mr. King, that is going to be doing some of that expansion . MR. KING: That's -- my company has nothing to do with Geisinger or Geisinger 's expansion . Probably 95 percent of the work my company does is K to 12 schools . We're not involved with -- MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, I was -- that's why I asked you because that was the rumor going around. And I just figured if that was it, you should recuse yourself . MR. KING: Believe me, if that were the case I would recuse myself.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. Well, thank you. Basically that's what I was here for to see where our next steps were. So next week -- will that be reintro duced at the meeting or at the caucus that you have? MR. KING: That will be reintroduced at the meeting . And then it's going to be tabled. And then we'll try to set up a time for Don King to come in and meet with us. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay, great. Thank you. The other thing I had as long as I still have some time left, there was on Olive Street and Colfax Avenue, there's still one corner that was never cut down when they cut down the four corners . I realize it's kind of the colder weather now. But they were going to look into that to just cut down that one more corner because if you're going in a wheelchair or a walker or a stroller , you can't get up that one -- it's really high because , you know, when they keep digging down for the paving and it was just missed. MR. KING: When you say cut down, what do you -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MS. KOLOSKI : Well, the curbs for the handicapped they're cut down. They just happened to miss. The other three curbs are all cut down. And it's the corner of Colfax and Olive on the even side closer to the armory or the old armory. And there was one other thing, I was also wondering about the parking permits . I mean, I went down and bought my parking permits. And they assured me that they were still going to still ticket on my side of the street on the 400 because we never see anyone so I'd just like that clarified . I'm hoping they are because otherwise we can't park. I mean, they are already parking in front of my house. I'm closest to the hospital and God forbid they should have to walk from four houses away instead of two, you know? And that's basically it. Have a good day and congratulations , Mr. King, on your -- MR. KING: Thank you very much. I appreciate it. MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , and Happy New Year and congratulations , Mr. King and Mr. Smurl, for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 filling out the roster and everything and Happy New Year. And the year is going to be what we make it. And I'm hoping that between the board and Council that we make it a good year and we make some good decisions for all the residents of Scranton . The first thing I wanted to ask about was I was looking on the website, the City website for the street paving schedule . Is there a new schedule every year? I have some -- I had some pretty big pothole s in my street and I called several times, the pothole hotline. They did come out and fix the bigger ones. But they didn't fix the smaller one. So I don't know is there a definition of which ones they fix and which ones they don't because it seems that they were out there putting that stuff in the hole why they couldn't just continue to fix the other holes. So then I thought the whole street has been patched a lot and I thought , well, maybe we're on the agenda to have our street paved next year. So I went to the website . I did not see a list of the street paving for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 2023. MR. KING: What street is that, Mrs. Jeffries ? MS. JEFFRIES : 600 of Colfax. And, you know, it's so strange because they paved Olive Street and they paved Pine Street and they left us in the middle with nothing . So it's just something every time I pull out I hit that hole. And I don't want to buy a new car this year. So that was one thing I was concerned about. The other thing I was concerned about it still remains a hot button with me is the street signs. And I have to thank the Times for following up on Mr. King's list of street signs that were going to be put up in South Side and West Side. And that's one of my activities that is going to be this year is to take that list and to go and make sure that they're all done like they were listed on Mr. King's report. Now, Mr. King did -- I'm sorry, Mr. King, Mr. West, I'm sorry. Mr. West did offer to sit down with me and go over the street signs. I may just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 give him a call and see what's what. But, you know, with all the Scranton Tomorrow is going to be doing so much work in the city and I don't know -- you know, I keep thinking why they can't jump on the bandwagon too and to have our street signs out because they're going to be doing all that work so they say between Jefferson and Monsey Avenue I think it is on Biden Street. So if they're doing all that work there, why make that all pretty-pretty and then the rest of our city is falling apart. So I like Scranton . I've been back in Scranton almost four and a half years now. And it's still is a place I enjoy living. And I know there's a lot of negativity about it but I won't go there because there's a lot of positive things going on as well. My final thing is that I would like to -- I guess it's a congratulations to the new members that are going to be introduced tonight by Council to the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority . As you know, I'm a member of that authority so I do welcome those that are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 and they'll get to know me. And I'll get to know them and look forward to us having a good board. I want to also thank those that are no longer going to be serving on the board Teri Millard who did so much work on the board and her fund-raising efforts are just stellar beyond anything that I could ever do. So I just want to thank her for that as well as Tom Williams who was our treasurer and who kept track of all of our books and everything . So I just want to thank them as well and congratulate those that are coming onto the board. And I look forward to getting to know them and to working with them as well. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Is there anyone else who would like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn . Okay, I would agree with Joan piggybacking or caboosing on that audit. Something has to be done with that. And I feel anyway that some of the pension losses was the stock market. We have to start keeping track of that a little better. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Back in the last 2008 flop of the stock market, we lost 26 million dollars in value from the pension on firemen and police alone. So it's very important that we light a fire under anybody that thinks they have a right to sell us any wooden nickels . I don't need another series of tax increases that are astronomical because that is inflation too. Now, I have an old article here. I guess it's Thursday , December 15. It was right around -- I missed that. It went over my head with the increase in the sewer rates. But this article goes through (inaudible ) state utility laws to limit rates. And apparently and I remember it from way back I was against selling the Sewer Authority and plant entirely because I felt that a couple million dollars a year, year in and year out we could have met the requirements anyway. And at that time my bill was less than $55 a month for two people. So the point in being that now it's more like $120 a month. Now, there is some insurance there. That's gone up a bit. But apparently the PUC has a long history of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 rolling over for utilities . But in this case it went even further and acting against local consumers interest . The company had propose d a 4 percent reduction in sewer rates for Scranton and Dunmore . But other parties invoked the state law in spreading broader system improvement costs to Scranton and Dunmore . Now, that's where I remember it very clearly several years ago when this started we were suppose d to be like everybody else -- treated like everyone else. And at that time if you had a fancy spot somewhere out in former farm land or out in former forest land or in the Poconos or something like that with half million dollar houses. My sister was offered 420,000 back in 2005 because somebody from the Casino up in Mount Airy wanted to buy them out. So the point being that we were actually subsidizing those sewer plants for those small communities , 20 houses, 15 houses, a housing development , sometimes even a second home. And we hesitate on all of this infrastructure and onto our sewer bill. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 then when it came down to the consumer protection -- Pennsylvania Consumer Protection Agency, they pulled the carpet on us. And our sewer bills shot way up. And it's really a shame. And we have to -- I don't know what can be done about it; but it's not right. They just love to pull the carpet out from under city people who actually have less money. And the only reason we have any money is because we're efficient in our use of land and, you know, highways and everything else. Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I wonder what is the matter with DPW that they did not know that January follows December and we would need a new recycle schedule . I mean, I had to call to find out because I was getting a lot of papers together and I wanted to know when paper was going to be collected . So I don't know why that -- that should have been out certainly by the middle of December . And I don't understand why those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 3-O -- why are they -- why is that amount not in the budget? Should that not be revenue in the 2023 budget? That is the -- I mean, last time I went to the meeting I thought it was going to be the last meeting but it wasn't, but it's very close and certainly going to be done by this year. So why isn't that money that's going to come to us in the budget as revenue ? MR. KING: I believe that that's currently held in escrow in reserve at this time. I'll look into it further for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, but it's suppose d to go -- it's this escrow until it's the Sewer Authority is gone. And that should be happening any time now. So it does come to the city. That's -- that's a given then. And I don't know why -- that's a good chunk of money to be in the revenue . On 3-D, E, and F, I do not know why they had not come before Council and why they're doing it after the fact when you take three months to finally cover some of the shortfalls and cover them with transfer accounts that had over -- still had a lot of budget left. And I just don't understand why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 it was done after the fact. MR. SCHUSTER : So these here (inaudible ) only don't come in front of Council , only if they switch from department to department . But, yeah, I requested that these be in Third Order to get them to the public because a lot of transfers we've seen in the several weeks. MS. SCHUMACHER : I think there is also a dollar amount. If it's over $10,000 I think it -- it still I think should have been here last year. What happened to last year's 8-A? I'm surprised the Commonwealth is not after us. I mean, that is something that has to be done. And we've been holding it there because it's well -- well, it's -- I believe at least the reason is because it has the hospital and what they can do in their -- with all of that land that they have torn down the houses. And I just don't know why they're not after us because we are way, way delinquent . And what has happened -- I think it's been about six months. We're suppose d to get lobbying reports . And it's been six months 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 and I have not seen a report in Third Order. So are we not using that lobbyist and just throwing -- what is it, like $8,000 a month or something like that? MR. KING: I think a report was given recently . I think it was in December . And I think it was -- DR. ROTHCHILD : We did receive an update. MR. KING: Councilperson Rothchild , did you give an update on that or Kyle did. MR. SCHUSTER : It's in Third Order tonight . Council did request that we get some sort of an update from them regarding the Nossaman contract . And it's in Third Order tonight . It's Item 3-M. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Yeah, so I don't know -- as I say, I don't know if we're not using him and we're just throwing money at him or if we're doing something . I'd like to know if they are doing something . MR. KING: Under 3-M we presented a list of all the activities that's been going on that they have been following through with. MS. SCHUMACHER : Which one?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. KING: 3-M, it's dated December 13th. It's from Eileen Cipriani and it's regarding Nossaman , LLP Services . If you open that up it lists the activities that they have been conducting since we brought them on board. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that was one of your request s I'd say from like four weeks ago. And we did get the answer the following week and it's in Third Order tonight . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Schumacher . FIFTH ORDER. MOTIONS . Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Not at this time. MR. KING: Mr. Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Not at this time. MR. KING: Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Just a couple quick ones about the agenda tonight . So I just wanted to point out in advance about agenda items 5-D, E, and F which I mentioned during our caucus earlier that those are resolutions with new members to boards and authorities .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 And those three do not include a resume in the backup. So that should be included for next week if anyone was interested in looking at those and I certainly am, of course. But for the other appointment s that are on our agenda there are resumes attached to those. And I also did want to echo some of the thought s that were given in public comment about the Rec Authority Board. And I know that they haven't been completely filled this year. And I think it's great that tonight that we'll have new appointment s on our agenda to fill that board because of the important work that they do for the park. So I look forward to that and to the meetings resuming . That's all. Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : I have nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. KING: Okay. The only thing I have in Fifth Order since I'm going to be filling in as the President for this year, Mr. Smurl will be assuming my position in charge of DPW and the Vice Chair of Finance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 going into this year. Also, I would like to as Norma Jeffries has mention ed the members that contributed to the Rec Authority that are leaving , I want to thank them for their service to our city. You know, a lot of these jobs and serving on some of these boards they tend to be thankless jobs. And people don't realize the amount of time and effort that goes into serving our city. And I believe that happens quite a bit across our city. There's a lot of people that volunteer their time and efforts to make the City a better place. I think it's important that we recognize them and thank them for all that they do. And obviously , the new people that are going to be joining these boards tonight , those are five year commitments . So I want to thank all of them and thank all of you for welcoming me as the new City Council President . It's an honor. Fifth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
