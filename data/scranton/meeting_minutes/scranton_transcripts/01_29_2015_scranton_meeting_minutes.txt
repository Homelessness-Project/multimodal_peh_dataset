MR.EVANS:Second. MR.MCGOFF:Onthequestion ? MR.GAUGHAN :Yes,onthe question .I'mmaking thismotion tonight inlightofourreceipt ofa draftcopyof2015revised recovery planfromPELthatwereceived this week.Therevised recovery planwill appear inouragenda nextweekand represent atives fromPEL,ourrecovery coordinator willattend apublic caucus hereincouncil chambers .In1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 therevised recovery plantherearea number ofworkforcemandates orcosts containment mandates asitrelates to collective bargaining .Someofthese mandates include thesickdaypolicy, retiree health care,elimination of minimum manning ,longevity pay, elimination ofpastpractices ,among otherthings.Therecovery plan explicitly states thattheworkforce provisions shallonlybeapplicable to collective bargaining agreements executed aftertheadoption ofthe revised recovery plan.Ibelieve it wouldbeextremely irresponsible to passthiscontract tonight inadvance oftheadoption oftherevised recovery plan.Ifwedothis,we wouldessentially becircumventing our ownrecovery planandbinding ourselves toacontract forthenext sixyearsguaranteeing thatwewould notbeabletoimplement anyofthe workforcemandates thatareafforded tothecityintherevisedrecovery1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 plan.Iwouldurgemycolleague sto tablethislegislation untilafterwe haveadopted 2015revised recovery planandhadachance tohaveapublic caucus withourrecovery coordinator , PEL.Andmyquestion wouldbeto everyone,howcanwebargain a contract against ourownrecovery plan.Thankyou.

Weare--thiscontract wasn't negotiated outside ofourownrecover y plan.Theplanyou'rereferring tois onlyproposed .Wewillbehaving a caucus nextweekandmaybeitwill pass,maybeitwon't.Ifwedon'tact priortothisplan,thecurrent contract willgoonforthreeyears. Soitwillbethreeyearswhere basically we'llbeundertheold contract without theincrease dpension contributions ,without thelower starting salaries ,without themanning changes toreduce overtime .SoI thinktheseactions needtobetaken1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 nowtosaveusmoney.Ithinkwedo needtomoveforward withthevote. MR.MCGOFF:Iwouldjustliketo alsocomment onthemandates thatare intherecovery planareforestimated savings thatcouldbeachieved during thecourse oftherecovery plan.It wasstated bytherecovery plan coordinator thattheestimated savings inthisproposed contract wouldbe within theparameters oftheir mandates .Andifthatweretrue,then itwouldbeperfectly acceptable.In bothcaseswe'relooking atestimates . PELisestimating whatcouldbesaved through theirmandates .We're estimating thecontract andifthere areestimates forwhatcouldbe achieved insavings through the contract changes .Again,itcomes downto,youknow,whichestimates do youfeelcomfortable with.So-- MR.WECHSLER :Mr.McGoff,I'd liketojustechoalittle bitofwhat you'resaying.Theproblem withthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 PELplanisthatthere'smandates but there'snoplantomeetthemandates .

OverthepasttwoweeksI'vesubmitted numerous specific questions tothe administration concerning the revisions tothiscontract .Iasked theirresponses tobeprovided in1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 writing andasoftoday,Ihavenot received oneresponse .Thisis outrageous andtrulyunacceptable .As I'vementioned forthepasttwoweeks aswe'vedebated thiscontract ,the wholepurpose forasking for concessions wastoaddress thecity's financial crisis withthegoaloflong termstructural change thatwould result inlongtermsavings .Iwas undertheassumption thatthemayor andhisadministration understood that Scranton isinnoposition andunder noobligation toofferadditional benefits orconcession sthatwould costcitytaxpayers inthefuture. Apparently myassumption waswrong. Therearerevisions tothiscontract whichIfeelwillbecostly tothe cityintheshort,immediate andhow longterm.Justtobrieflyrecap.

MR.MCGOFF:Anyone else? MR.WECHSLER :Yes,Mr.McGoff. There'saperception thatwhenthenew administration wasinstalled in2014 thatthebargaining unitsweregoing togivedrastic concessions thatwould cutsalaries andbenefits .
