DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one. I had mentioned this last week, but I just wanted to remind the public that this Saturday there will be the Pine Brook Family Arts Festival taking place from 12 to 4. And that will be held at 927 Capouse Street -- or Capouse Avenue. And there will be a lot of family fun activities , music, food. So definitely bring your children and head down there on Saturday afternoon . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have announcements at this time? MR. KING: I'll have one. I'll announce what Norma gave us just earlier that there's a Mother's Day Baby Pantry on Saturday , May 7th and it looks like Sunday, May 8th from 10 until 3 p.m. at Nay Aug Park. They're looking for diapers sizes newborn , four, five, and six; Pull-Ups 4T, 5T, all sizes accepted; baby wipes, baby food, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 cereal and formula , blankets , diapers , diaper bags, pacifiers , baby bottles , infant and toddler car seat and no clothing , please. So that's May 7th and May 8th at Nay Aug Park. I'd also like to thank -- I guess it would be the Hill Neighborhood Association in conjunction with the Recreation Authority and some -- many volunteer s that showed up at Nay Aug Park this past weekend for the cleanup. It was pretty well attended . I think we got a lot of work done to help spruce up Nay Aug Park. And I was happy to participate in that along with Councilman Donahue and Council man Rothchild . And the park is looking better and better. A tremendous amount of work is going into Nay Aug Park, including the fountains in front of the Everhart Museum. And they're doing work on the mine trying to reopen that. So it's really looking nice for our city park. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Any other Council members have announcements at this time? MS. SCHUSTER : Yes, I do. There's going to be a parks cleanup by the Greenwood Neighborhood Association . The dates are May 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 7th at the islands at Capouse and Electric Street. And then May 27th at Pretzel Park at North Washington Avenue. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : And I just have one that an executive session was held this evening to discuss personnel and labor contracts . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I don't know how many of you saw this article in the paper on the 24th. It was an article written by Mary Jo Sheridan , your former Treasurer . It's entitled Battle Corruption With Fiscal Responsibility . And she's talking about how good accounting can help a city overcome its reputation for corruption . So I want to read some of this because it's not only something that every city official should read but every taxpayer too. Financial management teams should monitor vendors for contract compliance . What does this mean? It means administrators and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 staff should routine ly review and report internally and to the public, not merely at budget time with consolidated numbers that hide activity . Also data should be analyzed to identify trends and anomalies . Reports to the public should be meaningful and easy to understand . How do the numbers compare to prior year to date numbers ? How do they compare to contract terms and trends for comparable goods and services industry wide. Do treasurers and controllers effectively fulfill their duties to ensure the collection of revenues and payment of bills are appropriate and accurately recorded and reported ? If elected , officials and vendors know a government's accounting staff, treasurer , and controller are competent , ethical and watching the numbers , the environment will be far less inviting for ethically compromised official s to shake down vendors to steal, misuse, or waste taxpayer money. Now, that only applies not just to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 City officials but every taxpayer should be watching the numbers , asking for the numbers , demanding explanations and following up. You know, you get the government you deserve . And if you're not going to put in the sweat equity into your government , you're going to get hosed. Speaking of getting hosed, the caucus tonight , if you didn't sit up there with a paper copy of the slides and you had to sit back there behind the railing , how useful would that caucus have been? Couldn't hear. Couldn't see. What's wrong with taking those slides and posting them next week in Third Order, which, you know, similar caucuses that have slides like that, you got to share them with us. We're stakeholders . We're the ones that fork over the money. MR. DONAHUE : We'll do that. We didn't receive the slides until this morning . MS. HODOWANITZ : I understand . But routinely , it should be automatic . The next week they're in Third Order. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, it will be in Third Order next week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, and speaking of followup , this is day 116 of the year. It's April 26th. A quarter of the year is gone, what is the status of the labor union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : They're still ongoing to the best of my knowledge . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, was there genuine progress made? Did you get your information you asked for last week? MR. DONAHUE : That involves negotiation s that I can't really discuss . MS. HODOWANITZ : Did you get any specifics , billable hours for Mr. Ufberg's firm was $97,000? MS. SCHUSTER : Yes, we are currently negotiating . MR. DONAHUE : Well, our Solicitor is going to review them -- City Solicitor -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, if there is nothing confidential about them, please put them in Third Order next week. MR. DONAHUE : That's what we're -- MR. HODOWANITZ : Okay, I would love to see that. And the sound system, should I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 make a donation in my Will, you know, a legacy so that when I'm dead we could hear back there? MR. DONAHUE : We have a meeting -- I have a meeting set up on Thursday to start outlining how we're going to go about doing that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. So let it be written , so let it be done. MR. DONAHUE : I'm hopeful that we can get that work done during our August recess and then when we come back in September we have that fixed. MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm going to hold you to that. MR. DONAHUE : I'm hopeful . Next on the list, Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I had to chuckle when Joan gets up and starts talking about things because as I was away for three weeks -- my son got married which is always a wonderful thing for a mom, you know, when they go ahead and do what they're suppose d to do. So when I did look at the YouTubes and watch some of them and I told Marie when I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 came in, I said, how many years have you been talking about the stormwater ? How many years? I've been coming to Council -- I've been back in town I guess it's almost five years now. And I've been coming to Council four years. And each time she's talking about stormwater , stormwater . And I'm not sure if there is any advancement yet or not. They talked about it a little bit from what I could hear from the presentation I think the word stormwater was used. I'm not sure what they were talking about because I agree with Joan, you know, I sat there listening and you can't hear a thing. But something funny though when you hear YouTube , but this is not -- I don't think the caucuses go on YouTube I don't think. MR. DONAHUE : The public ones do. When we have our normal ones, they don't. But when we have guests in they go up on YouTube . MS. JEFFRIES : So then I'll be able to listen to that and hear because you do get good volume and good sound when you listen to the YouTube . You know, so anyway, that's what I did. I did follow you guys when I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 listening being entertained . But, you know, Council 's a part of my life now to see what's going on. So one of the things I want talk about and I do thank Bill King for addressing the drivethrough for the Mother's Day weekend . But I just want to also thank all the volunteers . Nay Aug Park is run all by volunteers . No one up there is paid. We all are volunteer s. There's the board members up there. We have our meeting on the first Thursday of the month. And you're all welcome to come and to just help us make the decisions for the park because we all enjoy the park when you go there. It's just such a, you know, they refer to it as a jewel of Scranton . And it is. It's a definitely a jewel of Scranton . And when we call for volunteers , we don't mean just the young. I was a volunteer . I had knee surgery . And the other lady that was with me, she had some other issues. So what we did to help, we volunteered . We gave out the rakes and the bags and these little grabber things for people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 to pick up. So, you know, there is something for everyone to do no matter what your physical capabilities are. You know, there is something to be done for you up there at Nay Aug Park. So I put the notice out that we will be having our meeting on Thursday night, the first Thursday of every month at 6:00 at the Community Room up at Nay Aug Park. So I'm just hoping that, you know, my little flyer can go up and I'll be putting them around in the grocery stores, in the neighborhood s so everyone can see we're doing this drive for St. Joe's and that we can, you know, bring in a good amount of supplies for them because they do -- now, the reason they said they don't need clothes is that a lot of people bring things, the clothes , you know, their kids that they've outgrown things and all. So they don't really need clothes . Some people were a little bit annoyed by that. But, you know, if they want the donations to be those that are most effective and that will be used mostly by the members that come to get things, okay? MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 One question on that, for the diapers , do they have to be unopened or could they be opened because I have sizes, you know, one, two, and three that are opened that we didn't get a chance to finish. Can I bring unopened -- or opened? MS. JEFFRIES : You know, I'll get back to you, Kyle. I'll ask them. I was talking with the lady today. And, you know, we don't want used ones. MR. DONAHUE : No. MS. JEFFRIES : No, you could tell when they're not because that little tape on there. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, absolutely . MS. JEFFRIES : They'll know right a way if they're good or not. But I'll check it out for you. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. Next on the list is Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . Okay. I don't know if it's a dead issue, but last -- a few days ago we had three firemen injured and taken to the hospital when a floor collapsed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And see, I read my Scranton Times. Anyway, a thought popped into my head, well, gee, maybe we could use a couple extra firemen . So if it's not viable, it's not viable. But it could use a little more consideration . This is -- involves everybody everywhere . You know, we had another antivax and antimask hero here last week. Well, I'm on my fourth vaccination and I'm still here, you know, get vaccinated . Don't think you're some kind of hero by running around the country in a big diesel truck and going nowhere and protesting . I don't care much for protest s because as soon as the trouble makers show up, then you're liable to get arrested for absolutely nothing . So I work in traditional -- if I believe in somebody I'll even consider working for them. I read the other day that credit union building is going to the town again, another building off the rolls in Scranton . It will probably never be back on the rolls. And we really need to petition the state to take up for some of these property tax losses. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 And there was something I heard from the tax collector about a Friendship House building downtown or something . I'm not against anything , but the only thing I am against is paying all the more and more taxes for the whole county and the state. And it's their constitution that requires this. So that being said, I think it's about time they open up their wallets a little bit and not tax people out of their houses and homes in Scranton trying to make up the difference . And last week I mentioned some -- I made a mistake that it wasn't the American Accountability Federation . It was foundation . And, of course, it's financed by none other than Donald Trump and one of their main methods is right out of the Putin playbook to accuse politicians of being groomer s and pedophile s. Now, there was almost a shooting in New Jersey. A guy walked in with an AR-15 and shot into the ceiling . And there wasn't even a basement . There was suppose d to be pedophilia productions downstairs . You know, and this crazy boom, boom, boom, you know, into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 ceiling . And there was nothing going on there. It was QAnon baloney . So there's a couple of organizations you should watch out for, the Heritage Foundation , American Accountability Foundation , American Family Council , Fox News, essentially it's -- it's totally disgust ing when I hear a reporter that he's siding with Putin. And Rand Paul from Kentucky just called the Ukraine part of Russia. The point is that we have to put up with these people out of these other states. They affect you. They affect me. They affect everybody . And it's a real shame because if anybody 's an embarrassment , they are, not Joe Biden. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : By the way, I'm proud of the aid he's given to countries even humanitarian aid he's sending to Poland and everywhere else. So stop your barking and find something productive to do. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, you too. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Tonight is sort of a whatever happened to night. Like following Joan, I believe we were told in February this -- the acoustics were going to be improved in this room. So whatever happened to that? Yeah, I heard what you said, so we'll hope. What ever happened to Serrenti ? Where are the figures on maintenance and who is paying for it? MR. DONAHUE : Our request for a public caucus is still out there. We're still waiting a response from the Chief. We're hopeful in the next few weeks. MS. SCHUMACHER : Maybe you need (inaudible ) rather than an invitation . Another one, Nay Aug pool -- Nay Aug Park Pool Complex . We spent money for that expensive report and they came back with everything from, you know, lazy river and all kinds of things. And now which one has been picked? MR. DONAHUE : We haven't selected one yet. We're still trying to put the puzzle 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 pieces together in terms of the funding . MS. SCHUMACHER : What are you trying to put together ? MR. DONAHUE : The puzzle pieces in terms of the funding . We did receive a grant from DCNR I believe for 2 million dollars . We have a 2 million dollar match. And we have some other funding opportunities that are still out there. MS. SCHUMACHER : Is there going to be any water there this summer? MR. DONAHUE : This summer, no. MS. SCHUMACHER : Nothing again. MR. DONAHUE : I mean, realistic and honest with you, we're looking at 2024 by the earliest . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, the Pocket Park. MR. DONAHUE : I did get an update on that last week too. The fill is being tested a second time. Once it passes inspection , the fill will go in and then construction will, you know, the actual work will begin once it's filled and settled with the completion by the end of this construction season for the Pocket 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Park. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. When are we ever going to get a Land Bank report? I don't recall ever seeing any information on how many properties they've taken and how many they've sold, how have they've been used. MR. DONAHUE : We'll request that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, so I have a couple questions too. Have you -- has anybody checked to see how many taxpayers paid their property taxes in full and how does it compare with what you had in the -- in the budget for how the cash flow is going to go? And when are we going to see a cash flow report? MR. DONAHUE : We'll request that. I did get numbers . But I think it was in a conversation . It wasn't in writing . But I'll get it in writing on the taxes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And, oh, yes, the next phase of Meadow Brook. How many of those rights of way have been under contract ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe the bidding either is about to close or the bid timeline is about to close or did close in the last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 for the services for appraisals and surveying over there. I know that was put out in the last couple weeks. I just can't remember the timeline . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And last week, Mr. Schuster mentioned right at the end about the -- the final -- a signature was given. What is the next step now in that process ? MR. DONAHUE : So I believe that -- I'd have to double-check with this. But the DEP permit had to be amended . And I was told that wasn't going to take too long. It should have been done by now. So now I believe it's just a matter of time of just scheduling the work to be completed with the property owners. MS. SCHUMACHER : That would have been after that last signature , correct ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, as soon as the last signature came in for that they were able to send the amended -- the request to amend the DEP permit -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Does that clean-out have to be contracted out or is the DPW going to do that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MR. DONAHUE : It was already bid out based off emergency declaration in the fall. So that's why we have that price tag for it. So now it's just a matter of just scheduling with the homeowners for access to the hole. MS. SCHUMACHER : Superb. Okay, my time is up. Thanks. MR. SCHUSTER : So, yeah, that was last Tuesday afternoon I don't know what time it was, maybe 3:00 we got an e-mail saying that the last property had signed off. They should be able to start moving ahead with that. So now, yes, it's just going to be scheduling with the property owners and when the crews get out there. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, because the property owners did, you know, sign off for the initial . But to go back in we had to amend the DEP permit. So they had to sign off on the amendment to it. And there was a property owner that took a little longer than expected. But that came in last week. So we just need that amended permit and then schedule the crews to go out there. MS. SCHUMACHER : Excellent . Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , as the Mayor is speaking forward , the microphone in front of her in caucus is pushed away by the cornucopia of paperwork in front of her that excludes the microphone from picking up the volume. I understand she is projecting forward the voice from you. But without that microphone , the speakers do not work. The speakers in the back work fine for any of these speakers here who properly have the microphone in place. It is not totally the fault of the sound system in here. It is a matter of having a microphone completely away from your face when you speak. I will wait in Fifth Order to find out if we have any responses yet on the DUI for the police officers . The City Community Plan that was shown today, we were shown the popular vote and the City's plan. Then we switched to another slide. And it looked -- though I did not have a copy of it, it looked like the slide 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 of the proposed plan ignored the entire intent of the popular vote and reverted back to what the original plan was without the input of the community . I'll have to be able to look at those slides to verify it. But when I looked at the (inaudible ) matching from the first screen to screen five on their presentation , it looked like the edits that the public put in place were completely disregarded . ARPA funding , I've requested before who were the community members who started this plan, the unnamed people. We have yet to figure out with all of the meeting s who these unnamed community people came together in secretive meeting to bring up this plan before going forward . There were no names. There were no groups. There were no communities disclosed . And without that, there is no way for a citizen or anyone to decide whether or not someone has come in, put in their input for their own self-serving interest to direct funds in a form of nepotism to their own business or business dealing s without clarity of who was involved in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the initial setup of this before it even went to this group. We're blind to be able to audit whether or not there are personal fingers in this before it even gets to the population . In this document it notes that we are upgrading the City environm ent. Why are we upgrading the City's IT environment and the IT structures when we're outsourcing ? If we're getting rid of the IT, and we're getting rid of most of it inhouse and it's going to be handled by dot Gov and other organizations , they why are we improving it here? Why are we buying a new car for a garage that we're about to sell? Last week I talked about the electric vehicles . I said I thought I saw an article out there for the funding for these electric vehicles coming from the ARPA funding . I was told that I shouldn 't believe everything that I read. What I noticed in this slide here was electric vehicles line 6.01, line 6 on that surprisingly enough out of these funds has electric vehicles . It seems that four weeks before this even came up when this Council was asked for funding for some of the plans to vote 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 on, electric vehicles were put forward without full funding . And out of the documentation today, it seems that was cut out of the top of it to be put in this plan. Again, there are choices on electric vehicles . But it gets a little bit discomforting when the City takes money off the top for its own self-serving interests and allocates that prior to the input and the health and the structure of the community . And we have people who need money, not charities who do testing , but people who need to eat who are put at the back of the line. This is an issue. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR.

Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I just have a couple things in terms of Mr. Coyne's request on the two SPD officers . We are still waiting official response from Chief Carroll . I did bring it -- you know, we did bring it up with the Mayor before too. So we're hoping to get a response soon. Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to request an update on a request I sent to you a couple weeks ago regarding water runoff at 339 Wheeler Avenue. It was in the Code Enforcement report but there was nothing -- no action taken. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get an update. MR. DONAHUE : The resident reached out again to me last night. Thank you. And there is also another thing to send along to Code Enforcement . There was an issue with garbage in the 200 block of Sherwood Court between Linden Street and Roselynn . And I actually took a ride by in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 there last night and it is a complete mess and I can't really tell where it's originating from. But if we can send Code Enforcement on that as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. DONAHUE : That is all I have for this evening . Thank you. Mr. Schuster . MS. SCHUSTER : One thing I have, Frank, we did get a response . So the questions I asked about the labor Council billing, we did get the response back. And I sent back a response to you last night to send forward to the administration or to the current solicitor that's working on it. I did speak with him in executive session . And I'd still be looking for that information and how to move forward with redaction if need be. So if you could move forward . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up in the morning , sir. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. President . MR. DONAHUE : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. KING: Just one comment that had been brought up in the past about the segregation of funds with the garbage fee and the general fund. We brought that up as well. And we were told that that's currently under litigation . So it couldn't be discussed at this time. That's what we were told by the City's attorney . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR.

SCHUSTER : On the question , as this piece has come up before a couple times and now we're accepting -- we're looking to establish a special account for this. I am going to be voting no to this. I am against this private funding for this City position here. And to be clear, Council did vote on this on the original intent of this legislation over a year ago. And the original intent was to look at lowering the City taxes. So I'm going to read it again. This is the third time I've read it. The money of $50,000 was to undertake a study to evaluate tax policy, billing and collections with the goal of increasing collection rates, strengthening internal controls , eliminating waste and improving tax relief for the City of Scranton . I voted yes for the initial intent of this document . But I am against this funding going to the private -- the private funding of this position in the City. That's all. MR.
