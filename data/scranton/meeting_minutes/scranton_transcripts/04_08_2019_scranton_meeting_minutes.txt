Les Spindler spoke on city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 business and matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Glynnis Johns spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business . Paul O'Hora spoke on city business .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, do you have any motions comments ? MR. PERRY: Just a few comments . We will start out with some congratulations . First of all, congratulations to our colleague Mr. Gaughan , Councilman Gaughan for his newest member to his beautiful family. I believe that's number three now, right? Is that number three. God bless him. He is going to be a busy man so way to go, Bill, good job. Also, you know, how could I not congratulate fireman Robeson for what he did with the half marathon . That was just outstanding . I mean, you talk become strength and determination to finish that with fire gear, and you have someone like me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 who complains about going up and down a couple of flights of steps to do laundry twice a week. You know, what an inspiration and a shining beacon of light in our community . God bless him and that was just -- it takes my breath away every time I think about when someone puts their mind to something what they can actually accomplish and I think that's kind, you know, and I don't want to put words in his mouth and I don't want to put actions into his actions , you know, but I think that's kind of what I took out of it. I took out of it if you are determined enough and you have enough will, you know, what can't you do? And I think he showed us over the weekend , you know, what is actually possible if you want something bad enough. I did get some answers back on the Serrenti building . Mrs. Schumacher asked some questions on it so the business administrator , Mr. Bulzoni , was quick with his response . There was grant funding used for the roof work that was done and that was done late last year and followed up into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 into year and that was on the grant that was used before it expired . Recently there was a public notice put on April 1 for exterior and general improvements at the Serrenti building . The bids were put out and the bidding ends on that -- when does the bidding end on that? I believe on the 26th of April is when all bids would be in and the grant money for that to be used is $175,000. So we will use that $175,000 for exterior and general improvements to the building . We won't use money to exceed the grants. The grant expires on June 30. So this work has to be -- the grant has to be exercised by June 30 and that was our update. He doesn't have any itemized work to be done because that's going to depend on when the bids come in and how much he thinks he can get done for that $175,000. That's all I have for today. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just quickly on the city hall assessment , I'd like to first thank Mr. O'Hora for giving us all a tour of the -- me and Mr. Perry went today for a tour of the building . I really don't care 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 how much it costs. I don't think we should ever walk away from this building and I will never support selling this building . I think if we are going to sell this building I think we might as well just put the whole city up for bid and put a padlock on the door because that's basically what you are saying so I think we have to get better at maintaining this building and we have to figure out a plan on how to fix it up. And that's all I have this evening . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Yes. First of all, congrats to Bill and Kelly Gaughan and their beautiful baby daughter Maeve. All the best and good luck. And I, too, saw -- I was at the half marathon and I watched Fireman Robeson in full uniform and all of the equipment he hd and it is -- when you see it in person it's pretty impressive what he accomplished and all the best to him and congratulations on a Herculean effort in the half marathon yesterday . As far as city hall is concerned , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 last week I also took a tour of city hall. I have been in every office here at one or another but never in the full context all at once and especially with the backdrop of the discussions on city hall. I'd like to thank Paul O'Hora, who was just here, for the tour and taking his time out of his personal schedule in the evening to show me around, but my take-aways were, but the current conditions are certainly something that no one should be proud of. Conditions that in many ways are chaotic , they are cluttered , they are inefficient , they are certainly uncomfortable . The working conditions certainly don't lend itself to a productive and efficient work force. With all of that said though, I applaud all of the efforts of those responsible for finally bringing this issue to the forefront and hopefully to a proper conclusion . I'm not going to discuss the future of the building and the context of if it should be sold or not sold. I personally think, as Councilman Donahue does this is the people's building . We are responsible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 for this building and we should restore this building , but I'm going to provide my observation s on what I think could be done to correct some of the issues, at least at this stage, so we can cake city hall well into the future. First of all, it's pretty basic, you have to seal the exterior of the building . You have to have roofing , flashing , reappointing of the stone, repair the stained glass, which is very fragile right now, that's priority one. Once that is done you move onto the interior . It's not that complicated . There is old piping throughout this entire building and it's leaking . That has to be replaced entirely . At that point, you have sealed the interior of the building and you have to seal the outside of the building so all of the leaks that were causing problems have been resolved . Then you move onto repair the damage that was caused by the constant influence of moisture within the building , ceilings and walls that were damaged would be repaired . But I have to tell you, from that tour the real 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 elephant in the room, or in the building for that matter, is a lack of coherent storage and a real records retention policy. There are boxes and file cabinets and records and just stuff everywhere in this building . There is simply too much stuff. There is more space I think in my viewpoint being wasted by the inefficient use of all the interior space that you could ever imagine but, you know, it is what it is. That's been years and years and years in the making, but this is an amazing building and it could be something that we can all be proud of again. It can be a building that city employees would want to work in. It could be a building that citizens would want to come and visit and transact business at. It could be something that we can all point to as our municipal building . It is our building . And as I repeated on several occasions , we are the stewards of this government and of this building and we cannot walk away from our responsibility to do what we know is necessary . This should not just be my opinion . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 So next week I'm going to offer what I think is -- what I think should be included in a phase one restoration for city hall based on some of the comments I made already and the tour itself. So moving on quickly , I'd like to recognize that today would have been Bob McGoff's 71st birthday so, Bob, you are still missed by all of us sitting up here on this dais. And, finally , and this is a sentiment that Bob surely would have believed in, every day is your chance to make the city a little better. And that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. A couple of comments . I'd also like to congratulate Councilman Gaughan and his wife on the birth of their baby girl, and also I'd like to congratulate Ryan Robeson on what is an amazing accomplishment to complete an entire half marathon in full gear, which is astonishing . So we want to congratulate him for that as well. A couple of comments on some items that came up. I hope this is the last time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 I address this issue, because I think I made my position on the building pretty clear. I'd also like to thank Paul O'Hora for giving -- I think we have all met with him at one point in time regarding this issue and he has really given us a lot more information on the state of this building . My position comes down to dollars and cents. What is the most efficient way to provide services to the residents . It's not about sentimental attachment to this building or any other building . So my decision is strictly is going to be based on the cost and what is going to be the best way to provide services to the city. That is if it even gets to that point. It seems like there is a majority that is against any sort of move. I personally think that's foolish to not look at all of the other options, especially if there millions and millions of dollars that can be saved to provide better services but, again, it's a debate where we will continue to have and, like I said, my position is strictly where we are going to get the most bang for the buck that's what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I'm going to support . We did have a caucus prior to our meeting today with members of the Recreation Authority regarding Nay Aug Park specifically , the Nay Aug Pool, and it's already been reported in the newspaper but they did want to come in to give us a presentation on the status of the pool and why that larger pool needs to be shut down. Pretty much it's the same story that we hear regarding the status of city hall that for quite a long time there hasn't been basic maintenance . There was a overhaul about 15 years ago, a new liner, but the structural components of that pool were really never revamped when they should have been. So, unfortunately , that pool does need to be closed. The smaller pool and the slides will remain open so there still will be swimming in Nay Aug and the long-term goal is to fill in that other pool and have a splash pad which I think will be long-term is a great solution because you will then have not only pool with slides but you will also have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 splash pad for younger children as well. So I'd like to thank our Recreation Board members for coming in and they are volunteers and it's a tough job to run the parks and it's definitely a tough job to make a decision such as the one they made but because of the safety concerns with the pool it was really the only decision that could have been made. So I'd like to thank them for coming in to educate council on what's going on up there and to give our input on what we would like to see in the park in the future. That is all. MS. REED: 5-B.
