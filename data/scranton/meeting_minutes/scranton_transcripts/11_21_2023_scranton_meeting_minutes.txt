MR. KING: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , including Mary Kay Warner, Ricky Seco{phonetic } and Ted Robeson. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MR. SMURL: I would like to make a motion to reconsider resolution for introduction in Fifth Order this evening . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: There's a motion on the floor and a second. This resolution authorize s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 the Mayor and other appropriate city official s to waive the residency requirement for Sergeant Scott Gassenmeyer in his capacity as Parks and Recreation Director for the City of Scranton . Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, on the question , sorry. Go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : I'm not an aye with this and I'm going to tell you why I'm not an aye. All right. So six months ago we received legislation that Mr. Gassenmeyer was appoint ed to Parks and Rec. And so with that said before I had final -- voted for final passage I asked two questions ; is he going to live in the city within six months and is he going to get his lifeguard training ? He came back through correspondence through Mr. Voldenberg and said, yes. Fair enough. So I voted yes for him. We didn't need the residency waiver at that time because he said he was going to move in within six months. And under the Administrative Code Chapter Six when the Mayor wants a residency waiver, she has to send it down to Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 before the hire for advice and consent. It didn't happen. And under the same Administrative Code it says that a new employee of the City of Scranton who is not a resident of the City of Scranton at the time of commencement of employment shall have six months from the time of commencement of employment to acquire a bona fide residence within the corporate city -- limits of the city. Such residence must be maintain ed during continuous employment by the city or be a cause for immediate termination . It's the code. It's what we're supposed to follow. This Chapter Six is the Mayor's Administrative Code. She's responsible to follow this. And guess what, as Council we're responsible to follow this. So, of course, I don't want to vote to -- first of all, the legislation in our Granica says reappointment . He's already been appointed . He's here six months. Come on. And then the sloppy legislation that we got says the waiver is good for six months. And then at the bottom of the legislation it says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 it's good until 2025. But if we follow the Administrative Code like we're suppose d to as Council men and the administration , that's what it's written for. We should not -- first of all, he should be terminated . He had his six months. He had his time. So it's my responsibility to follow the code and I am this evening . MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I'm going to echo the sentiments of Mr. McAndrew . And one thing I want to point out is the administration said that we will be getting these prior to the hire if one is to ever occur again. So I hope that happens if we were ever to get an individual that needs a waiver. But we do have the City Code for a reason. And it's something that this administration hasn't taken very seriously because it's a common discussion that we have. I think maybe Council has wavered in the past and it's allowed some to slide through and we get to where we're at right now. So it's something that comes up every so often about employees who are hired 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 that live outside of the city. And it's something that the administration isn't enforcing . And I stated my opinion on it several times in the past. And I'm also not in favor of this being passed tonight . MR. KING: Anyone else on the question ? On the question , I agreed to this also for the six months. You know, at the time I thought that Sergent Gassenmeyer was going to move back to the city. And, you know, whatever family circumstances were that changed , he was not able to do that. But in the meantime I will say that he has done an excellent job. He, you know, has really -- we've heard a lot of positive feedback on Sergeant Gassenmeyer . And in the meantime we've also had an arbitration award that doesn't require the police to have to live in the city anymore. So I think that, you know, I'm going to reconsider this on the fact that he's done a good job. He is a veteran . So I'm going to reconsider this. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I was going to reserve my comments for Fifth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Order but I'll express them now. So I also had voted this down because it didn't make sense at the time. We were told that he was going to be moving into the city. And obviously that didn't occur which although I would prefer it if he was in the city, he's not. And I voted for waivers in the past. I've also said in the past that I feel like our residency requirement for the city is antiquated . A lot of cities don't have that and don't require people to live in the city in order to work in the city. And that's always been where I've stood on the topic in general . But with reference to Mr. Gassenmeyer , I am concerned about the potential for another gap in -- in that position with all the parks project s that are going on. And, you know, he's been doing a good strong job in that position . So with all of those things, that makes me lean in favor of reintroducing this. MR. MCANDREW : So further on the question , so I'm well aware that the police were through arbitration no longer require d to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 live in the city. But guess what, before they were hired they had to buy a house and move into the city. So it's not a big win for them versus Mr. Gassenmeyer committed . You know, he told me -- and I take someone at their word that he's going to move in, so he hasn't. So the code says he should be terminated . It's nothing personal . And then in regard to waivers , everybody else in the city that works here has to live here. It can't be a select few every once in a while. You know, if it was changed for everybody I'd be okay with it. But it's not fair and equitable for everybody else who has to live here to work here. It's only a select few that get this option. It's not fair. And then if you look at -- some of you have come to the budget hearing s, right, so this gentleman has worked here six months and who promise d to move into the city, in the new budget he's proposed a 7,000 raise. Six months of work? Also there is a proposal for an assistant for him at $60,000. That is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 rewarding behavior . That's rewarding behavior that I can't wrap my head around. MR. SMURL: Back at the time when we had the second reading we were under the impression that Sergeant Geisinger was moving into the city. Before that I had spoke with him and he said he was looking at building s in the city, also around the area. That evening we were told that he was moving into the city. The next day I had called him and because I had voted it down and asked him, you know, when did you change your mind? He said I didn't and I never said that. But that's what he had told me. But so I was under the impression that he was moving into the city when I made that vote which was my fault. I shouldn 't have done that. But I'm completely satisfied with the job that he's doing. We have a lot of big project s coming up. And I think he fits in well where he's at right now. So I will be supporting this. MR. KING: One thing I would like if I do end up supporting this, I would like to see that I know we did this with at least one, possibly others to see if -- require him to pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 the wage tax in the City of Scranton . Anyone further on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : I would say if this does pass tonight that he be required to pay the taxes in the city. MR. KING: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. KING: The ayes have it and so moved. Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR.

LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION REPORT RECEIVED NOVEMBER 16, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: I have one. Nay Aug Park the light show -- the holiday light show has begun. It began last night. It starts every day at 5 p.m., and it usually -- they are there until 9 or 10. And there's a collection at the end for donations . So that has begun. That's all. DR. ROTHCHILD : I just wanted to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 wish everyone a happy and safe Thanksgiving on Thursday . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so in addition to Nay Aug, the indoor winter concert series has started . They started last Sunday. They're at 2 p.m. on Sunday; 12/3 it will be Cullen, Bordo, Ambrosia ; 12/10, it will be Jump Start Music Duo; 12/17 will be Luongo Brothers Duo. Donations will help offset the cost of concerts . These will run -- continue through January . And, of course, all concert s are weather permitting . And I also would like to wish everybody a wonderful , safe Thanksgiving surrounded by, you know, family and good food. MR. SCHUSTER : I have an announcement . December 6th at 6 p.m., there will be a meeting at the Keyser Valley Community Center to address the Keyser Valley and West Mountain stormwater study that occurred two years ago and also to discuss some of the flooding that occurred there as well. So I would encourage any citizen of Keyser Valley or any other interested citizen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that is wondering about West Mountain stormwater to attend the meeting . And it's December 6th at 6 p.m. at the Keyser Valley Community Center. DR. ROTHCHILD : I just want to add one other thing. The Scranton Police Department is having their annual toy drive. And donation s will be received until December 11th. So they have a collection bin at the Scranton Police Department at 100 South Washington Avenue. And you could drop off the new unwrapped toy at the bin. Thank you. MR. SMURL: I have one question , Mr. King. For the Keyser Valley meeting , it's a public meeting , still only three Council members or not three members allowed there? MR. KING: I believe that you could show up at a public meeting . And you're not going to be discussing any legislation there. So I think anyone from the public is free to show up there to at least listen or participate . I don't believe that violates any rules unless our Solicitor tells me otherwise . ATTY. GALLAGHER : You're free to go to a meeting . No votes can be taken. Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. KING: Okay. Thanks. And I just want to wish everyone a very, very happy Thanksgiving and hope that everyone gets to spend some time with their family and has a relaxing few days to kind of catch up and recoup and get back at it next Monday. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . So where is my audit tonight ? MR. KING: I'm sorry, I was distracted . MS. HODOWANITZ : Where is the 2022 audit that was due on September 30th? MR. KING: Frank, you indicated earlier that we were -- got news from the administration that the Scranton Sewer Authority -- MR. VOLDENBERG : Finance Director Domines ' advised me today that they received the opinion from Attorney Shrive at the Scranton Sewer Authority that the issue was not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 material . So they could move forward with the audit. MR. KING: Do we have a timeline as to when the audit could be completed ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I asked that same question and haven't received an answer as yet. I expect one tomorrow . MR. KING: Okay. Great. If you could get that for us so we could report that out next Tuesday . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MS. HODOWANITZ : Ah, will wonders never cease. And firefighter and police contract s still not on the city website . Firefighters ' contract was 233 days old. And police is now 116 days old. Mr. Ufberg and Mr. Holroyd still, you know, dotting I's and crossing T's typing away madly? MR. KING: I believe that's the case. That's what was reported the other day by the Mayor and administration . MS. HODOWANITZ : Just to make you feel better about how your tax dollars are spent, in October , Mr. Ufberg receive d a check for 52,947.32. I went ahead and filed a right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 to know request because I want to see his contract as labor counsel . I suspect that there is no cap on how much money he would be paid. So what we've got here is a cash cow called the City of Scranton . This is -- this is ridiculous . And speaking of taxes, I see where there's a (inaudible ) the Single Tax Office contract is up for amendments . Does anybody know who's the labor counsel for that little deal? Is that in-house or did they have to contract that out? MR. KING: I don't know the answer to that. Frank, can we reach out and find out who the counsel is for that contract ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. That one seems to be rolling right along though unlike the others. Hopefully that one will hit the website sometime in my lifetime . Now with regard to the waiver for Sergeant Scott Gassenmeyer , I too feel that residency requirements are probably antiquated . Having said that, here's a man who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 goes by his veteran rank sergeant . And that's an honorable rank. He was a noncommissioned officer . I assume he's no longer on active duty. So when I see somebody , you know, that is proud of having served in the military , you know, I think, oh, there's a guy, you know, that I could respect , you know, he's duty, honor, and country and you take such a man at his word. Now, there may be good reason why he wasn't able to find a place to live inside Scranton . But I certainly would like to know what it is. I'm also of the opinion that any pay raise going to a department head should be performance based. Now Councilman Smurl says he's done an excellent job. That may be. I see no evidence of it. You know, if a man says he's going to move into the city and get certified as a lifeguard , if for some reason he can't do that he should come back and say I can't do it and this is why. And then you're going to give him, what, a $7,000 pay raise? Good luck. Just so you are keeping track, if all the propose d pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 raises for the city, the school district , and county go as they're touted right now, citizens are looking at 10.65 percent increase in their tax bill. And again, Happy Thanksgiving . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . And I think it's important to note that that is what the initial budget submitted to -- by the administration to Council is. It's not necessarily what's going to be approved in the amended budget. Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I wasn't here the last week. So it was -- I just had to go online to listen to Council . And I guess one of the things that -- about listening to ECTV and the Council meeting s is that you have a chance to stop it and rewind when you hear something that sort of perks your ear. And you think -- and I've said this more than once. When we stand here at this podium we are -- it's our responsibility to say what's the truth and not to make generalizations about anything . That is your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 responsibility . And it's each person's responsibility as we stand here. As I listened to the video last week some comments were made by one of the speaker s about the boards and that there were 13 boards and they did not run efficient ly. I'm on two boards in the City of Scranton . I'm the secretary of one of the boards. And I have a great honor to take those minutes , to write up those minutes and to get them down here to City Hall as quickly as I can. It may not be in a timely fashion as other people may think. But you just have to realize this is all volunteer . Step up to the plate and volunteer for some of the boards if there's so many openings on the board. Step up and volunteer because that's what these boards are all about. I take great pride and being involved in two of the boards because as I serve on two of the boards I feel and I'm sure that everyone else feels that is on the board that they feel that they want to make it a little bit better for the City of Scranton . They want to walk away and say they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 helped in some way to make the City of Scranton a little better, not to complain , not to poke it down and not to hammer it into the ground. This is our city and what we need to do to make it better, we should all step up to the plate. I had some negative comment s about an article that appeared in the paper. But that's okay. I'm thick skinned that why did I return to Scranton as a retiree . I enjoy Scranton . I enjoy coming to the meetings . I enjoy getting out and around and about and seeing what's on going on in the city. So those naysayers about the City of Scranton , I love Scranton . And any time I get an opportunity to say something positive about the city I will. For the activities that are going on at the park, Mr. Smurl, thank you for bringing it up so that I could speak and use my time to talk about some notes that I took as I was sitting back there. The Home Rule Charter , I had gone on the website during the summer and tried to find what does the Home Rule Charter say about residency in the city. Since I've been coming to Council , there's been so much discussion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 about the residency rules, the residenc y rules. Well, then do something about it. Do something about it to change the Home Rule Charter , to change the residency requirements because we've got good people in the city. So if we don't have the people -- just because they don't live in the city just to get rid of them and to fire them because they don't live in the city when they are bringing value to the city. I've been in Mr. Gassenmeyer 's company . And I'm very -- can I say that he's doing a great job? I don't know. But I do know that he has the Parks and the Recreation Department 's best interest at heart. I do know that for a fact. And that's what it takes to bring something -- improvement to all of our parks in the city. So as I stand here as a citizen of City of Scranton and as I come to these meeting s and I hear about these different things, please look at the Home Rule Charter and change it. Time after time after time we talk about the residency requirements . Let's not continue this. This is 2023, 2024, 2025, are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 we just going to continue to talk about it and not do something about it? That's all I have to say tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . And thank you for your service to the City of Scranton and, quite frankly , all members who serve as volunteer s on the various boards throughout the city, often times they are thankless jobs. There's a tremendous amount of time and effort that goes into the serving as volunteers on those boards. So I want to publically thank all of you for the great work you do to contribute to the betterment of the City of Scranton , so thank you very much. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner , taxpayer . Listening to the talk about the residency ordinance , it brings me back to 21 years ago when Chris Doherty first took office and he hired George Parker as DPW Director who did not live the city. Chris Doherty had his rubber stampers on Council and just like tonight it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 okay. We have a City Code that has to be followed . Mr. King, you tell people who come to this podium to follow the Rules of Council . Why don't you follow the rules of the City Code? It's being a hypocrite . MR. KING: No, I don't think it's being a hypocrite . MR. SPINDLER : I do. We have to follow rules. You have to follow the rules in the City Code. MR. KING: Then we'll disagree . MR. SPINDLER : You're wrong. What do you have a City Code for? MR. KING: There are times where exceptions can be made and the Council has the authority to make those determinations . MR. SPINDLER : That's -- rules are rules. If you don't follow rules, why do you have them? Just tear that thing up and just do whatever you want. That's ridiculous . And I hope next time around (inaudible ) voted for this guy, when it comes election time to vote these people out. We don't need rubber stampers on Council . We need people to stick up for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 people of the city, not stick up for the Mayor. And while I'm talking about the Mayor, I'm going to be on the Israeli flag bandwagon again. I'm Jewish and a lot of my Jewish friends are spreading the word around that the Mayor won't put the flag up. So again, when it comes election time if the Mayor decides to run again, a lot of Jewish people are upset with her. I'm going to keep spreading the word around. I'm going to write a letter to the Editor also saying the Mayor refused to put that flag up when she puts every other flag of other nationalities up. But she refuses to put the flag of Israel up. So I hope that word gets back to her because she's going to lose the Jewish vote. I know she lost mine. Next thing on positive note, I was happy to see Marty Flynn and a few others talking yesterday at the Pennsylvania American Water headquarters that they are going to fight the water rate hike. And I'm glad to see that the city is going to fight it because people can't afford it. I couldn't believe my ears last night on the news when they said last year we got a 70 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 percent rate hike. I know my water bill went up a lot. I didn't know it was 70 percent and now they want 25 percent more. Myself and many other people in this city are on Social Security , fixed income. We can't afford a 25 percent raise. I don't get a 25 percent raise in my Social Security check every year. People just can't afford it. And I have to work part time to make ends meet. It's ridiculous . These utilities are just out of control and the water company is number one. They dig up the streets a month after they're paved and it's just out of control . I hope the PUC votes that rake hike down. We should have a decrease, not an increase . They make billions of dollars and they want to take money out of my pocket when I have to work part time to make ends meet? It's ridiculous . I can't even stay retired. That's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . I was going to be short tonight , but would it be fair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 to say that the City of Scranton has two sets of rules? Did we forget about last week the two tree incidents , the Parks and Recreation s or is that another like -- that's okay. Did the Parks and Recreation Director receive his Red Cross lifesaving certificate yet like he had promised ? So he's two for two. Mr. King said he's military . That's cool. He should be held to a higher standard then if he's military . In regards to the boards, I stand by what I said about the boards. The best board out there was the Housing Authority Board. And I would be more than happy to serve on the boards. I have two resumes on file. I would be more than happy to contribute my 30 years of self-employed to the City of Scranton . But I'm nobody's cheerleader. So week after week we come here listen to the same old rhetoric . You're going to do this. You're going to do that. It's a lot of lip service that we get. One of your great lines are, "We asked the administration but they didn't get back to us yet." Well, the last issue was the water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 rate increase . We had three increase s in a very short period. Rothchild said she was going to write a letter and request an investigation why the water rates were so high. Remember when I asked about testing the city water? That's when you were going to do that. Guess what, we had another major water bill increase . This time you guys were all gung ho. You were going to write letters. You were going to talk to the Mayor. You were all jumping up and down. Mr. King, you stated the Mayor is mad too. Okay, well, I'm here tonight to commend not City Council , not the administration , but Senator Marty Flynn and our state reps because they proved the old saying actions speak louder than words. All you people do is talk. Senator Marty Flynn brought the fight to American Water Company . He set up a press conference across the street from Pennsylvania American Company headquarters with our state reps present . Not one city official was in attendance . Should we be surprised ? MR. KING: It would have been great if we were invited . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. ARGENTA : Okay. You people last week said you were going to do something . You were going to do something . You were going to write a letter two times already , Jess. Mr. King, you were jumping up and down. You had this private meeting with Mayor. She was mad. What does that mean the Mayor's mad too? MR. KING: I provided -- MR. ARGENTA : Okay, excuse me, but you're cutting into my five minutes . I'd be happy for your rebuttal when I'm done. Senator Marty Flynn brought the fight to the American Water Company . He set up a press conference across the street from the Pennsylvania American Water headquarters with our state reps present . Now that's action. It was a lot more than what you, our elected city official s did for us right after an election two weeks ago. But you proved tonight what you guys are all about rubber stamps again. So is this what we're in store for? I'll say the next two years because , Mr. King, you're up in two years. This is a prime example of actions speaking louder than words. Thank you, Senator 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Marty Flynn and our state reps Bridget Malloy Kosierowski , Kyle Donahue , Kyle Mullins for standing up for the resident s of the City of Scranton when our elected officials let us down again. When our city official s ever write those letters , please make those copies public, Mr. King. Happy Thanksgiving to you and your families . MR. KING: Thank you, to you as well. That exhaust s our sign-in list. Is there anyone else that would like to speak to Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First, a little housekeeping before I go into this. Do we have any -- in Fifth Order I would like to find out if we have any update on the emergency order and the cost incurred and the money that was spent under the backdated order if we gotten a response from that yet. Two, any news on not only the U of S but any nonprofit rentals including other nonprofits , hospitals , multiple universities who all have dorm properties in the City of Scranton ? Do we have an understanding yet that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 a $45 rental fee is the issue? If the administration still can't get a grasp on that, can Council please forward a copy of the law to the Law Department so they could understand what the law is? Three, the safety paint on the end of the Scranton City Expressway and Biden Street, do we have an update on that? And now the target fee letter I just passed up to you. I see we have a 5-L waiver. I could already hear the arguments that can't hand it out after an employee director is started . But I would like to push that aside and make it easier. A revived request to waive has been requested as the six months appeared to be near. Let us return to the promises of both moving into Scranton and lifeguard training . He has not upheld those promises . With this attempted waiver, it is violating both of his statements he had in taking that job. His retroactive effective hire date was May 22nd, 2023. See Council agenda for June 6th, 2023 that reflects this. As of November 22nd by city charter and shall has a specific legal meaning .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 It does not give you the option. Shall means you must comply or you're in violation of the law. As of November 22nd which would be tomorrow which we're already in that business day since City Hall is closed, he is mandated by the body that his contract is terminated . The code is clear. As of close of business today even if passed by a rocket, the legal day would become effective the 22nd and he cannot be a legal employee of the city, nor reelected, reappoint ed to circumvent the city charter. The attached Law Department paper is also not sufficient as this memorandum is a copy of the original request that this body struck by agreement with City Council back when his retrospective hire was made. The request for a waiver is frivolous . It needs to be stricken and an order immediately passed to the Law Department requiring his immediate termination of service s. This is not an option. This is the code. This is the ordinance . This is the law. And if you need to understand what shall means 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 in the law, Counsel -- I'm sure your Counsel will gladly explain to you the difference in may and shall and the verbiage and the legal tie-in from it. As of end of business today by City Code, he was no longer an employee . If you choose to ignore that and try to put him on back door for it, good luck because you're intentionally and willfully violating the City Code and the law. Moving onto a budget with the HUP test, Miss Cipriani made comment s on how the HUP test will proceed . How -- what confuses me is it was not a product of the administration . It was this body who actually produce d it forward. They wanted to send it out to the county office and look at all the buildings , look at all the nontaxable and assess them. The actual contract itself said that they cut out the top 100 and 85 percent of all the money that could potentially be owed would be in the top 100. I think this body since it was made out of this body, not out of the administration should make sure and mandate that we go for the top 100 first, not go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 through every single record and slow down the process . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Coyne, the answer to one of your questions , we did get the spreadsheet of items that were paid for during the emergency order. We got that on Wednesday because that looks like from the e-mail we got it on Wednesday . Can we get that into Third Order for our next meeting ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll place it. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident of Scranton . I didn't congratulate anybody for winning a few weeks ago with the election . And a little advice if you're running , don't come up here and state that $7.25 an hour is a good living. And don't harass other citizens , especially people that are down on their luck. I'm tired of this. It's been 43 years. I heard all kinds of stuff, the welfare queen. That was in 1980. There was no welfare queen. There never was a welfare queen. I could prove it right now because it's blatantly illegal to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 double dip out of the welfare system. So somebody might have been getting away with something like that. But it was illegal and you probably would see some serious time in prison. People locally have gotten caught gaming the system and they went to jail. You know, so, you know, you're entitled to see it the way you want to see it. But maybe it's time to open your eyes and I don't think anybody up there is really a crook. I disagree with some things but that's the way it is. I'm old and I have to go with my interests , not some ideology or theology or theocracy or whatever because in the long run, theocracy is just a club that the kleptocrat and the dictator used to beat the masses into submission . That's all it is. Now, on the tax exempts , I refuse to call them non-profits , in many cases they aren't. But 37 percent point 5 percent is too much for the city -- other taxpayers to carry and the state mandates it. But I think there should be a limit. And what I propose time and time again is to go to court against the state and get an interpretation on what should be the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 bottom ground. And last week and appreciate it if this just briefly gets into the Times. I was proud to see my name there. The water company has breached its promise time and time again with the sewer and water deal. And I think also it's time to go to court. As far as I might stop and see Kyle. I know Kyle. I know what his address is, Kyle Donahue . And I mentioned it's time to invite people from the city so you don't have to hear that kind of accusation that you are not interested . I think you're retired, Mr. King. So you might have some spare time to attend that. Other people are working . MR. KING: I'm not, but thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Oh, you're not retired. Okay, well, then you have to take a day off, I guess. And last week I also mention ed about the pension , the MMO and I'll define that for people on TV land. MMO means minimum monthly obligation . And due to certain losses which is time that the whole pension system be revamped because pension investment package or basket doesn't cut it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 There's ways to make money on stocks and certainly not have someone take -- some investment organization taking care of their friend and Bitcoin or whatever that's so vulnerable that the reasonable investments are going to -- are going to bail that out. And we're still stuck with a minimum monthly obligation . Thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn , you too. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . I'd like to talk two things about the budget. I definitely agree with freezing some line items in that budget for a while. I think you have been very generous over these last few years. And I think it's -- if you have to raise taxes to do that, it's a no-no, I believe . But if you could find some other places to cut then okay. Although I don't know the way you look at it, I was reading there was one place where you were going to save money overtime but you were going to give the employee because the employee was a supervisor , you were going to give him a raise to -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 instead of -- because he does not -- should not be getting overtime . So I mean, how do you save money? It comes from the same pocketbook. So that I don't understand at all. And now, you guys are frustrating us out here, at least me. I don't know why we can't get reports . Why we can't bring something here, it's legitimate and then it's gone and we can't go back to it. For instance , why can't we get something on the Serrenti building ? Ask for a study of that or a report on it. We were told before that by the Mayor herself that we would be getting revenue from that building . Are we? How do we know, we can't get a report. And there are other things. The same with the pilots. You don't seem to want to follow through with anything . Yeah, we should do something and then we should do something and somebody does something and we don't know about it, I guess. Same thing with the answer to the -- I mean, you know I like you, but when I asked about the rights to know on Meadow Brook two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 your response to me was that has been contracted out. That doesn't mean to me that some contractors got it and we don't have the information . Contracting out is fine, but let's get some reports from them and find out how they're doing, you know? And then I was looking at some of the fees and I don't understand . My understanding is that you pay a fee for a service of some kind. But some of our -- some of our fees don't seem to -- to get anything back. And, for instance , one of them I looked at was there's a license fee for equipment that are in places -- I'm not having too good time reading my own thing again. I promise to go to the eye doctor one of these days. But machines -- gaming machines that go into other places, restaurants and bars I guess and stuff like that. And they have to pay a license fee. Now, what happens to that money? What do they do for it? I mean, I know when I was involved -- at least I went in and out of my father's business . We had scales. And you paid a fee or got a license 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 and, yeah, somebody came in and checked it to make sure that it was doing what it was suppose d to do. It wasn't overweighing and it wasn't under weighing . And, you know, you could see that might be a problem . But what actually happens to the fees that are collect ed from those machines ? MR. KING: Gambling machines , is that what you are referring to? MS. SCHUMACHER : Just I think they are just playing -- just put some money in and play. MR. KING: Frank, if we could just send something to the administration and ask them about some of these licensing fees for equipment in some of these businesses . MR. VOLDENBERG : And ask the question what account they're placed in? MR. KING: Excuse me? MR. VOLDENBERG : In what account are they placed in once they receive the licensing fee from the party? MR. KING: Yeah, and where that funding goes, okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : The gambling 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 machines are a hundred dollars a year fee. But I'll find out where it goes. MR. KING: All right. Thanks. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. I hope you all find a lot of things to be thankful for. MR. KING: You too, Mrs. Schumacher . MR. LAFRANCE : May I approach with these copies? Good evening , Council , Pat LaFrance , South Scranton resident . What I just handed everybody out is a packet of something that I believe is very wrong. The first stapled part of this packet is my permit -- first permit from 2023 that was started back in April. The second packet should be information and instructions for board of appeals . I was denied a permit -- my third permit of 2023 and I appealed the decision . And I filed a right to know request which is also in here. And in the right to know request I said Mr. Oleski was questioned on my first permit back in April by Mr. Marino could a homeowner do this type of work. And he within hours approved my permit. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Well, I requested those documents through the right to know request . And I found out it wasn't Mr. Marino that made that statement . It was Mr. Negron. And I didn't need those document s from the City of Scranton because I already had them. And the City of Scranton did not give me all the documents that I wanted. They gave me some documents . I don't even know what they are. But this shows my activity log for my permit right here shows an activity timeline . And I requested document s from the city through a right to know request . And this document right here is from the city to me through the activity log, not through my personal Yahoo account , through the activity log right here. And it says April 14th, 11:28 a.m., Abraham Negron comment ed on administrative view message at Tom Oleski, can a homeowner do this type of work -- I'm sorry -- at Tom Oleski, can a homeowner do this work? Shortly after that I saw that question . I took a picture of a sketch I wanted to do and I threw it into my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 permit application as an attachment . That is not in this activity log. Two things, two electronic documents are missing from my activity log. Right to know request and somebody went in there and removed documents . All the proof you need is right here. If nobody thinks an investigation needs to be done on this -- everything is here. If anybody wants to reach out to me I'm willing to talk to anybody . If you want to talk about boards, I went to an appeal board hearing on Thursday night and I brought all of this up at the appeal board hearing . And I had the information on me ready to give it to anybody who wanted to listen. Nobody wanted to listen. They denied my appeal and all walked away. That was Thursday night. Friday has gone by, Monday has gone by, Tuesday during the day has gone by. Nobody from the administration found out about this through (inaudible ) and got a hold of me and said, hey, what are you talking about? Something is going on here, folks. And all -- there is an electronic file on this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 computer system in this building . Whoever went in there and removed that out of that activity log, their name is there or whoever 's badge or whatever credentials they used to get in there. It's in there. So I would like with the document s I provided you, I would like to ask Council to convene in a separate room to take a look at this to figure out what you with your lawyer would like to do with this if you would like to do anything with it at all. MR. MCANDREW : Well, I think we should just request -- confirm that there is anything missing from his time log and if so, why. I don't think we need to convene to do that. But that's a question we should definitely send over. DR. ROTHCHILD : I want to clarify with you. You said that there was the picture that you uploaded that you didn't find in this document . You said there was a second piece of information that was missing . What was that? MR. LAFRANCE : There's actually -- this is where it gets sketchy . When I download the right to know answer from my phone, okay, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 don't have a computer . I only got my phone. When I download it from my phone right above the activity log on my permit something is overlaid over something . And I cannot see it. But when somebody else did this on their computer for me, that information changed and I was allowed to see that. And that's in here. I have a question mark. This sketch right here when Tom Oleski was asked can a homeowner do this type of work, I could have sworn it was within, like, because I got a ping on my phone and I looked at it. It says can a homeowner do this type of work. And I'm like, boom, boom, boom right in. It was within minutes that I sent this sketch in. That request from Abraham Negron, that question from Abraham Negron and it says it all here. The time is there and everything . I got it all right here. It's missing from my activity log and electronic log. When I -- I asked for that through a right to know request too. So if anybody -- if you guys think you're going to -- I'm going to file a right to know request , they're being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 edited. They are being -- this is nuts. And the city like I said, I brought it up at a hearing in front of a board Thursday night. Nobody got in touch with me. Nobody wants to say it. Everybody is looking at two years down the road, you know? I'm looking at two years down the road too. Absolutely . Thank you for your time. Happy Thanksgiving . I'm serious . I think I have that right to ask you guys to go to a different room, convene and see if you want to do anything about this. I'm serious about that. I would like to ask that. MR. KING: We're not permitted to have an executive session to discuss a personal situation but we can -- MR. LAFRANCE : This is not a personal situation , Mr. King. This is a city document that was purposely taken out of the record. This is not a personal thing. It's the city. MR. KING: Okay. So we can make a request and take a look at these document s and even have our solicitor take a look at them and submit to further investigate if there is any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 wrongdoing or anything going on here. MR. LAFRANCE : Dr. Rothchild , I'm sorry, to fully answer your question there is also an e-mail on my second permit from Tom Oleski to my personal e-mail account . The face page of the e-mail for me what law to refer to, a 19 page law and then a comment very quickly within 20 minutes . I saw the law. I said, Mr. Oleski, please see this law. And I sent it in. That is not on the activity log for my second permit. I could understand that because that's an e-mail; but still, I mean, come on. Somebody wiped something out there and somebody needs to go in there and see who did it. That's -- what are we doing here if public information is getting wiped out to make somebody like look like they didn't do anything wrong? The corrupt politician was taken out of this building . But the political corruptness did not go with it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. LaFrance . MR. LAFRANCE : Have a Happy Thanksgiving . MR. KING: Is there anyone else who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Not at this time, Mr. King. MR. KING: Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. SCHUSTER : I guess the only comment I have is tonight it came up and it came up last week as well, flags on the building . I think if we stick to the American flag, the Scranton flag and the Pennsylvania State flag, we wouldn't have any of these problem s that we do have. Once we're flying one flag for a group that we agree with in the moment, I think we need to fly all flags at all times. And this is when we get into these situations . I discuss ed Council wavering on waivers . And in certain situations we approve certain things and in other situations we don't. And being inconsistent is where we get criticism from the public. So I think it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 would be good -- I don't know -- a good procedure to, you know, stick with the rules that we have on the law. Miss Jeffries mentioned , you know, if this piece of the code that we don't like needs to be adjusted we should change it. And if we're not going to change it then we should be abiding by it. And I think that goes for what we do on the outside of the building as well. And like I said, when we're wavering or when we choose one group over another is when our inconsistencies are called out. And if we're going to be inconsistent , those inconsistencies should be called out. That's all. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I received an update from DPW regarding the leaf bags that they are available at DPW. If you need leaf bags you could pick some up there. And they have not yet received the recycling bins. But they didn't include a date as to when they anticipate receiving those. And I receive d a complaint about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 corner of Colfax Avenue and Olive Street on the even side that the cars are parking too close and the line-of-sights are blocked . So if we could request a traffic study at that intersection to see if there needs to be any changes made for an increase in line-of-sight. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And with regards to the water rate increase , I know last week I was encouraging resident s to write letters . We did a write a letter to the PUC earlier this year regarding the other increase with the sewage rate. I still believe that we should send one as Council . But I think it's even more powerful the more people that we get signed onto that letter, not just coming from us, coming from the Mayor, coming from our other elected officials . I was really happy to see that there was the press conference yesterday that Senator Flynn had held. And I also wish that we had been given more notice or notice at all to be able to attend that press conference . If I was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 able to make it I would have because I'm in full support of us coming together in order to fight this. So I think it needs to come from all sides, from residents , from the city, from other elective officials . And I believe that's what I said in the past. So I'm not sure if there is anything else that I said that was misleading or any other actions . I can't individually take legal action. I believe that the city should. So I'm happy to be on record about that and to continue pushing for that. And I'll make a motion to write a letter from Council to send to them -- to the PUC regarding the water rate increase . MR. KING: I have no problem seconding that. I did write a letter to them last time. But I want to go beyond writing a letter. I want to take action. I want to file a formal complaint . And that's why I have been working with the state senator and the state representative s. I have been providing them with some research that quite frankly some other citizen s have been helping me with. They've been doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 some research for me, providing me with some information that has been extremely helpful . I have been doing some of my own. I will say this. If you go on the PUC website , they do not want you to file a formal complaint . They want to you file an informal complaint . They make it very difficult to dig through that website to find a formal complaint form. I found it and printed it out. Every one of us up here has a copy of that. I was asked by the state represent atives if I could forward that to their offices . I did that the other day. I've been working with Senator Marty Flynn. I've been working with State Rep Kyle Donahue . I've been working with State Rep Kosierowski along with State Rep Kyle Mullins and Tom Welby. I've been communicating with him. So I have no problem writing a letter. I don't think the letter will do anything . I think the formal complaint , the formal complaint is the direction that we all need to go. And we are, quite frankly , working 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 in unison, all of the bodies. I have been in touch with the Mayor of Dunmore . I've been in touch with Council members from the Borough of Dunmore . I know the Mayor spoke to the Mayor even of Wilkes-Barre who is interested in getting involved in this. I think that it's going to be Senator Flynn's office that's going to help to try to coordinate all of us to bring us together to figure out a way rather than, you know, all of us separately trying to submit formal complaint s how we could all do it collectively . And I certainly would have been there yesterday for the press conference had I known about it. Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So -- DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm sorry, I did make a motion I just don't know if there's a second like if we can start with that and -- MR. KING: I'll second that. All in favor -- DR. ROTHCHILD : We should be filing a complaint as well. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, all in favor.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. Okay. I'm also thrilled that there was a press conference yesterday with Senator Flynn and the state reps. I know a few of us here are maybe a little bit disappointed they weren't invited but get used to it guys. I'm used to it. It happens all the time -- at least to me. Secondly , I've been told by a concerned resident that the -- last Friday night between 8:30 and 11:30 the kids' playground gate was open and a group of nine to ten kids were in the park. And this is the Novembrino Park, okay? I'm not referring to the basketball courts which, you know, there is accessibility to this. But my understanding is all parks or at least this one, aren't they suppose d to be locked at dusk? It seems to be destruction waiting to happen. So, Mr. Voldenberg , could you reach out to our Parks and Recs Director , I'm sure he'll be there tomorrow with this concern . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So this is an issue that's been brought to me a few times. It's the rear of 1111 Blair. It's a condemned house. We know it's on the demo list. The neighbors know that. But the neighbor s there are experienc ing some issues. All right. All of them are getting rodents in their own homes because of this property with open cellar doors, windows are open. It's just, you know, of course, it's on the list. But -- and there's a lot of overgrowth for the rodents to live and, you know, be able to transcend next to the other apartments or houses that are the neighbor s there. So, I mean, can't something be done by the owner? I know it's condemned . But they should still be held accountable for, you know, making sure this property is at least safe and not a public health crisis over there. All right. So could you please have code enforce ment take a look at -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. They were unable to reach that particular owner. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 it's pending demolition once they receive the asbestos report. But I'll see if DPW could board up the property . MR. MCANDREW : Somebody needs to close the door, all right? MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe DPW boarded it up in the past. So I'll see if they could do that again. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Well, just have them take a look, please. Thank you. I also received multiple concern s between River Street and Meadow Avenue. And I'm just going to come with the first complaint tonight because I got a list from a concerned resident . So the gas station there when it was built on the top of Meadow, the city determined that a left turn could not be made, right? That was instructed . But it's not enforced . So it's causing a great safety issue there with all of the traffic coming out of the bank, out of the Gerrity 's, out of that shopping center where the pizza place is, out of the hotel. And there's no light there to help with that. There's no painted lines or some type of traffic direction coming out of them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 establishments . During certain times of the day and year, there's a tremendous amount of traffic there. You know, so the resident -- like I always say, resident s sometimes have the best ideas and make the best recommendation s for us. So that resident made a great recommendation to have a traffic study conduct ed parked in the bank across the street there between 8 and 9:30 in the morning , around noon, and then again at 3:30 to 6. So with that said, Mr. Voldenberg , and I'll be honest with you, I've driven past there. It's crazy sometimes especially around the holidays , certain times of the day. It is -- this is a very, very valid concern . MR. KING: I believe that road is on the pave list for the spring too if I'm not -- all the lines are gone. They're like -- it's missing and the road is in bad shape on top of the fact it's probably one of the busiest roads in the city. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, you know, so that's great. So we still need a traffic study. Can you please request that with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 city engineer ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We will, the traffic manager , the SPD traffic officer and the city engineer tomorrow . MR. MCANDREW : All right, please, yeah, take a peek at that. MR. KING: And if I might add, I was coming from back from the Penn State game a week ago Saturday and someone got hit by a car crossing from the ANZ Hotel over toward Gerrity's. So it is very dangerous . MR. MCANDREW : Right. Thank you. And then in addition to that, so a couple weeks ago I asked about the expired towing contract that was -- that expired on October 31st. I know there was a meeting . Do we know what happened at that meeting , Mr. Voldenberg ? Did they answer my question or provide any feedback ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did receive a status that they're reviewing it and we should have found out by today's date, but we haven't. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. MR. KING: I spoke to the Mayor earlier today. I didn't get a lot on it. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 it sounds like they're going to make some changes to however they put that contract out for people to apply. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Well, I'm looking forward to getting that information . And then last week we talked about leaf pickup, right, and it was confirmed , okay, look at your little card that you have on your refrigerator . They pick them up during cardboard . Well, I got a couple calls this week and, guess what, they weren't. So retired -- one was a retired woman. And, you know, she waited all day. And it's the holiday coming up so she ended up shovelling her own leaves, putting them in bags and she had to bring them to DPW. That's unfortunate , you know, she pays her garbage fee. So we need like I said last week, they got to post it somehow . We know it's on that card. But it's not being consistent . I need -- please, if you would reach out to the DPW Director and ask what's going on. I mean, and this is multiple people. So if there's a schedule , are they going to follow? If they're going to adapt it they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 have to let these people know because you know how leaves are. They become wet. They become slippery . All right? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll clarify that. MR. MCANDREW : Once the snow comes it's brutal. All right. And also, I got another complaint over at Weston Field at the pool. So the schedule has been okay for a while. But there's one of the ladies or lifeguard s or whoever is there under Mr. Gassenmeyer is opening windows and keeping the door open. It's in the 30s now. You know, it took a while to get the part for the heater fixed and they are grateful for that because they have a warm pool. But when they get out and it's freezing for whatever reason and they complain ed to this lady who's over there, I'm not sure what her capacity is but she has a fan on, windows open, door open. That doesn't sound right. So send that over to the Parks Director too, please. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have some responses for Fifth Order. We got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 a complaint about a damaged dead end and watch children sign pole at the intersection of Return Avenue and Bundy Street. DPW and Scranton 311 were notified and will place that on the work list to reinstall that sign pole. There was a request -- request to paint turning lanes, road markings at East Elm Street and South Washington Avenue. That was submitted to DPW roads for their review and handling . Crosswalk marking s on Green Ridge Street at Wyoming Avenue and North Washington Avenue, DPW Director advised the crosswalk at Green Ridge Street and Penn Avenue were placed on Thursday , November 16th and Wyoming and North Washington will be updated as temperatures above 45 degrees and weather permit to be able to take care of those line markings . MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, and I forgot to bring up and that was another issue. We know it's weather pending but this resident asked me -- actually Mrs. Augustini asked me could she get a copy of the list. Is there a list for spring? Where are they on the list? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 So if we can -- MR. KING: The crosswalk list? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, if there is a list. Thank you. I'm sorry for interrupting . MR. KING: All right. Sure, no problem . We receive d a request regarding roofing work being done without proper permits at 1617 Jackson Street. LIPS confirmed proper permit was issued to the contractor on 11/20/23, referred all police related claims by the neighbor to the Scranton Police Department . Barrel barriers at Biden Interchange entrance to Interstate 81 South, PennDOT confirm ed that the contractor Penn Line is awaiting supplies to replace the barrel barrier s at the Biden Express way entrance to Interstate 81 South. PennDOT confirmed the barrier s will be replaced and will keep our Council informed regarding the date of completion . Construction signs on East Mountain Road, DPW supervisor and director reviewed and advised that the road signs are being used related to construction work being done at Florida Avenue by O'Hara Construction . They are not city owned and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 cannot be removed . The City of Scranton audit, Matt Domines ' City Finance Director advised the opinion was received from the solicitor . And CLA auditor for the city will advise the BA's Office for timeline on final review. And also, you know, I know it was mentioned two years people are going to get reelected or up for election . I said this before. I'll say it again. I could care less about getting reelected. That's not a concern of mine. It never will be. I'm here to do what I feel is in the best interest to move the city forward and I will vote what I think is in the best interest of the city regardless of getting reelected or not. That is not a concern of mine. It never will be. I don't care if the election was next week. I'm going to vote what I think is in the best interest of the city. And guess what, we all -- every one of us each has our own votes. You know, we differ sometimes . That happens . A lot of us vote the same way a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 lot of times. But at the end of the day I think we all have the best interest of the city at heart and we try to do the very best we can and I'll always vote for what I think is in the best interest of the city regardless of an election coming up or not. That's not a concern of mine. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR SERGEANT SCOTT J. GASSENMEYER IN HIS CAPACITY AS PARKS AND RECREATION DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 SCRANTON . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-L be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SMURL: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I can't even go any further . First of all, this is the Administrative Code. This states that anybody who is to receive a waiver needs advice and consent before the hire. This person was hired six months ago, right, and promised on his word that he would move into the city and he would get his lifeguard certification . That's why I voted yes for him. I took him on his word. This is nothing personal . This is nothing -- like I said earlier , if they want to change it I would be okay. But it's not fair to everybody else who works in this building every day. It's not fair to everybody else that has to work under him. What type of message is he sending? Leaders lead by example .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 The employees that work for him, what type of morale is that in the building for him, right? We're making an investment in him. He should make a investment in our city. I can't stress the fact that, first of all, he shouldn 't be employed right now, right? The other part of this says after 60 days -- I'm sorry, six months you don't move into the city, you're terminated . And guess what? There's no one who's ever been allowed to stay after -- there's never been a waiver for someone after six months. They've left. They either moved into the city or left. This is precedent setting guys. And this is -- guess what, our responsibility every one of them as a Councilman I take it seriously . This is my responsibility to follow this. I can't -- I can't stress the fact. And you know what, his performance is a performance . He seems like a nice guy. I'm sure he's doing a great job. This is nothing personal. All right, but personally it is our responsibility and I take mine serious ly, my role here as Councilman is to follow the code. Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I don't recall there being a promise made. When I look there back and there's an e-mail from Mr. Voldenberg that says that Mr. Gassenmeyer was looking for a place within Scranton . MR. MCANDREW : He was suppose d to get certified . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay, that's not on this point. It's on moving into the city. MR. MCANDREW : Promises aren't the point. This is the point, the Administrative Code. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm just saying we were led to believe that he was going to. However , he didn't. And I believe that we can ask for, you know, if there's a reason as to why he didn't. Maybe it was that he wasn't able to find a house or for whatever circumstances , I don't know. But at any rate, I don't feel like we're in a position to begin looking for a new Parks and Rec Director again and have that turnover when we have so many integral project s to the city and to our parks. And I think that it will be detrimental to the city to do that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 MR. SCHUSTER : So I'll just state this again. City Code is City Code. There's a reason that we have City Code. It was mention ed in public comment tonight if this body would like to change that code we can. When it applies to this, I would not be in favor of changing it. But if other individuals here do, have at it, please. It was also discussed in public comment tonight the frustration , something that happens here is that we ask for information and it's not given to us. I think some of the public's frustration tonight is Council asks for things, we don't get the answers to them and the administration thinks we're going to forget about them. And when they raise their ugly head again, Council then address es it again but it's ignored. And this administration ignores this body a lot of times. This here is another reason why this -- I think this body is being treated as a joke from this administration . We don't have the power that we should have. And when something fails, it gets brought up again and it gets reintroduced. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 I think this is part of a major problem that -- I mean, it's continuing problem and it's going to get bigger and bigger. MR. KING: Anyone else on the question ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Regardless of how you vote whether it passes or fails, the legislation as it reads now is incorrect . I believe Mr. McAndrew pointed out before maybe some other Council members , but there is some factual inaccuracies in the legislation that need to be corrected before it's finally passed if it passes.
