MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community . Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MR. MCANDREW : I would like to make a motion to take from the table File of the Council No. 14 of 2024. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: We have a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table File of the Council No. 14, 2024. This ordinance converts the 600 block of Deacon Street from a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 one-way street to a two-way street from 625/628 Deacon Street to the intersection where Sanderson Avenue is being taken from the table and placed in Seventh Order for a final vote. On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. CORRESPONDENCE DATED APRIL 24, 2024, FROM OCD/ARPA DIRECTOR , REGARDING AN AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) UPDATE. 3.B. CORRESPONDENCE DATED APRIL 30, 2024, FROM BA/ARPA DIRECTOR , REGARDING ARPA DEPARTMENTAL BUDGET TRANSFERS . MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I had a few comments on Third Order Items. 3-B, when it comes to the department budget transfers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 regarding ARPA, a couple things stuck out. So we had a Pittston Avenue Streetscape and that Pittston Avenue Streetscape is being split. And the funds are being transfer red to two other project s, one being Cedar Avenue. Could we ask the administration , Mr. Voldenberg , what's occurring here with this transfer ? Has the city found an alternative way to, you know, do this project or are we abandoning the project altogether ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And the next one was the transfer for Keyser Valley flood funds. They're transferring about 49,000 I think 700 dollars from Keyser Valley flood funding to City Hall improvements. So if we could just get an explanation of why we're switching these flood funds over the City Hall improvements , that would be great. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. That's all. MR. MCANDREW : I also raised an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 eyebrow to the transfer from the Keyser Valley hazard mitigation over to City Hall repairs . I would like a rational e for myself too, please. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? Okay, I just want to mention before we get started about the situation we had with files being left in the outside rear of the building I believe last Wednesday or the week before. I spoke with the administration . They are quite aware of the situation . And they are going to have a third-party investigation done on this instead of having something internal . But for right now a few changes have been made for right now. So from now on, documents have to be shredded in your own offices . Any office that doesn't have a shredder will have one. And then all of the shredded material will be taken by Paul to the Recycling Center. That is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN S PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First -- MR. KING: Excuse me, we have some Third Order items from Council I don't think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 you asked us. MR. MCANDREW : Announcements . MR. KING: We didn't get an opportunity to do our announcements . MR. SMURL: Oh, I'm sorry. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I do. So I just want to congratulate the organizers of The Office 5-K that went on this past weekend . That is the group Valley in Motion. Gus Fahey I know was the main organizer of that event. And they attracted 1,500 runners and a lot of them were from out of town. So it was a huge success . I remember the first year he did that. There were literally maybe 100, 150 runners. So it's been growing substantially and now to the point where it's started to draw people into town from afar away. So I want to congratulate them. It's a great thing for our city. Also, I know that I had announced the Oakmont Park ribbon cutting . I think I said it was going to be May 10th originally . It's been moved to Thursday , May 16th at 3 p.m. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 at Oakmont Park. And that's the new park that's been completed up on the East Mountain on the -- I guess it would be the northerly side of Route 307. They did a great job on that. So other than that, I know -- well, I'll do the rest in Fifth Order. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple announcements . First of all, I probably wouldn't be able to go home tonight if I didn't wish everybody a happy Mother's Day to all the moms out there. And, you know, hang in there, guys, Father's Day is right around the corner. And I also probably couldn't go to work tomorrow if I didn't wish everybody a happy Teachers Appreciation Day to all the teachers out there who impact lives and make a difference every day, especially my colleagues at the Career Technology Center of Lackawanna County. They are truly some of the best. Also I was asked to announce two events coming up at the Ukrainian Club on 237 Railroad Avenue in Scranton . Saturday , May 11th there will be entertainment by Jack Bordo, Jim Cullen, and Sharon Ambrosia from 7 to 10. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 And then on the May 18th, live side piece called the Bad Girlfriend Duo and also like I stated earlier , these will both be at the Ukrainian Club on Railroad Avenue. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I just wanted to mention that the Greenhouse up at Nay Aug Park this time of year has their plant sale going on. So I believe their hours are Friday, Saturday , Sunday 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., and then Thursdays 3 to 6 p.m., and also 9 to 1. So, you know, it's a great local place to be able to go and get some plants for the season and they've got hanging baskets . They have a lot in stock. I just encourage people to take a look and everything goes to the Greenhouse Project . That's all. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I'd like to mention the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 passing of Charles Miller. He passed away on Sunday. His obituary was in the paper today. If I recall correctly he was a retired firefighter . He was 94 years old. The union contracts , have we had any movement on that? MR. SMURL: A little. MS. HODOWANITZ : Inch by inch, paragraph by paragraph . MR. SMURL: We're getting close, Joan. We're getting really close. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, I put in a right to know to get copies and the 30-day extension of that request will end on May 15th. So we'll see what kind of explanation they pass onto me. However , I have heard something about the pocket park on the corner of Linden and Wyoming . A little birdie told me that the grand opening is set for June 7th. I think that is the first Friday of June. They're going to have a DJ and all kinds of activities . And they'll be adding benches and other (inaudible ) so it will really look like a park. The article that was in the local paper about the resolution of the Samters light 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 debacle , I just found that so utterly amusing . The city retracted the issue of the violation of the ordinance . But they didn't come anywhere close to saying we screwed up. We apologize . Next time we'll do better, which is what I'd like to see. I live in the Samters. And I'm telling you, all you need to do is close your blinds. And it solves that problem because I have headlights shining in my apartment at night. And if I don't close my blinds, it's like daylight . You close your blinds, no problem , which brings me to the next topic. I'm still hot under the collar over the way Tom Coyne was treated last week. And I think the city owes him a public written apology . They were very quick to put in writing on a demand letter which they had hand delivered , you know, accusing him of some kind of misconduct , okay (inaudible ) will account for his actions . And turn in all photograph s and e-mails and the names of the people whom you shared those pictures . I'm one. I'm ready to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 turn myself in to have my brain washed. Anytime they want to know where I am, I'm at Samters. But I still am bothered about that. What the city needs is more people like Tom Coyne, intelligent , articulate . He does his homework . He knows how to research . His bearing up at the podium is always professional . And, you know, to -- basically they spit in his face. I would say they kicked him somewhere else, but I'm a lady and I won't say that, but a public apology and a written apology is in order. And I hope the administration has enough common sense to do that. Everybody makes a mistake , including the administration . The question is how do you correct the mistake after you realize you made one. And if they just pretend that nothing ever happened, we're all cool here, shame on them. That's not the way of leadership . And I'll tell you another thing, I don't care who put the trash out, who put the bag out, who made the mistake . The buck stops on the Mayor's desk. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 And it's up to her to write right this wrong. And I'll be counting the days until she does it or until we have a new mayor. And you mentioned during the caucus about the parks and putting signs up that the parks close at dusk. Okay, I'd like to have you consider something . Maybe there should be some kind of ordinance in addition to signs and that anyone caught there after dusk should be fined. And if it's kids, sock it to their parents , you know. You need to get a handle on this kind of conduct or it will continue all the time. It's bad enough that there are no gates at the Nay Aug Park and people are going in that gorge especially as the weather is going to start getting hot. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here today is that, you know, I don't know how much room is at the District Justice 's office for people to come in and watch this hearing that's going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 to be the beginning of this aspect of litigation . But it's on Tuesday , May 14th at 11:45 at 130 North Washington Avenue at District Justice Farrell 's office. And I think that every Scranton resident that could come there should come. It's a status hearing , so it's the beginning . But I think that sooner or later the resident s of this city have to understand that they have to stand up for themselves because we don't have a Council that could do that job. And we definitely don't have a mayor that's capable . We've elected a lot of failed leadership in this city over an extended period of time and it's really hurt us. I have to say that I'm happy that most of my children left this city. I only have two more left. I'm trying to get another one of my children to leave here. I just really hope that people would understand that what you see every week at this Council meeting is not leadership . And what you see from this Mayor is not leadership . Leadership is much different . Okay, these are people that are supposed to be representing us, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 but they don't. And what's it's been is a trajectory of failure over almost my 40 years here. Like we're talking about documents in a dumpster , that's not the first time that's happened . That's happened a couple of times already . Okay, there's a host of issues that come here all the time. A very large amount of the damage that's been done to this city has been done by appointment s of Council members when one leaves and the neighborhood groups who patronize certain people who come to them and say that they intend to do this, that, or the other thing to benefit the city. I think it's time for the residents to ask where are all the Council members who were elected in this city over the last 40 years? Where do they live now? I think that's a very important question that everybody should ask. And I think another question that should be asked is, with all the federal funds flying all over the place, how come the city is in such a desperate situation , deterioration everywhere , population decline . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 You know, it's time to really ask these questions and our elected leaders can't answer these questions . But, you know, me, I'm ready to litigate over ECTV and the Mayor and the Council and the removal of the public access channel politically . I'm going to litigate with Licensing and Inspections . And I don't think the District Justice Farrell likes my subpoena list. And I'm prepare d to defend it. And I'm just a truck driver. So I don't want anybody to think that I'm some well-versed litigation attorney . But I do think that the residents of this city need to stand up for themselves once and start cleaning house. You know, you look at the renovations taking place to this building today, they could have bought the former Stoehr and Fister building for 1.6 million dollars . It was office space, multiple floors ready to go. You just -- you just -- you look at all the failure of this city government and over a lack of, I don't know, concern by the Council members because they have a right to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 investigation s but they don't. We talked about just utterly silly things. Like, it's not legal to be in Nay Aug Park after dark. Okay, there's a lot of things that we could be doing for this city but we're not doing it because we're all playing politics . We've elected a mayor who failed at the Scranton School District and then became mayor here. And it's just happened just so many times that it's just a tragedy that we have people that don't understand that collective stupidity is killing us. Just look at the person in the White House and you'll figure it out. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident and homeowner . Now, first off, I want to double down on what Joan said. I couldn't say it any better. Tom deserves a big apology . He could have just walked by those boxes and not have done anything . And maybe people's information could have been released all over the city. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 again, as I agree with Joan Tom is owed a big apology . But I know he'll never get it from this administration . So I wouldn't hold my breath. Okay, next thing, last week a speaker came up here and complained that Joe Biden signs should be taken down because he's opening up our borders. Well, the fact is President Biden several months ago sent a bill to Congress that was bipartisan passed by the Senate and Donald Trump told his sheep of the Congress not to vote for it because he's afraid it would have hurt him in the election . And they listened to Trump. So the President did try to secure our borders but Trump was against it. Next thing, the railroad bridge on Main Avenue I keep talking about, I know a while back I think Frank said that a letter was sent to the railroad about putting on the side of the bridge the height and everything . Have we heard anything else about that? MR. VOLDENBERG : We haven't had a response . MR. KING: What's that? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. VOLDENBERG : We haven't had a response . MR. KING: See if you could check on it, please. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll follow up on that and our suggestion . MR. SPINDLER : All right. Thank you. Next thing, last week when I was here I talked about these letters I got from Berkheimer and I went on and on. I'm glad to say that the next day my accountant 's office called me and they spoke to Berkheimer . And they said they're going to take me off their records . But that doesn't discount the harassment to myself and many, many other people went through in this city. There's people that got rental registration letters that don't have a rental property . And Council man Schuster is one of them. So we have a company working for us that doesn't even know what the heck they're doing. And I think you people should go back and revisit that legislation you passed and rewrite it the way it was before because there were no problems with the old legislation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 People weren't getting letters harassing them. So I know you people won't do it because you listen to what the Mayor does. But you should revisit that legislation and do it over and help the citizens of this city. Thank you. That's all I have this week. MR. SMURL: Mr. Spindler , the legislation that you said that we passed, the original one -- the ordinance that was -- it was from Council number 36 of 2022. That was the original one that was done from -- updating it to the city's rental registration code. You said that three Council people had signed that, three approved it -- the original one. And you said that the three people up here had to get lawyers . So I did research it because I didn't think I was here. But I wasn't here. So the first one was passed without me being here. I have that for you. And then the second one, the updated one, that you believe that only three people passed, that is incorrect also. There were five affirmative votes on that updated one. And that was done in Council number 82 of 2023. I have that for you too if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 you need it. Next Roger Leonard . MR. LEONARD : Good evening , Council . My name is Roger Leonard . I'm a 23-year employee in the Department of Public Works. I'm the President of IAMAW Local Lodge 2305. I'm here today to share with you my concerns over actions currently being taken by certain individual s in our city government that could undermine important work being done to support economic development and result in a loss of good union jobs to help provide a living wage in our community . Last year I was approached by city management about the creation of a new blight remediation groundskeeper classification within the Department of Public Works. This new position would have been responsible for responding to and abating instances of blight within the city, including removal of debris from vacant lots and maintenance of vacant properties . I was initially enthusiastic about these new positions because this is a much needed service in our community and because DPW already had the skills and the equipment to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 perform this work. In fact, we had already been doing some of it for years. But I had some concerns about the types of work the city wanted this position to perform which include d our traditional DPW work and the condition s of employment they wanted to set which include d an extreme degree of discretion and when this work would be done. The city has wanted to move the DPW away from predictable scheduling for years. And it looked like they were trying to use this new position to get a foothold in our department . And so on behalf of our union I pushed back. I told the city that we wanted to do this work. But they would have to use the same scheduling that they use with the rest of the DPW workers and that this job would have to be focused on the work the city claimed it was meant to do. When I raised these concerns instead of working with me, the city took the blight remediation position s away from the DPW. It's currently attempt ing to place these position s in another department under a union that primarily consists of clerical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 employees . I have great respect for the work that those city employee s do. But it's very different from the type of work that is done by DPW. Some of it is we operate heavy equipment , pick up garbage , cut trees, maintain roads, sewer, infrastructure and work nonstop during snow emergencies for as long as it takes to keep our city safe. Clerical communicates with the public and maintains records . Again, no disrespect is meant. But being able to type 60 words per minute has nothing to do with the work of cleaning up blighted space in this city. I am concerned that by placing these positions outside of DPW, the city is setting them up to fail. It would be unfortunate to say the least for the city to wind up subcontracting this work out, eliminating union jobs that could provide a living wage in this city and prevent blight from happening in the first place. I am, therefore , asking the City Council to investigate the situation and to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 take appropriate action to ensure that blight remediation is housed within a department that has the capacity to successfully do the work and that the work continue to be performed by union represented workers of the Scranton DPW. I will be back next week to respond to any comments or grievances that you may have. Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Rik Little. MR. LITTLE: Hi. I'm Rik Little, Scranton . I'd like to talk about is it possible to get removal of the Biden sign on the ballot? What can you tell me of the procedures to do to this legisla tive body to put it on the ballot in November to take down the Biden signs so that people -- because the people had no input. And when it went up and we were told, hey, it went up for free. DPW put it up. I watched them put it up. So it seems to me they could take it down for free. I think it's very, very important because all progress starts with ideas. You have to have an idea before anything gets done. And I think people got a better idea 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 of who Joe Biden is after Covid and everything . I've been following Biden all my life. And the biggest thing was being in the family court system in New York State. New York State was the first state to really kick in in 1989 with the Title 4D and the federally enforced laws like VAWA. And VAWA is really why I don't have a family I don't -- because as soon as I got to the family court, you know, they start arresting me for talking onto my -- because part of VAWA is the harassment statute , which I did manage to turn around in New York State. It hasn't been turned around here. They included things in that statute it's -- for one thing it's called the Violence Against Women Act. But there's more violence among women partner s than men. It's a completely -- it doesn't make sense, just the title is unconstitutional . But this Violence Against Women Act, everything we see here, all of this feminist stuff that has come up since 1966 suppose dly Joe Biden wrote VAWA with the National Organization for Women. And if you know who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Andrea Dworkin is, I mean, she just hates men. She's the muse for this legislation . And it was done in about 1989. And it doesn't matter what party because it was developed under Bush and it was first passed in, like, I believe in 1994 by the Clintons . But this is a family destroying litigation . And Joe Biden has his name on it. I really doubt he actually wrote it. But he's been the go-to-guy for legislation all his life. And everything about him is -- turned out to be false. So what are people suppose d to see when they're walking down Spruce Street and they look up and see this Biden sign, this brown Biden sign. And the only reason it's there is because the powers that be are trying to, you know, impress the Feds so they get more federal funding , like -- and they keep getting it too. I mean, I read in the paper today that NEPA Housing Authority benefit for more than 17 million in federal funding . But it also says that they never know how this money is spent. And this -- and Scranton Housing Authority is a 5013C. Just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 the nature of that as a legal entity should be audited. We should know where -- who's living in there, who's working there, who's being evicted and who's being brought in there because I promise you that hundreds of people -- this is a sanctuary city. That's what it is. They're bringing people in. And they are housing these people, especially -- and they're giving them jobs -- Matt Cartwright's office. And they are removing people that -- like me that are much more qualified to live there. And the people that run it -- my time's up. But I need to know how to get it on the ballot for -- to remove the Biden sign because I'm sure -- it depresses me and I'm sure it depresses a lot of people. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Little. Anthony Marquise . I'm sorry? Thank you. MR. LITTLE: I know. But can you tell me? MR. SMURL: Without -- no, I can't help with you that. I'm sorry. You have to go to Voter Registration at the Lackawanna Courthouse and ask them.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. LITTLE: County, okay. MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. MARQUISE : So, yeah, I just want to start off by saying hello, Jessica , hello, Gerald, that's your name? MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. MARQUISE : How you doing? I saw you guys the other night. And I also want to say, like, I didn't come here to attack anyone, you know what I'm saying? At the end of the day, they need our help from the community . They need our solutions . They need our ideas to help them lead in a better manner. So I'm not going to come up here and attack you guys. I know you guys possibly do your best. It's a shame that we don't have any belief in our government or our system. We have people who want to tear down the President 's -- the President 's, what, his sign or something like that? You want to tear down a president 's sign. This is his city. He was born in this city, you know what I'm saying? Maybe Biden needs one of us to go up there and speak to him so he would become a better president . So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 didn't come up here to attack anyone within our government or our city system or anything like that. But what I do want to say is, last week we had a bunch of people speaking on -- what did they say we have a bunch of gang violence out here or something like that. And we also have a bunch of citizens who do not respect the police. So I came up with a solution for that. My solution is we have a -- we hold a community event, you know what I'm saying, maybe like some free food, music, you know what I'm saying, activities , games for the kids and stuff like that. And as you guys already know, like, I'm an artist. I'm a speaker . I do all types of things. So I could possibly play a role in that. I could sing. I could dance. I could do whatever , you know what I'm saying? And you could check me out on YouTube just to get familiar with what I do because I know sometimes I get up here and I just go, you know what I'm saying, I'm talking fast and it seems like I'm rambling . But you can check me out on YouTube and you could check out, you know, how what I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 do, you know what I'm saying? So you could check that out. And I just wanted to come and bring that solution to the table. And I want to say thank you for your time and God bless. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all that's on the sign-in list. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Members of City Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . I wasn't going to address last week at all. But since it was brought up at the beginning of this session as a note, I do want to at least touch upon that it shouldn 't be more shredders in City Hall. The shredder that they use here is a single line shredder which has been outdated for probably 15 or 20 years because everyone in the industry is going to a minimum a crosscut shredder , not a single straight line shredder . Secondary to that, even my mother's apartment building the condo that she lives in in Philadelphia has a shred box. They are supplied by Iron Mountain or another agency. You just throw the papers in there unshredded and they're picked up by a certified registered company who sends you certificates they have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 been destroyed on record. It should not be that the city is shredding documents and then having a city employee transporting those documents who is obviously not HR to another location to dispose of them in transit . You get a shred box downstairs or central ly in the office. That's where all the shredding paperwork goes to. It's taken out by a third party company that's insured and it's done with. That's the reasonable way to deal with it. And I was in charge of setting up policies for PHI, for patient health information . I set up Sarbanes -Oxley rules. I set up rules for HIPAA compliance because I was in that industry . I was neck deep in patient information . When records got pulled out, you went to the record office. There was a logbook. You signed in the logbook that you took it out and why you were taking it out and you had to be part of the authoriz ed group to remove it. When it was returned , it was logged back in. When it went from the offices to storage at Iron Mountain , it was logged in that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 book itself. All of those records , the entire history was physically logged. I understand that employee records aren't patient confidential information . But the policy and procedures are the same. And I think it needs to be looked at more of having an independent company actually pick up, shred them, and transport them and the city having an insured company verify that they have been done correctly . And I expect that the trash person taking them out as it was in the newspaper was going to be blamed. Oh, it was they grabbed a box that they shouldn 't have. I'm sorry, but HR should never have a box out there to be grabbed . It never should have been out of the control of the person who pulled those files. If they were going somewhere , they should have been secured and locked up. They should not have been around for cleaning people to pick up and remove them. That's all that I have to say on that issue for this week. For last week's vote that I did not get a chance to talk about that rocked through here, the university property , I looked at that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 because the property itself was set up in there to become a park. When it got tore down it was to become a parking lots. As far as I know by the new code, new parking lots aren't allowed in Center City. As a matter of fact, we had a variance for a parking lot that the Mayor's office is suing the Zoning Board because they authorized a parking lot when parking lots aren't suppose d to be allowed in Center City. I also have a concern with just because they don't repair it -- want to repair it is a reason to tear down a historic building . That does that mean that anyone in the City of Scranton now could buy a historic building and they could say I own this property but I don't want to fix it. I don't care that it's historic . I want to tear it down. Is that how we're going to deal with historic buildings ? And when you take ownership of a historic building instead of saying fix it or transfer it to someone else, you bought it that way. You own it. You can't take it down. Instead , now do they have the right to just rip down anything that's out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 there because they don't want to fix it? I understand it's the University . Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta . Last week you voted on an emergency demolition for the property located at 301 Moir Court, University of Scranton property . The hurry-up vote was needed for an emergency demolition to meet the 45-day deadline . Supposedly the building was in a very dangerous and precarious condition . One would have you believe that this was ready to collapse as are the many blighted building s that are destroying our neighborhood and lowering our property value in the city. Did anyone personally tour the building or receive a structure report from a certified third party on this building ? I'm sure nobody from City Council is certified in structural building inspections , correct ? I don't know what's more troubling , the fact you voted so quick to tear down what looks to be from an up close visual inspection 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 a perfectly solid building with every aspect intact or the fact that Council was made aware and given this information to vote on the 44th day of the 45th day deadline. Even more troubling is the fact that Council person Rothchild didn't abstain from voting due to her affiliation with the University of Scranton . We're asking tonight that you reverse your decision and you allow an expert and the Historical Society to look further into the structure before demolishing it. Does the University really need three parking spaces that bad? Now on the issue you of the curfew that I asked for two weeks ago, is there any movement on that? We'll wait for that one. Council , I'm sure that your constituent s are burning up your phone lines regarding the condition s of the many streets that need to be paved. At least you could share with them that the Mayor's street is getting paved this week. If I may ask, the skate park at Jackson and Bromley , the building outside lights have been on 24/7 every day. Traffic lights at Main 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 and the Expressway are horrific and it's an accident waiting to happen. Can you maybe see if whoever put those lights in could address the lights? Some of the lights just go totally blank with no color whatsoever . MR. SMURL: What's the intersection ? MR. ARGENTA : It's the Expressway and North Main Avenue, both to the entrance to Keyser, to the entrance to downtown and also the exit ramps as well. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mr. Voldenberg , will you send that to traffic control ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Voldenberg , can we also get the building that he spoke about on Jackson and Bromley , it's near the skate park. Can we find out if that's a city-owned property ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 was just hoping that you could give us a further update on this -- the traffic lights that are going to be installed for 800 and some-odd thousand dollars ? I just read that tonight . If I had read it earlier , I would have looked at the backup information online. But it's not very good reception in here. So I couldn't look it up. So when we get to that resolution if someone could give us more details as to what three intersection s are going to be involved . And if those three intersection s that are going to be involved , is that a good time to put up the street signs? And I'm sure they are probably needed. So make it a, you know, a two for one deal if they could take care of that at that time. Also, I was just looking for a followup on some of the issues that I was hoping that I could reach Doris before then and her cutout that she keeps asking about on Colfax Avenue, the cutout for her. If you ever lived in our neighborhood , you see Doris out there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Doris walks more than anybody that I know in my neighborhood . She's out there morning , noon, rain, cold, whatever . I think she deserves to have that cutout so that she -- when she's walking pushing that walker of hers and has to push it up over the curb, you know, you take that for -- we take it for granted because we just step up over the curb. But if someone that has an issue, you know, that's a very serious problem for them. And she's been here several times, you know, talking about the cutout and to no avail. And also the flooding that we have at the corner of Colfax and Olive Street, I did take a picture of it yesterday or whatever day we had the storms. And the water is just, you know, if you walk through it, it's going up over your shoes. And I'm not sure, you know, I thought -- I know it was brought up before and someone was suppose d to come out and clean it out with one of those digger things. And I don't think that ever happened because it's still flooded up there. MR. SCHUSTER : I feel like the drain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 that you're talking about on Colfax is a water company . I think that's in their jurisdiction . MS. JEFFRIES : So does that -- does that mean you have to go to them with our concern ? MR. SMURL: I believe we did, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : It's been brought to their attention . But I'll follow up and make sure -- MR. SMURL: -- again tomorrow . I believe there's two of them tied together , that one and the block afterwards. They all flood at the same time. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MR. SMURL: Okay. MS. JEFFRIES : Because I'm not sure they have a public comment section . If they did, I wouldn't mind going there. And I don't have a concern with talking with anyone that's going to be for our betterment. And then the final thing that I have to say is that I would be remiss if I did not stand here at this podium and voice my concern over the treatment of Mr. Coyne and his slap on the hand is what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 it looked like to me from the paper, you know, from what I read. And it just reminded me that in the old days when the neighbors saw someone doing something wrong and they came to the parents and they told the parents about that issue that their child might have been doing wrong and the parent were very appreciative that the neighbor came to them to tell them what their child had been doing. And they took the appropriate action to correct that child. But in this case, you know, it would have been like the parent turning on the neighbor and saying, you know, and berating that neighbor for advising them about a concern of their child. So that's what I was thinking about as I read it. I thought , you know, he does deserve more than what he -- Mr. Coyne deserves more than what the administration -- how they treated him. I thought it was very unfair. I thought it was not appreciative . And it was something that was benefitting us all because I thought like all of you Council members , once a year we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 to -- anyone that's on a board has to fill a paper out and that paper has to be sent back in. It's our financial statement , something like that paper. My paper could have been in there since I'm on a board in this city. My paper could have been in there with my name, address , telephone number and everything else on there. So I was doubly concerned after I started to think about it and the way that he was treated . So I just had to voice my concern about Mr. Coyne's treatment . MR. SMURL: Norma, what was the intersection -- the intersection that -- MS. JEFFRIES : Colfax and Olive Street. MR. SMURL: Colfax and Olive. Mr. Voldenberg , in 5-D we are expanding something (inaudible ) and stuff on the Cedar Avenue. And we're authorizing -- well, we're going to look at authorizing the engineer to look at it. Will you ask the city if they could add that intersection into that study or into the engineer to look at it? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. And I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 also follow up with -- MR. SMURL: It's been a few years since we've tried to get -- MR. KING: Doris has been asking for that since I've been on Council . It needs to be addressed . MR. SMURL: So maybe they could address that as long as they're doing a study on intersection s. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Like my shirt? A word from our sponsor available at Tuck's down on Penn Avenue past the former Times building . Okay, I'm not going to mention any more about cousin Tom. But years ago, it's probably like 2008, 2009, there was a renovation done on City Hall. And there was a dumpster back there. And was just chock-full of people that probably went back to the 40s, work records and Social Security numbers and you name it. And it was just tossed there in a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 dumpster . And, you know, there was a little bit of a hoopla about it but not much. And, okay, I want to remind you again, there's hearings on the landfill . And I found out that they are shipping the leachate out in trucks to special facilities . So I don't even know if a sewer plant would have the ability with all the things that people throw into trash and eventually throw down into the soup. So something has to be done other than to dump it into Nay Aug gorge. Not acceptable . I don't care about their perverse osmosis . I'm watching out for my gas bill. Once again, apparently that was snuck in under the fence. And I'm expecting that that summer gas bill is going to be 250 percent above what the gas I'm using. So I'll keep an eye on that and keep you posted. Something needs to be done with these utility companies . As we seen, we got nowhere here with the water company probably and it's getting worse and worse. The Stoehr and Fister building was mention ed. Well, that Globe Store was purchased off the county originally . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 During the day I didn't have a car and I would ride the bus. And I got to know a lot of people. Some of them were older part timers. And there was a medical building outfit there. And the Chamber of Commerce sold that building because they emptied it out and moved that company which was Diversified . They changed the name again somewhere . And they changed it and built a tax exempt up on the mountain there at the Montage . And, of course, a good time was had by all except for us because . We lost a quarter of a million dollars a year in taxes. And a lot of those people were just let go because they didn't -- they didn't even have cars. They were just retirees that rode to town and could do the job. Okay, a little thing on some of these fancy laws that are coming out compliment s of the Heritage Foundation , a 501C3 which gets donated into the billions of dollars annually. On birth control or pregnancy care, in Texas women are told to sit in their hot cars with the windows up to mimic sepsis during 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 a miscarriage . In Iowa, torn clothes , facial bruises , lacerations , verified molestation , no morning after pill thanks to the thumpers, 501C3s. They can't be left to run things forever . It's a national problem . Have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council , this weather is absolute ly killing me and my dog too I'll tell you. MR. SMURL: Will you state your name for the record, please? MR. ELLMAN: I never heard of a dog, his eyes are just as red as mine. MR. SMURL: I'm sorry, would you just state your name for the record? MR. ELLMAN: It's a little French bulldog. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: All right, Council , I realize I've been a sword in Council 's side for many, many years. But I, for one, consider Council the absolute most important voice citizens have. That's after all my fighting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 and so on you still -- I still believe that. But apparently the Times doesn't have any interest in Council , the people of this city, or what is said and accomplished here by people like myself and all of these people out here taking time to come down and suggest , complain , whatever . You know, when you give an hour or so in here it's gone. You can't make it up. And nobody seems to appreciate it in this news media. But Dominick Sudotti {phonetic } he writes one of his racist anti-Israel, anti-Jewish letters , they're in the paper and here comes Chris Kelly with all of -- Chris Kelly supporting is a Sudotti is a disgrace to the paper and a disgrace to the people of this city. And I can't understand -- I can't comprehend why Attorney Faulk{phonetic } would even acknowledge knowing him. When this community or any community is fortunate enough to have a presidential visit -- in our case this gentleman , he should have been just regarded with the utmost respect . It doesn't matter what our political 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 affiliations are, beliefs are. But when his visit was here, Mr. Biden's visit was here, 80 people inappropriate behavior following him around town demonstrating just shows what a bunch of demented simpletons they are to me. And the Mayor when President Biden was here, showing her back to him shows what a disgrace in politics she turned out to be for any party. And that's enough, I guess. But what has happened with this $300,000 low income house, you know, everybody is avoiding the issue. Is it rented? Is it sold? I'd like to know what happened . I've had some people make comments nobody -- there hasn't been anything in the paper. MR. SMURL: Ron, is that the one that was up in the Hill Section up behind -- MR. ELLMAN: It seems to me it's going to end up like another con job like the walkability failure is. I don't know. But I don't have a computer . When my son died I have his computer but I just don't have any interest in computers . I think -- MR. SMURL: Ron, that house that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 you're talking about, I believe the total price on that was $420,000. It was suppose d to be a double house. But it was changed to a single house. And it was rented out. It was leased out to people. It was actually leased out before they had the opening. MR. ELLMAN: What kind of low income person -- family. MR. SMURL: I believe it's 30 percent of your income. MR. ELLMAN: But that's who it was made for. That's what people donated money. That's what this city donated money. It was a total waste and con job to me to have a $300,000 and say this is a low income house. I thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Ron. Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , City Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Let's talk first and foremost about Mr. Coyne. I'm the last one, Tom. All right. I walked out that Wednesday evening . I also witness ed these boxes, right. I have experience in debt collection and mortgage origination . I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 firsthand the importance of private material , private and privileged under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I also know that if the City of Scranton does not correct this issue to prevent any breach in a timely manner, you know, unions can get involved . I heard the clerical union -- the head of the clerical union here in the City of Scranton provided a letter simply because they are very concerned . And they have every right to do so. You know, these boxes were out in public. And, you know, at this point if they don't get any answers , they could go to the Consumer Protection Bureau, Consumer Protection Bureau, the CFPB. All right, it's set up through the federal government . They would look into it immediately . They will come to a quick resolution and make sure that everything is fair and accurate . Second thing I want to talk about this evening is the canines . I spoke with the Police Chief along with the breeder Shadow Romano and the trainer Ed Adams. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 The main concern with the police chief and our wonderful amazing canine department which we also met with, I left there very educated knowing a lot more than I knew before. And I could tell you firsthand, they are very intelligent people that are working hard on our behalf. The main concern with the police chief was the size of the canines , okay. They can't get into some smaller places. And to the police department it's not practical . So we left there under the understanding that, you know, hopefully they will maybe add some more canines in the near future. They could actually order them and have Shepherds readily available in a short period of time with these calls. And it's very important that we load up in the right areas. And let me just talk about the police chief as well. In West Scranton we met with him very recently as far as part of a crime watch. And we left there two hours later, again, very educated , very feeling proactive and wanting to make a difference . We had a lot of good people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 in that room. So I encourage anybody in any part of the city if you are looking to make a difference , don't sit on your hands and watch the national news. You know, anybody can do that. Maybe you could make a difference , you know, because the federal election is right in our face, right? But when it comes to our -- things here at home, you know, we get elected officials . You start at the very bottom with the school district . They are with our kids nine hours out of the day five days a week and make very important decisions for us. You know, here at Council , it's very important we have the people in the right positions . And that includes the Council President . You know, Mr. Smurl, we've had various and several different issues that we brought up to you over the last, what, six, eight, ten, twelve months. And in return, you're not addressing a lot of them. You know, there's a long laundry list of things like the union contracts , you know, why should we have to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 talking about them a year later? Address these issues. People look to you for support in the time of need, each and every single one of you. Each one of you live in different parts of the city. Do your part. Talk to people in your community and start a crime watch, okay. You know, we're going to be talking about this election a few months after that. We're going to be into, what, March and then the elections are shortly after that. Let's pay attention on what's going on here at home because what's going on here at home needs to change and it needs to change rather quickly . We need to do our part. Let's protect ourselves, our neighbor s and lets help the Scranton Police Department . Again, God bless the Scranton Police Department . Have a good evening . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? There's no one else. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. KING: I have a few comments . I too would like to wish everyone a happy Mother's Day this coming weekend . None of us would be here if it weren't for our mothers . And God knows they do a tremendous amount to keep us safe and take care of our children and take care of each of us. So I want to wish all the mothers have a great happy Mother's Day on Sunday. I also want to acknowledge all the teachers , Teacher Appreciation Day. I've had three children go through the Scranton School District . I'm one of eight who went through the Scranton School District . I got a tremendous education , greatly appreciative of all the great influence that the teachers have had on my life and my children 's life. All three of them have gone off to great colleges . One's graduated from Manhattan College Summa cum laude. I have another one at the University of Hartford , 4.0 in architect ure. And I've another one going to Thomas Jefferson University to study biology and play golf. The little one is running cross country and track up at Hartford. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 But they went through from kindergarten right through the Scranton School District . And they were influenced by some tremendous teacher s. And I know often times our schools get beat up. And, you know, I understand we have some difficult challenges in our school. We have some great student s and we have some great teacher s. And all of those student s are influenced by tremendous educators . So I want to thank all the teacher s, not only in the Scranton School District but throughout the state who do a great job educating our children . A few other things, in terms of streets being paved -- well, first of all, street signs I spoke to the Mayor earlier . Mack Signs is continuing to work on getting those signs completed so they could be hung throughout the city. Looking forward to getting more and more streets -- street signs replaced. I know that Norma has been after that for years. And we continue -- it's been a work in progress but we'll continue to stay on that project . But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 they're working diligently to get those signs printed and completed and hung. I was thrilled the other day, I mean, thrilled and I guess a little frustrated . Meadow Avenue is being paved. They did the first -- well, obviously they went through and grade it first. And then they put the first amount of pavement down. I know everybody gets frustrated because it causes issues trying to get to school, trying to get to work, trying to get to Gerrity 's. But if we want to get our streets paved, sometimes there's going to be some inconveniences . But I'm thrilled. They have that first coat down. And that's going to be completed . That was a really -- it's probably one of the most heavily travelled section s of Scranton between River Street and Moosic Street. And it was in bad, bad shape. So I'm thrilled that project is well on its way and the first coat is down. And it's going to be completed . Hemlock Street, the same thing in South Side from Meadow Avenue all way down I believe to Pittston Avenue. So that's key. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 And I know they're doing some curb to curb patching down on Biden Street. And a few people mentioned some other streets that are being paved throughout the city. It's never enough. But, you know, we're working hard to try to get as many streets paved as possible . Also, it was mentioned about -- earlier about the streetlights . So the streetlights are $623,200 came from the Green Light to Go grant funds. And the city matches $348,703.47. And those lights are going on Cedar and Maple, Cedar and Elm and Green Ridge Street and Wyoming Avenue. Also, it was just announced I believe it's in the Times right now. I know that all of us fought hard against the Pennsylvania American Water Company to try to reduce that rate increase that they wanted. We were are all successful , each one of you, our State Senator Marty Flynn and all of our state reps, Kyle Donahue , Kyle Mullins , Bridget Kosierowski , I know that we fought the hard fight. I know Joe Gilhooley was running the office across the street. We got somewhat of a victory, not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 exactly what we were looking for. The PUC ruling came down today for water -- the Pennsylvania American Water company sought an increase of 192.2 million dollars . They were only approved for 92,000 point 6 million . That's a 53 percent reduction from what they were looking for. I know we all wanted zero. I don't know if that was realistic , but we fought, you know, hard to not have an increase whatsoever . Now, on the waste water they sought 4.7 million increase . But they got 11.5 million , which is that I don't fully understand . You know, they claim that they need to do all of these infrastructure increases , yet their profits are through the ceiling . I find that to be extremely frustrating . It's not completely a done deal yet. But the final decision will come down on July 7th. And if this goes through what I read this evening , the new rates will go into effect August 7th. So I guess we could continue to hound the PUC with our concerns . As I said, if we did nothing -- if we did nothing , it would have been more than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 double this increase . But a lot of people fought and fought hard. So we got a 53 percent reduction in that rate increase . Now once again, not thrilled with it but somewhat of a victory because if we stood by and did nothing , it would have been a heck of a lot more. That's all I have. Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. SCHUSTER : I do have a few comments , wishing all the mothers out there a happy Mother's Day. And to follow up with Mr. King, it's good to hear with the reduction that we got. It isn't exactly what we would like but a lot of hard work went into it, State Senator Marty Flynn, our State Representatives , people here on Council . And I think it was the citizens here that come into Council Chambers that were the first ones to bring up going to the PUC to fight this increase . So although it isn't a zero increase , we got -- we gained some ground there. Mr. King also touched on the Green 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 Light Go Project . They were grants for those three stop lights. We received the grant award quite some time ago. So it's nice to see them go out to bid. It's about 600 -- it's 623,000 in grant money that we got. And we have a 300,000 match by the city to get those lights in. Last week I asked about the recycling calendar . The original calendar that went out was a six month calendar . So I got some phone calls about, you know, we're into May. And June is the last month on that calendar . So I did hear back. We got an update from Jack in IT. The monthly updates for refuse and recycling are publish ed online on the City's website in the E-news letter and on social media. In addition to those monthly publication s, they're going to be sending out a new six month calendar via the United States Postal Service. And they'll be batched in May and June for arrival in July. So we should be getting those new calendar s in July. They also noted that they received feedback on the design and with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 previous postcard . And they'll be adjusting for color blindness . So that will be addressed on the new six month calendar . That should be out in July. I had a chance this last week to get over to the North Scranton Neighborhood Association , a group of guys from West Scranton went over to speak with them and communicate with them. And one of the things that got brought up was the Providence corners. There was some damage done to the monument there. It's been something I've been wondering as to who originally got the funding for that project . But there was damage to the marble wall. I did reached out to Eileen Cipriani and she said it was turned into the insurance company and they're looking to have insurance cover that or hopeful that insurance could cover that damage to the monument in Providence square. I did get a couple calls about 317 North Sumner Avenue, so, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could reach out. 317 North Sumner Avenue there was pave cuts on some utility work. There's a large depression in the road. And I'm not sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 if it's water or gas. But if we could reach out to see who did the work on North Sumner. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Because it will need to be restored . That's all for tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. First, I also would like to wish everyone a happy Mother's Day, especially to my wife who I'm so happy that I get to have as a partner in motherhood and, you know, raising two children and figuring out our way around that with the newest one, so happy Mother's Day and also happy Teachers Appreciation Week. I know I've had some incredible teachers in my life. And I don't know where I'd be if I didn't have them. So I wanted to say that as well. And I just wanted to touch on the issue, the papers that were left out of City Hall. I don't believe that I mentioned it last week. But I wanted to say that I appreciate Mr. Coyne and him, you know, trying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 very hard to get those papers secured and think the city should have tried harder to do that themselves that that situation didn't occur. But now we've clearly identified gaps in the process in shredding . And I believe that we need to rectify them so that doesn't ever happen again. And I did appreciate the suggestion too for shredding bins like Iron Mountain . I would have assumed that's what we did because that's when I'm used to as well in healthcare . I've always had those and, you know, being utilize d by Iron Mountain and being taken there. So I would like us to take a look into the cost of that service if that's an option for the city or something that could be budgeted even. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And let's see, I had an update on 447 Clay Avenue which they were some student parties I believe being held there. So SPD and code enforcement were both notified . There was a quality of life ticket issued for that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 property . It was a paid and cleaned up for the quality of life issues. So hopefully that will be under control for now. But I'd still encourage neighbors in that area if there are loud disruptive parties to notify the police so that they could address it. And on the PUC decision , I'm certainly disappoint ed that we're still going to have a rate increase . We really were fighting for there to be none. I don't believe it's fair that our residents still get an increase on their water and sewage, especially after the increases from the previous year. But we'll keep fighting and staying on top of them and the work that they are doing within the city. Speaking of which, I brought to mind the 1600 block Myrtle Street. So Myrtle Street, you know, the entire -- many blocks of Myrtle Street up and down have been torn up and need to be paved and complet ed. And so we've been getting updates on that project . However , the one block that was completely paved and done was the 1600 block. And now there is a section of that that has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 been dug up again possibly by UGI. So I wanted to look into which utility company had done that work and when they're going to fix that because that block is heavily travelled . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find out, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. And lastly, I just want to bring up about my affiliation with the University of Scranton . I haven't been a student there for 10 years. I benefit in no way from my vote from last week. I don't receive any money from the University of Scranton . I'm not employed there. I was when I was student , I was in their catering department . But I was employed by Aramark and not by the University . And I really was just in it for the food. So not really sure why I would have abstain ed from my vote last week. But I just wanted to respond to that. And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Sure, I got a couple. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 So it's not a secret we live in a world or climate where we're advised that if we see something we say something , right? We're all prompted to do that anymore, and I'm glad. Guess what, Mr. Coyne did and got ridiculed for it. It's unacceptable . He's made out to be the bad guy. I'm glad there's an internal investigation because like I said last week, somebody should be held accountable . It doesn't happen very much in this building in the four plus years that I've been here. I could only speak on behalf of myself and no one else in this building . But I apologize , Mr. Coyne, the way you were treated . And guess what, it's never too late to admit you're wrong. And it's never too late to apologize . So secondly , so Mr. Leonard brought up some great points here. So last year during the budgetary process there was a recommendation for two new positions , blight remediation groundskeepers. I thought it was a good idea, right? The majority of complaint s we get from all of you is blight, right, so I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 thought this would be an easy one. These positions haven't been filled. But I guess I have better understanding as to why. It doesn't make any sense to me or I can't even wrap my head around the pushback from administration is, you know, well, they have to be in the clerical union. It doesn't make any sense. I have yet to see the job description s. Okay, they might be posted online or at least the announcement for these positions . But I'm sure every one of them duties would fall under union work from the DPW and not clerical work. And I have the utmost respect for the clerical workers in this building . They work very hard. But, you know, myself being in a union, you never want to lose -- potentially lose a body, all right, because there's a brother hood. There's union numbers . There's numbers you work by. You never want to use lose a union member, a potential one or one you already have, especially to another union. That doesn't even make sense. So I agree with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 Mr. Leonard . Something isn't jiving here. I would like to look into this. I want the rational e, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could please reach out to administration and ask for the rational e with this -- I guess some type of negotiation s that are going on for these two hires that we voted on, put in the budget, and we desperately need. All right, but I don't understand and I can't wrap my head around why would they be put in the clerical union. This is some tactic that I just don't agree with if you could please do that for me. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So last week -- and I brought this a couple times but last week I brought it up again. And because guess what, it's roof season and it's gutter season. This happened last year where, you know, on the weekends and, you know, I've heard just on the street that if you want to get a roof done or gutters done, do it on the weekend because , guess what, there's no code enforcement , guess what, you don't need a permit, guess what, no one's going to stop you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Well, a couple of resident s have approach ed me in the last couple weeks. I've actually seen it myself driving around. I have no authority to stop it. But I posed a question last week and previously that, you know, how do we address this? Is there a way to overlap on the weekend s or a schedule ? So I got back the same response I got last time that housing inspector coverage on the weekend is covered by the Clerical Union Collective Bargaining Agreement , which means they are under negotiation s which is fine. So the city is currently looking -- currently participating in contract negotiations with the Clerical Union. So I hope that's address ed in the new contract because we're losing. And it's not fair to the contractor s that do the right thing and get the permits and follow the rules. It's not fair to them that this is happening on the weekend . So I'm glad -- I'm hopeful that that occurs. So I'm also asking for a followup . I don't know if we got it, Mr. Voldenberg , on the properties of 1305 Prospect and 523 Cedar, the ones that have over multiple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 times their windows smashed. We didn't get anything back yet? MR. VOLDENBERG : Nothing back from code enforcement or SPD. I'll follow up. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Follow up. I know you will. You do a great job. Also so on 1145-1147 St. Ann's Street, there is very high grass. This has happened over the past two summers . I know that there is an apartment manager . I'm not sure where this person lives. But my understand ing is -- and the neighbors try to do the right thing. They know this number. They try to call, voice box is full. So I'm not going to share that number with you now, Mr. Voldenberg . But could you please put this on code enforcement 's radar? They're familiar with this property . But they need to be reminded that it is still occurring . And I'll share that number with you so they could follow up with that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. And also, so, you know, there's been a lot of cleanups in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 the area in the city which is fantastic by different groups. They're all doing a great job. But one of them, a person that belongs to one of them reached out to me because they have an issue. And they're saying that, you know, now they have the understanding that, you know, from the curb to the property , that's the responsibility of the homeowner . But they are encountering some curbs maybe where there's not a house where there's like sludge or debris that hardens like clay. And then there's either weeds or roots or some garbage under it. And they want to know that, you know, when the street sweepers come around, are them machine s powerful enough to remove them as they pass on the streets . And I said I don't know but I'll look into it. And also, I know in the past that there's, you know, every year there's a street sweeping schedule . I think it might have been on social media last year. I don't really remember seeing it on the City's website but I could be wrong.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 But that same resident who is involved with the cleanup with her own little group would like to know and so do I, you know, because I'm sure more people are going to ask us. They ask us every year if we could get, you know, the schedule for this year. I forget how it works. I know it's every other. But maybe for everyone 's sake so we could all remember or have something to look at with regards to street sweeping. And if you could please ask if that machinery can handle the stuff that I mentioned . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And that's all I have right now. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thanks, Mr. McAndrew . Mr. King, did you have something ? MR. KING: Just two real quick things. Can we -- Frank, can we check on that castle house? I believe that the judge ruled on it just to get an idea what the next steps are. I guess it's suppose d to be demoed. It's schedule d by the city. And if so, when is that scheduled . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 And the final thing is, even though I'm not a member of the administration , I am a member of City Council . And I too -- I meant to mention this earlier that I appreciate Mr. Coyne's efforts very much. Having been in positions in the past where, you know, having HR Directors work for me and knowing full well how confidential all that paperwork is, I appreciate the fact that you stayed there and you were diligent ensuring that they weren't just going to be left there all night. So -- and trust me, everyone on this Council is not happy about that that occurred . And as a result, there is going to be an investigation by an outside investigator . But I wanted to make sure that you know that I apologize on behalf of the city for you to be -- I think you were treated poorly when in fact, you were doing the right thing and seems to me like you were treated as if you were doing something wrong. And as far as I'm concerned you weren't. You did the right thing and I appreciate it. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 few things, Meadow Brook Flood Project , Marie, you asked about that. Attorney Boyd Hughes will advise Council this week with an update. So next week we should have the rest of the information on that. Also we asked about the downtown pocket park. So I had some information . Scranton Tomorrow planted 10,000 flowers in the park in April. They were funded by Scranton Tomorrow and also in April, Leslie Collins of Scranton Tomorrow requested a meeting with administration to review furnish ings, garbage cans, appropriate sign usage also pet waste bags and additional aesthetic items. So the organization , they are ready waiting for a response from the administration on that. And I will let you know what's happening with that. I don't know -- someone said there was a ribbon cutting for that. I'm not sure what that is. But I guess we could find out. And we had another request 3000 block of Murphy's Court that we requested patching down there. Mr. Voldenberg , we requested this multiple times. Will you find 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 out if they are going to do it? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a date. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Also, when I met with the Mayor the other day I had asked for all of the signs for all of the parks to have signs put up that city parks close at dusk. We did have a request from a few of the officer s that I spoke to that were on the scene of a fight at a park and they had requested that we should have signage up at every park. So the administration said signs are being made as we speak. Last thing is Armed Forces Parade is coming up shortly . So I've asked administration if they would rehang the Armed Forces flags back out in front of City Hall. That's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH KUHARCHIK CONSTRUCTION INC. TO PERFORM THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL REPLACEMENT PROJECT AT THREE (3) LOCATIONS WITHIN THE CITY OF SCRANTON FOR A PROJECT TOTAL OF $873,831.90. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , it's been quite some time since these grants were awarded. So I'm very happy to see that they've been bid out. I'm waiting to see the new street lights in these intersection . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? Norma, did all your question s get answered about this traffic lights? MS. JEFFRIES : No. MR. SMURL: Okay, if you wait afterward s, I'll help you with those. All right. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING AN INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT OF COOPERATION AND MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN LACKAWANNA COUNTY AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON REGARDING COORDINATION ON CERTAIN PUBLIC SAFETY TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? On the question , I do have a comment on this. This is the system -- the CAD system that the police department uses, also the county and 911 system use. Since we have -- our new commissioners have been in office, they have agreed to allow us to participate in this system which in turn will save our fire department the $1,700 a month. So I'd like to thank our new commissioners for allowing this to happened . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AMENDING RESOLUTION NO. 268 OF 2023, A RESOLUTION ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH BARRY ISETT & ASSOCIATES TO PERFORM A THREE (3) YEAR ENGINEERING SERVICE FOR AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT ” TO INCLUDE AMENDMENTS TO THE CONTRACT . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I had a few questions about this piece of legislation . I know a few arose during caucus. This project was bid. It was accepted so now basically the cost is doubling . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 My question in caucus was why isn't this project bid out again or rebid? The backup said that the amendment is more fiscally responsible . But I don't see how since the price is basically doubling . I know we talked about it somewhat in caucus and we said possibly , you know, with the cost changing and maybe expanding this project it may be more fiscally responsible . But we wanted to get some of those questions answered. I know Mr. Gilbride has some of the question s that came up in caucus, correct ? ATTY. GILBRIDE : That's correct , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. But in general just knowing why this project wasn't rebid. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . MR. KING: On the question , I believe since the Barry Isett and Associates , that's a service contract with this company . The reason why the price increased is because we're adding three more blocks which originally was not included in there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 It turned out we had some extra funding and we were able to add an additional three more blocks which is why it increased .
