MEMORANDUM FROM MAYOR PAIGE G. COGNETTI DATED SEPTEMBER 5, 2023 REGARDING CITY UPDATES . 3.B. A SCRANTON CITIZEN 'S GUIDE TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FROM CITY OF SCRANTON 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 OFFICIALS . 3.C. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORTS 2022-2023 YEAR TO DATE SEPTEMBER 7, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple. So I did announce these last week but I was going to mention them again. This week coming up this Saturday , September 16th, it's going to be the Welcoming Scranton event over in South Side where they have the farmer's market. And that's going to be from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. So you could make sure to stop over there. They'll have food, music, vendors and that's a great event. It's their 7th annual one. And then another great event will be the West Scranton Fall Festival . They're going to have activities throughout the day and that is starting at 11 a.m. And that's going to be starting over at Clover Field and that will be another great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 thing this weekend coming up. And toward the end of the month, Scranton Fringe Festival is going to be starting . So they are usually a little bit earlier in September , but this year they are starting September 28th. And that will be running through October 7th. So make sure to check out Scranton Fringe Festival 's website . You could find plenty of shows and events that will be going on throughout that period of time. And it's really -- it's really a fun time within the city to be able to go to, you know, to support our performing arts. So the last thing I was going to mention is this weekend is Rosh HaShanah . So I wanted to wish those who celebrate happy Rosh HaShanah . That's all. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I don't have any announcements . I just want to express how sad and how I feel with the horrific storm event that impacted all of Scranton . I mean, there are residents , God love them, with their houses underwater . There's resident s that are going to lose their home. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 This devastation , I've never seen this level in these areas in my 61 years living in Scranton . So my heart and support and prayers go out to these families . I hope we can do and make them whole again and prevent this horrific -- a storm like this ever happening again in our city. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I'll echo those sentiment s as well as the fact that someone lost their life in Clarks Summit, South Abington Township as a result of this storm event. It's unbelievable the amount of rain that came down in literally an hour, hour and a half, two hours, the likes, you know, you don't often see in a lifetime and the devastation that resulted from it. Quite frankly , we're fortunate that only one life was lost. I know a number of people had to be saved with the torrential downpours and the stormwater that raged from the Abington s right down in through North Scranton and West Scranton . So hopefully we could do our best to try to help those people out that were most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 affected . And believe me, our thoughts and prayers are with all of them. And that's all I have. DR. ROTHCHILD : I apologize . I also wanted to mention that in my remarks and announcements from earlier . But I also feel terrible for the families in Scranton and Clarks Summit in our area who suffered during that storm and continue to deal with the after effects of it. And I just really wanted to thank our emergency services and our or DPW and code enforcement and all of our department s with the city for coming together to try to mitigate the problems from that and they're going to continue to work to -- to help those families and those who have lost their homes. And so I was happy to hear the update that we received earlier and I'll continue to be thinking about those families as well. MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I'll add in now. I was going to save it for Fifth Order. But I echo my other Council members ' sentiments . I am a resident of Keyser Valley. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Within five minutes of this storm I was bailing out my own basement and then moving towards pumping out other's basement s, pumping out pools and making my way down. And those are only minor issues that occurred that night. It doesn't compare to the things that happened down in the lower portions of -- around Merrifield and in North Scranton . Some of those people have lost everything from the multiple vehicle s and the entire content s of their homes. So I'll echo those sentiments . I'd like to, you know, help in any way I can. I tried since I started on Council with Keyser Valley with that pump house and with the areas that I noticed for years have been issues. And I brought that to some attention . And I would like to see these issues cleared up. And I know in the capital budget and with our ARPA funds we are looking at Keyser Valley. In this case it didn't come soon enough. In caucus tonight we discussed -- I know I brought it up. We'll see where the administration is with it. But we've done working groups from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 much -- for a lot of things around the city. And I know the resident s of Keyser Valley are looking to see, you know, they're looking for help, you know, they don't -- I think we could work with these resident s down here to go through condemnation . I don't know where we're at with that. But it's not something that I think's going to help them at this point in time. And I think an open discussion with them since there -- there isn't -- I mean, there's not a lot -- we're not talking about a several hundred people here. It's a small group that's been affected there and in North Scranton . And I think it's feasible to get them together and talk about and see what it is that they actually need before we move forward . So I would like to see that working group, that task force, whatever we'd like to call it to get with those neighbor s and actually have the neighbors join in with the efforts . That's all. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. Smurl? MR. SMURL: Yes, I've worked in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 flooded areas before. You feel terrible for these people. You don't know what it is until you've actually been involved in one and fortunately I have not. I've been in the plot many of times after floods and stuff. But this one, this one, the destruction from the amount of actually earth had moved. It was unbelievable . I went out and looked at it and seeing how much destruction actually was done by this between the bridges and rivers out of the banks and just making new rivers down the side of West Mountain . It was just unbelievable . And we just pray for the people that were damaged in this. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I too would like to compliment the efforts of our city workers , public works, fire, and police. I watched the news on this event over the last few days. And you could be very proud of the efforts they put forth to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 mitigate this disaster . Without their help it would have been far worse, which brings two issues to mind; one, the three taxing authorities we have, the city and the school district and the county. Is it possible for people who suffer significant financial loss, whether it's condemnation or major loss that they could get some kind of relief on their property taxes for this year? Is that a question that can be asked? I don't know if it's doable, but it would be a help to them, you know. To be paying 100 percent of your assessed tax bill when you got to shell out major money for major repairs or your house is condemned , it just doesn't seem the right thing to do. The second thing is, this should emphasize to all of you the importance of getting moving on stormwater management . Come December 16th, it will be seven years since the city sold the Sewer Authority and became responsible for stormwater management . Seven years is a long time for this issue to drag out. And we need to get moving 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 on it. You know, I mean, who's to say there won't be another storm this year or next year? So you have your marching orders. With regard to the City's website , the firefighter s' arbitration award is dated April 4th. That is 161 days ago. When are we going to see the firefighters ' new contract on the city's website . I remember you mentioned 120 days to dot the I's and cross the T's between all the lawyers . It's 161 days. That document should be available for public review. The pocket park, is there a projected completion date on that? MR. KING: I'll address that in Fifth Order. In Fifth Order I'll address that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. And the audit, is that still on track? MR. KING: As far as we know. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. You got 18 days to go. Do we have any information on the MMO? We usually have it by late August, early September for the upcoming budget, the MMO figures . MR. KING: Not at this time.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And on the capital budget, Mr. Schuster , the question I asked you last week is 7-I the same as the item on page 13 of the capital budget the pedestrian and traffic safety initiatives Lackawanna and Mifflin avenues or are those two separate initiatives ? MR. SCHUSTER : So it's two -- that was the question I had asked to Miss Cipriani tonight . She actually said it was three separate initiatives . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. So these two are separate . MR. SCHUSTER : They are separate . MS. HODOWANITZ : So basically we're looking upwards close to 4 million dollars for pedestrian safety on those streets . Okay, I hope we get it all. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Les Spindler. MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . I too send my best wishes out to everybody that suffered from that storm. I hope they get all the help from the city, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 state, and whoever else they could get to help them out with the damage they had. You know, it was just awful. But God knows -- I live in Tripp Park. Thank God there was no damage there that I know of. Councilman Schuster , you shouldn 't have left. MR. SCHUSTER : Well, I did travel from Keyser Valley to Tripp Park to get a pump and returned. Tripp Park did look fine that night. It was a war zone in Keyser Valley. MR. SPINDLER : I don't want to blow my horn, but for years I was calling for storm drains on Dorothy Street where the baseball fields are and the basketball court and tennis courts. On the side of the tennis courts they put one in about a year or two ago. And just a few weeks ago, they just finished the job. They put two on the ball field side. And if that wasn't done, I think those fields would have been under water because under normal rainfall, the water collect ed, like, almost out to the middle of the road. And the way it came down Saturday , I know those ball fields probably would have been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 flooded . So thank God for Pennsylvania American Water and DPW. They both did their job together . They finally finished it. Not a spec of water on the street the day after the storm. So those storm drains did their job. Next thing, I watched the meeting last week. And those people that were here that live on the 1800 block of Ferdinand Avenue, I can't believe what they have to put up with. I saw that picture on TV. It doesn't look like a street. It just looks like a washed out dirt road. If I was those people I would -- when it came tax time, I would put my taxes in, like, an escrow account and not pay it until that street was fixed because they pay their taxes and they have to put up with conditions like that? That's outrageous . I've never seen a street look so bad in my life. It looked like something out of a war zone. It's just ridiculous . If I was them, I would be here -- I'd be screaming . I'd be here every week until that was fixed. My heart goes out to them. I hope it's taken care of quickly . The next thing, I noticed this -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. KING: Mr. Spindler , I will address that in Fifth Order as well. I was up there yesterday . MR. SPINDLER : Okay. I probably won't be here. Last month -- early in August, maybe late in July I noticed the splash pad at Novembrino Complex wasn't working . There's wooden horses on one section of it and I'm wondering why. I heard the splash pad at McDade Park was down for a while because something happened with the motor. But I didn't hear anything about the splash pad at Novembrino . And that was during some hot August days it wasn't working . So, I mean, if we could look into that and see what the problem was. The swimming season is over. I'd like to know what happened . It's only like two years old. MR. SCHUSTER : I do think there is damage to the surface . I didn't get that officially but I believe there is damage to the splash pad surface . MR. SPINDLER : Also in the same area, the new playground that they put, I noticed it looks like it's all done except for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 underneath the playground. And it's just stones underneath there. I'm hoping it's not going to be left like that. Kids have to play. Are they going to fall on stones or are they waiting for another surface to put on top of those stones, I don't know. If we can ask about that. Usually in the Tripp Park playground there's mulch underneath it. MR. SMURL: There are -- rubber surfaces are going to be install ed in both that park and also in Connell 's or -- MR. SPINDLER : Okay, thank you. Last thing, when they were finishing up the storm drain job on Dorothy Street, I bumped into the DPW supervisor who said my corner would be fixed. Anyway, I told him that -- I was told that North Rebecca is on the paving list. And I said when they put it in the paper it wasn't in the paper. And he told me there's a fall and spring paving list. I had no idea about that. So I guess that means I will be on the spring list. So I will have to go all winter without a curb again. I've been talking about this for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 years and it just never seems to get resolved . So I guess I'll have to wait another six months. Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Regarding the Keyser Valley flooding the night of September 9, 2023, could it have been prevented? The resident s of this area deserve better. One of the biggest concerns from residents was the no show of the Scranton Mayor until nearly 24 hours later. The only elected official that was there earlier that morning was Councilman Mark McAndrew . If Council man Tom Schuster was not dealing with his own water issues, I'm sure he would have been there too. The fire chief was there doing water rescues . We're grateful and thank him for that. I'm not here to kiss anybody 's ring tonight . We elected a Mayor to run the city. I'm sorry if she never won homecoming queen or prom queen, we elected -- what she did win here was we elected her Mayor. We gave her the privilege to serve and make our city better.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 We are still waiting for that. After talking with the residents of the affected area, the biggest fears are having their homes condemned . This seems to give some city department heads excitement and glory when they condemn a home. These citizens understand their homes are damaged and in need of repair. It should be all hands on deck now providing a loader, a dump truck, a Pak Master removing all damage debris from the front of their homes. We all know once the city condemn s a home the nightmare begins. It is like taking a cheap shot at somebody when they are already down. Lately that seems to be the new Scranton style. What we should be doing now is upgrading the pump house to a bigger computerized pump system. If you noticed , the Keyser Valley pump station was underwater. Is it sufficient to handle the amount of water in that area now with all the new development on the mountain ? Was there a malfunction with the pump? Was it turned on? Was it out of service ? Is there a warning system that works? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Are there bells, whistles , or sirens that activate ? If so, were they working ? The neighbor s that I spoke to nobody heard any warnings . Is the drainage and piping in that area sufficient ? Are there storm drains there that are blocked or cut off? Were the issues that resident Lenny Srebro present ed over the years ever address ed? He has been asking for help. He's been asking for help with this issue for years. The neighbors also reported that they -- no warning signals came from the pump house. Sure, we all know the storm moved in quick. The water was fast. Okay, we get it. What wasn't fast was the response of the DPW. If anyone listened to the 911 calls that night, they had a difficult time reaching anyone from DPW. Just to set the record straight , no one is blaming DPW. They could only do what they are told and allowed to do by the administration . Do you know if we still have the 24/7 emergency callout crew that we can call out and utilize during these incidents , Mr. Smurl? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 We had an operations manager and an emergency coordinator . Has that job ever been filled since the person was relieved of his duties, Mr. Smurl? If that job was filled, could it have made a difference and the outcome been different , Mr. Smurl? You're in charge of DPW, correct ? Is there a pump over on Market Street and Yard Avenue, Mr. Smurl? If so, was it turned on? Did the city ever fix what they started over there years ago? Does anybody know how to turn on that pump or where it's even located at Market and Yard? Why would they bring people in the affected area put in a school gymnasium ? There wasn't a great matter to the homes or families that were affected . Why weren't they offered hotel rooms? Were they not worthy of hotel rooms? But you'll give vouchers to the homeless to use Weston Field. Does anybody not see the disconnect in the city right now? Mayor, and your Deputy Mayor just proved to the citizens of Scranton how crucial living in the city you represent is when you must respond to emergencies . People 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 want to hear from the elected leader. We didn't vote for chiefs. We didn't vote for director s to represent us. We voted for her, the Mayor. If the job is beneath her or too much for her, then have her resign. We deserve much better representation than what we're getting . On another issue concerning the flood, I'll tell you something else that is bizarre and troubling . There was a Facebook blast that went out, not a mention of a tragedy . But what it did mention , it mention ed that there was a Council person's birthday and if you would like to do anything for this person, it says you could donate to my re-election campaign . Really? Who does that during such a terrible time in the city? The same Council person after someone else said about the flood had to interact and say that she was sorry. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Norma Jeffries .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And, you know, there's one thing that's good about America that we have difference of opinions about things. I'm here to stand to say that over the summer I looked up a lot of things in the charter , our Home Rule Charter because there's things that I don't understand about what's going on in City Council . One of the things was when we have public caucus and, first of all, you can't hear completely what's going on in the public caucus. And to me it seems like we should be able to send questions in prior to a public caucus so that our questions can be addressed by the individuals that are sitting and having the caucus. I know that a caucus is a political gathering of information and to provide information to the public. But if we the public don't have a chance to ask our questions , I'm not sure why we break our neck to come to a public caucus. It is advertised that you are having a public caucus. But if we can't ask questions , you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 know, I don't understand what a public caucus -- how that's going to benefit me. I do appreciate the Mayor and business representative Cipriani being down here tonight . I was just very pleased with the information that they provided . I have a very dear friend that lives on Merrifield Avenue. And she called me and said, Norma, are you okay over there? I said, yeah, I'm fine. I'm watching a football game. And here she was waiting for the police and the firemen to take her out. Her picture 's on the front page of the paper. I told her she made the paper but didn't want it that way. So she's very nervous about this whole situation . So I was taking as many notes as I can to tell her about what the Mayor said. I was very pleased that the Mayor was right on top of the situation over there at that part of the city. And like I said, it's here in America . We do have the opportunity to dispute other things that people are saying. So the speaker before me, you know, I'm not sure what he expected the Mayor to do to get a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 boat and come over there herself , but a lot can be done in the -- on telephones . And I'm sure that they were buzzing with trying to get people and to get help. So I do have to say that as far as the Mayor was sitting there and as to why she was elected to do her job and she's doing that job. I was not here last week as well. And it's just different listening to it at home versus being here. But when each of us stand here with different things that are on our hearts, different things that are bothering us, with Joan it's the audit. With Marie, it's been the stormwater treatment . And with me, it's been the street signs. So last week when there was an article in the paper with the person that took the time to write to the paper about his concern about the street signs, I had received information over the summer that it was an issue with the equipment to put up the street signs and that a bid was going to be going out for that equipment . So I'm hoping that that will happen. And it will be -- it's been six years that I've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 been talking about street signs. So six years, each time I have a birthday I get older and older and older. So six more years before the street sign goes up, I'm not sure I'll be standing here. But I just hope and pray that on the capital budget going up for next year that it will include something or some line item so that the equipment can be bought and that it can be functional for next year. I've seen -- that's another thing when they talked about budget tonight , how many of our resident s out there know or can see anything about the budget? And we talk very freely about the internet. Everybody doesn't have the internet. Everybody doesn't have the access to a computer . So whenever I can, I'm speaking for those that don't have that kind of a voice. And my paper is filled tonight with different notes I took as the Mayor was speaking . I will type them up. And I will talk to my friend over on Merrifield Avenue and just to give her some kind of hope. And one other final thing I want to say is that at Nay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Aug Park, they are collecting it was Tuesday night. It was tonight and it will be next Tuesday night from 5:30 I think until 6:30 or 7. So one of the things that I thought was interesting on the list along with the cleaning supplies was quarters . And I thought quarters , and then it dawned on me they probably have to go to a laundromat . So, you know, think about the people that are out there. If you see them collect ing someplace , you know, it's easy to be in our own little world. But try to think about those people that are out there that have been affected by this water because like me, I was sitting watching a football game while others were in a very bad state of affairs . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . I will address in Fifth Order about the caucuses in terms of microphones . We're looking into that. And also the street signs, I know the Mayor mention ed it during caucus, but I'll give a little bit of update on that. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 first off, I'd like to say Rosie and me went down to the festival . Even though I dropped a couple 20s, I couldn't be more enthusiastic . It was just terrific . I think it was well planned . And I seen bathrooms -- that's a necessity when you're 86 years old now. Anyway, we need more like that. And like I said, I found shade to sit down in. I just couldn't find nothing adverse to say about the whole situation . It was terrific . Now, about six houses down the street from me is where the flood started in front of the (inaudible ) those poor houses, this is my neighborhood . I know all of these people. Some are retired. Some are both husband and wife working for their property mostly. Everybody 's basement is flooded . Washing machines are out there. And heating systems were lost, water tanks. I talked to three or four. And they just don't know their next move, you know. The next move is going to have to be some sort of loan I suppose . That's the -- it just -- it's bad over there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 for probably more than a dozen houses. Two of the occupied houses weren't condemned . They were just -- there's just no saving them. Then you start thinking the tax losses, everybody seems to want around here. The hospitals wants. The city wants, the county, the state, the school board, the colleges . I don't know where -- Joe Cross said years ago, the worth of this city has dropped million s. And this reassessment is nothing but the big lie. I've been saying it for two or three years. Now, you people realize some of us got to have some help here when the reassessment comes. Reassessment is to raise taxes. It failed down in Wilkes-Barre. And now it's just a burden to everybody . It keeps -- it keeps creeping up in conversations . You know, you think I jumped up and down about the $240,000 walkability plan, here in August our code enforcement lost five suits, five suits for $1,300,000. This is the same people that harassed me right up to today. They just don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 seem to learn. I don't know. You know, two or three months ago you were -- you said how many apartments they came across. They didn't talk to a single person on North Main Avenue where there's a dozen illegal houses. There's so many illegal s on North Main Avenue they park on the sidewalk . Every single house on the 2000 block has a garage and a driveway . They are just full of people. I don't know what to do with them all. The Zoning Board keeps giving variances and there is no place to park. This whole city needs a Mayor desperately like we just heard. This woman doesn't have the ability to govern. It's sad. I'm not mad at her or nothing . But she's not Mayor material . And we don't need any -- to keep buying. We need some taxable property . We don't need that building next door and worry about the long term. Look what's here right now. We are not in good shape right now. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Taylor Sulkhill (phonetic ). MS. SULKHILL : Hi, I'm Taylor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Sulkhill , I'm a resident in the Hill section and a homeowner . So I wasn't going to say anything about it after the devastation from the storm, but today a child in front of my house fell off his bike. And we have a sewer grate that was broken. It got ran over by the DPW trucks during the Hill Section , you know, when they paved the streets and everything . But they fixed it. But there's a gap about this large. And you could see the old brick. And today he fell. And I sit by Farber Court on Olive Street down from the Farman's hill where they like to ride their bikes and stuff. So when he fell, I kept thinking of, like, all the other children in our neighborhood . It just seems like a really bad thing for not only just obviously the kids but the city it seems like a liability to have that big of a gap. MR. KING: Taylor, where is that Olive and where? MS. SULKHILL : So, you know, there's Irving -- North Irving, Prescott , Farber Court, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 across from 1425 Olive Street which is -- MR. KING: Farber Court. MS. SULKHILL : Yeah, across from 1425 Olive Street, that, like, sewer grate. I have a picture on my phone if I could bring it up? Is that fine? But I don't have a printout . Can I show you? MR. KING: Sure. Okay. Thank you. MS. SULKHILL : That's all I have to say. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you very much. David Dobrzyn . Mr. Voldenberg , can we have DPW take a look at that on Olive and Farber Court, I guess it would be the manhole cover. Would that actually be -- would that be the city or would that be -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to DPW and the water company . MR. KING: Yeah, and the water company if you could. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Have them take a look at that. That doesn't look good. It looks like -- honestly , if that kid fell it looks like he could fall down in there quite frankly . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : It looks like that movie with the clown. It doesn't look good. MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I would implore you to do everything you can with this flooding and trying to give these people all the help they need, probably won't be able to good give them all the help they need but as much as you can. And I have to go up that way tomorrow so I might stop through the neighborhood just to see what's going on up there. Last week I mentioned about 21 million dollar losses in our pension for police and fire. And I would hope that that gets considered now. I would hope that some of our new and old speakers here pick up on it and inform themselves it was in the Times paper you could get information from Brian Fulton in their archives . And it might cost you a coin but not too many. And by the way, it lost 6 million -- no, it gained 6 million dollars from last year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 But I don't buy that. We're still 21 million down and that should have earned a couple of million. I see some issues in the paper with restoring or rebuilding the swimming pool at Weston. And a few weeks ago it was Mr. Bolus he mentioned grout. And by the way, you would think that that might be a silly idea. But when they want to repair cracks in the Hoover Dam with all of the billions of tons water or millions of tons of water behind that, they inject grout into the cracks. And it holds that water back instead of having it progress . And now getting to the water bill situation , it's a prime example of basically a con job by everybody . Henry Amoroso was brought into town by the college s. And it was suppose d to be some kind of solution . And we were made promise s that the payments wouldn't be jacked up. And they just consistently got jacked up. And as far as I'm concerned , PA American Water is not living up to the promise . And I think we should start a counter suit on some of this because I don't need to be paying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 for people outside of Scranton for sewer authorities and such and then turn around and have the Department of Consumer Affairs say, no, you can't do that. You can't charge other people. I was against it. I was at the original meeting when that proposal -- it was probably 10 years ago was put forth. And now moving along, after the Italian fest, I was walking up Linden Street and Jefferson Avenue. And it was a four-way stop, no turn on red just about the time the parking light -- or the walk sign came on. Somebody pulled off in front of me. And it's no secret I am totally against that walkability plan. And furthermore , they have a bike trail listed down on Mattis Avenue which winds around the old Chamberlain General Dynamics. And several years ago the city took parking meters from up by the hospital and put them down there because they had their garage in repair. And the guys came in; and, hey, we're a big corporation here. We have nowhere to park. And we can't have people running out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 every two hours to fill the meter with coins. Now, they are putting a quarter of a billion dollars probably to help with Ukraine and different situations . We're falling way behind on our national security problems with the Department of Defense . And that being said, they're talking about 40 more employees within a year or two. And by the way, you have to go through a security check before you walk in the door. So how can you run out and parking meters or park six blocks down street? You are just plaguing somebody else there. Thank you. And have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . That exhausts the sign-in list. Would anyone else like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Members of Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First, I would like to note the passing Robert Kozzie Kozmark (phonetic ), a good friend of mine and a friend of my brother 's from Minooka . He also at one point lived in West Side. He passed away this Friday. Second, on the pickleball request , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 can't see any possible justification in raiding workmen 's compensation fund for any project . Retirement workmen 's comp and obligation s are not a rainy day fund for the city. Who thinks stealing $500,000 for the pickleball from workmen 's comp is a good idea? And last, faster than a rising flood, Mayor Cognetti was out to the cameras saying how horrible the flooding is and millions of damage. And in case there's more rain, you should stay put as we are ready to watch you get flooded again. Last week we had people who comment ed on Leggett's Creek. They related to us experiences of being dodged about FEMA and studies and grants and dates promised that are already passed, all sorts of dismissive actions . It's not new. The city has not been working on it since 1985 and Hurricane Gloria. The community suffered millions of dollars worth of damage. And the mayor was quick to remind people they could look to the Red Cross for help. We have updated flood maps, water runoff issues, faulty undersized pipes and a failure to dredge.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 We've had a flood of federal money that is going to everywhere but where we know the community truly needs it. Choose walkability and leave the citizen s in danger. Thank goodness for the people of Leggett 's Creek will have a one million dollar pickleball court. Antique lighting around City Hall and the courthouse is definitely a bigger priority . Maybe the flooded resident s can go to Coopers to the new bar that was rapidly funded and drink their sorrows away. How can we have seen this coming? I asked that of myself almost every week as do the people here at City Council . Maybe the people who are suffering can come to City Hall for help. No, they can't because the doors are locked. The Mayor does not want people contact ing her or her people. They should contact 311 and wait. I believe the government thinks direct interaction with the public is a danger. And from recent classified nonpublic reports paid for by the people of this city, it all starts with those pesky veterans . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Now, I know that Fourth Order and Citizens Participation is a bother. It would be so much smoother if we did not have the people involved . But citizens participation comes from a right. The First Amendment is also often quoted for free speech. But this forum is the right to address our government . The Mayor dislikes people's rights of people who question . We have a government behind a blockade who avoids the First Amendment who locks people out of the people's building and who yells at them. We will tell you how you could express your rights. Let us ask questions to -- let us preask questions to the Mayor so the answers could be provided or dodging of the topic can be preplanned . Impromptu questions sometimes get truthful answers and we can't have that. And on the act of hiring a company to make a list of potential people of danger, we have seen it with Charlie Chaplin and the red scare and the Hollywood blacklists. We've seen it with 20,000 people on Edgar Hoover's subversive list. We have seen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 it in 1940 in Germany. We have seen it as infants who are currently on the no fly list. How do we allow ourselves to go from a government who is there to protect the people now to a government who seeks to be protect ed from the people? I don't quite get that. And the last statement on flooding, it was said how can we deal with the pump house being flooded , what can we do to -- maybe learn a page from Fukushima when their generators and pumps got flooded . You don't build flood -- pumps for floods at ground level. You elevate them. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, flood victim. You probably knew I was coming. Okay, this is all about I get to say -- I get five minutes to say what I feel. And if you don't like it, too bad. You know, I think that was pretty slick for the Mayor to call an emergency meeting that I only -- well, I came in a little bit late. But I didn't know anything was coming about the flooding there. I live right at the corner of Lafayette and North 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Merrifield . So I'm there firsthand . You know, and the Mayor -- boy, this is really something . I was interviewed by Channel 28 the day after the flood. And they even told me what time I'm going to be on and a caption about it. And, jeez, they didn't show it. But they showed the Mayor telling us, you know, if you see water, don't go in it. Thanks a lot Mayor, duh. You know, now why didn't she say at that time I'm going have a special meeting on the flooding here? I didn't know anything about this. You know, I even come to -- when I come to meeting s I come here early. Quarter after I walked in. She was done talking about the flooding , you know, and then she rambled on and on about all the other crap that, you know, just isn't as important as, you know, the citizens here, the neighbors . You know what, the picture s and the TV doesn't do it justice . You know, go there yourself and see how it is. You know, I asked a bunch of neighbors to come to the meeting . Once again, you're wasting your time, Len, and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 we're too busy cleaning up. You know, all I know -- I don't know everything but people have had to call dumpsters themselves . I didn't see any being delivered by the city so, you know, what are the people suppose d to do, you know, wait to clean out their place if the city sends dumpsters ? You know everybody , we need help out there. You know, that's what I said at the interview . And then I was surprised I wasn't on, you know, but I learned not to drive in the water from her. You know, even from past experience I've been coming here for 10 years. You know, and I know there was other places that got it bad. But I believe we wouldn't have had the flooding problem if Council listened , not just to me but other people have tried talking about, you know, the drainage system is just totally wrong. Also, the Mayor when she was talking about the pump house, I just caught the end of it. And she was saying, you know, like, how she gets her information . Why don't you ask 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 me? You know, that pump house, that's right. Who the heck engineered that place that when it fills up with water it kicks the breaker right there. I agree with Tom. It needs to be up higher. And that's what happened years ago a couple of times in some bad flooding it fills up and it kicks the breaker , duh. Jeez, I wonder how to fix that. You know, I even feel that this is a big thing right now. But you know what, after it blows over, my experience in the past for 10 years, yeah, we're taking care of it. I heard every -- every story in the book or every excuse what they are doing. We're looking into it. We sent engineers . It's even -- now, a couple of years ago they said, all right, it's in the budget. But it's too late in the season. As soon as the spring comes around, you know, we're going to start fixing the problem . That was three or four years ago, never saw it happened . You know what, I have no faith, no faith in the Mayor, in this city. It's really sad. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , city resident and taxpayer . I must admit I'm a little bit in shock today. I just heard about my neighbor Wayne Hiller and a few other things that I heard here tonight that makes it hard to get back on these items. But I do want to say thank you for two things, number one, last week I talked about the big hole that -- and it was still there when I went home that night. But the next morning when I went down 307 it was filled in. Now, I don't know if it was DPW or the owner of the property or who did it, but I want to thank whoever did it because that was -- that was a very good feeling to know nobody was going to get hammered by that. And the other is just for the DPW and the police and firemen that had been out working on this storm, really appreciate them and hope they get some -- were able to get some rest. And then I also wanted to -- when I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 came in tonight , there was this thing downstairs , a flyer about tick check and underlying tick bites and Lyme disease . Lyme disease is terrible . But I do want to share with everybody and I think I've done it before and I think the county has done it, East Stroudsburg University has a lab -- tick lab there. And they are excellent . And if you could pull the tick out and send it to them, they will tell you what you need to do or not or you could relax and not do. So please do that if you need to. Now on the -- what is going on with the tax exempt properties ? We were going to do a study of some kind. I think there was an RFP in twice. I don't know if anybody even bid on it. But is that progressing ? And is it underway or what is the status of at this point? MR. KING: I know they put it back out for bid again. I'll check on the status of whether people have bid on that. I'll get back to you on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, thank you. And on 7-I, I know you'd be voting on it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 tonight . But I wish you would not vote until we actually see a split about how those -- all of those things are going to be funded. You know, it's just too easy to get them in the wrong place and make it look pretty down there, Lackawanna Avenue instead of doing what needs to be done. And Serrenti , are we going to get a study on that? I asked about what's going on there profit and loss about Serrenti . Are we going to get anything ? And then what are we going to do with that -- well, Engine 15 home there on I guess it's Ash Street in Petersburg. I don't think it goes out, does it? Does anybody know if it goes out? Mr. Smurl, do you know? But, you know, why does it sit there? I just don't know. I thought that was going to be closed off. MR. KING: I'll check on that status for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. KING: I'll check on that status for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, I just don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 know what happened . If it still goes I can't -- I have a hard time believing that it goes out, but maybe it does. MR. SMURL: The fire station Engine 15? Yeah, Engine 15, there is no engine in there. The police department uses that for storage . MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, there's still an engine in there. MR. SMURL: Up at Prescott corners ? They put a new engine in it? There wasn't. I know the police department was using the upstairs for storage . And we did have an office up there at one point. But I don't know if it's still there. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I just wondered if we still need to have that property either. And on tonight -- and Lenny was just talking about coming in and hearing the Mayor and Miss Cipriani doing -- talking about the stormwater which, of course, was, you know, I guess unavoidable . But yet when a caucus is announced for one thing, it should be held to that one thing. And, you know, maybe announce one after 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 the meeting instead of before the meeting so people who are interested in the stormwater as Lenny would have been and a lot of other people I'm sure that would have helped. MR. KING: Yeah, we had her schedule d to come on the capital budget. And we thought because of the emergency the occurred over the weekend , we thought it would be a good idea to have her update as to what is going on with the city. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, it's understand able. It just would have been nice if you would have kept it at the beginning of this meeting and, you know, put it in there so people could have known, but thank you. I lost my time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton city taxpayer . I think it's a good time to start taking into the consideration the increase in extreme weather events in the area, in the world at large. Now, I don't speak on this too frivolously . Actually on Saturday night, that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 marked the 12th anniversary of a devastating flood that wiped out my own house 12 years ago, rendered me homeless and my family homeless for some time. And I'm very aware of what it's like to lose everything to a flood, a flood that by all accounts shouldn 't have happened . And further consideration , that's how easy it is to become homeless. So when we approach the homeless people in our community , think about one bad storm, one car accident , all it takes. But we as a city need to do what we can to prevent as much as we can adverse weather and extreme weather conditions which we all know are tied to climate change. And we're getting pretty close to the wire on that where it's irreversible and this is just going to be the new normal. Now, obviously the City of Scranton can't do that all by itself. But we can do our part to make a change in our own lifestyle s, in our own city planning in order to reduce carbon emission s and reduce urban heat islands and (inaudible ) the events of extreme heat coming from our cities.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 And part of that has to do with reducing our reliance on automobiles . Now, cars are a huge source of carbon emissions . They're not even close to the number one. But it is one thing that the city actually has some relative control over. And by boosting public transit , especially by transit that doesn't involve burning fossil fuels such as electric trains, we can really do a lot to help combat the effects of climate change in our own community and reducing people's reliance on cars and promoting walkability , also really reduces our rate of consumption on both material and on fuel. So this is a good time to start investing and start really taking some huge strides or walkability for transit and increasing the public density reducing our reliance on automotive because this is too expensive for us both in terms of personal finance , city finance , and when the storms hit and we lose everything . Most Americans can't afford even a $1,000 emergency . The millions of damage -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 hundreds of thousands sometimes for families who've lost their homes just on four or five people is untenable . And we can't keep experiencing this. So doing what we can do, reduce our own contribution to climate change and also help to increase our community 's ability to have something to save to bounce back if things occur, if tragedy does strike is what we need to be focusing on as a city. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Delmar. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hi, I'm Rick Little from Scranton . I'd like to talk about the criminal izing of the elderly here in Scranton mainly through judicial means through the Scranton Housing Authority . Yesterday there was a meeting . I have been to many meeting s, try to go to many meeting s before and I go there and the door is locked. But for some reason, surprised -- I was surprised to see the Times-Tribune there and other people. And we got into the meeting . And then, you know, they make you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 sign a list. And it was like they'd never seen anybody at their meeting before which I believe is probably what the fact is. It's just that I read in the paper today that the Mayor -- or I'm reading the letter that Mayor Cognetti sent to them about a new SHA Director . And, you know, she says I was surprised to read in the Scranton Times that the search is already well under way to fill the anticipated vacancy in January . And I was also surprised that there is only three candidates . I mean, I know from living there for 14 years, 15 years that is a very closed little thing. It's the same people over and over for the past 28 years. And you know they do, oh, SHA was incorporated in 1939. Well, the fact of the matter is it was in business way before that. It just got incorporat ed in 1939. And as I said before, there was a Mayor of Scranton , Mayor Durkin who was head of SHA from, like, 1926 until the mid70s. It was a good thing. But it turned into this thing that just if you don't -- they put signs all over, all over the building . You 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 know, you're going to be evicted . You're going to be evicted. If you don't, you know, put your garbage in bags you're going to be evicted . You know, it's constant stress of eviction . And I finally figured it out. It's because they got this prosecutor and the prosecutors are -- I mean, they recently switched it to (inaudible ) that's representing the school board now that I'm fighting that they didn't even put their papers in today like they were ordered to. But, you know, before that it was David Coyne evicted me twice in -- in the magistrate court. And I'm looking at the board and I'm seeing that there's this guy on the SHA Board who is also a magistrate judge. And they do it so fast. I mean, I tried to get out of the -- I tried to move it to federal court. But it's -- they didn't even ask me to see the lease, the lease that was, you know, approved in this body. All the papers, I mean, they have rules in the courts where, you know, if we don't have the court -- the citings in our law library -- talking about the law 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 library in the Lackawanna Court that you have to provide them. Well, they don't have any of the CFR federal things. And they have gathered together almost every agency in the city, the Department of Aging, the Lackawanna Pro Bono. They got the police involved , the fire involved . And they are criminalizing the elderly. They don't have a chance. They go to court. They're taken to court. I said three words. And the last time -- you know, my last eviction which I'm still dealing with with court process ; but it's -- it's the number one thing that's making people homeless . And I think the main -- and now they want Carl Lynott who I learned last night, oh, he worked 14 years as the liaison for the District Attorney 's Office for Housing. And he's the guy that hired David Coyne. And I've dealt with him a lot. There is no honesty anywhere -- anywhere going on. And, you know, how they know that police officers work there, how the Mayor knew, why don't I know? Why don't they have a list of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 the people that work at SHA because I've been just -- they're dodging everything including discovery in court of who works there. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes. Yes, I do. First, Mr. Voldenberg , I had sent to you pictures and a short address and stuff of 914 South 9th Avenue. They said it's behind printing place on Main Avenue. Anyway, it's a small building owned by Verizon . And you could barely see it. I think they cut the front of it out so they could get in and out of the door. But we've sent code enforcement up there and ask them to find out -- maybe we could find out who actually owns it. I believe Verizon does. And maybe they could clean that up in the neighborhood . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you. And the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 second thing I had is, I was contact ed Wednesday morning after last week's Council meeting by some veterans , veterans concerned about this thing -- this report from Muflehun . This was an assessment done by the Trump administration through Homeland Security . This was a pilot study that Scranton was involved in and Philadelphia and other cities throughout the United States. The concern was the veterans -- word veterans was in here four times and they felt like they were being targeted . But this pretty much means nothing . I don't think it's worth the paper it's printed on. It is not though something that we voted on for a project that the city sends an RFP out for. This request , a proposal was sent out by the City of Scranton . The RFP I have here and exactly what I said before we went on break it was about. It was about gangs. And if you read the community health and safety landscape analysis , it says Scranton faces a combination of challenges and potential violence in the city. These include but are not limited to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 gangs based outside the city also operate within the city and increase migration population from larger cities into our neighborhood s. This is what I voted for. This was the study that our police chief had asked support on. Myself -- well, we went to speak to him the day of the Council meeting before we voted on this. We spent an hour and a half with our police chief and went over there's a lot because there's a lot of things in there that can help us but there is a lot of stuff in there that is kind of unnecessary . But anyway, the RFP went out and two proposals came in, one was for $99,675 from the Institute . The second proposal that came in was for $69,374 from Muflehun . The city chose the cheaper one. And that is the one that I voted on approving because our chief asked for support on this. I trust our chief. So that's why I supported it. Buy anyway, the concern with the veterans -- so the following day I had arranged a meeting with our chief and some of the concern ed veterans . And I met with Andy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 Chomko, Ed Chomko, Sam Puchwara (phonetic ), Davis, Kyle Donahue , and Chief Carroll to discuss all of these concerns about our veterans . That report or whatever that was done before means absolutely nothing . My only concern was with what Chief Carroll had asked for support on which was this RFP. That's what we voted on. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few things. I didn't plan talking about Muflehun , but this pilot program was done in four cities. It was a grant for about 749, $750,000. What Mr. Smurl said I wrote his words done, worth nothing . The report's worth nothing . And what's included in that report is absolutely unnecessary . When I first spoke about this report, those were two of the things that I feared. We were spending money on a study from when I researched this group, this group had nothing do with crime, nothing to do with gangs.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 And my fear was that we were going to spend $70,000 on a study from a group that was unqualified to do this type of study. And I still stand that this group is unqualified to do a study that we were requesting a study for. It's worth nothing and it's unnecessary . And what I planned on doing was getting a copy of the original study so I could base my opinion on whether this group is worth investing in to do this study. I was denied that access to this study. It was passed. We spent the $70,000. After reading that study, it was worth nothing and unnecessary . Next, in the capital budget we have four new electric vehicle s that are being included for purchase . Mr. Voldenberg , can we get a list -- if could you reach out to the administration to get a list of who the individual s are that are driving these electric vehicle s and if we can get a list of other city vehicle s and the drivers and who they're assigned to? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. I did forget to mention and I'm sorry for it, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 thanking the Scranton Police Department , Scranton Fire Department , and DPW. They did a lot of great work which I witnessed firsthand, Frink Street, Keyser Ave, North Scranton , thank you very much for what you did that night. It was something that once that storm started , I saw police officers in my neighborhood called into action and leaving their homes to get out on the roads that night. So thank you. We have a hearing coming up on the capital budget. Everybody here in attendance tonight got to hear part of that capital budget. And I hope anybody on TV that was listening if there is any concerns with that capital budget if you could please come in and, you know, give input on onto that budget whether we should move forward with it and what your thought s are. I've asked for it before, Mr. Voldenberg . I don't think we ever officially got a copy of it. Can we please ask the administration for the Keyser Valley stormwater study? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 mentioned tonight a task force to be -- we could use any name that we want, a task force, a working group, anything like that it came up in caucus. The neighbor s in Keyser Valley and parts that were affected in North Scranton would like input into what's going on. And I think our city could give them the benefit of the doubt to get input on what help it is that they need. I can't say what help it is they need because I'm not in the position . But I think they could give input into what help it is that they need to help them through this. I don't know if condemnation is the answer, but I do know that's something that they are very concerned about. Ferdinand Street seems to have been paved. Thank you for that. And I'm sure as I move to the next Council person there'll be some things that I forgot to say but that's all for tonight . Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have several complaints I'm just going to go ahead and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 forward along an e-mail to Mr. Voldenberg . But just one real that if we could request from DPW and this is at the, like, at the top of the 400 block in between the 400 and 500 block of Taylor Avenue and Vine. There is a one way sign that someone has brilliantly turned around. So it looks like the one way is actually the opposite way. So not to confuse drivers , if we could get that sign corrected . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. MR. KING: Is that it, Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : That's it. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. I wasn't going to speak about Muflehun tonight either. But I thought I put it to bed. Guess what, the first report is nothing . And the second $70,000 one is going to be a bunch of nothing too. All right. Secondly , during announcement s, of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 course, I spoke to the poor resident s and how bad I feel and how I hope that we could help them as much possibly and quickly as possibly . But in Fifth Order I want to say how proud I am of our police department , fire department , public works department with their immediate diligence helping all of our residents get through this horrific event. So this morning I opened the paper and I was -- I was very disturbed . I was disappoint ed when I read the article about the housing authority meeting . And what concerned me was even a horrific event and the devastation s that occurred since Saturday , the amount of involvement from the Mayor and her administration with regards to the appointment process , with regards to the search, it should be expanded outside of the state, the civil service component should be removed , the qualifications and job description should be altered . That disturbed me because the Mayor's authority is to appoint . That's it. That's it -- to that board, nothing else. Not sending letters telling them how to operate , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 who to pick or how to pick -- maybe not who to pick, but I didn't like it because most of us remember the last time a mayor tried to take over and actually controlled an authority was the Sewer Authority and look what happened there. It was sold. We were left holding the bag for stormwater . And our water bills have been the highest that I could remember . So that concerned me and it should all of you. And then last but not least, Mrs. Hodowanitz , I mean, I'm with you. Chairman of Public Safety Committee , let's find out why once and for all why the firefighters ' contract isn't on the website . We were told way before we went on recess that, yeah, I think it was 120 days max they told us. And I know it's well over that. And thank you. You're keeping the counter going for us. But we need an answer. And I don't want to hear it's because of Ufberg and their legal department . We paid enough for that. The contract is settled . I don't want to hear that they go pieces and through it and spend more money on it. So please, we want to know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 exactly when and by next week. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have several notes here. The Mayor and City Council will present a joint proclamation on Friday, September 15 at 1:30 p.m., for the city's Hispanic Heritage Month proclamation to community organize rs at NEPA's Latino festival . The event will take place at Scranton City Hall front steps. ECTV is contract ing with Endeavor , Incorporated to secure four microphones for the conference table out front here so that all the citizens can hear, you know, our discussions during caucus and so that you could hear when we have guests come in and present to make it, you know, obviously better for citizens to be able to hear what's being discuss ed during caucus events. So that was something that was bothering me as well. So I put this request in as recently as late last week. And I'm glad to see they're going to jump on it. The 1800 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 block of Ferdinand Street, which I visited yesterday , took a video, took some pictures , and I also spoke to the daughter of one of the -- it was actually a former student of mine, daughter for the parents that lived up on Ferdinand Street. So I wanted to see it. As I was bouncing around to the different spots yesterday in North Scranton and West Scranton reviewing some -- the flood damage, I made sure I went up to Ferdinand Street to review what went on up there. So Council asked if this street was part of the FEMA 2018 project . The resident s who visited here last week, you know, told us about the terrible condition s. And they were right. It's absolutely horrendous . It's terrible . It's present ly under review by DPW. And so FEMA damage contains three sites for repair, Ferdinand Street, remove and replace the surface of asphalt , roadway surface 92 feet long by 5 feet wide, 6 inches deep. This work is scheduled between today and Friday of this week. So hopefully they're going to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 some relief up there on Ferdinand Street. So hopefully the neighbors maybe up on Ferdinand Street are watching this evening. But help is on the way. And please scream and yell if it doesn't happen by Friday. Joan Hodowanitz , status of union contract s on the city website ; the city is waiting on a finalize d version from the labor counsel and will post the same upon receipt . That is the answer I got on that one. Item 5-D and 5-F, donations to Scranton Fire Department . Scranton Fire Department donation account is 12029544000000000000 . It's the same account . And they indicated that they can amend the Amos Tower legislation to make sure the -- there was a question last week because it appeared as though there are two different account s that they were going to go into. And I think it's actually the same account . It was just -- so we got an answer on that. Under 5-L, legislation with the Lackawanna Avenue wall repair. I think that was address ed. They are two different project s and funding is already in place for the wall repair. It's awaiting PennDOT permit approval . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 So that's a mess. It's a terrible eyesore in our city. And I'm afraid that wall is going to come down on top of somebody . It -- and it's right at the entrance to the City of Scranton . It's got to be repaired. It appears as though it's well on it's way. So let's hope that happens soon. Miss Schumacher mentioned that the sinkhole on Route 307, Seymour Avenue has been repaired. We're thrilled about that. The street sign program , it's been advised DPW has made 577 signs in-house as of September 7th and has installed 400 of them. The administrations plans on issuing an invitation to bid for installation of street name signs in West Side as indicated earlier by the Mayor. Lackawanna Avenue wall repair legislation , okay, I think we already addressed that. Marie Schumacher asked how much the improvement s are for safety and how much is allotted toward beautification . This is a grant application . It has not been awarded to date. The proposal calls for the addition s of new curbs, paving, curb pump house, ADA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 accessible ramps. Signing and marking of bike lanes and crossing at intersections create proven traffic calming measures . The project also implements a road guide for lessening the vehicle use of the road space for additional traffic calming measures . Further , the adding of better lighting and tree cover along the entire route not only improves visibility but reduces the heat island effect adding additional safety features for pedestrians and other users. That's the response I got on that. Doris Koloski mentioned the handicap curb cut repair at Olive Street and Colfax Avenue, East Gibson Street and Colfax Avenue. We sent this to DPW for status on those repairs. Len Srebro, Keyser Creek flooding , Dewey Avenue, Lafayette Street, sent a request to administration as homeowner Len Srebro asked Council to reach out to the city administration to secure a copy of the approximate two year old study done by the city engineer regarding the flooding to his street and projected repairs .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 The response was, DPW has done a lot of work in this section . DPW employee has met with the resident , has pictures and a map of the potential issue. DPW has plans to camera the line this weekend to pinpoint the elbow that was installed without engineering approval . Once DPW can locate the position of the issue, DPW could recommend a permanent fix. DPW and engineer will meet to determine whose property the elbow is located on and acquire the proper permits and engineering for the fix. Apparently , they also asked that the resident complete a right to know request at their earliest convenience concerning this issue. Not me, the city. Keyser Valley stormwater design, the city plans to make improvement s for stormwater infrastructure in Keyser Valley area. The next phase of this project will add to the previous study of the area and begin design engineer ing phases. The study will be used and the application for additional funding sources for 11 construction and implementation s. The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 project cost 467,000. The city will use 421,000 of PEMA advance assistant grant funds, 46,000 of ARPA funds for the project of the estimated cost to Keyser Valley stormwater construction between 2024. That was the design. The construction is between 2024 and 2026. Estimated cost for construction phase is $9,600,000. The city plans to use 4,800,000 of (inaudible ) grant funds and 4,800,000 of ARPA funds for this project . Mr. Coyne asked a question concerning University of Scranton dormitory and University off-campus apartments . Council President asked -- I asked on your behalf to address the situation . They said please thank Mr. Coyne for his question and time and research . The administration would appreciate a 311 request . And if Mr. Coyne feels comfortable doing so, incorporate Mr. Coyne's research . That's the answer I got. Just some highlights of some things that have been going on in the city during the summer, the city continues to support the growth of the small business by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 awarding $660,000 in small business grant recovery and wage boost grants in July using funding from the American Rescue Plan. Throughout the summer the city hosted 12 popup City Halls, with four more schedule in September . Sprucin up Scranton Community Cleanup will be held in October and November . Scranton complete d a successful swim season with three outdoor pools, one indoor pool, Novembrino splash pad being open and available to resident s. The city opened application period for resident s, resident childcare assistance scholarships and childcare serve providers . Wage boost grants using funding from the American Rescue Plan. Available funding totals a million dollars for both residents and providers . The city is accepting request s for stormwater engineering proposal s in Minooka , West Scranton , and North Scranton . The city is nearing the completion of the three playground upgrades at Novembrino , North Scranton mini park, and Conner's park. The city has complet ed surveying and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 citizen 's participation sessions for Nay Aug pool. They will be looking to bring a proposal to Council this fall. City is submitted the 2024 capital budget which we heard about tonight and early August, the city hosted the Mayor's innovation project summer meeting which hosted 35 mayors from around the country and US Senators Casey and Fetterman. And I had a chance to at least attend two of those events while those mayors were in town. And that's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 33, 2022, AN ORDINANCE (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2023 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2023 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET 2023”, AS AMENDED , BY TRANSFERRING $50,000.00 FROM CONTINGENCY ACCOUNT NUMBER 100-45000-000-910-000000 TO OPERATING EXPENDITURES , VETERANS ’ ORGANIZATIONS ACCOUNT NUMBER 100-45000-000-935-000000. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'm going to start off with, Mr. Voldenberg , last week I asked about that Bread Basket NEPA. They were using community center funds. Did we ever get an answer what community center they were operating out of? MR. VOLDENBERG : I did not receive that. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Why I'm saying that is, this budget transfer here is a transfer that's moving money over to cover veterans organization . Council put these funds in a budget a year or two ago to help out with the Marine Corps League and other veterans groups. And I guess the money didn't get allocated to them. And this is a similar situation that's occurring with the community centers. The community centers were allocated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 money that they never received , maybe some of them received pieces of it. But the fund sat around and now they are being distributed as grants. I think at some point, Mr. Voldenberg , I did ask if we reach out to the administration to ask why these funds are being distribute d as grants. So if we could just ask why these funds are being distribute d as grants. It's a different process than I think was -- I really don't understand the grant process . I understand we're trying to get records of what the money is used for. And I would think that would go without saying that these organization s should be able to account for all the money, every dollar, every cent. But why it's being passed out this way, I don't know. And it wasn't being passed out in a timely manner. And that's why we're making this transfer here. MR. MCANDREW : I agree because , you know, from what I remember , they're line items. They're not grants. And now they're awarded as grants and I don't know why. Maybe it looks better for someone or someone else. But these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 are line items that were put into the budget. They are suppose d to be given to these organization s to survive , to keep these neighbor centers open, Keyser Valley, so we need clarification because when you change the name of something , that's always -- there's something there. So if you could find out how it went from a line item to a grant that has to be awarded every year and bunch of hoops, from my understanding , to jump through in paperwork that never existed before. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, and what I'm saying here is, I'm not saying you shouldn 't have to apply for it and account for it. But I don't know why it's being done in the manner it's being done. MR. KING: On the question , is this different than the funding for the veteran 's organizations that you and I helped some of the American Legion and -- MR. SMURL: That funding that we did was in this year's budget. MR. SCHUSTER : So this is reoccurring funds. This was money -- there was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 some improvement s to the Marine Corps League. The money was originally put in to help out the Marine Corps League. It's reoccurring funds that are there for veterans ' organization s. That's why I say we should have to apply. I need a new handicap ramp for the back. I need a new roof on my facility . And the same thing was done with community centers . And what I was saying with this Bread Basket is it's a food bank. And it was community centers expenditures line item that was given out as a grant. MR. KING: Got you. Right. MR. MCANDREW : There was a line item every year but all of a sudden they became grants. MR. KING: Got you. Well, let's try to get those answers. I'll vote for this tonight . But let's try to get some answers. It's in Fifth Order tonight . MR. SCHUSTER : I will as well. I mean, I don't -- with this one, I don't disagree with where the money is going. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR.

MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-F be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , I'm going to make a motion to table this because I was at the Rec Authority meeting last Thursday 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 evening and nobody had any idea what this was for. Nobody discuss ed it with the Rec Authority or anybody . So until they clear this with the Scranton Recreation Authority , I don't think we should move it. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. KING: All right. There's been a motion and it's been seconded to table Item 5-F. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , with this item here, my fellow Council member has some questions on the item. I'm going support his questions . I'm going to get an answer. And I just want to make it stated that when I have some questions on some items that are on our agenda that I get the same support . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , (inaudible ) that they have done already with the Brooks mine and reading through this, it did sound like a great project proposal to add to that restoration and to the Brooks mine and what would be offered there. So I wasn't aware this was coming out of nowhere . So I think that's fine to table and until we get further answers about this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO ANY AND ALL DOCUMENTS NECESSARY TO RELEASE OWNERSHIP OF LAND FORMERLY OWNED BY LEO J. RAFFERTY TO PENNSYLVANIA AMERICAN WATER COMPANY . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this -- I felt like there was a little more information to be had here if Solicitor Gallagher could just take a look into it. It didn't seem like there was a lot of information here. ATTY. GALLAGHER : I looked into it prior. It says that PA American Water acquired it through eminent domain. However , when you look up the docket there is no such order granting that. And the order attached to this legislation is actually an order from Judge Nealon terminating the case. So I don't know if it was ever -- if PA American Water currently owns this through eminent domain. If they do, nothing was filed of record to indicate the same. So I probably wouldn't vote on this just yet until you get a full answer. Obviously the city doesn't want any liability with the property . I understand that. But maybe if you want to pass it and then ask for more or just table it right now. But before you do a final vote, you need to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 an answer on this. MR. SCHUSTER : I would be fine going either way. I don't mind getting it through as long as we get the information before final vote unless somebody would like to -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : Before it's voted on, if it's not -- if they didn't obtain it through eminent domain, then the whole legislation has to be changed because it's inaccurate . MR. KING: Attorney Gallagher , do you think it would be possible for us to get an answer by next Tuesday ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Oh, yeah, I don't see why not. I'm sure the law office probably has -- MR. KING: We'll put it through tonight pending an answer next week by our solicitor . And if the answer isn't what we need, then we could table it. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I mean, I'll even make an offer to table it next week if we don't get the information . MR. KING: Okay. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, I'll either 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 call or put an e-mail into legal tomorrow morning . MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you.
