PERRY: Yeah, yeah, good meeting tonight , lots of things going on, lots of discussion . So let's see if I can get through this rather quickly . So I guess we'll start with the meeting that we had with the mayor about the 2600 block of Birney Avenue, the flooding . Since that was the very first meeting called, we did -- Pat and I did ask some questions that pertained to more of the city than just that intersection because I felt that was only fair. One of the biggest concerns was any kind of FEMA relief that we might get from a the August storms so I talked to a representative from DPW. The good news there is all our forms for the city were submitted in time to the county. The county forms were submitted in time to Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania has submitted in time in like to the federal government and we have met our threshold every step of the way. The county had met their threshold to turn their neighbors into the state. The state 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 met their thresholds to turn it into FEMA. So right now all our work, all our sweat is done on our side, we are just waiting for FEMA's answer. As you can imagine , FEMA has been pretty busy with other floods and hurricanes that have been going on, but right now we have met every quota that we needed to met for disaster relief based on that storm in August and we are just now waiting for the word from FEMA to see are there going to be any funds given out to us. Now, if there is FEMA funds to be had, DPW director insisted that there is going to be an application process and an application class that will be taken care of by DPW. He mention ed something like the fieldhouse down at Weston Park being used. Big area where there will be applications , there will be people to help, everybody get all of their applications filled out correctly and timely. That will happen if FEMA releases money to us. They wanted to make a point of that, but as of right now we are just waiting to hear back from the federal government so our fingers crossed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that there is some kind of relief to us and if there is we will be make everybody well aware of it and we'll have a nice meeting date and time and have a lot of represent atives to help us get the application process filled out for everybody so that was one thing that we discussed . Another thing that is more of a city issue with the flooding was brought up is what happens if my street is flooded ? What happens if on a regular part of the city that's being flooded ? And as the director explained to me, if you live in a newer development that is definitely going to be a single use sewer line so that is definitely a DPW storm drain situation , so your very first phone call will be to DPW. If you don't live in a newer development in the city, which is most of us, that's going be to a DPW responsibility -- or I'm sorry, American -- PA American Water Company responsibility so the first phone call should go there, okay? Now, if you are ensure he said please call DPW if you have any questions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 any kind of issues that you are not readily getting taken care of by Pennsylvania American Water Company. On that, I did talk to Pennsylvania American Water Company, they are willing to step up there, their end of the bargain and to keep track of the areas which are being called in that are known flooding areas within the city and do line cleanings every six weeks or as needed, and I asked them what "or as needed" meant because we don't want to wait to get flooded to have that -- I guess we need that line flushed out because of flooding , we don't want that, we are trying to prevent it. So they are going to do routine inspections every few weeks on issue that we have had to flush out on more than one occasion and if it does need it they will schedule for the next two weeks, I got that reassurance so we will keep a follow-up on that. They promise d a flushing at 2600 of Pittston . I did a follow-up, it was done that same day, so I was glad to see them keep their word on that. We just have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 make sure that they hold their end of the bargain when it comes to other areas of the city that that could help. Now, to the people that live on the 2600 block, these are some issues that we talked about that pertain specifically to that area. We talked about the drain situation , they are going to be out 2600 Pittston every six weeks or more to keep those lines flushed from the sediment that comes down from Kane Street, from down Pittston Avenue, it's just a bill bowl area like it is in most flooding situation s. Instead of doing it when it gets into someone 's yard, they are going to do it every six weeks. The one question was brought up by a resident of increasing the pipe drainage pipe going across Pittston Avenue, and that is not possible , that was explained to me by Mr. Pocius due to the pitch of the road. And, again, it gets kind of technical, but if we increase the size of the drain we would have to lift the drain to get the right amount of pitch so there is not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 backflow and he said the pitch of the road wouldn't support anything larger. He pulled out the old architect plans and building plans to when that was put in and he showed me there was a request for a larger pipe originally , but it was shot down by PennDOT because the pitch of the terrain could not handle that size pipe so that's why there was a smaller pipe put in than original ly planned for. They also, now, they gave no promises , but we started looking up, I guess you could say upstream , for where the process and the program started in the Pennwood area. A lot of that water comes down, it T's off, it goes off Kane Street and that water flows into Pittston Avenue. They couldn't make any promises , but they want to see if there is any way that they could diverge the water coming from there to a different route and then down Sanderson Street. He said that would be a bigger process and he can't make any promises about it, but that would be something they would look at, too, if flooding consistently 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 happens there. So overall I was pleased with the meeting and I'm sure, Mr. Rogan, you have some other notes from the meeting that he could throw into, but that was just the overall thoughts of it and on top of that Mr. King, Mr. Pocius, Director Gallagher , they all give themselves up personally to anybody who has flooding situation s in the city. They said to be called and they will get out there as soon as they could to meet with anybody . As I explained , I don't know if Mr. Srebro -- Lenny, you are still here, Mr. Pocius was out to see you and he said at the end of that meeting , "If Lenny still has an issue or something else going on to give Mr. Pocius a call and he will back out to see you." So please, use that to your advantage to take care of these issues. These guys know the issues are out there and we are tying to take care of them. Moving on, I don't know is Ron here, Mr. Ellman here? I spoke to Mr. Ellman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 earlier this week, we had an issue about a little port-a-potty request . If you want to send something out to Mr. Fallon. Mr. Fallon was busy this week with the demolition at Novembrino Park, finally got started . You know, the Novembrino Park demo started on that so we are hoping that we stay on target. Our goal is to have that working and up and ready by some point during the summer of '19, but the question Mr. Ellman had was the port-a-potty at Weston Park. And I know the city only has a limited amount of them and they get moved depending on venue to venue on what's there and what's not, but if there is one that's freed up, and I don't know how Director Fallon handles it over the wintertime , but they are requesting one stay at Weston Park for as long as possible . So if there is not a need, which there probably isn't in the winter months with little league games and, you know, concerts and events, there is probably not that much going on, if one could be left at Weston Park for the residents there in that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 area, that request is made. And then, also, since it was brought up and it was in the paper about the ten-year tax abatement , Mr. Ellman brought up KOZ. Forget KOZ as far as this side of the dais is concerned . I'm not for KOZs. A KOZ is a total tax abatement . You don't pay city tax, school tax, county tax. You don't pay wage tax, you don't pay tax on your building , your improvements or your property . You don't pay tax on any of it for a set amount of time. That was some of what we did up in Tripp Park, for example . I'm not interested in going that route. I believe a couple of years, I believe it was 2016, this council we talked about trying to put some vigor into our real estate environment with a three-year tax abatement . Now, tax abatement is the only thing you don't pay on is on new construction or improvements to your property , but if you are an existing homeowner that wants to make an addition , build up, build over, put a shed on, you are not going to pay any taxes on that for three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 years. If you're a new commercial business that you want to buy a plot of land on and you want to build a structure on that land to conduct your business we're not going to -- the city isn't going to tax you on that new structure that you brought in to start your business on. You will still pay mercantile tax as a business , you will still pay wage taxes, your employees will stay pay wage taxes and you'll still pay the actual tax on your land that you hold. That's kind of the difference between KOZ and the tax abatement that we agreed on in 2016. The Chamber was in here last week and they brought up a ten-year tax abatement and it will hold true to the same form that we have now which is a three year, it was just extending it out. Maybe that will entice some people to come in here and do some business . Now, while I think it could help on the residential side, maybe get some of these vacant lots that we have used and built up on, I'm really looking at this more of a commercial avenue to maybe get a business in here who is on -- they don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 know want side of the fence to be on. Do we build outside of Scranton , which has been the case for so long or do we move into Scranton . Scranton has got a motivated work force but the taxes are higher than the surrounding communities and that's not -- that's just something we all know. So if we offer them a ten-year construction abatement or improvement abatement maybe that's something that will entice them to come to our city. And that's just in our earliest stage of discussions . We talked about that in caucus last week and we'll discuss that more as time goes on, but it was just an introductory phase from the Chamber to see if there is anything we can do to stimulate some growth in our city. We talked about Mr. Ellman's request , the Novembrino park. Oh, Ms. Schumacher 's request . If we could send out a letter to Chief DeSarno and Chief Graziano to ask -- I guess we could word it, if anyone is arrested and/or convicted or a vehicular crime, are they obligated or mandated to report the incident to their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 superior ? And that is all I have, Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Yeah, briefly . As some may know I'm a member of the Blight Task Force as part of the Blight to Bright Program. In fact, as a representative of city council , I'm the only person from the City of Scranton government that has attended the task force meetings . While there are still two more task force meetings to come, I would like to discuss some of the finding and recommendations to date and how they may impact the city and it's fight against blight. It should be noted that dozens of municipalities across the county have responded to request s for information and to complete surveys relative to important data on blight. City officials as of today still have not responded . I sent another request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 to LIPS today to see if they would provide the information being sought by the organizers , but looking at some findings from the draft report, 14.2 percent of all housing units in Scranton are vacant. There are over 2,283 vacant addresses in Scranton with 52.7 percent of those being vacant longer than 36 months. That is an alarming statistic . An average above 10 percent is an indication of a weak housing market, among other things. So we have a lot of work to do on that issue. We certainly need to begin to document those properties and analyze their cause and effect on our neighbor hoods. Also, of all of housing units in Scranton , the percentage of renter occupied units are 49.1 percent which, of course, calculates the owner occupied units at 50.9 percent . The national average for homeownership is 62.9 percent . It's generally understood that when owner occupied units dip below 50 percent it is a sign that the conditions that lead to blight are going to be more pervasive and more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 prevalent . We absolutely must find a way to do a better job, increase homeowner ship if we are going to be a healthy , thriving city in the future. If the percentage of homeownership continues to decline in Scranton and we do not reverse that trend, we will never have the stable neighbor hoods that we want with the stable financial condition that the city must have to reverse this current way of blight. So some of the solutions that we talked about to date are, of course, the quality of life tickets which have been roundly conversed on, I should say. While Scranton has a quality of life ticketing program , across the state similar programs are administered quite differently than ours. Most have first offense fines ranging from $10 to $25. Their success rates in getting problems resolve d at the ticketing stage is high. In fact, in one example Cole Township in Northumberland County, approximately 9 percent of code violators resolve the issue after a warning or after the first ticket is issued. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Additional ly, the issuance of tickets is limited strictly to quality of life issues only. Most have ten to 15 different items on the ticket as part of the program. In Scranton , our tickets range from $100 to $1,000 and we have 29 different items on our ticket. The collection rate is somewhere in the range of 25 to 35 percent , but it's been difficult to determine that because I have not been able to get the information from the administration through LIPS in a spreadsheet format that makes any sense, so my point is that our quality of life ticketing program has to be completely reviewed and if necessary overhauled and I fully expect that to happen. Another thing the city could do is work with the Tax Claim Bureau and decertify buyers at tax sales that have outstanding delinquent taxes, code violations and municipal liens. State laws allow municipalities to challenge a successful bidder within 20 days after the sale, so that's something we could do very easily. Another blight strategy is the appointment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 of a property conservator ship. This allows municipalities to file a petition within the Court of Common Pleas to be appointed the conservator of a property for the purposes of making repairs to address code violations that the existing owner either refuses to do or the owner is unable to be reached or be found. That was approved by state law in 2008 as part of the abandoned and Blighted Property Conservatorship Act. If the Court's grant the petition , the conservator proceeds with the work and the owner has the opportunity to reimburse the conservator for the work completed . If the owner does not do so, the Court may authorize the conservator to sell the property to recoup it's costs. This tool is intended to deal with blight and abandon properties that have been in that condition for a long, long period of time. It not only saves the city costs by eliminating the time spent by trying to get the owner to comply, but it also could save a home or a property from an unnecessary demolition as well as getting the property up to code and finally , if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 necessary , it could force the sale to a new homeowner or better investor . So that is some current information from the Blight Task Force. There are several other remedies that are being discussed , including my ongoing plan for a complete review of the city's condemnation and demolition policies . My expectation is have a final report based on those recommendations from of the Blight Task Force to city council for review by the end of the year or beginning of 2019. At that point, I would ask or expect city council to engage the administration to discuss our recommendations and findings and to begin implementing solutions soon thereafter . And that is all I have for this evening . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I have a few, thank you very much. Mrs. Schumacher asked a few weeks ago for a list of equipment used for storm water management throughout the city and we did receive a letter today from the administration so I can give you a copy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 of that, and there are -- I won't go through all of them, but there are eight pieces of equipment that they use for storm water management so that is the list and I will get that to you. Also, we have one bid that has been received for the Crowley Park improvement project and that was by Chilewski Enterprises for $308,798.88 so that's for the Crowley Park Improvement project in Greenridge . Mrs. Reed, if we can ask the administration for an update on any money that has been spent at the Serrenti Center and just an overall progress update I would appreciate that. Also, I'd like to announce that Councilman Donahue and I are holding an idea session Wednesday , November 7, at 6:00 p.m. here in council chambers and it will be televised by ECTV and this idea session is going to be with local high school students and our local colleges . We are trying to engage our younger community , listen to their ideas. Councilman Evans and I met 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 with the University of Scranton student government club a few weeks ago and they were very excited about the chance to participate in this idea session , so the overall goal of this is to tap into our youth, the youth that we have here in the city and to try to get them move involved in local government , so we did send out an invitation to all of the local universities and colleges and high schools and hopefully we get some good participation on that. Also, we will have the budget on our agenda November 19, and since I have been here I think we've only had the business administrator show up to give his presentation . I do think this year especially in the caucus that we had before the meeting , there is a lot of different moving parts with this budget, especially with agenda item 5-D, so I think it would be helpful if the mayor, business administrator and his cabinet members could attend the public caucus so that we could have a conversation with them when we do have the budget on our agenda. I think that be very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 helpful and I'm hopeful that my colleagues would agree and we could ask them to do that. I also have a question , Mrs. Reed, there was a transfer , I believe I brought this up two or three weeks ago, to the IT Department from the Workers' Comp Trust Fund for somewhere in the area of $350,000. I would like to find out, and I didn't get a chance to ask tonight Mr. Bulzoni why -- if there should have been legislation for that transfer because we did pass legislation when we transferred money from the workers' Comp Trust Fund into the Tree Shade Commission so I'm wondering why there wasn't legislation for the transfer from that fund to the IT Department . Also, as Mrs. Hodowanitz correctly pointed out, we did receive the audit so I'm still reviewing that and it will be in Third Order on our agenda next week so it will be included in the backup online if anybody wants to take a look at it. Also, Mrs. Jefferies brought up two points. Mrs. Reed, if we could ask for an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 update from the administration on the street sign project that's related to legislation we passed quite a few weeks ago so I think it will helpful for an update on that. And then an update on the tree house. I remember we received some kind of update from Mr. Fallon, I'll go back through my records and see what we have, but if I can't find that we will ask him for an additional update. The only other thing that I have is, you know, I appreciate Mr. Perry's answers tonight to questions that were asked regarding flooding and the reimbursement method from the flood that we had in August. Apparently , a meeting was held with Mr. Perry and Mr. Rogan and members of the administration and that's great, but I do think that because the flooding affects all citizens throughout Scranton and each different part of the city this meeting should have been held in public in a public caucus with all council members especially because of the nature of the issue not behind closed doors, and I'm not sure what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 everyone is afraid of, why everyone is afraid to speak out on this issue. Again, I mentioned it last week. I had asked questions and put them in writing on multiple occasions about the reimbursement method, but never received an response and I would like to ask my colleagues what is point of being on a committee ? I'm Chairperson of the Committee on Public Works. What's the point of me being on that committee if I can't get answers to any of the questions and if there is a meeting that's held and I'm not even invited to it and I have been bringing these issues up for the last few months? So, again, I don't agree with the way it was done and I wish that the administration would be more open and more transparent especially with these important issues that are facing all of residents of the city, and that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. A number of items to hit on. Regarding the borrowing for the pension , a question was asked whether this money is the same as the money 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 that is set aside and I think Councilman Evans and myself at the exact time said yes and no. In the purest form this legislation does not touch that money. That money will continue to be set aside and earning interest for the city garage. On the other hand, you put two and two together pretty quickly that the dollar amounts match up. What this instrument allows us to do is get that money into the pension fund quicker than if we just wrote a check because there are other items that are still outstanding . This allows us to get it in there to allow it to grow. It really is a good time right now, there has been a little pullback, so that's definitely part of it as well. It is, and when Mrs. Reed reads it, it is a very lengthy piece of legislation but I appreciate the caucus that we had today because I know I have a much better understanding of the inner workings of the legislation , and I know it is the administrations goal to pay off that note much quicker than planned but personally I feel if you could borrow at a net of really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 2 1/2, 3 percent interest and earn seven you are well ahead of the game. I looked at it, obviously , a little bit differently than our panelist did because when I asked that question they kind of got silent for a second, so regarding the borrowing the legal answer I guess is no, it is not -- one does not have to do with the other but the practical answer is yes. That's why the numbers do match up. A resident mentioned the park downtown listing it for sale and I agree, I made the same comments . I did vote for this legislation very reluctantly and part of the reasoning why we were told that mitigation of the hazardous materials to construct the park would be less costly and wouldn't be as involved as mitigating to build a new residential -- or a new commercial or residential building . I tend to agree that that property I would much prefer it to see it be redeveloped than turned into a park. It's prime downtown real estate, and I know Councilman Evans has brought up that it was listed a number of times and he is correct , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 but it certainly doesn't hurt to throw it on the market for a month and see what type of funds the city can bring in and, you know, whatever money that was brought in could be used in other parks in other parts of our neighbor hoods to spruce them up and we would grow our tax base by a large development in the downtown . I do agree that large development projects have not been happening , and that's why I agree with Councilman Perry's remarks regarding expanding our LERTA from three years to ten years and I do echo his comments that it is not even similar to a KOZ as far as the structure . Under the KOZ system, you did not pay a dime in taxes. You don't pay on your land, your improvements , you don't pay wage tax to the city or school district , you don't pay wage tax to the state. Under a LERTA, you still pay all of those taxes with the exception of the improvement that you have made on the property as part of that deal so it is a much, much more watered down version of the KOZ. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 That being said, if there was a large developer that approached us for KOZ I wouldn't be closed to it. I think I'm maybe the outlier on this issue, but the Tripps Park development was a huge success . If you go through their now it's generating tons and tons of tax revenue to the city and without question if it wasn't for that program , it never would have been built. It still would have been abandoned coal mine land. So I'm not advocating going that far for individual projects , but I do think the Chamber's proposal is spot on for what we need to do. Regarding the storm water issues, Mr. Perry summed them up pretty well. Just a couple of things I did want to mention that I took away from the meeting is -- and everyone who watches knows I have been critical of the DPW through the years, but on this issue they are doing a lot more than we see on a daily basis. I know from myself I was not aware that the DPW was in the Keyser Valley as many times as they were. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 was not aware that tons of millings were put in the alley by Mr. Srebro and others to try and correct some of the problems that were going on. Certainly not a long-term fix, but these are things that we were not aware of. Thinking long-term, I am encouraged with the fact that they listened to some of Mr. Besko's suggestions . I think all of the neighbors I talked to in the area seem to say they are expert on that area. He seems to know the lay of the land better than anyone else so I do think that's something that, you know, I'm anxious to see if that could work and it sounds like from talking to some people that it definitely can work. Regarding the FEMA and PEMA, Mr. Perry already hit up on that and we are going to -- Mrs. Reed, if we can send a letter to PennDOT asking for regular street sweeping on all state roads, particularly Pittston Avenue in Minooka , it was brought up that with the state roads, and it's very complicated because the state is responsible just for the surface , we are responsible for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 everything under the surface . The water can be our responsibility or the water company so there is a lot of different aspects that come into play here, but that is one thing that if we could get a little cooperation from PennDOT , and not to say the city needs to do a better job of street sweeping also on our roads, but that's one thing if we could send that to PennDOT . As Mr. Perry mention ed, depending on if you are in an older or newer part of the city it will depend on whose responsibility it is and DPW is your best first call if you don't know. When you have lingering issues like many do you become familiar with some of the people. And the point was brought up at our meeting , and I wasn't going to mention it, but I do think it needs to be said. Unfortunately , water issues have come to the forefront this year and this is the worst summer and fall that we have ever had at least into my lifetime as far as rain goes. The ground is just so saturated. I still have grass growing in my backyard and it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 almost November . Most years by August the grass is it so burnt you can't even cut it anymore . That just shows how much rain we have been getting on a daily basis. The ground has not had a chance to dry out and every time we get an inch the rain now it's causing issues where in the past if you had, you know, a regular summer the ground would absorb much of that, so that's something to keep in mind as well. Hopefully we do get a little stretch of the dry weather here, but that's something that I do feel that did need to be said. Finally, I know Mr. Perry brought this up as well and I was, unfortunate ly -- I wasn't able to make it over to the ceremony for the groundbreaking on the Novembrino splash pad. This is something that is extremely long overdue. I hope I never have to mention this project again other than the Novembrino splash pad is completed . I have lived in West Side my whole life. I know that park. I swam in that park when I was a kid. It's a shame that it was gone to such disrepair that it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 has to be demolished and rebuilt , but that being said I am happy that is being rebuilt and for younger kids nowadays it seems like splash pads are actually more popular than pools. It's easier to maintain for the city, it's easier to have for safety for lifeguards, so this is something I am very, very fortunate that it's happened and we are very fortunate as a city we are finally able to get many of these projects that were done that were lingering for far, far too long. So that is all. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

As I mention ed in the caucus there is a lot of moving parts to this deal and, you know, I know that I'm going to have follow-up questions on this over the next two weeks. I know that in speaking to the members that came tonight the Pension Boards are going to play a part in whether this whole deal gets approved . They have to approve some things. There is going to be legislation that comes back to council where we will have to approve an amendment to the trust fund apparently . The other thing, and it was discussed in the caucus and it was one of my concerns , and it has been one of my concerns over the last couple of the months and the last few years, is with the lawsuit that questions the legality of the whole sale kind of hanging over our heads. Should we lose the lawsuit , taxpayers are going to be on the hook for, you know, all of this money, so I'm concerned about that and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 whether we are playing with fire here, but I'm going to vote to introduce this and have more questions next week.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question . I'm not completely sold either on the idea of a pocket park at this property , but either/or the remediation has to be done so that's why I am voting for this legislation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. ROGAN: I agree with Councilman Donahue , and to follow-up on the point I made, and I think one of the speakers made a really good point on this, it has to be remediated either way. It's been listed for sale and it wouldn't sell with it being contaminated , which if you are a real estate developer buying contaminated land is a little bit of a gamble, but I feel very strongly that this land should be listed. If it's permissible I would even agree to list it myself free of charge through the real estate company that I work for it the city wanted to take me up on. MR. PERRY: Conflict of interest . MR. ROGAN: What was that? MR. PERRY: Conflict of interest . MR. ROGAN: Free of charge. MR. PERRY: Nothing is free. MR. ROGAN: It certainly is something that I think the city should explore but as Councilman Donahue mentioned the remediation needs to be done one way or the other, so I do support this legislation . MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 the pocket park was always Plan B that was just something -- I remember when Mr. Bulzoni proposed that to council we had this land, it couldn't be developed , it needed remediation and, you know, what are we going to do with it? And so I believe at the time there was county and state funding for the park, which would be no cost to the city to turn it into a park, so I think and, again, I'm going back about a year or so, he said our choices was to leave it as a brown space as it is now or apply for the grants through the county and through the state simultaneously and use that to build our pocket park. The green space would be a lot better than the brown space, but Plan A was always develop the land. It just was just so far long that no one wanted to develop it, but if someone wants to step in in the 11th hour and develop that land I'm all for it because that tax dollars are what it's at in the City of Scranton and we'll take all we can get when it gets to new tax revenue . So let's develop it. If we can't, you know, I think Plan B still should be the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 pocket park. MR. EVANS: On the question , I don't know if there is restriction s based on the grants that have already been approved for this. We have a grant for the park, obviously , there's a grant for the remediation , I think that might be something down the road. I do know that the parcel was exposed to the market for almost ten years and there was no takers on it. Of course, there was the issue with the remediation involved with that, but I'm not -- I'm actually for the packet park, I think it's a good idea. However , if somebody came in after that pocket park was built and they want would to reimburse us for the cost of what we spent on the land we'll move the pocket park somewhere else, but I don't expect that to happen. We have quite a few large parcels downtown that I'd like to see developed probably even before this one, one being across the street that's probably the biggest single parcel in downtown Scranton and it's gone undeveloped and it's parking lot probably for 20 years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 now, so we need to really concentrate on those large parcels . There is a small corner lot. I think what we have in place is a reasonable plan and we'll see where it goes. MR. ROGAN: And just not to be a beat a dead horse, but just regarding approving these grants, as Councilman Evans kind of alluded to, if somebody comes in at the 11th hour and wants to buy it the city could always turn down these funds and if somebody would come in and offer to develop that property . If the options are keep it as it is or put a park in, of course, I would want the park but I would want much like to see that land developed . Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR.

PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . Ms. Hodowanitz , you had asked the question last week or the week before about this legislation and we did get an answer from Linda Aebli. She said that their budget says $345,405.25, but the way the LS grant work they cannot include cents, so she reduced the amount to $345,405 even. In the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 narrative and support letter it says, "356,376" because in September that was the amount they were looking to receive but the $10,971 was work that was currently underway and it had to be taken out of the application , so I hope that answers your question but that's the reason that there was the difference between the two figures .

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. EVANS: As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-E. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . This is a really great project , and we have talked about Neighbor works here many times 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 over the last few years, but they really are the unsung heroes in the City of Scranton . They don't always get the recognition they deserve and people often don't know all of the work that really goes on there so, you know, the work that they do to help people in the city is unbelievable and I hope they get this grant and best of luck to them. MR. EVANS: Yes, on the question . I would absolutely second that. The work they have done for us as our partner in the SHAP program , which is the Scranton Homeowners Assistance Program has been phenomenal with 27 homeowners getting -- first time homebuyers getting grants to fix out of the outside of their homes has just been a wildly successful program and we are actually talking to them again about another potential project that they can help us with, so kudos to them and this is a great project to rehab their home over on Smith Street so good luck. MR.
