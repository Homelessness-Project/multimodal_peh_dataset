Partoftheproblem wehavewiththe budget though iswhatever wepassisgoing tohavebeapproved bythePennsylvania Economy League.ThePennsylvania Economy League isgoingtoevaluate thebudget in termsoftherecovery plansowedohaveto staywithin theparameters oftherecovery plan,butIalsolooked atthebudget asa planforwhatwearegoingtodonextyear andIthinkthat'swherewehaveto concentrate ourefforts .Thebudget iswhat weplantodoandwhatwehavetolookatis doingwhatwesaywearegoingtodo.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Wemakealotofcommitmentsto collect certain feesandsometimes that's notdone.Wemakealotofcommitmentsto docertain inspections andthatdoesn'tget done.Wemakealotofcommitmentsto provide different services .Ithinkwhatwe havetomakesureisthemoneythatwebring iniswedeliver ontheservices thatwere promised ,andIthinkthat'sjustas important ascontrolling thetaxincrease . Thisisthelastbudget that Mr.Bulzoni isgoingtoprepare forthe city.Imyself amgoingtomiss Mr.Bulzoni .IthinkMr.Bulzoni hasraised thebarwithin ourcity.Different people thatIhavespoken tooutside ofthecityin thefinancial communities trulyrespect the workthatMr.Bulzoni hasdone.Hehas bought credibility andrespectability back tocitygovernment . OneoftheideasthatImayhave, andIdon'tifanybody thatshares this,I thinkwepenalize ourselves whenwehirean administrative person oracabinet whois notpermanent employee ofthecity.Ithink1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 wepenalize themwhenwerestrict theamount oftimethattheycanservethecity. Mr.Bulzoni asgranted anextension ,he agreed topaythewagetax,whichIcommend himfor,andIwouldmakethatarequirement ofanybody elseinthatposition ,butI thinkactually thattheoriginal period that aperson should beallowed toworkinthe cabinet should betwoyears.Thatallows themtogettheirworkstartedandcomplete d it,andIalsowouldthinkthatperhaps another two-yearwaiver wouldalsobe permissible foraperson ofMr.Bulzoni 's stature .Thatwouldallowthisperson to workforthemayorforafulltermbecause thesearepermanent employees .Theyare cabinet employees .Theyarepeople that serveatthepleasure ofthemayor,andI thinkiftheymakeconcessions topaythe citywagetaxIthinkforsomeone ofhigh stature Ithinkwepenalize ourselves for having thatbearestriction .
