And that's going to be from 1 to 4 p.m. at the Post Ice Cream Shop where you could order those banners . If you are ordering it for someone , then you need to provide their full name, rank, military branch and if you have a printed photo available . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Yes, a while back we received a donation from James Kuchwara for a flagpole for Nay Aug Park. The flagpole has been erected . And there's a bench there now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 and some rock and stone and stuff put around there. So on this Saturday , October 14th at 1 p.m., there is going to be a memorial service honoring James Kuchwara and all of our military . That is this Saturday at 1 p.m. It is open to the public. That's all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? I'd like to announce that the Scranton DPW Workers Union will be having a Truck or Treat event. It's Sunday, October 29th from 3 to 6. It's at the Scranton DPW parking lot on Poplar Street. There will be trucks and heavy equipment on display , candy, live DJ, decorations , family fun. This is their second. Last year it was their first and it was -- they did a fantastic job. My grandson had a blast. So he's already looking forward to this. And that is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Chris Fadden? No, okay. Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Scranton . First, I would like to compliment the city workers , DPW, police, and firefighters for the running of the Steamtown Marathon . I think they did an exceptional job considering the weather was a little against them but it was well done. Speaking of firefighters , their contract was settled 189 days ago. Why isn't it on the website? The 120-day period for, you know, crossing the I's -- dotting the I's and crossing the T's is long over. MR. MCANDREW : We don't have an answer. I inquired myself. Mr. Voldenberg , would you circle around and inquire again? Do you have an update that we haven't received yet? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, I'll follow up with the Law Department and they could follow up with labor counsel . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : I mean, if we're still paying Mr. Ufberg, can we get one page a day or something or whatever ? Also on the City's website the delinquent refuse fee database which was suppose d to be updated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 quarterly was last updated on May 31st. That means it should have been updated by August 31st. That's behind. And any news on the audit? MR. MCANDREW : Just what we reported out last week. Mr. Voldenberg , did we get anything else? MS. HODOWANITZ : If you let me know when the Sewer Authority 's meeting, when and where, I'll go down there and put the fear of God in them because I could do that. MR. VOLDENBERG : They are going to call an emergency meeting and I will advise Council and Miss Hodowanitz . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. Item 3-E, the Payroll Preparation Tax, I was looking at the numbers . And I understand that the collections come after the fact of the quarters and everything . But in 2022 they collect ed something like two and a half million dollars . And so far we've collected about one million . Are we really on track and it's just a -- just a lag in the payments ? MR. MCANDREW : We can inquire about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 that also. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I suspect that's what it might be. But this is now the second full year. So it should be coming routine . So the numbers should be looking I think a little better than this. 5-D, the high fidelity audio visual services , I saw two numbers quoted, the one on the city's paperwork which said is $23,389. And Mr. Borwick 's paperwork says $24,599.84. Did we kind of argue them down or which is the correct number? MR. MCANDREW : We can inquire about that too, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : For clarity 's sake. MS. HODOWANITZ : And 7-B, the mental health mobile app for the firefighters , anything that contributes to the health and welfare of city employees I'm all in favor. But I have a couple questions . One, if this is good enough for the firefighters , wouldn't we also want it for the police? They are exposed to trauma. I understand the rational e was, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 know, that sometimes , you know, city employees are so busy and they can't come forward and get the help they need and this would help. But it seems to me that that argument would also apply to the police department who would be exposed to trauma. But the one concern I was having, not so much the money that you were discussing in caucus the $18,000 and $5 a month, $60 a year whether it's used or not, that seemed a little dorky to me that if nobody used it and we still had to pay $18,000. What I would not want to see is that they use this mobile app when they really need more professional help and they fall under the radar. I think, you know, it's a good supplement -- a supplementary approach , but it should not be a substitute for the professional help they may need. And I wouldn't want them to, you know, get second rate care, that kind of thing. And also, I'm still going to push for legislation to make the flood victims tax exempt for the property taxes. Commissioner Chermak agrees at the county level. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Next up, Mr. Mike Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , for the two of you I've yet to meet, my name is Mike Mancini . I'm a resident of the City of Scranton . Good evening , Councilman McAndrew . Good evening , Councilman Schuster . As the -- as we turn into the future, we have a railway system that is going to be coming through here in the not so distant future. So transparency is very important with this body. I want to talk to you this evening . I want to know where everybody stands because the election is right around the corner. I want to talk to you about the sale of the Scranton Parking Authority , Scranton Sewer Authority . Both of those were sold by a former mayor who is incarcerated . He said everything was above board. He said everything was correct and he in turn disrupted things. He sold the biggest asset that the City of Scranton had for 195 million dollars . 3.1 million dollars went to several attorneys , 50 of them, 50 of them. 1.5 percent of that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 closing went towards attorneys . Let me tell you something , as a city solicitor the question should have gone to the Solicitor Shrive. And from there all you would do is question the title company and it's buyer be ware. It was up to the water company to either take the proposal or not take the proposal . Limerick Township , Montgomery County sold the same type of sewer system that we had for 71.1 million dollars . Two law firms, $200,000, okay. Three days before closing on the Sewer Authority , they received a settlement statement . He did not notify this Council , did not notify the taxpayer s and the citizens of City of Scranton , did not notify the Scranton Times or other types of news sources , kept it all private . Now he's incarcerated . And it's a kick in the teeth knowing that I was the one that had the City of Scranton , Lackawanna County place delinquent taxes for collection , okay, to be on the take for something like that is going beyond good taste and reason both. All you have to do this evening is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 send a letter to the Mayor requesting the audit of the Sewer Authority and the Parking Authority and let me tell you why. Five minutes in front of the former Mayor at his town hall meeting back in May of 2017, there was some simple questions to him. He closed the Parking Authority and the Sewer Authority through the same law firm in Philadelphia that put 3,500 into his account for his reelection . It's a proven fact. He said it himself , okay? He was on the take. He's in jail. And I'm asking this body today, each and every one of you, transparency is very important in our government . Do the right thing this evening . There were people that sat here before you. Gary DiBileo , Commerford , Pocius, Mike Melnick and Bob McGoff who actually determined their own future based upon what the citizens voted them into office for. They drew their own conclusions and they looked out for the citizens in the City of Scranton . I grew up in the city on West Elm Street next to a gentleman by the name of Jim Decker. He had horses. He had horses. We had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 horses in the city at one time. And he used to bring us up and down the alley every single weekend . It's a lot different now. All right, we deserve better. We're as good as we surround ourselves with. So I'm asking this body this evening to send a letter to the Mayor requesting the audit of the city Parking Authority and the city Sewer Authority . The Mayor snuck the Parking Authority through just to see if he could get the Sewer Authority through . Guess what, he accomplished this before everybody 's eyes. And he did it on the take and it's shameful. I'm a citizen of the City of Scranton . I love the city. And it's up to you guys to show your love for it too. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Mancini. Mr. Bob Bolus is next. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . First off, I would start off I'd like to see the city expedite the flood relief to the people that are damaged in this city without any reservations and playing games or waiting for this or waiting for that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 They deserve immediate response without waiting for legislation or this or that to get the job done. The other part is as I brought up, we have the disinfectant wipes at Weston Field are on one of my Bolus trailer s. And they're also at the fire department in Clarks Summit. The trailer is open in Weston Field. Help yourself but don't be greedy. Don't try taking them all and selling them to anybody . Take what you need to use or help your neighbor and give them the wipes that are necessary for them. I'd like to see let's restore the ambulance from the city back again. There is a tremendous amount of money to be made. They support themselves. It would be an asset back into this city. We used to have the fire ambulance here many, many years ago. These hospital s are all making a ton of money on it. We should share in it and put the ambulance back. We have excellent people here that could do the same job they are to get our people to the hospitals . The other thing is, I'd like to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 the Bill Gaughan mud pond up at Nay Aug cleaned out and engineering done the right way by test pouring around putting dye in and find out where the dye leaks into the holes and seal it with Gunite and put the pool back the way it should have been without spending all of these million s and millions of dollars and filling people's pockets for no darn reason. I'd like to see the change of Bill Gaughan 's Biden Street back to Spruce Street. As you could see what we're getting right now the negative worldwide with Joe Biden running the country . And what's really concerning me is he's going to put us in world war three. You know, the weapons that went to Ukraine , bullets , airplanes , tanks, remember , they're American made. So if you get shot over there, you're getting shot with an American bullet, it doesn't mean a damn difference what uniform is shooting you. And we have no business doing what we're doing. Now we're into other problems as we see in Israel. And what I would request tonight out front we fly two flags. Israeli flag and the Ukraine flag. We took another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 group's flag and flew it for a month. We need to honor those who are being butcher ed and murdered right now for no darn reason and we got to show our support who we are as Americans for what's happening over there. Okay, the other thing is, why are we allowing our country to keep doing what we're doing? We're in harm's way right now. We're already backing up Ukraine against Russia. We got North Korea to deal with next and China. Where are we going to get hit next? And that's where Joe Biden's taking us. And people have to open up their eyes. I've spent a lot of time in the Middle East. I know the country very well. I know the people very well. And these butchers and savages that are there right now can give a damn less about life. Nothing scares them. They could care less. You could put a gun to their head and they'll go, go shoot me. They don't care. We got to start taking our are people and take it seriously . But to honor those that have been murdered and butcher ed, I'd like to see those flags flying out there until this conflict is over.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 We owe it to them. We owe it to our citizens in this city that made what we're doing. And you guys are the ones that could get it done. But let's change Biden Street back to Spruce Street and take Biden's name off because we didn't agree to it. Bill Gaughan and rest of them decided that should happen. We didn't have a moratorium . We didn't have a referendum to put it on. We didn't get the right to vote. And I sure in hell don't care for -- to see Gaughan -- not Gaughan but Joe Biden doing what he's doing and keep talking about us in Scranton . We don't support him. I don't and a lot of other people didn't. Give us our rights back. Put it on a referendum this November and let us vote whether we want it on that street again. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. Next up, Mark Scarinci . MR. SCARINCI : Good evening , Council . All right. So, I'd like you to really look at this picture and then I can describe what my feeling s are. May I give it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to the bailiff and he could give it to you? MR. MCANDREW : You could bring them up, sir. MR. SCARINCI : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Sure. MR. SCARINCI : So I live on Mulberry Street. And I got there last May. And what it is, is that that gate is too close to the street. And when it's too close to the street, what happens is that there is that alarm. And that alarm goes up when the gate is up. And it will not stop until that gate comes down. And it just goes on and on and on, Council , on and on and on. So it's very annoying , Council , very annoying . So I'm asking you, do you think you could put that gate back 10 feet or 12 feet like it is on Linden Street? Whoever did it on Linden Street did it good. The contractor in his infinite wisdom on Mulberry Street put it too close to the sidewalk . We cannot sleep, Council . Let me tell you something . Those windows in that Mulberry Tower are like 49 years old. The other day it was 38 degrees . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 You could feel the air coming through the window. You could feel the air. You could feel the sound waves coming through that. And then you got that building on one side and the building on the other and it magnifies that sound. You wish you could put some sound clouds or something . So I wrote something on there. If it's too much money to move that gate back like on Linden Street, can we at least disable the alarm for five seconds after the gate is up because half of the time people are with their headphones and with their earbuds, they don't hear that alarm. You know who hears that alarm? Mulberry Towers hears the alarm. There are people just waiting to die over there like me. And we just want some peace and quiet in our last days on earth. So I'm asking you, Council , do you think you could do something with that alarm so that we could rest comfortably until we have our final breath? That's it, Council . Thank you for your time. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , would you inquire -- I don't know if that alarm is part of any code or anything 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 like that, but have them take a look at that or inquire . Okay. Thank you. Okay. That exhausts our list, but I'm sure there is more people that would like to speak, so whoever would like to come up next. MR. COYNE: I guess it's me tonight . Tom Coyne, Minooka . Unfortunately our gentleman from Keyser Avenue isn't here tonight , the one who was asking about sandbags because I had in my garage -- these are fillable. They are almost like the water fillable tubes that are used for holding down pool covers. I bought a number of them beforehand because of runoff issues near my house was jumping over the curb. You fill them up with water and put them down. And when the water hits them, it hits up against the water barrier with plastic and just flows along. So I was hoping he was here so I could have given him those because I'm not sure that he's gotten those sandbags that he needed yet. And I hoped that he would be here or comes next week so I could give them to him so that maybe next time this happens he could at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 least put something out there to protect the house. Now, for the pump house delays and debates on keeping the water out, we have heard about all the arguments about how much it's going to take to change it, to update it, to make it functional , to have engineers in there, how much we need to review it. And keeping the water out is kind of simple. There is evidence of early versions of the diving bell in fourth century BC by the Greek philosopher Aristotle . The first design for the diving bell was in 16 century though Halley who is the -- of Halley's Comet designed and construct ed one functionally in late 17th century . That diving bell was constructed in 1691. It seems if we could make a structure in 1691 that uses air to keep water from flowing up and flooding out a building that the science of 1691 can be duplicated and implemented here to keep it from repeatedly happening again. I understand moving electrical up to the roof or up top may be a problem . But if we could use air and water to keep it from ever 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 getting to that electric and putting an air pump on the roof with power to it, that solves the issue while we figure out in 20 or 25 years how we might actually fix that pump house. Talking about corruption and things that get done in the back room, is it possible to get an update on the OECD Director who was driving under a suspend ed license and pled guilty to that? I understand it's a city employee . I'm not sure whether or not they were driving a city car. But driving under a suspended license for a director of the City of Scranton is something that should be at least addressed because it's not ethical to decide that I'm going to go back and forth to work with a suspended -- knowingly with a suspended license . Last week -- and this has happened beforehand because we all remember the gas cards and not being reported and being hidden and going on trips to New Jersey and putting them on gas cards on vehicles . There's a placebo of saying that it's for safety and not doxing of employee s that we can't give out the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 information of city cars that are owned and purchase d by the city to the people because they may actually watch what city employees are doing. Well, maybe after they drive with suspend ed licenses and they're using personal vehicles as their own play toys, there's a legitimate reason to watch what they're doing with these vehicles . Do we have any word on the pilots yet that are requested ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I'll report out in fifth. MR. COYNE: Okay. We're going to have a list of that provide d so that we could see all the names that it's been mailed out to? MR. MCANDREW : I have the list. But I'm request ing or I did earlier to put it in third order for next week so you could all look at it. MR. COYNE: For Eighth Order it was the overtime was introduced on June 6th of 2023. It's been 127 days since the overtime report has sat on Eighth Order for continuing input. Are we ever going to have input on this? And if not, what was the stumbling block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 that stopped the process in the first place? I understand it was supposedly an executive order because they needed more time. But 127 days is enough time to figure it out. Do we know why? MR. MCANDREW : I do not. I was in favor of it so -- MR. COYNE: I understand that. MR. SCHUSTER : I was also in favor of it. I don't think we're going to be getting an answer. And I haven't been really waiting for that answer because I don't think it's coming. MR. COYNE: I expect it will die at the end of the year, but thank you very much. DR. ROTHCHILD : But we could request an update on that. And Councilman King had previously given an update on it last month on when we had come back from break that they are in the process of getting a company to be able to obtain the data. MR. COYNE: They've been in the process for 127 days and figuring out why they don't want reportable overtime for employee s and why they are doing it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 DR. ROTHCHILD : I understand . I agree. I would like to see it done. MR. COYNE: I think 127 days is more than enough time for the Mayor's office to figure out a question . DR. ROTHCHILD : Once again, I'll request an update for it. MR. COYNE: Thanks. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Would anyone else like to speak? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , Rick Little from Scranton . There needs to be some figuring out of the judicial branch of the government as it applies -- well, certainly federally ; but state, county, and city. And I've been spending a lot of time trying to figure out the Lackawanna County judiciary . And I go to the magistrate court twice to get eviction just summary eviction , and then it goes up to the Court of Common Pleas. And I've done all the due diligence I can. Even the magistrate court over here on Washington , Judge Alyce Hailstone Farrell 's court says it's a court of no record. And then I go in front of Judge 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Moyle in the Lackawanna Court and she's holding up a piece of paper which is the complaint and the judgment , yeah, that's a record. What we need is a record of how many people go through that court. I think it's hundreds , if not thousands . I've court watched all the -- all I was allowed to do in all the cases one day with Scranton Housing Authority versus, you know, a tenant there with the same bad legal representation . They act like there's legal representation from Lackawanna Pro Bono and Northeast Penn Legal. Anyway, it's not adequate . Most of these people are, you know, as old as I am, 70, 80. And I know many of them. They're down by the river. I think a basic conflict of interest in my looking into it is the legal representation for City Council , Mr. Gallagher , here. But his father is the legal representation for the Board of Commissioners , same law firm at 416 Jefferson Avenue. And I have been trying to get onto the Board of Commissioners for a long time because there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 really no tenant represent ative even though Karl Lynott says there is with this guy Dave. I never heard anything about any tenant person. But they're just evicting people all the time. And I go to the clerk's office, the Lackawanna Clerk and they say, oh, you should go see Matt Cartwright . So it's just moving things around, moving people around. And it's also a big conflict of interest I think that Karl Lynott the new Executive Director of Scranton Housing Authority , he works also at the -- for 14 years at the Lackawanna County District Attorney 's Office and the same with the prosecuting attorney who I walk into this court, David Coyne. He's worked there 12 years. And it's just an atmosphere of fear and you're going to be evicted for this. You know, we don't need permission to come into your apartment . And none of those people know how to -- I don't even know how to -- and I had a lot of legal experience . There has to be a rep, a true tenant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 rep on the Board of Commissioners . And because they had no right to go to that court in the first place, federal rules under 24 CFR SHA as a HUD landlord, they have a duty to prevent homelessness . They have a duty to seek funding for people that can't pay their rent. And all the stuff that I've witness ed under the American Rescue Act, a subset of that ERAP, Emergency Rental Assistant -- it was put in charge of the Area Agency on Aging and then they privatized it out to Philadelphia . And now that, you know, coming back to court, oh, all the ERAP money is gone. Anyway, there has to be some sort of thing about the legal stuff happening in the city, the county and up to the state and the federal . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Little. Anybody else like to speak? MR. ELLMAN: I told Marie ladies first but she said old age first. I'm a firm believer in that old adage that that was then and this is now. You know, what was good then might not be good now and vice versa. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 I noticed in last week's paper a statement by one of the paper's employees . That's because I definitely don't consider them journal ist, newspaper man reporters . Anyway, it was -- they mentioned Mr. Howe's run for Council . And they brought up some trivial unnecessary remarks as far as I'm concerned . And John could put a sign up in my yard if he wants. You too, Jerry. The more the merrier . I -- many years ago I remember the paper referred over and over and over again to a murder victim as a prostitute . This was completely unnecessary just like these remarks about Mr. Howe were. Well, enough I guess. I'm not one for rumors, but I heard two interesting ones last week. One of them was that Biden's army of illegal s is staying at Montage -- up at Montage at the Hampton Inn. I know I certain ly couldn't afford to stay there. And the other one, I heard a homeowner talk to a construction man who told them the property at Leggetts Creek on Wells where the ballpark is was stated to be a water treatment plant. You know, if that's true, it's not very good news. Both of them had good sources 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 too. That's why I don't know how true they are. And lastly, I was wondering if there was some way the code enforcement could interrupt their busy day and go down East Throop Street towards the railroad tracks and explain to me why a huge bulldozer is allowed to be parked in a residential neighborhood . Now there's pallets being left there. They go by. They go up Throop Street which is West Throop past the condemned house where the junk cars are in front of it. For five years they don't see nothing . So I guess asking them to do something about a bulldozer they probably couldn't even find it. And I'd like to say last week Chummily and me walked around Nay Aug for God, I guess, two hours. That include s the sitting time. And I was on the upper part. And it is such an improvement over a couple years ago when I walked. And today when I was at Weston Park, there was two different city employees working cleaning up and cutting grass. And they had made such a big difference . At Weston Park it really was a different place than it was four, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 five years ago. And whoever is responsible should be proud of themselves . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Mr. Voldenberg , would you have code enforcement go over on East Throop and check out this bulldozer ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, I will. I'll have them check out West Throop also. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . It was kind of him to say that he's older than I, but I've got him beat by a mile. Two things I'm really happy about are number one, the lights that have been netted around the corner of Lackawanna Avenue and Wyoming Avenue for many months have finally been removed . And also, the Penn Avenue and Lackawanna Avenue is starting to shape up with theater work. So that's happy news. But I do have a bunch of questions . My first one Tom already covered with the pilots. Second, why does DPW fail to remove signs like there is one about -- two about 7 feet tall and wide on East Mountain Road. And they all say, you know, work -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 roadwork ahead 500 feet. Well, the work has been done for months, I mean, literally months. And I called to 311 and asked that same question and yet nothing happens . They just sit there. And then next, why do we still get reports with six digit dollars of Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax when Council replaced that with a payroll preparation tax several years ago? If you could do that in Fifth Order I would appreciate it. Then next question is, when the state right to know law allows five business days before a response can be provided to the requestor, why does the city start out with 30 days? I mean, I'm sure in many cases things that are -- have been requested are probably sitting here. But you got to wait 30 days? Something is wrong with that. And again on the DPW, I called three times today and -- with several hours in between to ask a question . And every time it rang and you put the 15 in to get to the right place and the machine is all filled up. Something needs to be done there because maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 you guys know the answer. I get a lot of mail and I like to recycle it. And what I wanted to know was I'm running out of paper bags because everything is plastic anymore . So what should I put it in? I mean, I would just like to know but I can't -- so if you know the answer I would appreciate it. Does anybody know what you put just like mail in? Cardboard boxes don't do the thing. MR. MCANDREW : I'm not sure because if you put it in plastic , they're going to dump the mail and then leave the plastic bags. That's obvious , right? So maybe we could inquire about that because I don't know the answer unless someone sitting up here has the answer or the correct answer. We'll get it for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. I would appreciate that. And then I do have a suggestion . You know every lousy looking corner it seems is a gas station like Meadow Avenue and 307. And I don't know why I think we should ask our former president of the Council here Mr. Donahue to see that some of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 that gas tax money that is coming in and being transferred other places be used to get those tanks out of there every one -- I don't know but if they could help use that money to get those tanks out of there and get those properties working again instead of pulling down the way the city looks. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Anybody else like to speak? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . Once again my question on pension losses wasn't that the whole enchilada lost money. It's that I'm concerned about volatile investments being subsidize d -- losses in those investments being subsidized by solid stocks and good investments . And finally Mr. Bolus and I agree about something . We should definitely before anything is done with the pools, especially replacement , we should look into viable repairs. And the grout thing is a solid idea. Utility bills once again, last month for 35 days and 2,500 gallons , my bill is up to $177 or something like that; two people, 2,500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 gallons . I don't think that would have been more than 50, 60 bucks just a year or two ago. That's unacceptable . And why would that be? Well, we have a bunch of 501 C3s stick their nose in, bring in Henry Amoroso , paid Henry Amoroso and they walked away from it after that. We had one meeting and we had a speaker in here. We had one conference on the sale of the sewer plant. And that conference was in the afternoon up at Marywood College . In looking for it I got treated totally disrespectfully . I got treated like somebody that was just looking to hang around and look at the young attractive females or something . I wasn't even directed . I asked several times where -- what building is the meeting and nobody knew or cared. And then large amounts of money were offered for the sewer plant. It sounded like a good deal. But here we are paying $175 or more for water in 35 days for 2,500 gallons . And that is strictly -- I mean, there's no excuse for that at all. And once again on this HUP test, I would advise one of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 the things that I find most disturbing about 501 C3s is that they seem to be very interested in politics . And to me that is unacceptable . I don't need them assuming they're holier than thou. I don't need them assuming they're smarter than thou. They are good at what they do and they should stick to what they do. You want to save somebody 's soul, fine. Don't come up with a political opinion to run my life and don't assume that you know everything about everything just because you're an educational institution . And once again, we heard an awful lot about Joe Biden. And, I mean, I wonder if they're embarrassed over the Iran Contra Affair where we were selling arms to both sides, Iraq and Iran. Who the hell who should like us after to find out that we stuck them in the back with the knife, you know. So Saddam had his reason for being mad at us and the Iranians didn't like us already . And it just goes on and on. I didn't favor Joe Biden Street. But I thought a ceremonial idea on Joe Biden and they didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 take that advice and here we are hearing about it three years later. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : I have more to say on that but I'm out of time. MR. MCANDREW : Anyone else? MR. LAFRANCE : Good evening . My name is Pat LaFrance. I'm a resident of South Side. And I'm here basically to find out your opinion tonight whether I'm a homeowner or a landlord . I lived on the 600 of Alder, years ago grew up on the 600 of Alder. And then after my wife was assaulted in front of my house we moved. So within two months we were gone. We moved up to the 1000 of Maple. And that's where I'm at now. And the only reason we moved there is so my wife can be near her family. And when we looked at the house that we are in now, I said, Babe, a lot of work. Yeah, yeah, let's buy it. We bought the house 2005. About four years ago I had something medical happen to me and I stopped working on my house. This year we got a contract or come 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 in give us a price and I started working on my house again myself because it's astronomical . I'm not looking to do any plumbing in my house. I'm not looking to do any electrical . I'm not looking to do any structural . And the beginning of June, I believe it was late May, I put in for a permit to put up some two by four walls in my bathroom , nothing structural , fur out one wall. When I put that in for the permit it was questioned by whoever the inspection department is now. It was questioned by them can a homeowner do that type of work. And when I saw that on the question , I sent in the little sketch that I have of what I wanted to do up there. Every drawing , every measurement anybody could have took of my bathroom was on that drawing . And my permit was approved . That was in June. Okay, July comes. I did that work in my bathroom that I had the permit for. July comes, I file -- I put in for another permit to close up four windows that now have foam panelling in them. I want to put half inch plywood over them.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 And I was denied the permit. I'm like, okay, what gives? And they said, well, you're a landlord . You got to hire a contractor . I was like when did this come about? Where are we going with this? And they said, yeah, November of 2022 Council said that anymore if you have an apartment in your house that you rent out you can't do any work on your house. You have to hire a contractor , okay. Can I see that law? Everybody I was e-mailing on the permit to get it was commenting , comment ing, commenting . And as soon as I asked for that law, everybody stopped commenting . It took me about four days to get this law. I was told to go on the Scrantonpa .gov. Yeah, well, it's not on there. And I didn't mean to be smart with the people who I spoke to. But when they tell me it's on there, I'm, like, okay, you got a computer in front of you. Find it. Put whatever you want to put in the search bar and find that law for me. It got to the point where I went to one part -- I was -- I went from permit office to another person on the phone to another 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 person on the phone who I didn't get his name so I'm not going to bring up the title or the name. Where can I get this law that says I can't work on my house? He's like, I don't know where to tell you to get it but I could talk to this guy that runs the permit office. I'm, like, wait, wait, wait. You are -- and I told him, you know, his job title. And, like, how do you not know where this law is? How can somebody in your position can't tell me where I could get this in an e-mail or I can come down and look at it in a book. I just don't believe it. So the next day I got the law. And sure enough, I don't know what you guys did. I can't understand it. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not a legal person. But you guys voted on something in November of '22 that has to do with people working on their houses. And I go to page six. And the whole -- all 19 pages is all titles of different occupations . That's all it is, what the license is and, I mean, apprentice , supervisors , everything . But on page six there is one it says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 exceptions , homeowner. Any natural person engaged in home improvement on a one or two unit residential property owned exclusively by them and occupied as their residence shall be allowed to obtain a building permit for and perform such work without being a licensed contractor as long as they meet all of the requirements of City Code including this chapter in UCC. So I don't have to be a license d contractor to work on my house. So I would like to get Council 's opinion . Am I homeowner or a landlord ? MR. MCANDREW : Excuse me, Mr. LaFrance, is this a duplex or -- MR. LAFRANCE : Yes, a first floor, second floor. I have an apartment on the first floor that I live in right now. It's a two-bedroom unit. My wife, myself, and my two sons we live in it. We have two -- same pattern upstairs , two bedroom upstairs . I had so many problems on Alder Street when I left Alder Street I swear I would never rent again. We get to Maple Street I want to say maybe in 2013 or 2014. I could go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 back to as much as 2015. That apartment has not been rented out since 2015. I showed the city the other day I came over and I showed them a letter from PP&L. The power usage in that apartment stopped in 2015 and a meter was pulled in 2020. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So Mr. LaFrance , your time is up and I'm not trying to be rude. Would you please leave your name and e-mail with Mrs. Carrera here. And, Mr. Voldenberg , can you take special interest in this and get clarification . It doesn't sound clear to me with code enforce ment and any correspondence this gentleman has had to see if we could rectify this? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll talk with them in the morning . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. LAFRANCE : Can I ask one more thing about that correspondence ? I don't mean to take up everybody 's time. But does anybody know what the law is on right to know requests , how many days? How many months? How many weeks? MR. MCANDREW : Our solicitor isn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 here. But there is a process . MR. LAFRANCE : Yeah, I understand that, but five weeks? MR. MCANDREW : I agree. MR. VOLDENBERG : It's five days response unless it involves more investigation then they would request a 30-day extension . MR. LAFRANCE : Yeah, that's what I thought . Well, I was told -- when I came over the other day I come over to City Hall and I was told five weeks. MR. VOLDENBERG : Five days and then a 30-day extension if the city needs it. MR. LAFRANCE : Thank you, Council . Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Would anybody else like to speak? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton city taxpayer . I'll keep it brief tonight . You guys know who I am. You guys know what I want. I think it would be very, very nice to be able to leave my house, walk or bike to a train station , get on a train, take the Laurel Line up into Scranton , get off in Scranton , go to work, play, etc., and do a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 reverse . I think it would nice to be able to live in the Scranton , go to the train station , get on train, take it to Old Forge, to Pittston , to Wilkes-Barre, do the same. I've talked endlessly about how this would be beneficial . I think it would be very nice and I would like it very much. I did also have a question regarding Biden Street because it was brought up tonight . All these streets at least in Central Scranton are either plants going one way or people going the other. So why is Biden Street on the plant access and not the people access? Does anyone know? I didn't know if you would. It's been something that's been bothering me ever since it went up, so thanks. Yeah, you guys know it would be really beneficial to the city, community to build a train and be able to have localized regional rail in the Scranton -Wilkes-Barre metropolitan area. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Is there anybody else who would like to speak that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 hasn't? Okay, thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, one -- actually two. Mr. Voldenberg , the construction signs up on East Mountain Road, they were done by a private construction company . So if you could call code enforcement and see who pulled the permit for that, they would be the ones that we should contact to remove their signs if they're complete . I believe they're complete . But the signs are still there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll verify it, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Now, the 26th running of the Steamtown Marathon was this past Sunday. And it so far has raised over 2 million dollars that they donate to St. Joseph's Center, also benefits the City of Scranton hotels, restaurant s, and businesses . And I'd like to thank our Council President and the Race Director Bill King for all the work that he's done in this over the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 past 26 years and all he has done for this city bringing that into the city and also to St. Joseph's. That's all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Actually tonight all of my comment s will be made on the items as we -- on the question on the items so nothing at this time. MR. MCANDREW : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do. I have a few things to get to. First off, I meant to discuss it earlier , but I feel like now is still an appropriate to time to bring it up. I just wanted to mention how saddened I am by the events that took place in Israel over the weekend with the unprovoked attacks from Hamas. I understand that this is a conflict that goes back a very long time, decades . And, you know, I know that it's not something that is going to be solved any time soon. But I hope that innocent lives are spared and that they don't continue to be taken. Last night I did attend the vigil 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 that was at the Jewish Community Center. And it was a great way to see the community , people from all faiths come together to show their support for Israel. And I spoke with many people who have family members or friends who were over there and they are very worried about them. And someone said that there is just nowhere within the country that they could go and feel safe. So even though that's, you know, in another part of the world I feel like it's still concerning to many of our residents and people of the Jewish community here within Northeast Pennsylvania . So I did want to make sure to bring that up tonight . Secondly , there are a number of issues some of which I brought up before along Prescott Avenue and many that have been brought forward to me, I also drive that street very often living in the Hill Section . And so I'm able to see these problems as well. One of them has been the disrepair of the street from the work that American Water had done. And I'd asked for updates previously and that was suppose d to be completed by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 end of September , early October . So that's where we are now. So I just want to make sure that those are going to be taken care before the winter and quickly I hope because they're in pretty bad shape there and the patch job was not done well. So I know -- I discussed with Mr. Voldenberg reaching out once again for an update. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll ask for the completion date. And if not, I'll ask that they repair the pave cuts. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And there were a couple of code enforcement issues along that street, one of them being there's an overflowing garbage dumpster . I think this property has been an issue in the past. It's on the corner of Prescott and Olive Street if we could see if we could get code enforcement down there to take care of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : And there's an overgrown empty lot that is on Prescott and Vine Street, I believe the southeast corner. And it used to be the entire empty lot that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 overgrown. And I think maybe even during American Water's project there or someone was doing construction locally that had, you know, vehicles parked on the lot. And so some of it is not overgrown anymore because there's not grass and weeds. But the good part is still if you're coming from one part of Vine Street it's difficult to see the traffic coming along Prescott Avenue because of the height of them. So if we can see if the owner of that lot can take care of that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And one more note on that street, the property I believe it's 423 Prescott Avenue had a fire. I think this winter it will be two years ago. And that property is still sitting there. And I know that the owner originally stated that they were going to renovate that property and still have it be useable . So it wasn't on a demo list. But if we could find -- I've asked for updates on this in the past and I don't remember receiving any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 recently . So I want to know -- and I know the neighbors want to know what's happening with that property if it is, in fact, going to be renovated since the fire they had or if it needs to be demolished . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask OECD tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And along those lines I've also asked in the past and have not receive d a list of properties like this one that have had fires and been condemned and just seem to sit there for sometimes years. And it's frustrating to see and I want to make sure that we're staying on top of it as a city and being able to address these properties . And if, you know, the owner says okay we're going to do something with it, you know, that we're not waiting six months to check back in on that. So if we can once again discuss that list between , you know, code enforce ment and I know the fire department too because it has to deal with some of them that are under the act -- I think it's 59. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll see if they could firm up some timeframes .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , did we get a list -- didn't we recently get a list of some of these properties because I know the one on 1111 Rear Blair Avenue was one we've talked about. We've talked about the one just above Tripp Park, didn't we get a response back on some of those? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did get some responses . I'll get you an update. Rear 1111 is still on the list for demolition . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. DR. ROTHCHILD : What I'm looking for and hoping that there will be just a complete list of what those properties are and then their status of them if they are condemned , if they're on the demo list, if they are being renovated so that we could get more and more of those properties taken care of. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : And along the 700 block of Schultz Court there's been a chronic garbage issue with garbage being, you know, overflowing from trash cans or not in trash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 cans at all and being torn into by animals and all spread across Schultz Court so if we could get our code enforcement officer over there as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I received a complaint previously about Front Street over in South Side. And there was a lot of overgrown, you know, bushes and garbage , a mattress , tires. I received updated picture s today. And it's still in that same state. So if -- I know there might have been recent quality of life tickets, but obviously , nothing 's been taken care of there. So if we could check back on that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have them follow up on that street. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Excellent . And Mr. Mancini had come up and asked question s for Council regarding audit of the sewage and parking authorities . And I know for the complete city audit that we were waiting on the sewage one. And, I mean, I think it's very important for to us demand that that gets to us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 quickly so that the city audit can be completed . But also in the interest of transparency , I fully believe that we should have those audits. So I'm in agreement with the question that was asked. MR. SCHUSTER : We also got correspondence from the Sewer Authority saying that they reached out to their auditor and they will get that. They asked the auditor to do it as soon as possible and get it to the city. DR. ROTHCHILD : As soon as possible , can't come quick enough. And then there was one final point that I had. There was also a question about overtime update which I mentioned we definitely need an update on that. It is important to me too that we are properly tracking overtime of employees . And I've stated that in the past. And I'm hopeful that we'll get an update soon. I certainly want to ask the administration for that again. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . They are working on implementing a new system similar to the police department . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. So maybe if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 we could get some dates as to when that's going to be implemented , how that implementation is going. Thank you. That's all that I have. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. So maybe to clear up with what Mr. Mancini was referring to, I think he's referring to a forensic audit, not the yearly audit or an audit by the auditor general . That's what I think. And I think we asked for that. MR. MANCINI : (Inaudible .) DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm asking for it again. MR. MCANDREW : So I believe we asked for that in the past and we can do that again, okay? So that's cleared up. So what I'm going to report out is request s that I had sent the past couple weeks. So I remember last week I asked that if the city is going to honor Attorney Terrence Gallagher 's term on the Scranton Housing Authority through September , '24. And the response -- I'm glad we got it back and I'm glad we got this one is that the city does not intend to put forth another new appointee for Magistrate Gallagher 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 position until September of 2024. So we could finally put that one to rest without anymore nonsense. All right. So we also sent a request to city administration on October 5th asking if the hours of the lady's swim club at the Weston Field may please be alternate d with the rest of the public at the indoor pool and this is referring to the vouchers that were issued to the homeless . The response we got back is Weston Field is a smaller public pool that it's only open from nine until one Monday through Friday and then again from three to six only Thursday and Friday. Even though it's a smaller pool, the pool hosts many activities , swimmer s (inaudible ) and all sorts of aquatic activities , lap swimming, aerobics , exercise recreational , etc., attend during the above-reference d hours on various times and dates. It would be irresponsible of the administration to relinquish more than half of the daily hours available to a private group that is using a public amenity. Well, they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 a paying group. They are paying taxes and they also pay a fee, a membership fee. I don't think it's unreasonable for them to have their own time. And also Director Gassenmeyer has spoken to the ladies and they have agreed to share the public pool. It is Director Gassenmeyer 's understanding that only a couple of the ladies are still frustrated that the city is unable to close the pool for their private swimming group. The use of voucher s is going well. The Keystone Mission voucher usage has trended upwards. August there was 19; September , 29; October , 14 and counting . The administration is happy to report that there have been no incident s to speak of. All Keystone Mission guests have been respectful and the people -- of the people in the facility . They leave the area clean and express their gratitude for the ability to utilize the facility . All right. So then, speaking of condemned properties , I requested through Mr. Voldenberg last week a list of all condemned properties .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 I know we got a demo list. I don't know how current it is or updated it is. But I requested that. And it's noted here that you sent that request in. MR. VOLDENBERG : Right. We have not received it as of today. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then we also requested an update to the Briggs Street pipe issue. You know, it was will this be repaired -- will this repair be include d in the Keyser Valley flood project or make any necessary repairs be made to the pipe because there was great debate last week about this pipe, you know, it contributes to the problem . They changed it out. It was a 24 inch or 15 inch. So the answer was kind of vague. The answer we got is the Brigg Street pipe issue was identified . Well, of course, we all identified it. And the Keyser Valley stormwater study will be part of the design for the overall stormwater project in that area. So my concern s is, this project , it's only in -- still in the planning stage, not the construction stage. So how long is that going to take if this pipe can just be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 remedied sooner than that? Can you follow up with that? Say why do we have to wait to either reconnect this pipe or reconfigure it to make it, you know, a better experience during a storm up there? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And then in regard to pilots, so -- so the recipients of a pilot letter, okay, I have the list. It's too lengthy to read. And it's 177 are in receipt of this pilot letter requesting some help, right? And during caucus I asked Mr. Voldenberg to please put it in Third Order. So out of 177 that received letters asking for, you know, to participate in the pilot program , only seven have participat ed as of September 25th. Them I could name because there is only a few, the University of Scranton 150,000; NEPA Youth Shelter, $50; Midtown Apartments , 13,000; Boys and Girls Club of Northeastern Pennsylvania , 2,000; Good Will and Gerald T. Langan Apartments , 4,524; DCNR, $3,752.92 and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 the Society for the Preservation of the Tripp House, $200. So we've only gotten or received $173,000 and change. So I know the HUP test is another angle we're looking at. But, you know, 7 out of 177, that's dishearten ing. So like I asked earlier , would you please put this in Third Order so you could all take a look at the list and digest this like we're going to try to do. All right. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And I believe that is all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 310, 2023 – APPOINTMENT OF TERESA GRETTANO , PH.D., SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , AS MEMBER OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S ETHICS BOARD FOR A TERM OF FIVE (5) YEARS. TERESA GRETTANO , PH.D.’S TERM IS EFFECTIVE UPON EXECUTION OF THE RESOLUTION AND WILL EXPIRE AUGUST 31, 2028. MR. MCANDREW : As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? None heard, roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. MCANDREW : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 311, 2023 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT WITH NLYTEN CORPORATION D/B/A GUIDE TO PROVIDE THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S FIRE DEPARTMENT WITH A FIRST RESPONDER MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS MOBILE APPLICATION . MR. MCANDREW : What is the recommendation of the Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Vice Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final vote of Item 7-B. MR. SMURL: On this item -- MR. MCANDREW : No, we need a second. MR. SMURL: Oh, I'm sorry. Second. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. On the question ? MR. SMURL: On the question , I'm sorry, on this item we received information this evening in caucus, a lot of information I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 didn't know about this, and really a lot of confusion on payment s and stuff on it. So I want to recommend tabling this for further information from the administration . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So there's a motion to table. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , so during the negotiations with the fire department there was mental health piece that was, I guess, a point of contention with the contract . I did reach out to the fire department . We need to see if this was something that filled in that void for mental health services for the fire department . And I was informed by the union that they felt this was a waste of money. They trained nine individuals over the last couple years to be a peer support team. And they felt that the fire department would not use this mobile app as this is a mobile app for mental health. It was mentioned in public comment tonight that an application would not be a good substitute for actual mental health and I tend 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 to agree. I'm also going to go off the union's recommendation as they do not endorse or feel that this would be effective . If a motion to table tonight occurs and passes I'll accept that. But even next week I will be voting no to this. They felt that the $18,000 that may go towards this application may be better suited in training either additional firefighter s or getting more support for their peer support team as this team is actually a team that covers most of the northeast from Pennsylvania to Maine. That's all. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Also on the question , I agree with Mr. Schuster . I had the same conversations with our brave firefighters . And I believe them that this app or whatever you want to call it doesn't replace or doesn't replace the training that they had in the peer training that, you know, they probably wouldn't use it and it would be a waste of money. So, you know, I listened to them and I agree with them. So the motion on the floor is to table, but no matter what comes back I'm probably going to be a no for this. I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 agree with the rational e. So all those -- DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm in agreement to table this tonight . There were a number of questions , good questions that came up in our caucus that I would also like to find out the answer to before determining my vote on this piece. I don't think that it's a bad thing to have more options for our employees for their mental health. And there have been apps that have been found to be helpful and beneficial in that avenue. And it could be an adjunct to, you know, other service s that they might be receiving . But, you know, I didn't have the same conversations with the union or firefighters . And, you know, I think there's a couple things that we need to look into where this is coming from. There was a question about, you know, why these services wouldn't also going to be offered to the police and just to the fire and then along with some questions regarding the cost and the contract . So I'll be in favor to table tonight . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So all those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 in favor saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. Opposed? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : You voted no to table? You voted no to table -- MR. SCHUSTER : I was discussing on the floor here. I was just seeing which way it went. I wasn't sure which way it was going. So I could be a no to table. MR. MCANDREW : I'm sorry? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm a no to table, yes. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So 2-1, it's tabled. Okay, 3-1, sorry. MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-C. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE FOR ADOPTION . FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - RESOLUTION NO. 312, 2023 – AMENDING RESOLUTION NO. 69, 2022, A RESOLUTION (AS AMENDED ) ENTITLED “AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO TAKE ALL NECESSARY ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT (ARPA) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 GRANT FUNDS IN THE AMOUNT OF SIXTY-EIGHT MILLION , SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY-SIX THOUSAND AND FIFTY DOLLARS ($68,746,050.00)” TO REALLOCATE FUNDS FROM VARIOUS , BUDGETED ARPA ACCOUNTS TO ALLOW FOR FOCUS AND FUNDING OF DISASTER RELIEF EFFORTS AND STORMWATER MITIGATION , DEVELOPMENT AND REMEDIATION OF POOL COMPLEXES WITHIN THE CITY, AND TO EFFECTUATE ONGOING STEWARDSHIP OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS . MR. MCANDREW : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote of Item 7-C. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , there's a couple things included in here that I had some discussion about. Mrs. Cipriani was in a while back when we discussed our streetscapes . And one of those streetscapes that was included was the Providence Square Streetscape Project. I know there was some questions as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 to what census track it fell in but it was a project that was discuss ed some time ago. In this resolution we have in front of us we're reallocating money from the North Scranton Providence Streetscape Project to take that to 2 million dollars and reallocate it towards Biden Street. There are several project s here. One is West Scranton . There's South Scranton . Each part of the city has a streetscape project . And the Providence Square piece is the North Scranton Streetscape Project . There are several streetscapes in downtown Scranton . And I would hate for North Scranton not to get some improvements in their section of town. So I would like to make a motion to amend Item 7-C to exclude the reallocation of Streetscape North Scranton Providence Square DI minus 2 million dollars as well as the streetscape Biden plus 2 million dollars . It's item number 17 from the front column and item number 17 on the to column. So that is a motion to amend 7-C. MR. SMURL: Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. On the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 question ? Also on the question , I also agree that, you know, so for the streetscape project , you know, it was pretty much promise d to North Scranton and getting rediverted for the Biden area. I think it should be equalized throughout the city since other parts of the city are receiving some of this ARPA money. I think it's only fair that we redistribute . Think again about North Scranton . It was in the plan and then it was out of the plan. So I'm in favor of this friendly amendment . Anybody else on the question ? So all those in favor of the friendly amendment say aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 7-D.
