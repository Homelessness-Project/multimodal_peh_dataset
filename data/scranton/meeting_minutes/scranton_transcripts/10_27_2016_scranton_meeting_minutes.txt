MR.WECHSLER :Thankyou.Mr. Rogan? MR.ROGAN:Yes.AsMr.Perry mentioned ,Iwouldalsoliketocongratulate Councilman Gaughan andhisfamily ontheir newaddition todaywewishthemthebestof luck.AsImentioned earlier ,andasa couple ofspeakers mentioned ,Iamgoingto address thedouble pension scandal andthe Pennsylvania StatePolice report thatwasin thenewspaperthisweek.InJanuary of-- justtaking astroll downmemory lanehere, inJanuary of2015newsbrokebythe Scranton Timesthatmanycityemployees received double pensions thattheyweren't entitled toandIwanttopreference allof mycomments bystating nobody isblaming the recipients ofthedouble pensions .The1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 blameisonthepeople whoauthorized them notthosewhoreceived thepensions ,andI knowmanyofthepeople whoreceived them areelderlyandtheyreally had--they thought theywerereceiving alegitimate benefit fromtheCityofScranton .Ithink mostpeople agreeonthatsowedefinitely don'twanttomaketherecipients into villains here,butsomebody doesneedtobe heldaccountable . LikeIsaid,whenthisscandal did breakinJanuary of2015Ithinkeveryone in thecommunity wasinshockthatthismuch moneycouldbesquandered without going through theproper protocols .Thepensions wereneverapproved .Atthattime,Icame outandIadvocated forcitycouncil touse it'ssubpoena powertoinvestigate it internal ly.Atthetime,mycolleagues respectfully disagreed because therewasan ongoing investigation bythestatepolice andpossibly otherlawenforce mentagencies . Thisweekwedidlearnthatthestatute of limitations hasrunandI,forone,amvery disappointed tohearthisandI'mevenmore1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 disappointed thatittooktwoyearstofind outthatthestatute oflimitations have run,afive-yearstatute onincidents in 2002,2003.WhileIdon'thaveallofthe details ofwhyittookthislongforthat information tobereleased ,myhopeisthat therewassomeinvestigation doneasto whether eachpension payment thatwentout couldconstitute ifthereisacriminal ity ofthecrimewherethestatute wouldn't account ,butasImentioned ,sincethe statutes haverunoutthestatepolice has reported tousandtothemediathatthere isnolonger anactive investigation .Ido believe itnowfallsupontheCityof Scranton toinitiate aninvestigation to findoutwho,what,why,whenandmost importantly howthesedouble pensions were givenout.Theresidents ofScranton deserve answers onthisveryserious issue. AsImentioned ,Iadvocated forcity council touseit'ssubpoena powerjustasa former citycouncil didwhenmillions of dollars wentmissing fromtheSingle Tax Office.Citycouncil doesnothavethe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 authority toarrest,try,convict anyone, butwedohavetheobligation tofindout whyandhowthishappened . Regarding thesubpoenas ,Iamgoing totalktomycolleagues andthereislist thatIhaveinmind,butIthinkthatthe bestcourse ofaction,thefirststepshould beforustocontactthestatepolice and seewhatfromtheirinvestigation canbe turned overtothecity,ifanything ,and alsoiftheycouldhaveanexecutive session withcityofficials todebrief usonwhat theirfindings were.Obviously ,ifthelaw isthestatutes haveruntheyhaverunand thereisnothing thatcanbedone criminally ,butthereisstillanobligation tofindoutwhathappened andtoensure that itneverhappens again.Sooverthenext fewweeksthatwillbemytoppriority to gettheballrolling onthisandhopefully convince mycolleagues thatthisisa worthwhile endeavor togettheseanswers . SothefirstthingIwouldliketo knowifmycolleagues wouldbeinagreement tosendcorrespondence ,andwecouldworkon1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 thelanguage throughout theweek,tothe Pennsylvania StatePolice requesting any public information isturned overtothe cityfromthisinvestigation tocitycouncil sowecouldbegintolookthrough those documents ourself,andIwouldalsoliketo haveanexecutive session ifthat's something thatAttorney Minora believes is legalwiththefiveofusoncouncil ,state police officials andpossibly folksfromthe administration todiscuss whattheir investigation entailed,whereitleadthem, whotheyinterviewed ,whatwasgoingonwith howtheygottothepointwheretheygotto, andhopefully wecanpickitupfromthere andatleastdetermine whyandhowit happened sowecanputcontrols inplaceso thisneverhappens againanddespite allof theattention thisissuehasreceived ,the important thingis,one,wemakesureit doesn'thappen again,buttherearemillions oftaxpayer dollars thatweresquandered . Thesepension funds,asmycolleagues mentioned ,onaweekly basispension reform isbrought upagainandagain,oneofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 firstreformsismaking suremoneyisn't givenoutthatshouldn 'tbegivenout.So, asImentioned ,Iwillmakethismytop priority andifmycolleagues agreeIthink weshould startwithsending a correspondence tothestatepolice requesting thatinformation .

Thepastfailure oftheprevious legislation andthecity'sinability toregister rental unitsbeyond theestimated 20percent rate ofallunitshasbeenanexample of inefficient systems andalackof understand ingofthetrueissue. Tobeatapproximately 20percent afternearly 20yearsisadisgrace thathas carried through several administrations and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 tocontinually askthosesame20percent of therental property owners topayforthe other80percent overthattimeperiod is evenmoreofadisgrace .Wearehoping that thisordinance willallowthecityto aggressively register rental unitswhichin turnwillcoverthetruecostof implementation whileincreasing therefuse feecollection forthoseunregistered and seemingly unknown unitsdramatically ,andas moreunitsareregistered andmorerental billsarestamped paidthenweshould getto thepointwherewecanactually reduce the perunitfeeevenmoreandpossibly reduce therefuse feeaswellandfinally getto thepoint,andI'vesaidthismanytimes before,wheremoreareactually paying less.
