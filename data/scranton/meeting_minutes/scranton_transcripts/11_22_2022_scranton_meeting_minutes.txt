MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table file of the Council No. 36, 2022. This piece 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 of legislation is being taken from the table and placed into the Fifth Order for introduction . It is the rental ordinance for 2022. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I raised some issues last week. Included in this legislation are positions -- housing inspector position s that have not yet been approve d by the 2023 budget and also some language that states that. I will I guess pass it through for introduction . But I will raise some question s and maybe language change before final passage . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I also posed some questions that I'll expect some answers -- I'll vote to introduce but for final passage , I'd like them answered . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'd like to make a motion to take from the table Resolution 161, 2022. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table Resolution No. 161, 2022. This piece of legislation is being taken from the table and placed in Fifth Order for introduction . It's the appoint ment of Krista Murray to the Scranton Housing Authority . On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , the administration is past 30 days for appointment of this position . I think I've stated it maybe over the last two weeks. I did request some of the other applicant s so Council could take a look at -- would like to see Council appoint this position . There was an attempt to reappoint the last person in the seat, however , that has been taken off of the agenda. I wouldn't mind taking a look at the applicant s and having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Council do it since that is our ordinance that's on the books. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , I have a similar -- I have similar reservations . And, okay, does the Mayor have the ability or should she appoint to the Housing Authority ? Yes, it's her responsibility . But after 30 days it's our responsibility . And when it didn't happen, the gentleman who was previously on the board didn't resign. He sent a letter requesting to stay. So an easy fix would just actually reappoint him. We tried to do that. It was removed . And then all of a sudden, there's an appoint ment coming from the administration . But it's, you know, I'll vote to introduce it so I could vote no on it later because my vote will be one of -- my no vote will be one of principle and procedure . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm going to vote no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 not to introduce because I would have liked to have seen the other applicants . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm going to yield to the Mayor on the decision of who she wants serving on her boards and commission s. I don't have a problem with this candidate . In fact, I think she's very qualified to serve on the Housing Authority Board and has a lot of experience working with housing in the community . So I'll be voting to take this from the table tonight and to introduce it. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Opposed? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. DONAHUE : The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : I would like to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 a motion to take from the table Resolution No. 143 of 2022. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR.

LETTER OF RESIGNATION TO SCRANTON CITY COUNCIL DATED NOVEMBER 18, 2022 FROM COUNCIL PRESIDENT KYLE DONAHUE . MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I have an announcement that due to the Thanksgiving holiday this week the garbage and recycling pickup will be delayed by one day this week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So first of all, I'd like to wish everybody a very happy Thanksgiving surround ed by family and really good food. Secondly , Friends of the Poor just wrapped up their Thanksgiving dinner at 5:30. I'm proud to say that my students were involved in that process today, prepared a bunch of turkeys , carved them, made gravy. It was a great community service project for my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 students . Secondly now, so Friends of the Family are continuing to serve the public tomorrow by having a drivethrough food basket giveaway. It's going to be from 9 a.m. tomorrow to 5 p.m., at Scranton Cultural Center. Also this weekend a friendly reminder , it's the 10th annual McAndrew Family Cookie for Kids Cancer Bake Sale. That's my family. I'm very proud of them and my students ' involvement . It's going to be at the Career Technology Center on 3201 Rockwell Avenue from 12 to 2. Cookies are five dollars a dozen or you could donate on our Facebook page. This money raised is for less toxic treatment for children with cancer. So it's a worthwhile -- a worth-worthy cause. And then third, Scranton Police Department is going to have a toy drive fund-raiser Friday, December 2nd, at 5 p.m., at Laceworks Tap and Grill, 524 Court Street, Scranton , PA. Please bring a new unwrapped toy. Enjoy special pricing on beverages and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 appetizers . There'll be music, Danny the D.J., and there will be a photo booth for some free keepsakes. And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have one. I find it important to mention tonight the shooting that happened over the weekend at Club Q in Colorado Springs where five were killed and 19 plus people were wounded . I wanted to name the people who were killed in that shooting who included Daniel Aston, Kelly Loving, Ashley Paugh, Derrick Rump, Raymond Green Vance. And thank you to veteran and former Army Major Richard Fierro who was able to subdue the gunman in that attack so that he could be handed over to the police and hopefully justice will be served. LGBTQ clubs like Club Q are meant to be safe havens for people, somewhere that they could feel safe and comfortable to be who they are. They should not be a place that, you know, fear of going to for risk of being killed or injured by someone who is targeting the LGBTQ community .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 So this violence has to stop. I'm constantly disgusted by the shootings that occur within our country and this one personally affects the community dear and close to my heart. So that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any announcements ? I just have a couple, Council held an executive session with the City Solicitor and HR Director on Thursday , November 17th before our budget caucus to discuss personnel . I also just want to take a second to acknowledge former Council member Bob McGoff. I knew Bob growing up through this wife Marita who is probably the main reason I didn't get kicked out of Nativity grade school when I was a kid. But I came to deeply respect and admire Bob for the way in which he conduct ed himself from this Chair in this chamber . Bob brought decorum back to these chambers after a pretty dark period by simply treating everyone with dignity , respect , and kindness. I try my best to emulate him by living up to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 standard he set. Former Mayor and former Council member Wayne Evans used to speak on Bob McGoff on the anniversary of his passing which was this past Saturday , November 19th. It's been seven years since Mr. McGoff passed away. And former Mayor Evans read Mr. McGoff's words that he spoke at this Council meeting when he himself was going through a courageous battle with cancer. So I want to take a second to keep that tradition alive and read his words into the record on the seven year anniversary of his passing . Bob McGoff said, "Just one thing I would like to mention . I would just like to say that I know all of us have been affected in some way by this insidious disease . And I would just encourage that anyone that knows someone who is fighting this or dealing with treatments involve d with cancer to be a friend. One of the things that happens to cancer patient s and those under treatment , depression is a very significant aspect of it. And believe it or not, simply sitting down and talking with people, going watching a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 television show, bringing down dinner and having something to eat with them goes a long way to helping people deal with that. And I would just like to encourage that if you know someone , please be a friend and be a part of the helping process ." Those were Bob McGoff's words. And he was just such an inspiration to us all. I wanted to just take a second as my former colleague Wayne Evans and Bill Gaughan did and honor him and hope that we can all remember Bob by keeping him, his wife Marita and his entire family in our prayers . Thank you. And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. COYNE: I'd like to make an objection . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MR. COYNE: I'd like to make a procedural objection . MR. DONAHUE : You are out of order. First on the list -- first on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. COYNE: The Sunshine Act -- MR. DONAHUE : I am calling you out of order. I'm calling you out of order. First on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MR. COYNE: The Sunshine Act is -- MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Coyne, please don't make me -- MR. COYNE: You may if you want. If you want to violate the Sunshine Act -- MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Coyne, please sit down. You'll have time to speak in public comment . That's when you have the ability to speak. MR. COYNE: Under protest -- MR. DONAHUE : Give me a break. Miss Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Some good news, the Friends of the Scranton Public Library are going to sponsor another book sale just before Christmas . So it will run from Tuesday , November 29th through Sunday, December 4th at the Marketplace at Steamtown on the second floor right in front of the gym. And it will be the same hours as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 basically the mall is open. And they will sell hard cover, soft cover books, one to two dollars ; CDs, DVDs, talking books, fiction , nonfiction , adult books, teenage books, children 's books, such a deal. I mean, in this time of inflation where are you going to get a hard cover book usually in mint condition for 2 dollars . You won't find it. So take advantage of it. Has there been any movement at all, any progress with the police and firefighter contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : Based on my understanding , they're still under negotiation . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I was looking at -- oh, how about the 2021 audit? Any change on that? MR. DONAHUE : We got correspondence back I believe it was today saying that more than likely the first week of January . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. I was looking at the City's website . And I know that IT is working on reloading documents . And I looked at under archives . I looked at the labor agreements . And basically they still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 have not put up the DPW contract . The Controller reports , monthly reports , they are up there through September of 2020. The audits, independent audits are there through 2018. Previous RFPs and RFQs, nothing . They just have the page and there's nothing on it. However , the delinquent trash fees that used to be as of August 31st. It's now as of October 31st which is progress . It's not interactive. It's not live. We don't have the delinquent real estate fees or charges . But the trash fees delinquents as of October 31st, the City is due $10,800,000. So that's a lot of money. I saw that you have an updated Payroll Preparation Tax account as of November 15th. Total collected , $759,000. That equates to 20 percent of the accounts that are due. I also saw in Third Order -- not in Third Order, I'm sorry, in the newspaper . The Regional Stormwater Plan, finally we're making some progress . But I'm curious , have the County Commissioners weighed in on this that it seems 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 to be involving multiple municipalities in the county? MR. DONAHUE : So the county was approached originally to oversee this authority . At that moment they denied to oversee that. So that's why we're going the route we are. MS. HODOWANITZ : I know that's why you're going. But have they said anything since that article in the paper? MR. DONAHUE : Not that I'm aware of. MS. HODOWANITZ : It would be interesting to see if they say anything at their next meeting . And also, the allocation of 2 million dollars from the workers ' comp reserve account to the other post employment benefit s trust. It sounds good on paper. My only question is, is there any risk to the Workers ' Compensation Reserve Fund by transfer ring that money? MR. DONAHUE : So this money was actually given back to the City by the State Department of Labor and Industry . And one of the their recommendations in giving that money back is that we set up a OPEB trust with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 portions of that money. MS. HODOWANITZ : So that is -- there's no risk that we wouldn't be able to pay workers ' comp. MR. DONAHUE : No. This should help with, you know, any unforeseen increases in workers ' comp moving forward . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . I want to start out by saying all of the caucuses that you had with the administration , the cabinet members and directors of departments that came in, you based your thought s on your budget -- what you should do with the budget based on what they told you. Well, what they told you isn't necessarily true. So I don't know how you base your facts on how to do the budget when the information you got wasn't so. Larry West was here last week or the week before -- last I think. And Mr. Schuster asked him, do you -- DPW, do they work overtime to pick up leaves? And Mr. West said no. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Well, I'm sure that that's not a lie because I personally don't think he'd lie about it. I absolutely think he just doesn't know any better because he doesn't know what's going on at DPW. He's never down there. That was not true what he said. They work every night picking up leaves overtime . Chris Smith, the supervisor of the DPW of the refuse called me last week and told me how they go out every night. They went out last night. They went out tonight . They went out every night last week. He told me himself they go out overtime for leaves which I don't understand because they have the GPS in the trucks. And I do not believe they finish work at 2:00 even though Chris Smith says he goes out and sees them and he knows they don't get out earlier . But anyway, Larry West told you something that was not true. They work overtime almost every night to pick up leaves. That's nice for the City all the overtime is even there yet and the overtime is already gone. Okay, another thing. Kyle, just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 because you say something doesn't make it true. Now, a lot of people think because you're Council President that what you say is right. No, it's not. I think you owe Mr. Coyne an apology . He at least had right to say why he wanted to say against the Sunshine Act and you shut him right down. He had a right to at least say what he wanted. He probably is right about what he wants. And he probably had a right to stop this for whatever reason. But you didn't give him a chance. Another thing I noticed , before you ran for election you were super sweet. All of a sudden right after you got elected that week after, you tore after Bob Bolus. You were really rotten to him. And then even Marie you jumped down her throat. And then even before that once when Jessica mention ed about Ron Ellman, you did tell her. You looked at her and you said, Relax. Even though you lied about it. You said I didn't mean her. Yes you did. And that woman that spoke and said how you talked to her. You did say that to Jessica . So be I'll be glad when you're gone, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 very glad because what you say isn't true. You also said to Mr. Schuster last week you whispered to him about the budget you said two weeks ago -- no you weren't here two weeks ago. You weren't here. You didn't have time to come. You said to him about the raises and everything . You said some of these raise we can't do anything about because they're in the union contracts . No, none of these raises are union contracts . They're all special friends of the Mayor. Okay, Jessica -- MR. DONAHUE : DPW and clerical are union -- they're contractual raises. MS. FRANUS: Not the DPW Director . MR. DONAHUE : No, but DPW union members and clerical union members -- MS. FRANUS: We're not talking about raises for them. MR. DONAHUE : Well, that's what I was referring to. MS. FRANUS: This is my time, Mr. Donahue . You could tell me -- MR. DONAHUE : Well, I'm going to correct you if you -- it's --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MS. FRANUS: Like I said, Jessica , you asked the Mayor two weeks ago whenever she was here, not much, how are you going to sustain the raises next year. And she said with a big smile on her face, well, if you give me what I want, I probably won't have to have raises. You didn't get the answer to the question . You didn't press her on it. Why didn't you say you didn't answer my question ? She didn't answer it. She just said I probably won't raise it if you give me what I want now. That's disgusting . And then also you talked about the killing s about the gay people. I could understand that. But it's not always about gay people. You seem to mention gay people all the time. How about the four people in Idaho -- MR. DONAHUE : Miss Franus, that's enough, please. MS. FRANUS: Listen to me. I mean what I say. There's nothing wrong with what she said. It's just that she's always talking about that particular field which is fine. But there is also other people in the world. When you're talking about who got killed, those four 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 people got brutally knifed in Idaho, no mention about them; but that's okay. So, Mr. Donahue , I don't want to hear one word from you about what I say, nothing . You've said enough all the time you've been here. Enough. And I hope you guys do the right thing. I don't know how you pick -- how do you pick someone that's going to take Mr. Donahue 's place? Suppose it's a 2-2 tie, Mr. Schuster and Mr. McAndrew want somebody and Jessica and Bill want somebody else. What happens then if it's 2-2? Does the Mayor get to break the tie? That's a question . MR. KING: Yes. MS. FRANUS: That's convenient . So, Jessica and Bill, I guess get ready to find out who she wants. So that's all. And, Kyle, enough. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council . I would like to read a letter to Council from Nay Aug area community residents . The overwhelming consensus among the Nay Aug area 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 community residents is that we want the zoning on the 200 and 400 blocks of Colfax Avenue to remain residential . However , in the interest of compromise , we're willing to consider the zoning criteria and permitted uses associated with City neighborhood mixed use as originally proposed by the SAPA consultants . Among other things, this would limit the height of any new structures to 40 feet. We assume that this height restriction will include any antennae or rooftop havoc mechanical systems . While we understand that there are other aspects of the proposed expansion that do not fall under the umbrella of zoning, our hope is that Council would require the hospital to continue to dialogue with the concern ed neighbors about related matters such as ingress , egress, lighting , buffer zones and the aesthetic s of the propose d structures . In that regard and as proposed by GCMC at the meeting with neighbor s, we support creating a joint GCMC neighbor s committee to facilitate any agreements going forward for any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 zoning changes and related issues. We look forward to Council 's response . And we thank you for your time and consideration , Nay Aug area community residents . Now, the only other thing I have to ask on that letter is where are we in the process ? I know this letter was sent in and somebody had mentioned it went -- that somebody mentioned that somebody went to Don King's office. I don't know who or whatever . Are we suppose d to be communicating with Don King on what we want or just come keep communicating with you people? MR. DONAHUE : So I believe Don is working on the final adjustments to the zoning plan. That still needs to be sent to the county for a 30-day period before it could come back to Council . So that's probably going to take us through the end of this year. So it will be removed -- current legislation that's on the table will be removed from the agenda and it will have to start over at the beginning of the year at the earliest , right? But that's -- MS. KOLOSKI : How would we as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 resident s know what Don is proposing in the changes ? MR. DONAHUE : I'll reach out to Don. Can you leave a copy of the letter and I'll make sure that he gets, you know, that copy. MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : But then you can, you know, I mean, you're free to reach out to Don on your own. MS. KOLOSKI : We have reached out to Don twice, I think. And we just haven't heard anything back. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. MS. KOLOSKI : So that's why we weren't sure we were even reaching out to the right people at this point. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. And I'll check with him too to see if we could get something set up to meet with the neighbors before that is submitted . MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. Next on the list, Norma Jeffries. MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . Sometimes I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 wonder if I should be first or last. Anyone that knows me, I'm not a confrontational person. And when I hear there's always a time and a place, that's how I always look at things. There's a time and a place for everything to be discussed . And we all have our voice and we should have our voice but there's a way to have our voice. But I'm going to get started with my time here tonight . I missed the discussion that you were having at the beginning of Council . You know, sometime s I wonder if it's better to sit at home because I could hear it better at home and hear the replay because I couldn't hear the discussion about the letters that came in for Council replacement. I couldn't hear all of that because I was going to talk about it tonight . I brought the paper in because I was a little bit disappoint ed when I saw the names that were there. And I was disappoint ed because it seems that it's going round and round in a circle. You have to be on the school board and you're on the school board, then you come to City Council . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Or you're doing something else on some other board and you come to City Council . The diversity is not there. And then I say, well, Norma, then if diversity isn't there, you didn't put your letter in to break up the old boy network . Why don't you put in? I was canvassing for some folks to put up their name and to send their letter in so there could be more diversity on City Council to be more representative of what the City is. So I was sort of a little bit of disappointed when I read this this morning and saw the names and where they had been because as I thought about our City Council right now, I think is it three of you out of the five who were on the school board, you know, which I was never on a school board and I just come here to talk. But the thing that I wanted to talk about tonight that I wrote about was the talk last week from the DPW with Larry West, the Fire Chief Judge and the Police Chief, and I have to say that it was very informative , the information that they shared because I was able to listen and to really understand a lot about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 what was going on. One of the things that I had a question for Fireman Chief Judge was that he gave a demonstration . One of his slides had all the community involvement that he has which is very good. But he went from first grade or kindergarten to fourth grade. I have heard him talk at senior groups, which was very good. I learned a lot about the fire protection , your smoke detectors , where you should have them, the program that they have in the City to come and replace them. But there was a group that was missing . It was the group of fifth to high school. That group, there was nothing mentioned . So, yes, the kids get it from kindergarten to fourth grade like on their tummies when they have the fire, stay close to the ground. But if they're not in those classes before one to four, when do the other kids get their training ? I also thought about the colleges and things and I thought , oh, well, they're missing. But then I thought , well, maybe they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 take care of their own fire prevention codes which they probably do. So that was a question I had for him. And for DPW when they talked about the equipment -- I got to hurry up -- the equipment that they have and they bought and the leaf cleaning . I heard the Tornado , whatever that great big machine come down my street on Sunday morning at 7:00. I couldn't believe what this big noise was and was this machine sucking up the leaves. But down at the corner of Monroe and Gibson Street, someone has put up like a board to keep the leaves from going down into the gutter. And DPW could at least help that person whoever did that to keep the leaves out from going there because the leaves are all piled up. But the board is doing its job. But, you know, someone should help this person out whoever is doing that. Also with the calling about the holes in your street and patching , you know, that's -- to me it's not working because my concerns on my street is just terrible . There's this great big hole right before I pull 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 out and I hit it all the time. I call and ask can they fix it for me and I get nowhere . So I don't know if that's under DPW or what. But I do call that pothole hotline. And then that was that. And then with the Police Chief, you know, I have to say what a great job's doing as well. He's been to some community groups as well and explained that the services -- I have to agree with him now though and when he talked about the security and all at the doors and things. I sort of understood that a little bit better. So I thanked him for that that he took the time to really explain that. And one more thing, I want to thank all of the officers that come and are here each week and they stand there and they protect us, you know, so I appreciate that. And I wanted to tell him that but I wasn't here last week. So I hope he knows that we appreciate anything that he does for us in the City of Scranton to keep us safe. So we have a good Thanksgiving . We have a lot to be thankful for. And we just have to think about that sometimes , okay? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Norma. Next on the list is Charles Cortese . MR. CORTESE : Good evening , members of Council . My name is Charles Cortese . My family and I are residents and multiple property owners at the 200 block of Wheeler Avenue. I'm here concerning the zoning of the 200 block of Colfax Avenue which affects our property in the 200 block of Wheeler Avenue. The rear of our properties all 120 feet will be adjacent to the proposed parking garage. We have pride of ownership in our properties . Geisinger CMC plan will devaluate our properties . And our tax base will not reflect this devaluation . We do not need a degree from Pittston University in property values to know that parking garages will decrease our property values. The loss revenue from Geisinger CMC expansion will need to be made up by the resident s and property owners of Scranton . We wish to see the 200 block of Colfax Avenue to remain residential or permit usage associate d with City neighborhood use as originally propose d by the SAPA consultants .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 Please consider what I have said concerning the parking garage and the rezoning issue that comes with it. Please do not make us a victim of collateral damage for the sake of Geisinger CMC aggressive expansion plans. In the evening when the sun sets we still remain in the Nay Aug community because we are citizen s and homeowner s of Scranton . We wish to remain there and live our lives in the peace and tranquillity of our residentially zoned area. My response to what Doris had read, I was going to ask if Council would take a few minutes from their busy schedule and holiday commitment to give us an update as to where we are in the future. And that you already did. And that I appreciate it. And I want to say have a happy Thanksgiving . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. You too. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . This week in the news we have an article about pension losses. We also had some reports on a Bitcoin company FTX. And a few weeks ago I also heard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that some of our pension plans are investing in these entities and that they're really not much more than a pyramid club. It's very concerning . I don't care much for pension directors where you drop the money off from -- that's collected in town here and from either the police forces and fire, whomever . And then some are taxes -- paid by taxes, additional taxes. And then we dump it into a bank's coffers and they go out and decide that this is a good investment . We lost 26 million dollars in 2008 out of the firemen and police pension fund. And it caused quite a bit of problems as I'm sure you people remember . I think you're older than 30 years old mostly. And it's very concerning with these contracts coming up that have to be settled . And, of course, taxes are going up a little bit probably . But it gets really disgusting when some slick shot from Wall Street that doesn't even know how to dress, looks like he staggered out of a party in sweatpants and his T-shirt gets to control 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 billions of dollars . And now on the news tonight a lot of the money was pilfered before it even -- right as it started to collapse . So who knows where that went. And I think in the future we need to get these contracts that these entities , investment houses and stuff cannot do this. They can't just choose whatever they want to sink the money into and then say oops. Nobody was severely punished over that 26 million dollars . And that's more than most people possibly 20 people would make in their lifetime if they're at the lower rungs of the ladder. So on the swimming pool, I don't know if that's alive or dead. But let's have a study on that. And we'll just have to resume that in the spring and figure out what we can and can't do. Personally I can't take another 10 or 15 percent tax increase either even as much as I could be sympathetic to a swimming pool. And on the vote two weeks ago or whatever , it came to my attention that 55 percent of people roughly over 45 voted Republican . And I'll admit I'm a partisan . It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 time to start concerning yourself because they have some pretty crazy things to do -- ideas for Social Security and Medicare. And you're not going to have 40 million people marching out of their houses looking for a job some day to supplement their income. It's not going to happen. It's just not going to happen if they can even work if they're in any kind of physical condition to work. And it's up to -- actually what I meant to say also was that the younger generation s saved Social Security this time because their vote far exceeded the vote for the elderly people that just keep taking the same con every election cycle. Thank you and have a good night. You owe me two seconds next week. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First off and what I plan to speak about here tonight , looking at the bills before the board I see 5-C for the OPEB. Line 415 puts an incentive to collapse the fund for City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 revenue . It should be stated that if it cease to exist the entire fund should be rolled into the existing retirement account s, not to the general essential government funds. By having it roll into the general funds, it then gives an incentive to destroy this fund to be siphoned elsewhere than where its intent is to be. 5-3 -- B-3, the Business Administrator should not be the original trustee because the original trustee winds up putting in investments that get locked in for a certain period of time. And if they get moved, they get penalties . If we're going to have a trustee from it, the trustee should take over from the beginning not the Business Administrator . 5-5, the board of trustees, it's listed as the board has five trustees. Now four of those five trustees are the Mayor's appoint ees. That seems a little unbalanced . I think as a retirement fund, it should consist of the Mayor, Council President , maybe a fire and police representative and someone from the public position that was voted in, not assigned . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Both -- I object to both 5-E and 5-G -- sorry, 8-E and 8-G. 8-E and 8-G were voted in and failed on introduction . Failure does not mean they move to Eighth Order. When things get tabled, they move to Eighth Order. It should have been reintroduced . It should have not been on eight. It's a procedural error. And I'm tired of when something gets voted down by this board and it's unliked that it gets brought up again to vote for the same exact thing. It's a done issue. It was voted on. And the proper procedure is to bring it back in the following year, not to regurgitate it. It's an abuse of Council 's leniency to be able to reconsider something . If it's voted on, especially at this point it should be dead. Now as for the objection I tried to bring forward in Council Chambers and the President struck me down, Section 710.1c of the Sunshine Act prevents anyone from attending a public meeting to object to a perceived violation at any time during the meeting -- not in Fourth Order, not in the beginning , anytime.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 And if you're going to represent the state, maybe it would be nice for Council President to learn the state law. What I was bringing up was Reading and Eagle Company versus the City Council of Reading, 627 A2d 305. The reason stated for public agency must be specific indicating a real discreet matter. Saying personnel matters is insufficient . If you were having an executive session if it is legal, you have to state the case number, what it's about, and why there was an executive session . You do not have to go into details. But by law you are require d to give the people in this body enough information so they are informed of whether or not an executive session was truly valid. Personnel matters has been specifically struck down though it is in the code where it says personnel matters is an excuse. It is insufficient because it gives no one of the citizens an idea of whether or not it was due to dismissal , suspension , disciplining , hearing complaints or charges brought against or periodical -- periodical 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 personnel evaluations . Those are the type of things that get brought forward to say why personnel matters were there. And I objected to saying personnel matters because by law it is not sufficient . And I protested. I was shut down from that because it's a violation of the Sunshine Act. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. LITTLE: Hi everybody . I'm Rick Little from Scranton . I would like to talk about 8-G in the old business of the program which says authorizing appointment of Krista Murray, 1622 -- her address -- as member of the Scranton Housing Authority replacing Thomas Galella , Sr., whose term expired September 27th, 2022. Miss Murray's five year term is effective upon execution of the resolution and will expire in 2027. Is this something that you haven't voted on yet? MR. DONAHUE : We have not, no. MR. LITTLE: No, okay. I'm just trying to understand it because I've been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 trying to understand who's running what for about eight years now. And if I'm evicted and homeless , I'm finished . I just turned 70 years old. And I have been living in Scranton Housing Authority since 2009. As to the democracy involved with the old business 8-G that I brought up and the SHA Board of Commissioners , Krista Murray and Thomas Galella , Mayor Cognetti had a plea to get involve d with democracy to, you know, get involved and call the boards, which I did. And then they came back and said you have to send a resume, which I did. And this was a long time ago. And I finally did a Right To Know to try to find out what was going on. And then I did a Right To Know against Scranton Housing Authority . That is expired . It's starting to look like I might have to do a FOIL request because I just can't find out what's going on. Anyway, I'm running for the board of commissioners . I'm a tenant there. There's big problem s there. I just had my lease terminated on November 18th two days before my birthday last week. And, you know, they do this to me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 all the time, keep me in this litigation going on and on. They terminated my lease before saying I failed to recertify , you know. And they sent me another notice, you failed to -- you know, here's your recertification date. I went to it. And they said, oh, she's not here. Maura Decker is not here. Okay. And then they sent me a lease termination . Another big part of it is the bug wrangling that's been going on for years, bed bugs. And there's a piece in my lease where they have a vendor named Orkin. And they are suppose d to be able to just do anything they want. They leave notices out. If you don't have every one of your possessions in a bag you have to pay us $250. And this is from SHA. You can't ever find out who it's really from. And they come and they broke in my door again last week for this bug thing. I don't have one bug. I've done everything about bugs. If a bug did get in there, the bug would be dead in 48 hours, you know, with that earth stuff where they just can't live. But they want to spray all of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 these chemicals in. And I can't take these chemical s. I know about these chemicals . I've been a building manager . I've dealt with Orkin for 30 years. And they're not going to come in my apartment and spray all of these chemicals . A lot of them have perfumes in them that will attract bugs. I've taken care of the bugs, yet my building let's my faucet leak for six years, like, six gallons for six years. It's crazy what they're doing. They're using this bug wrangling and when they came to my door they said the person upstairs -- the same person who flooded my apartment -- he has bed bugs. You have to -- we're going to spray up there in a few minutes. And you better let us spray here or else -- because they're all going to come down, which is what the bug wrangling is. They move it around and they use bed bugs as a main litigation tool, so many people evicted illegally . Anyway, I want to be on the board of commissioners . And I would like to see the record of -- because from what I seen -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Little. MR. LITTLE: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I would like to know what is going on with 8-A. I'm surprised the state has not penalized us for not having our master plan submitted for a long time. I mean, I understand that it's the residents of the upper Hill Section and -- versus Geisinger . But a decision has to be made at some time. Why not now? MR. DONAHUE : So the changes we made citywide would require us to submit it back to Lackawanna County. So we're waiting for the planning office to submit that back to -- MS. SCHUMACHER : And do we have an estimated date for that? MR. DONAHUE : I don't, no. MS. SCHUMACHER : Another one, the stormwater , I did see, you know, I understand now why you were saying you were going to have it done by the end of the year. But it's obviously not going to be. But one of the things that really bothers me about what's said 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 is that the ratio of pervious and impervious property which is going to -- if it goes through , it could be that's how you would calculate your fee. And people of Scranton are going to get the biggest part because it's an old town. People build houses close together and they don't have big yards as opposed to the townships and stuff out in the suburbia. They have big properties with a lot of impervious property . So they are going to get a much lower fee than the people in Scranton . And that bothers me certainly . And then something for Mr. Donahue sort of personally . You know the problems this city has with the growing non-profits . And you are going to someplace where you could do something about that. And I hope you won't forget it. And there are other people there who have tried other things that you might get together with. And I certainly think there has to be some kind of a ceiling put on that. So I hope you -- the other thing again bouncing around here, but when the Police Chief was here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 I didn't hear one word about drugs. Certainly drugs are an issue in this City, a big issue. They're a big issue almost anyplace. Why did we not hear anything about drugs? Why didn't you guys ask a question about the status of drugs? That was disappointing. And now I would like to go back again to last week's things. And I'll read the list and then you could tell me if you followed up on any of these things: The police and fire contracts , the leachate content, the Pocket Park at Linden and Wyoming , the acoustics in this very room, and the Meadow Brook status of obtaining the rights of way for Meadow Brook II project . The street signs, do we really still have a program ? And what -- is it regional ized? That would have been my understanding at one point in time and when will that project end? And I'll stop there for now. Anybody have anything on any of those projects ? MR. SCHUSTER : I did send an e-mail on Wednesday , the next day at -- and I had one, Pocket Park update; number two, Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Chambers acoustics ; three, street signs plans if there's any; four, the Meadow Brook right of way. In previous answers we got there was 44 right of way. I don't know if I could be accurate on that number. But that's the number I got that there was 44 rights of ways. And we secured one. Now that one that we secured is the one that you knew about from probably a half year ago. The other night when Mr. Cutillo was here he stated we did not secure any since then. So there's 44. We secured one. And we haven't secured one since. But I did send that on Wednesday as well, also the vac truck operating at night what's the current schedule and then the type of information on the content and concentration of the leachate . I did send it over to Mr. Voldenberg . Have we heard a response on any of those? MR. DONAHUE : We did get a response from Mr. Voldenberg today -- this morning I believe it was. So we have not receive d a followup response from Scranton Tomorrow regarding Pocket Park updates . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 We did discuss with Mark Migliore and ECTV about the chamber acoustic s and they're going to be helping us out with that project. We did send another followup to Larry West regarding street sign plans. And we had no response as of this morning . We haven't had a -- so on Meadow Brook we did send an additional request to the Law Department , Andrew Cutillo and Jess Eskra, Eileen Cipriani and Larry West. Larry West indicated at their budget session no additional easements had been secured . He did indicate 30 remain. And Andrew Cutillo quoted 44 in his late July e-mail. So we do have to double-check on that number. We did get a response on the vac truck operating at night. The DPW -- what the response was, the DPW had two vac leaf trucks in service up to last week. As of last week there was one working throughout the City. Scott Petrafice {phonetic }, DPW fleet manager advised last week that the leaf bag trucks will continue to follow the paper and cardboard recycling schedule . He further advised at the time that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 the two leaf vac trucks were in operation in the City do not follow the recyclable schedule . So the pickup and the bags follow the recycling schedule but the vac trucks don't. The leaf pickup teams may workup overtime into the early evening for leaf pickup. Any resident with concerns may contact DPW dispatch at 570-348-4178. And they will advise the team to address their leaf issue. In terms of the content and concentration in leachate we did reach out to Jeremy Hull at PA American Water. And they will get back to us and advise regarding content and concentration in leachate in addition to landfill requests to process treated leachate which is a reverse osmosis process via the Roaring Brook tributary . But Jeremy has been out of the office this week. He will be back on Monday. So we're hoping to get more information on that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, thank you. And I just want to say I hope each and all of us here have a lot to be thankful for this week and enjoy your Thanksgiving holiday . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. You too. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton city taxpayer . First, I'd like to say Dr. Rothchild was absolutely in her right to bring up the violence at Club Q the other night. I don't think it's a coincidence that a gay club was shot up on a night that it was having a drag show on the trans day of remembrance . This is something that people on the far right have been pushing for and have been asking for and have been outright been demanding for a long time now. The encouragement of violence against LGBT members of our community , violence against trans people, violence specifically targeting so-called groomers who are involved in drag shows. This happens far too often. These people are deliberately targeted for their identity . And if you want to talk about other acts of violence , when a straight white man dies in a random act of violence it is rarely because he is straight because he is white or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 because he is a male. Gay men do not go into straight clubs to kill people for being straight . Women do not stalk, harass and shoot up fraternities because they don't get laid. Women do not encourage other women to go eastern Europe specifically to rape Slavic men. Black people do not go into predominant ly white grocery stores to kill people. This doesn't happen. And it is absolutely imperative that we call out hate crimes for what they are when they happen and do everything in our power to stop them to prevent them again. To quote the founder of Black Panther party, Huey Newton, we must all stop acts of fascism or else fascism with their acts of violence will most assuredly stop us all. What is the City of Scranton doing to prevent that from happen here? And I ask that with legitimacy , not accusation . Is there any measures that the City of Scranton is taking to curb, prevent , and end white supremacy , far right extremism here in the City? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. DONAHUE : Not to my knowledge , but let me check with the Police Chief to see what programs they have. MR. GUZIEWICZ : That's a very telling answer, Mr. Donahue . Thank you. Now, we're coming up on Thanksgiving in two days. And there are people in our community who aren't going to have family members visiting them because of these acts of violence against them being targeted for who they are whether it be because they're a person of color, a woman, LGBT, a different religion perhaps , nonreligious even. I think that's definitely something that we have to take with us as we travel on Thursday to see our families or have our families come stay with us is that not everyone has that privilege because other people have been asking for violence to keep our families , our neighbors , our communities from having that privilege , having our loved ones in our lives on this earth. Now, more onto my own special interest . Thanksgiving is also the most dangerous time of the year to travel at all, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 weather conditions combined with the absolute unprecedented level of automotive traffic on the roads has left over 10,000 people dead over the last four years with 2,414 deaths caused by car accidents last Thanksgiving alone. This is because people do not have an alternative to transit . We cannot take the train to go visit our family. The buses are inadequate . Flying is extensive but that is an option. We certainly can't walk or bike in our communities to visit. Our only option currently is the automobile . So Thursday or on Wednesday or on Friday whenever you're travelling , drive safe, be smart. And remember that not everyone is coming home. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: No. I just would like to continue pursuing the street sign situation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 though. You know, we seem to keep talking about it. We don't seem to be getting any answers on that. So that's something I would like to see us pursue with DPW I guess is handling that. Also, something I would like to see us pursue as a City Council , someone mentioned the non-profits . One of the things even if we can't -- I'm hoping that we would get some legislation to address the number of non-profits because most urban cities, we have a tremendous amount of non-profits , you know, universities , schools , churches , federal buildings , state buildings , county building s, city buildings . And it's eroding tax base. But one of the things that's frustrating is that none of those are on the tax rolls. But, you know, some of the universities have private companies that are operating in their buildings . I think that's a bit of a loophole . And I'm wondering if there's any type of legislation that we could push through to at least try to reap some of the benefit s or reap some taxes from those private companies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 that are operating in non-profits . So that's something I want to try to look at moving down the road. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just some comments tonight . I did get an e-mail from a resident up near Pine Street. They have two cars that park on Pine Street. They lived there for 49 years. I did forward that over to Mr. Voldenberg . And he is exploring that with the police department to get an answer for this gentleman and his wife living on -- in that area. And I also got an another e-mail regarding leaf collection . They had their leaves out. So it does kind of answer the question that the recycling schedule is -- on that schedule you see the leaf and cardboard schedule . But the leaf trucks aren't working in the same order as the -- the vac trucks aren't working in the same order as the cardboard pickup. This individual put their leaves out on the 11th of November as collection was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 supposed to occur in that neighborhood . But as of the 21st, they didn't have the leaves picked up as of yet. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we just send correspondence to see if the leaf pickup -- are we on time? Is there some kind of a schedule and where we are at this point with that. It's the 19 hundred block of Myrtle Street. All right. Thank you. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a couple comments . I just want to respond to a few things from public comment . The first of which being that I'm not going to apologize for bringing up the shooting that happened at Club Q. I think that's insane. And I had brought up many other community events and tragedies and deaths during the announcement period throughout my tenure here on City Council . I address a lot more than just LGBTQ issues. But it is something as I mention ed close to my heart being a member of that community . There are no other members on this Council who are LGBTQ or identify as that. So I'm going to continue to bring up issues that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 believe are pertinent to that community because I know no one else will. And I am proud to represent that community . And I have no problem doing that. Also while I spoke, I did mention how I'm disgusted with all of the mass shootings that happen around our country . It is a disgrace in the country that we live that we allow these mass shooting s to continue and do nothing about it. I did mention that. It is something very important to me personally . I am certainly not going to every week mention all the mass shootings that occur because there are so many which makes it even worse. But I did just want to address that. I also wanted to address the Council vacancy and appointment process that will be coming up. No one -- no one makes decision s for me. I make the decisions based on the facts, on legislation . I thoroughly review legislation . I'm thoroughly reviewing the resumes that we have in hand that we've received over the past week. I have not made a decision on the Council appointment already because we haven't even had interview s. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 And that's a very important process to me because I want to see what the person has to say. You can't just judge the person based on their resume or cover letter. And we're going to have question s for those people. We went through the same process previously with openings that I was a part of. And so I object to any insinuation that I am here to vote for any one person or any certain way. I take these decisions very serious ly. And I know my colleague do as well. And I will continue to do that here. That is all that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Nothing at this time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I just have a couple. Mr. Voldenberg , can we check with the City IT regarding the DPW contract not being up on the website ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : And in terms of non-profits , I've actually already started to get to work on that. I started by reviewing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 all the bills that have died in this session to see if they need a legislative sponsor for the next session . And I've also started collecting some legislative research in terms of non-profits and how to best address non-profits especially in municipalities that have a certain -- over a certain percent age of non-profits . So it -- number one on my list at the moment. And that's all I have for tonight . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

But it's a shame that she falls under -- this appointment where the process wasn't followed . And I'll just expand a little bit more. So after the Mayor who is suppose d to appoint like we all agreed upon that, after 30 days when she doesn't, it's our responsibility . So we did. We tried to do that.

DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , did we get an answer that stated -- so this is another document here that states that there's new positions that have yet to be approved. Did we get an answer stating that if we were to amendment the current budget that this would not -- MR. DONAHUE : So I believe the backup documents were for the three pieces of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 legislation . I think they were folded into one and there was an explanation for each. So I don't believe this pertains to any -- this specific piece pertains to any positions being needed or required . I think it's just updating those license fee -- those permit, license , and fees such as, you know, I think billiards and, you know, billiards and bowling alleys were the only ones because some of the other ones just don't exist anymore, right? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree this is not include d in the legislation . I believe what Council man Schuster is referring to is included in the backup to the legislation , the cover sheet that we receive that explains the package of legislation that we received from the OCD on these three different pieces. So I don't think it's necessary to table it. I believe we could move this forward . I don't think that has anything to do with this piece of legislation . MR. SCHUSTER : Was that given to us though from the administration ? Did we get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 that answer? DR. ROTHCHILD : We did receive an e-mail today from the administration . The rental ordinance itself does not add any new positions . It gives City housing inspectors explicit additional authority to inspect rental properties among other changes . Of course, enforcement (inaudible ) would be much more effective with the additional housing inspector s requested in the budget. But it doesn't seem like our vote on the budget will have any impact on this piece of legislation . MR. SCHUSTER : And that was late in the day today, correct ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
