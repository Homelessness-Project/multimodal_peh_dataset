GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So this Sunday, October 31st from 3 to 6 p.m., Shamrock Construction Incorporated will be hosting the Fifth annual Trick or Treat on West Scranton 's Main Avenue. This is the fifth year in a row with many West Scranton businesses will be handing out Halloween treats for the children of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Scranton . It's safe free family fun. Where? Participating business from the 400 block of South Main to the 500 block of North Main in West Scranton and at Allen Park on the corner of Main Avenue and Price. When? Like I said earlier , Sunday, October 31st, 3 to 6. And, parents, all you need to do is show up with your kids in a costume and bring a bag. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just wanted to mention over the weekend -- this past weekend on Saturday , the University of Scranton along with other partners had hosted a walk along Lackawanna Avenue. They've been doing a series of events to honor Jane Jacobs. And she was someone who was adamantly opposed to the Steamtown Mall when it was built. But former Mayor and Councilman Wayne Evans had given us the tour along Lackawanna Avenue and given us a lot of insight into the history there and some hopes and vision for the future of downtown .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 And I really appreciated attending that. As a Council member I felt it was really helpful . And I was able to learn some new things about our City from it. And the night before that I had done the Lackawanna Historical Association 's haunted walking tour. So I learned about our ghosts downtown as well. So it's just great that we offer those sort of things in our City and give people an opportunity to learn about our history . That's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I just want to take a second and recognize four employees of the City who recently either retired or are retiring this week, John Henehan -- John is a DPW worker, 37 years of service to the City. I know John personally . He's a gentleman , dedicated City employee ; and he will be missed greatly by the DPW. Perry Brunori , he retired after 25 years of service . He was a maintenance man in this building . I got to know him well over the last eight years, again, nothing but a gentleman and a great asset to the City of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Scranton . He'll be missed. Patty Brower, I also know her, worked with her years ago, 24 years of service , another great asset to the City, someone who cared deeply about her work. And I wish her the best in her retirement . And finally , Sally Locker, 23 years of service to the City. Sally worked in the Law Department . She was literally the glue that held the Law Department and the City together in my opinion for many years, one of the hardest , most dedicated employees in the City of Scranton . She truly cared about the City. She truly cared about her work. And she worked extremely , extremely close with our office, the City Council office. So I want to wish her the best of luck and health in her retirement and thank all of these employees for their dedicated years of service . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . Next Tuesday is Election Day. And I hope everyone is going to exercise their right to vote. They say it's the right to vote. I think it's also a duty to vote, whether you vote in person, by absentee ballot or mail-in ballot. Sometimes it seems that those who complain the most and the loudest about poor governments , are those who are most reluctant to take the time to vote or even to perform a simple civil duty like jury duty. So please, everybody , if you're registered , get out and vote. If you are not registered , get registered for the primary next spring. As said in the caucus, you gave me the feedback of the status of the audit namely that it's not ready. In three weeks you will be introducing the 2022 operational budget. Again and again, year after year we have a situation in which the budget is prepared without benefit of a prior audit. That can't continue . Or if it's going to continue , you are just going to continue to have financial problems . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 So hopefully we'll get beyond that. I think one of the reasons that occurs is because you have elements , reportable entities for the budget that operate on a different fiscal year. And somehow everybody needs to be on the same fiscal year or that's going to continue indefinitely . And you also mentioned that there will be upcoming caucuses in which the department heads will come in probably one by one to answer questions about their portion of the upcoming budget. I will be particularly interested in hearing what the IT Department has to say because that one I think needs the most help. Hopefully you were all pleasantly surprised by the fact that the Scranton School District is looking at adopting the payroll tax in lieu of Business and Mercantile Tax. I think that's a major step forward for the City long-term. And though there may be some initial pain in the conversion , I think that was the best decision to make. I'm happy about that. Let's see. And I'm also very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 pleased seeing several weeks now LIPS providing a detailed list of various properties and actions with regard to them in terms of violations and statuses and what's going on with these. I think that that should continue so that the general public knows what's going on in its various departments . And that's about it for tonight . I hope everyone does get out and votes. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening, Council , Les Spindler , homeowner , taxpayer . First off, I want to say it was great that President Biden made a visit to our City last week. I thought it was great for the City. I just regret that I couldn't have met him and had a picture taken with him. I guess I didn't know the right people. I would have loved to have shown my granddaughter when she grows up that I met the President . That didn't happen. Anyway, I'm glad he was here. And I hope he comes back soon. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 It's been a while since I was here. The last time I was here I talked about the corner I live on with the blacktop they used as a curb on that corner. Some of it washed away when it rains like it did today. My sidewalks get flooded . And so far nothing 's been done. And that's another thing. Why is it you are not allowed to blacktop sidewalks in this City, but in a lot of Tripp Park there's blacktop curbs. There's no concrete curbs in Tripp Park for most of it. Where I live and Hawthorne Street -- I know Councilman Schuster could attest to that. You shouldn 't have blacktop curbs. They wear away. So I hope something can be done about that because there's many blocks in Tripp Park that are like that. On another thing on blacktop, finally those three or four blocks of Main Avenue were paved. And they did a great job except for a few things. Some of the manhole covers they didn't bring up to meet the pavement . And when you hit those manhole covers, it's like hitting a pothole . Thank God it didn't happen to me. But some people came up to me and they told me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 they hit the manhole covers. And I said they could knock your front end out of line or do more than that. So whoever did the blacktopping dropped the ball there. Next thing, what I'm going to say is not taking a shot at firefighters . Every firefighter that knows me knows I support them fully. But why are we paying firefighter s overtime to watch people at the splash pad in the summertime ? When the first day it opened I was there for the ribbon cutting . I spoke to Business Administrator West and there was a young lady there with a Red Cross shirt on. And he said that's what they were going to have. You don't need a lifeguard . All you need is somebody there is to maybe do CPR if it was needed. But why are we paying firefighters for doing that? Like I said, I respect firefighters . I support ed them for as long as I've been coming to these meetings . But I think that's a mistake to do that. And it's costing the City money. I hope that is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 something that could be changed next summer. And lastly 7-C, I wasn't here when that was introduced. Tonight 's the last meeting . I hope you could not vote on that tonight . I think you are hurting bars by passing that. Like, every so often I'll go to Stage West in West Scranton on Main Avenue. It's on Main Avenue, not a residential area. How are they harming people by having a band there? To me, it doesn't make sense. You are hurting that business . That's when they make most of their business when they have entertain ment like that and many other bars in the City. So why you would even consider this ordinance is beyond me. We want business es to stay in the City and make money not -- you're eventually going to close businesses down by doing this. And I think it's a mistake and I hope you could reconsider this ordinance . That's all I have for tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . I told 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 brother Bill before the meeting my absent wasn't to punish anybody . A cat bit me. And you can't imagine how bad this can be. I've been in the hospital . And I had blood poisoning . It's unbelievable . I want to say that I was in Geisinger for a week. And they treated me like a king. I just can't get over the -- the way that hospitals run, manages is just perfect as far as I'm concerned . And I didn't do nothing to the cat if somebody asks. All right. A presidential visit has to be a rarity for any community . I wrote this about an hour ago so don't get mad at me. A Mayor is suppose d to represent every single being in their community regardless of their political affiliation . Of course, in Scranton , that doesn't mean nothing . Not only did this Mayor deceive us as being an independent , in actuality she is an extreme leftist liberal judging by her actions in office so far. To turn her back on President Trump's visit showed this Mayor's total absence of political acceptance , political knowledge , understanding and charisma 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 needed in politics . To me, it was a show of no character whatsoever . That's just my opinion of this action. It was a display of ignorance that wasn't necessary . She should have been down there with other people when the President of the United States comes. Scranton is in dire need of good government . To now allow this coming election become one of personalities , black against white or personal beliefs and especially don't allow a poor candidate again to buy an election with her outside money as stated in the past. Sunday's editorial gloating about how well she's done in office is just leftist newspaper praising a leftist person and demeaning Mr. Shaw about not being educated for the position . She had no education for the position when she took office, you know? Neither did so many others that have gotten in office. Last month in August rather, my house insurance went up $16 a month, $16 a month. Do you know why? I'm going to tell you. Because my house is insured for more than 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 my neighborhood would bring now. It wasn't this way two years ago. My neighborhood is going downhill so drastically . I got two blocks from my house, behind the house a junkyard full of broken down trucks, six, eight, ten trucks back there and a boat right almost in my backyard less 100 feet on Throop Street, the same thing. A man got a bunch of scrap and broken down cars behind his house. Next store is the guy lives in a school bus for two years I've complained . He's still there. The house is condemned . And you people just don't care about the City no more. This is senseless . You talk about -- my taxes are three times what they were when I bought the house. How much higher do you need taxes? Well, I appreciate you letting me talk tonight . It's my opinion . I think we can certainly use a new mayor. And I don't know any more about Mr. Shaw than I read in the paper. But he can't be worse than what we got. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet tonight . Would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 anyone else in the audience like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Looking at the Home Rule Charter just as a odd point of reference , when trying to change a Home Rule Charter for the people, it's quite interesting that in times of distress or aggravation for the population , in times when the citizens would want to make those changes , the bar becomes higher for those citizens to actually make that change. Because -- the Home Rule Charter is -- it's based upon the votes from the mayoral election prior, which in times of discord when people are most unhappy about their government , that's the time when they go out and they vote the most. They vote the hardest . And they put -- they bring that conflict to the voting booth. It seems against common sense that by coming out and saying there's a problem and we need a change that actually raises the bar to make changes even harder because in times of when there is no discord and the vote is low, it's easier to make changes . But suddenly when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 there's problems , it's more difficult just by the rules that the document is bound by. And that's neither here nor there. I just found that as an interesting insight that the more change is needed, the more difficult it is under this document to actually make those changes. Moving onto -- I wondered about the COVID vaccination rates for the City Police and Fire Department . I understand you don't -- probably don't have information back yet. But the City of Philadelphia actually came back with their numbers . And I think that might key in why a number of cities and municipalities are not willing to disclose or mandate vaccination rates. In Philadelphia , the city -- for the city police department of Philadelphia , 13 percent of police are vaccinated against COVID. In the City of Philadelphia , 23 percent of firemen are vaccinated against COVID. If the City of Scranton or Philadelphia made it mandatory that you had to have vaccination against COVID, they would have 87 percent of their police force removed from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 service . So I suspect somewhere underneath all of this on choosing whether or not to enforce a mandatory vaccination probably is the numbers would devastate the Police and Fire Department just by the shear size of it. To the IT budget that was put aside, I don't understand why some of it is put under special services . I believe that the IT budget, all of the IT budget should be put under the IT budget. To hide it in different departments in different sections is convoluted . It hides transparency and allows money to be moved around from department to department with no oversight . It is a shell game and it should not be allowed . If this is an IT budget, it shouldn't be under services . If you want a contract with Bedrock , that should be under the IT. It should not be under services . And as of the IT budget, why are we spending millions of dollars for Jessup and outside of this community ? Why don't we spend it on our own people? Why do we constantly outsource City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 funds and taxes outside the community rather than to our own people? We wonder why our tax base is low why we are not getting any income. That's because contractors aren't hired from the community because somehow only outside the community is valuable for resources . And I don't understand why we continually push City taxpayer funds outside of the grasp of our local community . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . You know, hear an awful lot about taxation . Yeah, 36 percent of our City is tax exempt. And some people do a lot of good things and some people, okay, just the tax exempt. Years ago there was a coal mining operation that was KOZ down in lower West Side along the railroad tracks. And what the purpose of that was being KOZ, I don't know. But at any rate, years ago -- and I'm sure this goes back to the Evans Council -- Janet Evans Council , I recommended that we should be going after the state. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 It's a state constitution . We have to accept tax exemptions and as long as they fit within the parameters . And it's, you know, it just never seems to end. A few weeks ago, I mentioned about the Prescott Avenue falling to a text exempt probably a whole City block eventually . Our former interim mayor, his real estate company is handling that. And I was really kind of distressed when I read the article last summer. You people were on your summer break and the school district was not part of that suit to start to equalize according -- they're suppose d to subsidize according to wealth base of the population . And we have an ungodly amount of people that are under poverty line or just barely treading water. So I would hope some day that we would get after the state and try to get our just compensation out of them. It's -- because the only other answer is to have people in here complaining week in and week out that their taxes are going up and up and up. And it's probably not working for everybody . We have a lot of people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 losing houses. Onto COVID, I got some good news tonight . We're only losing 1400 people a day. And, you know, we have the antivax and antimask people. As of today, today is the 26th of -- well, I qualify for a booster shot. And I have some news for you. I'll take two. They're small. You know, so get out and get vaccinated people. That's utter stupidity . You would never want to -- people begging to take the vaccination while they're being intubated in the hospital and told that they are not going to make it very long. So, I mean, how could you be so dumb? And let's see, two weeks ago I mentioned about changing the Home Rule Charter . And I don't know if I really support that because the current political activity and opinions it might be problem atic anything that we come up with, you know. These changes aren't necessarily good for the good. A lot of times people have their own underlying agenda and they interject them. And the average person, that's one of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 the things about voting, please vote informed . Start following what people are up to or doing or what they're -- good they're doing or the bad they're doing and, you know, it would be a horrible shame to change it and have things only turn out for the worst. And I caught that on 7-C. I didn't really understand it. I had some car trouble so it's hard to show up. But, you know, I started playing guitar or taking lessons at the 12 years old. And it's no longer worth showing up at many of these bars. I'm sorry. I'm out of time. But there's only so much you could harass them. I sit up in my music room and play almost every night. I have no interest in going to a bar and getting asked to take $15 from the bartender for the whole night. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else in the audience like to address Council ? MS. WALTMAN : May I give you some paperwork ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MS. WALTMAN : Good evening , City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Council , Carla Waltman , Scranton resident . Hopefully each of you board members took the time to read the e-mail that I wrote to Chairman of the zoning board hearing or Zoning Hearing Board, Robert Gattens of which I include d all of you as a CC copy. The e-mail addressed and explained the very reasons you should not be approving Resolution 7-C so that the bars could disturb the Scranton neighborhoods . In addition to the stated reasons in the e-mail, consider the thousands of residents that work different shifts or have school age children and/or infants that are sleeping during the times that the bars want to blast music. Please do not forget about all the residents just because a dozen bar owners contact ed City Council . I hope you've consulted the Mayor, the Zoning Board and 911 and informed them of your intentions . This resolution will have a direct impact on their offices with complaints from angry neighbors . The state of PA no longer has a mask mandate or social distancing requirement s as of June 28th, 2001. The PA Liquor Control Board 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 ended temporary extension s of outdoor servicing areas around the same time. My family and the neighbors near Backstreets Tiki Bar are firsthand witness es to the lack of enforcement by the Scranton Police for noise violation s due to loudspeaker s and live entertain ment. The police were called for the better part of 2020 and nothing changed until the Pennsylvania State Liquor Control Enforcement stepped in and warned the bar about loud music. The bar owner ignored the warning s and was eventually cited. Even the bar owner ignoring the citing and he has now has at least six noise violation s as per my husband 's conversation with the Liquor Control Enforcement Officers . Also stated in the e-mail to Robert Gattens was the fact that when the Scranton Police showed up at our house because we were complain ing about the music, we were told that they can't enforce the Scranton noise ordinance because a violation would not hold up in court because they don't have a calibrated sound level meter. Since no calibrate d sound level 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 meter is present within the Scranton Police Office, then no loud music violations will ever be made. You need to have written confirmation , not verbal because they will tell you anything you want to hear that a calibrated sound level meter is available at the Scranton Police Office. You need to have written confirmation , not verbal of the names of officer s that have received training . You need to have written confirmation , not verbal of the date it was purchase d and the serial number of the level meter owned by the Scranton Police. As I stated before, the calibrated sound level meter does not exist as per the numerous officer s and a supervisor that showed up at my house. Scranton Chapter 317, noise has a definition for noise disturbance property boundary , real property sound level meter zoning districts . It also contains 317-7 Prohibited Acts A(1)(a). The Prohibited Acts requirement is exactly the same as the PA Liquor Control Board's requirement that noise does not cause a disturbance across a real property boundary .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 317-7 Prohibited Acts A(4) loudspeaker public address systems is exactly the same as the PA Liquor Control requirement that noise does not cause a disturbance across a real property boundary . 317-8, Sound Level Limits -- and these are all in the paperwork that you have online. The sound level limits by receiving land use slash district 10 feet inside a lot in a residential district Monday through Saturday until 9 p.m., excluding major holidays is 69 decibels . The paper that I just gave you has 70 decibel s as a dishwasher . That's what 70 decibel s is. My house is 225 feet away from his property . By law, I should not be able to hear a dishwasher from that distance . From 7 p.m. -- I'm sorry, from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. all day Sunday and all major holidays , the sound decibel requirement is 64 -- MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, ma'am. MS. WALTMAN : -- which is between an air conditioner and dishwasher. MR. GAUGHAN : Ma'am, I'm sorry, I don't want to interrupt you. But your time is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 up. MS. WALTMAN : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MS. WALTMAN : Well, I'm against 7-C. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Just please state your name for the record. MR. WALTMAN : John Waltman, resident of the City of Scranton , Carla's husband . We have called numerous times probably in excess of 40 times last year noise, noise issues with Backstreets Tiki Bar. No citations were issued by the Scranton Police. They were all ignored , various reasons given, some of them absurd. Citations were issued by Liquor Control Enforcement . They were listening to the same issues. They found reason to cite and then later fine. I got reasons why they weren't going to do it. You know, I was told by one officer it doesn't sound loud to me, maybe you need to turn your television up. Another officer tells me, oh, it's his birthday . He's celebrating his 50th birthday tonight . I read it on Facebook . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 don't get any enforcement on that. It's loud. The most popular reason was, we don't have a sound level meter. Now, with all due respect to the Police Chief, if he can't enforce it when I'm calling and there is an issue that exists, I'm being told he enforces it. He doesn't have a sound meter. How is it enforced in other areas of the City? Is it being enforced in the other areas of the City? MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sorry, were you posing that question to us? We were told by the police department that it was being enforced and that they -- the correspondence that they had with our Solicitor , Kevin Hayes was that the Chief of Police said that they could take the enforcement up. So that's what we were being told. MR. WALTMAN : I have to disagree with it. His officers told me they can't enforce it without a sound meter. If they were enforcing it, he wouldn't have gotten citation s from liquor control . He would have already been quieted down. There's no enforce ment from my perspective . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 It may be enforced in other areas of the City, but it's not enforced when I call. I don't know if there is anything going on there, but I don't get any satisfaction with it. I'm not the only one in the neighborhood complaining . They're just not showing up. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : I guess just three -- three citizen complaints . I had a complaint from 1800 Cedar Avenue. I had a complaint of 1608-1610 Hawthorne Street, the bushes are overgrown . On Cedar Avenue there was garbage and rodents . And then I got another complaint from 1434-1436 Dorothy Street where the neighbors are getting cockroaches in their homes from another resident . So I'll follow up after the meeting with you, Frank, about that. Last week I asked about the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 personnel report. We asked several times about a personnel report. Was there any news or update on the personnel report? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, Mr. Schuster , we sent out a second request a few days ago. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. I know we had a resignation this week and we had some retirements that Mr. Gaughan spoke of. And then we also got some job descriptions in our e-mail. So it's still on my mind. So hopefully we'll get a response from that. That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a few. So last week it was brought to my attention by some concerned residents about the disrepair of the hometown hero banners that were rolled out in West Scranton last May. Mr. Voldenberg , thank you. You reached out to Todd Pousley of NeighborWorks . He respond ed to me very quickly Friday. And I would like to report out our conversation . So as we discuss ed on the phone, repairing existing banners -- okay, so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 NeighborW orks will be hiring Jaworski 's to properly hang any of the 30 existing banners that have fallen down or become loose. These are the ones that were piloted . I expect they will be able to be done soon. But not may -- may not happen before Veterans Day. I hope they are. And this stems from a hardware issue more than anything . So that has been identified and will be corrected . So hanging of new banners because people are inquiring about them because they were put on a list. So we also plan to hang 145 new banners. This will be a total of 175 banners along Main Avenue. And if we run out of room, Luzerne Street. We'll reach out to everyone on our existing waiting list to give them the opportunity to purchase a banner. If anyone would like to add to the waiting list, please contact our office, meaning Neighbor Works at 570-558-2490. And then the replacement of banners , so two years from now we'll take down the 175. That includes the pilot ones, return them to the families who purchased them and then take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 new application s for the banners to replace them. So I hope this satisfies concerns or questions . And also, so I got a little disturbing inquiry or concerns brought to my attention the other day. So during COVID, you know, the past 18 months, there was some emergency purchases that, you know, of course, are reimbursed . But these were for two gas powered very expensive gas fired commercial power washers for cleaning and sanitizing which was great. But I'm hearing right now that one of them is missing or gone missing . So, you know, I hope it's a rumor. But, Mr. Voldenberg , could you please send some correspondence to the DPW and ask if they are still in possession of said power washers . And this should be an easy request that should be satisfied . I'd like to know by the end of the week, please. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Now, I just want to touch base just on the issues in Bellevue with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 the trucks. We talked about it for a few weeks. And, you know, I think we got some movement. But there was one more question posed to me that I'm sure could be clarified -- answered in this room but I promised I would ask it. So we all know that the officer who was certified to weigh the trucks and issue citation s retired, which is wonderful for him. And we thank him for all of his hard work. But the question posed to me was, now that he's retired, will someone in his absence show up at the magistrate 's office, you know, when this takes place? And I'm sure that it does. Does it? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, I followed up with the Chief. And he said someone would attend the magistrate hearings . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I'm sure that was it. But I just wanted clarification . And then what else do we have here? So actually this afternoon I was walking in the hall to come here. And I was stopped by two very nice residents , didn't want to speak at the meeting and that's okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 I said I would speak on their behalf. But there's an issue on 822 Capouse Avenue. It's a second floor apartment that is vacant. And there's a lot of homeless people going in and out. There is all kinds of noise. There's like tiki torches on the upstairs back porch. They're hanging on the porch. You know, they are violating open container issues. And then on the corner of New and Capouse there is also an issue which is very close to this in proximity to this address that -- again, some open container issues and selling drugs. So after I spoke with these people, I promised I would bring it up in Fifth Order. But I did have a conversation with Mr. Voldenberg before the meeting . And he told me that, you know, these complaints are filed that the police are looking into it and there is action being taken. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , sir. MR. MCANDREW : So I hope that, you know, these two nice residents hear about that tonight . They said they'd watch the meeting . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Let's see here. So I have one more. So I have been asking -- I inquired . Last week I've been inquiring for a year about this illegal service station activity that's going on at the rear of 1149 Sloan Street. So I asked a week ago. And we haven't heard back yet right, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, we haven't. MR. MCANDREW : This is going on over a year. So I got a call Friday from a neighbor over there saying, oh, it's still going on there. There's cars parked the wrong way. The garage doors are open. They're painting, you know, which is horrible because of how dangerous it is. And I did reach out to the police department . They sent someone over which all their responsibility -- all they could do is just ticket the vehicle s that are parked the wrong way or that aren't -- have proper registrations . But in order to stop this, you know, illegal service garage, you know, my understanding and as I've been told all along, it's a code enforcement issue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 They have the power to go in. The police can't walk inside this garage. So I've been asking about this property . I don't see it on the summary that we keep getting , you know, every other month which is great. But I remember last year, you know, there was so many citation s issued that they would be charged $500 a day if this continues . So guess what, it's continuing . So I really want to follow up on this. I haven't gotten anything back from code enforcement within the last two weeks or even I brought this up a month ago. So please follow up with this, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I was going to ask about the personnel reports that we've requested as well but Councilman Schuster beat me to the punch there. The other thing I wanted to bring up because I know over the weekend there was some resident s that were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 complaining about 609 Prescott Avenue which is terribly overgrown and the house is in pretty bad shape. And it has been for some time now. And we had received an update from LIPS that will be in Third Order next week and that property was listed on there. And back in June there was a violation filed with the magistrate . But they still haven't received a trial date. And I know that's been problematic for a lot of properties the same issue that it ends up being held up at the magistrate and they don't get a hearing date or hearing dates get changed or pushed back and then the issues don't get resolved. And before we know it, it's wintertime and then there is snow removal issues. So I will keep pushing on that to see if we can get a hearing date to at least get that property resolved . And then in my meeting with Director Cipriani last week, we did discuss this list that she's been sending us with the updates which has been helpful for I believe Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 and the public. But it is getting to be a lengthy amount at this point. So she'll work on clearing out any of the ones that have been resolved that we don't still need on the list. And then we did discuss as well the progress with OpenGov . And I think it's going to be a very useful tool for Council because we'll have the ability to go in there and see what steps have been taken on these problem properties to update citizens when we're receiving complaints . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just briefly , I was going to bring up the fact that the Electric City sign has been not lit for the past week or so. But I was happy to see today that Fidelity Bank has agreed to pay the electric bill so that the Electric City sign could be relit. So I just want to thank Dan Santaniello and Fidelity Bank for stepping up to the plate on that issue. In terms of the transition to payroll prep, I'm a little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 concerned that we're starting to fall behind the eight ball in making that transition . There was suppose d to be legal services for appeals processes and then also a bid put out for a collector of the Payroll Prep Tax. That's not something that we could just do on the back end. It has to be done before we even think about implementing that is get those processes in place. So I am concerned . And I urge the administration to get on that as quickly as possible because we can't wait any longer. You know, we're coming up on two months. We can't just switch a tax and then not have a collector and not have a process that goes with it. So I am concerned about that. Also, Miss Hodowanitz brought up the audit again. And it really is unacceptable that we get to the end of October every year and not have the audit in hand as we move into budget season. At this point we're just going to have to relook at the contract . And hopefully when we put it back out to bid, have specific dates of when this stuff needs to be done on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 both ends because I don't know -- when you ask questions about it, the auditor blames someone else and then someone else blames the auditor . So it's -- we really do have to get that straightened out. Also lastly, I got a question , a resident saw an RFQ regarding Connell Park and it was for community based organizations for the use of the space that is known as Connell Park. Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to check with the Parks Director and see what this actually means? It is a public park so community based organization s should be able to use it as they see fit. So could you just check and see what that's all about? And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I had received a letter from a woman in the 3200 block of Powell Court. The woman was concerned about flooding in the 3200 block of Powell Court which is adjacent to Birney Avenue. Fifty years of devastating flooding , 50 years of pleas for help unheeded, garages inundated with water, yard, flooded back porch, sewer water spewing through house drains and no 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 help at all from any City officials . This woman provided me with a folder going back to the 1970s wherein there is correspondence between the Scranton Sewer Authority and Mayor Gene Peters. So this has been an issue that has gone on for over 50 years. So we'll ask Mr. Voldenberg to follow up on it to see if we can help that woman and find out what's going on there. The second thing I wanted to mention , I agree with Councilman Donahue on the audit. We did receive another update from Kohanski and Company . They stated that most of the financial statement audit is complete and under review. However , the audits of the Redevelopment Authority and the Sewer Authority remain outstanding . They received a schedule of expenditures of federal awards on October 13th and returned it to OECD and the Business Office for questions related to missing information and awards. They believe that they have all the information now and they are expecting to start the compliance audit this week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 Regarding the Portnoff Law Associate s collections , I think Miss Schumacher asked about this last week. Mary Jo Sheridan the City Treasurer will provide a monthly report each month and for the Portnoff Law Associates collections , the amended resolution we adopted at our September 21st Council meeting. And the first report is expected post month end October . So we should be getting that very soon. We also sent a request to DPW for repair and regular maintenance to the lookout on Route 307 on East Mountain . We continue to ask questions about the Nay Aug Pool complex and an update to what the plan is. I don't quite understand the response that they're waiting for the park study. We have already received the study and options on what can be done or what should be done with the pool complex and the splash pad. I did have a chance yesterday to speak to the Mayor about this and reiterated to her that I think we really need to get moving on this. Time is of the essence . And I'm of the belief that we need to explore a capital 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 borrowing , refinancing a creative method to fund that project . The longer that that sits vacant with no pools, the worse it is for the residents of the Hill Section and of our City as a whole. We continue to look for answers on the SAFER Grant. We -- I posed question s and Council agreed to send correspondence to the Mayor on September 23rd. We followed up with another correspondence . We ask very pointed question s about the SAFER Grant. I was told that there was a 30-day extension . But we cannot get anything in writing from the Mayor or her administration . I'm really not sure what the hold up is. But as days go by, it does get concerning that we don't seem to receive any response . Also as Councilman Schuster and Council woman Rothchild asked, we have asked for a monthly listing of employee s and employee vacancies by City department . Again, another request that goes unheeded and unanswered . I asked multiple times for a very simple request on employee s currently on workmen's comp and disability . Again, this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 a report that can be printed out within minutes . No response . Again, at this point it's getting to the point of being disturbing . And there are several others as well. We've asked for information and for some reason we cannot get a response . We did send a request to the Scranton Police Department on October 26th for a status and resolution on an abandoned vehicle in the 400 block of Phelps Street that was damaged in a severe rainstorm and flooding in that area. We also continue to have an opening on the City's Ethics Board. So if anyone in the public is interest , please send a resume and a letter of interest to Frank Voldenberg in the City Clerk's Office or you could e-mail it to Fvoldenberg @scrantonpa .gov. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – APPROVING THE INTERMUNICIPAL TRANSFER OF A RESTAURANT LIQUOR LICENSE R14696, CURRENTLY OWNED BY MICHAEL A.

CONRAD BOSLEY, 13 LESLIE DRIVE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , 18505 AS A MEMBER OF THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE REVIEW BOARD EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 20, 2021. MR. BOSLEY WILL BE REPLACING NELL O’BOYLE WHO RESIGNED EFFECTIVE AUGUST 17, 2021. MR. BOSLEY WILL FILL THE UNEXPIRED TERM OF MS. O’BOYLE AND WILL EXPIRE ON OCTOBER 11, 2024. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 228, 2021 – RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING CITY OF SCRANTON TO SEEK EXEMPTION FROM SECTION 4-493(34) OF THE LIQUOR CODE. MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'd like to -- I think there was some confusion tonight on what this legislation actually is. So I will ask Solicitor Hayes now -- or Attorney Hayes now, can you just take us through this legislation what this does for the public? ATTY. HAYES: Yes, I agree that there seemed to be some confusion in the comment s that were made. So what this would do, is allow the City of Scranton Police Department to be the sole ones to respond to noise complaints . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 It does not in any way change the Liquor Control Board's ability to respond to anything having to do with the licenses themselves , but rather they would not respond to any issues involving noise complaints . Once City Council approves this tonight , it does not mean that it automatically goes into place. What would happen next is more information would be forward ed to the Liquor Control Board. Public hearings would be held. And then they would ultimately make the decision about whether or not it's appropriate for the City of Scranton . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. What we heard last week from one of -- the business owner from Backstreets Tiki Bar -- and this is what I thought didn't make sense to be honest with you was that they -- and I'm just singling them out because they were here last week. But this goes for other bars throughout the City that they were authorized by the zoning board to operate their bar until 9 p.m. on weekday s and 10 p.m. on Saturdays . So they are authorized by the City to do that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 However , they were getting fined by the PLCB. So they're authorized to do something , yet they're getting punished for doing it which does not make sense. And one of the things that the City relaxed the rules on a little bit since the pandemic in order to help the business , was to operate outside so that they could, you know, operate in a safe manner because of COVID. So that's one of the things that I really didn't understand . One of the things and one of the reasons why I'll be voting for this is because it was explained to us by Chief Namiotka that he believes that the City Police Department could adequately handle the noise complaint s within the City without the involvement of the PLCB. Now, if there has to be some sort of a piece of equipment , that I'm not aware of that. But we will look into that. And if that needs to be included in the 2022 budget for the police department we will investigate that. But this in no way, you know, gives free rein to business owners. It just makes it I think fairer for business owners so that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 are not getting in trouble and fined by the PLCB for doing something that they are authorize d to do by the City. So you can't say on one hand they could do it and then on the other hand they get fined. So that's why I'll be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I would just like to say that I was in the meeting with both Attorney Hayes, Assistant Solicitor Lafferty from the administration and both Chief Namiotka and Lieutenant Mayo. And they -- there was -- it came to the conclusion that they would be able to handle these noise complaints on their own. And again, this is only a one year. So it's a one-year trial basis. And then we would have to go and apply for it again in a year. We also reached out to a couple municipalities that have done this in the past couple of years to see what their experience was with it. And their experience was positive . So that's why we're going to, you know, pass this tonight and then, you know, hopefully it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 goes -- then it goes to the Liquor Control Board. And then hopefully , you know, we'll see what this next year brings. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I would like to add I know last week I voiced my support for this piece and explained those reasons . However , I do have reservations about the enforcement . We've had -- we've seen issues with enforcing other ordinances like for fireworks . And I wouldn't want to see the same thing happen with this piece here. And I wasn't aware of the lack of a calibrated sound level meter. But if that's the case, I would like to ensure that the police department has what they need in order to enforce the noise ordinance . So if we could request clarification if they have that meter and if not, what we need to do in order to receive that and the appropriate training for our officers . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew .
