Basedonmyinitial review ofthebudget I dohaveseveral questions ,someofwhichI discussed withmycolleagues backinthe caucus tonight .Thefirstquestion thatI havefortheadministration istaking alook attherecommendations inthethree-year exitplanI'dliketoaskwhichofthese recommendations areunderwayalready justto giveusalistofthose,whichofthose recommendations areexpected tobecompleted in2-18justtogiveusageneral update and timeline.Acomprehensive updateonthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 status ofthoserecommendations . Oneofmyinitial concerns isthat theexpenditures proposed bythecityin 2018are$91,692,110.Theexitplan projections are$88,184,000foradifference ofabout4percent ,so$3million so according toPEL'sletter wearealmost 118 percent overcapital expenditures ,somyone question Ididposethisinthecaucus,and I'dlikeclarification onthis,forallof theincreases incapital expenditures where arewe--arewereimbursing thatinthe budget through theproceeds fromthesaleof theSewerAuthority andhowisthatgoingto workorarewejusttaking itoutofthe budget?SowhereareweusingtheSewer Authority proceeds whereweareincreasing allofthesecapital expenditures . Underdepartmental earnings narrative ,itsaysthattherewillbea redefinition oftheenacting ordinance defining procedures forutility companies , interactions withthecitywhichshould create amoreeffective program .Iwould liketoaskforatimelineonthis.What1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 doesthisredefinition include because we didrevamptheoldordinance ,wehavehad numerous discussions onapavecut ordinance ,soIjustwanted toknowwhat thisredefinition wouldinclude andwhy isn'ttheprogram effective now.Wewere toldbytheadministration months agothat itwasgoingpretty well. Ialsobrought inupinthecaucus therealestate transfer tax,weare lowering thisagainbytwo-tenths ofa percent andIjusthaveaninitial concern aboutwhether ornotwearegoingtobeable tohitourrevenue projection ,whichis around $3million similar towhatitwasin 2017.Mr.Evanssaidhewasgoingto provide moredatatobackupthatclaimso I'dappreciate thatforNovember 30.

Keeping withthepavecutordinance underdepartmental earnings ,thisisone thingIdidn'tunderstand,undertheline itemforpavecutsforthegascompany we budgeted $251,910in2017,asfarasAugust 30wehavecollected nothing ,andin2018we arebudgeting $195,000soI'dliketoknow whywehavehaven'tcollected anything yet asofAugust 30thisyear,andI'dliketo1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 knowhowthe$195,000figure wasarrived at for2018.

UndertheBusiness Administrator 's Office,Iwouldliketoknowifwehavean estimate onhowhiring thehealth insurance administrator willeffect theprojected 5to 10percent increase thisclerical and non-unionhealth insurance .

UnderLicensing andInspections ,it saysthatthedepartment willprovide amore userfriendly method ofpermit issuance and payment ,Iwouldliketogetatimelineon thatifthat'spossible for2018. UnderthePoliceDepartment ,the overtime isoverbudget by$133,360asof September 30.Iwouldliketoknowhowmuch ofthatovertime isreimbursable .Capital expenditure increase of$160,000,the reasoning beingsidewalk replacement at police headquarters forsafety reasons and apparently thecity'sinsurance riskmanager isrequiring this.Iwouldlikealittle bitmorebackground onthisbecause Iwas undertheimpression thatafewyearsago theoneoftheunions stepped upand replaced thesidewalks outinfrontofthe headquarters ifI'mnotmistaken atlittle tonocost,Ithinktheyprovided thelabor soIwouldlikemoreofanexplanation on thisonwhythose--whathappened tothe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 sidewalks . Also,underthePoliceDepartment , theothersalary isbudgeted at$401,00for 2018.Thisisalargeincrease fromthe 2017budget figure of$267,00,soI'dlikea clarification onwhattheothersalary constitutes andwhythelargeincrease . TheFireDepartment budget thereis anincrease inovertime from250,000in2017 to275,000,notalargeincrease ,butI wouldliketoknowthereasoningbehind that figure. Also,thenarrative saysthatthe budget fundstheremaining costsof firehouseimprovement --thefirehouse improvement project abovethe$1.5million thatwasgivenlastyear,andalsoreplaces concrete padsandsidewalks ateachofthe firehouses.Iwouldliketoknowwhatthe remaining costsinclude andarethesidewalk replacements andconcrete padsnecessary ,so alittle bitmoreclarification onthat. Also,undertheFireDepartment , othersalary 2017isbudgeted at$285,000. AsofSeptember 30,wehavespent$423,000,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 roughly $423,000foranoverbudgeted figure of$137,299soI'dliketoknowwhythatis, andunderothersalary in2018weare budgeting that$450,000so,again,Iwould liketoknowthereasoning forthat. $300,000underDPWforthe Novembrino PoolComplex,sothat'scoming outofthebudget.Imentioned thisinthe beginning ofmyquestioning andI'dliketo knowifwearegoingtobetaking someof theproceeds fromtheSewerAuthority money andusingthattowards the$300,000. Underboards,commissions and nonprofits ,wearegoingtoinstall sidewalks atMt.Pleasant development site for$50,000anda$10,000annual contribution totheScranton Plan.Again, I'dlikealittle morebackground onthis andisthedonation forthesidewalks necessary andwhycouldn'totherfunding havebeenprovided ? TheScranton Tomorrow budget,weare giving a$75,000contribution ,sothat Scranton Tomorrow couldbethedowntown economic development coordinator andIhave1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 saidthisbefore,Idon'tnecessarily disagree withthis,butIwouldliketoknow whatwearenowpaying OECDforinsome respects anyways.IstheOECDtaking on lessresponsibility because inthebudget thatposition isdueforaraise,soI'd likeananswer tothat. UndertheHumanResources budget, stationery andoffice supplies weseean increase from$500in2017to$25,000in 2018.Thereisareason forthiscost. It'sforequipment acquisition associated withthedepartment safety andenvironment al review whichisauthorized bytheCity SafetyCommittee whichIthinkisagood thing,butIwouldlikeclarification onor iftheyknowthisyetwhatkindofequipment wearepurchasing forthatamount. IntheLicense andInspections Department ,again,thereisanincrease in thedemolition program from$35,000to $65,000because ofgreater activity . Through September 30,andthisnumber could haveincreased obviously ,butwehaveonly spent$12,540onthedemolition program so1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 I'dlikeanupdate ontheprogress ofthe demolition program usingmoneyfromthe budget andnotOECDandtherationale of thiswholeprogram andthatincrease andis thereatargeted approach tothisprogram . Also,oneoftheinteresting things thatInoticed inthebudget wasthe professional services isgoingfrom$7,500 to$15,000mainly because theyaregoingto doanenergy efficiency evaluation ofthe DPWfacility .I'dlikeanupdate onthis, moreinformation andexactly whatitentails andiftheyknowyetwhatkindofsavings we mightseefromthatprogram . IseeMrs.Jefferies intheback there,thereisanincrease insignand paintmaterial from$12,500to$50,000,so obviously thereisgoingtobemoreofa focusonreplacing thestreet signs throughout thecity,atleastthat'swhat I'massuming fromlooking atthat. Somyquestion thereisistherea newsignprogram ,whatisthemethodology behind thisincrease ,howisthedepartment approaching thereplacement signsthroughout1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 thecity,aretheykeeping aninventory ,are theydoingitbyneighborhood ,isthere documentation ofallofthissoIwouldlike anupdate onthatbecause I'minterested in itmyself andIthinkit'sahottopic throughout thecity. UndertheHighways Department there wasanincrease inparksandrecreation supplies fromzerodollars in2017to $62,000in2018soI'dliketoknowthe reason forthat. Garage increase incapital expenditures to$25,000,I'dliketoget moredetails andexplanation onthat. Forcontingency weareincreasing from2017wehad$585,000andnowweare goingtohave$705,799.10for2018soI wouldlikeanexplanation behind that increase ,andtheCourtawardincrease from 2017was$200,000andwearebudgeting $350,000in2018soIwouldlikean explanation behind thataswell. Andthereismanyotherquestions thatIhaveinherethat--or clarifications Ishould sayrather,butI1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 willbesubmitting thistothe administration ,andjusttoendmycomments whatIwouldhopeforinthefuture,andMr. Evanshadmentioned thistomeearlier andI thinkitwouldbebeneficial .Youhaveto remember ,youknow,Mrs.Schumacher was asking usdirect questions .Weonly received thebudget lastWednesday .I'm assuming theelection played aroleinthat, thenMr.Bulzoni cameThursday ,whichwe appreciated ,butatleastfrommy perspective Ididn'thaveenough timeto comeupwithallofthesequestions and,you know,myneedforfurther clarification on thisbudget.Sointhefuture,and Mr.Evanshadproposed thisaswell,Iwould liketoseeaworksession wherewesit around thattablefortwoorthreehours, however long,sowecangothrough allof thisstuffindetail because wehavevoteon it.
