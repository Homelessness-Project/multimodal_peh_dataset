MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially Mr. Louis J. Martini , a South Scranton resident who passed away last week for more than 27 years who was employed as a firefighter for the City retiring with the rank of Chauffeur . Let us also take a special moment of silence for all of the people in our community , country and world who had passed away from the coronavirus . This pandemic has turned our world upside down, but we must remain hopeful and strong. We continue to pray for the doctors , nurses, researchers and all medical professionals who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they have protection and peace.

Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. So tomorrow night, Wednesday night at Nay Aug Park, it will be the last concert -- outdoor concert for the year. It will be a band called Classic Rock Express . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Anybody else have any announcements ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Okay. I have three announcements . The first announcement based on the technical issues that we had tonight , we weren't able to have a full caucus. We did have planned a caucus with the administration with the Mayor, the Business Administrator and the OECD Director to give us a two-pronged update on financial projection s for the City and also on the way that the administration is handling blight. Unfortunately because of the technical issues, we weren't able to start until I was able to livestream the meeting . So we're going to reschedule that for next Tuesday , October 6th. And that will be at 5:45 p.m., and hopefully we won't have any technical issues. Also, we have decided to make a slight change to the time of day in which public comment will be received in the office and via e-mail. We're making a change from 4:30 p.m., the day of the meeting on Tuesday , to no later than 3 p.m., in order to compile all of the submission s and to enable them to be read aloud during Fourth Order Public 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Participation . So that will commence next week, October 6th. Again, all public participation comments and question s should be submitted by the new deadline of 3 p.m., on the day of the meeting . Also, please keep in mind that you should keep your written comment s -- try to keep them to at least five minutes as if we were in Council Chambers . Also, NDC will attend our caucus on October 20th, 2020 at 5:45 p.m., to provide their third quarter parking update. Mrs. Reed, Fourth Order. MS. REED: Thank you. We have two submissions this week. The first is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O Please place into Third Order of your next Meeting the analysis on which Council based its decision to transition to the Payroll Preparation Tax. O When may we expect to see all City Contracts on the City website ? O When will Council return to their City Hall chambers for Meetings ? You may 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 have noticed the Senior Centers , who have been designated the most vulnerable citizens have returned to the Senior Centers . Dunmore Borough meet in person as well. It is time to return to City Hall. O Answers to question have been lagging again. I am hoping you have the Capital Budget question answers to share tonight . O Last week I believe Mr. Donohue said he believed the Police Code Enforcers have not been called back from furlough . If this is true why were they fuloughed in the first place and why not be called back. The revenue they generated was a contractual commitment to the people of the City. Do we have to sue the City to get the safety and revenue for which we contracted ? O I would request each member of Council read, or re-read the Administration 's 2020 Budget proposal to which Council agreed. There was much promised that is not being provided and this citizen would like to know why. Again, that was from Marie Schumacher .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 The second submission is from Mr. Coyne is as follows : Greetings members of City Council . Last week you responded to my submission , and from that I submit this. I understand that the 2020 budget has been approved and it done, but nowhere along the road, is it impossible to give direction to the Mayor/executive branch, or evaluate changes to the following years budget. The City home rule charter sets up council as the legislative and purse strings branch and mayor as executive . As part of that in congress in preparation for the budget, congress lets known what it will not approve in the following year, or gives guidance . Has City council evaluated based on last years budget, what may reasonably be excluded or drawn a line at what it will reject if submitted for 2021? Will Council introduce or put to a vote the separation of the trash collection fee from the general funds as a way to audit real costs of collection and disposal ? Has council received any response on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 the annual profit from the recycling center and it's due share of any potential profits ? Last. I was shocked and you spoke of Scranton Tomorrow being paid by the University of Scranton 's Payment in Lieu of Taxes. No wonder they took up the call to do whatever at the UofS calling . The Payment in Lieu of taxes should not be a pass thru to an outside group, that works to improve land and public spaces directly in the area the U of S owns, but to aid all of the citizens of Scranton . The entire $200,000 payment in the U of S pays to the city, never goes to the City and retiring debt, since $225,000 goes to Scranton tomorrow . Why can the University designate the where the taxes go? Can we as taxpayers also do the same.. Designating taxes to projects on my street only? It's concerning city taxes are running a pass-thru from a non profit to a non profit goup. Every step of the way. We need a change, this includes the budget. As for the IT items. The request is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 bloated and undefined . A third party to create and monitor a firewall is more expensive then a one time purchase of equipment and hiring a security professional on budget, who can be used for other tasks when the firewall is set up. The $300,000 on the first year alone would cover the extra professional in firewalls and equipment . Surface computer /pads are 3 times as expensive as smaller laptops without the easy of making them conform to an internal security and data retention policy. The only possible reason for anyone having one is the desire to have something flashy and upscale . Maybe a License and inspections person would qualify for the use as a tablet, to take pictures and draw on a diagram . For standard work, it's getting a perk wanted but not needed. The overall IT path and budget needs a lot more attached detail before it should be approved . Thanks Tom Coyne (This concludes letters as submitted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 to Council for public comment .) MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. At this time, I'd like to ask if someone would make a motion to accept public comment from Miss Shumacher and from Mr. Thomas Coyne. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept public comment . MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion. Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to check through a couple of these things. To place into -- we'll start with Miss Shumacher . To place into Third Order the analysis on which Council based its decision to transition to the Payroll Preparation Tax, there's been no official decision on that. No official -- there's been no legislation in other words, correct , Councilman Donahue ? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, so that's -- that's still in preparation for the court hearing that is still yet to be scheduled . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 was just trying -- last week I was just given an update on where we stood in terms of getting that information together . MR. GAUGHAN : And I believe there was a whole meeting , an analysis done in public with the former Business Administrator , members of the community , members of different institutions ; and I think that's on YouTube if anybody wants to watch it. But I've been on the record on why I think transitioning from a Business and Mercantile Tax to a Payroll Preparation Tax is a good move. It's more fair. I've been on the record multiple times at meeting s stating the case on that one. "When may we expect to see all City contracts on the City website?" I was speaking with the City Controller , John Murray. And he is working with the administration to make that happen. So I don't know exactly when, but I'm hopeful in the near future. So the City Controller is working on that. But Council wouldn't have any control over that I don't believe . So it would be up to the administration and now the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 controller has taken the lead on it. As for when Council will return to chambers for meetings , the cases in Lackawanna County are through the roof. Every day there is 40, 50, 60-some cases. It's not safe to be back in a confined area like chambers with five Council members , the City Clerk, Council Solicitor , Miss Carrera and then you have however many members of the public will come. We've already made that decision as a group that we did not think it was in the best interest , not only to the Council but more importantly to the public to be in those chambers . And I'm certainly not going to put anybody in danger because , you know, one person wants to be back in chambers . I understand , you know, the push to do that. And I think eventually we'll get there. But now is not the time to do it. So that is something that we'll continue to monitor as we move forward . But I don't foresee it being anytime soon based on the conditions . We are still waiting on the capital budget questions . So when we get them, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 obviously we'll share them. I can't, you know, make them up out of thin air. We've posed them to the administration . And as we heard tonight in the caucus, hopefully by next week we'll get them. And I think those are the only question s and then two comment s from Miss Shumacher at the end. Mr. Coyne had a question , "Has City Council evaluated based on last years' budget what may reasonably be excluded or draw a line at what it will reject if submitted for 2021?" Number one, I don't think you could make that evaluation until you've seen the 2021 budget because we're not sure yet what exactly the administration , what line items they're going to include that may have been included from last year. So it's difficult to say. But certainly that evaluation is ongoing, especially now within the next few weeks when the administration brings Council in to discuss the budget. And then in talking with the Mayor, we're going to do things a lot differently than they were done in the past 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 where the budget was some kind of nuclear secret. There's going to be public hearing s, more than one. The Mayor and the Business Administrator will come to Council caucus and explain the budget, go through the budget. So it will be much more transparent than it has been in the past. Again, when -- as far as I was concerned in my experience , we didn't get the budget until November . And then it was like pulling teeth trying to get a question answered out of anyone. So I think that will change this year. "Has Council received any response on the annual profit from the Recycling Center and its due share of any potential profits?" We did receive a lengthy response from the Recycling Center. I was talking to Solicitor Hayes about that earlier today. We are still reviewing that. And I think we'll, you know, bring that back up for discussion when we have to vote on selecting a company to engage in our recycling collection moving forward based on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the events that have happened . "Will Council introduce or put to a vote the separation of the trash collection fee from the General Funds as a way to audit real cost of collection and disposal ?" I'm not sure I understand that question . I don't -- I don't believe that we would need to vote on moving the trash fee into the real estate tax bill. But we'll leave that up to Solicitor Hayes to look into that maybe for next week. And then there's a couple things on Scranton Tomorrow . And I'll address those items in Fifth Order. Anybody else have anything on the question for public comment ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, on the question , do we know if the new Business Administrator plans on presenting any of the Payroll Preparation Tax information to Council ? I'm new to Council , but I'm not sure if Jess had an opportunity to hear any of that presentation . I know Mark did on the School Board. But I don't know if he's heard it on Council . And on the School Board, we're always promised the Berkheimer numbers by the City which never really happened . So, I'm mean, I'd really like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 to take a good look at those numbers that the City has compiled which I haven't seen yet and get a meeting together sooner than later with the school district to discuss with them. And I think they might still have some barriers . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. You can request that. Anybody else on public comment ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, just to piggyback off of what Mr. Schuster just said, I watched the Scranton School Board meeting last night. And they did touch base under -- during their finance committee meeting about the Payroll Prep Tax. They're still looking at receiving more data before they make their decision . And so they're kind of waiting to hear where we're at and have some type of meeting and have a discussion . MR. GAUGHAN : Well, I know that Councilman Donahue -- I'm sorry, Mark, I didn't mean to cut you off. MR. MCANDREW : No, just that I heard that last night. You know, they're moving in the same direction maybe. But they require a little more discussion and a little more data 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 collection . MR. GAUGHAN : Well, Councilman Donahue , correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Pat Laffey from the school district , yourself, members of PEL and the administration meeting weekly on this stuff? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, we haven't met in a couple weeks. But myself, Mr. Deeley and Mr. Laffey talked last week via zoom. And we did a share screen looking over some of the data just trying to marry up what was the work done in 2019 with the list we got then for 2020 -- or the work that was done for 2018 but then the list that we got for 2019. And there were just, you know, you know, a business that would have two separate names in two separate years because they changed hands. And it's marrying up that data and making sure that all the nonprofit s are excluded . So we're setting a rate on what we can actually collect . And, Mr. Schuster , in terms of, you know, going back to last year, I know Pat Laffey wasn't involved in any of those discussion s at that point -- at this point last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 year. But he is -- he's been in the discussions since the beginning of August. MR. SCHUSTER : That's what I've heard. Since the new administration took over over there, Pat has been now allowed to come to meetings . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question for public comment ? MR. MCANDREW : That was stated last night that there are ongoing meetings but what was also stated is the board is waiting for, you know, the collection of data from the -- so they could make a decision . So they're still waiting . They're not involved in this process until it comes to them. Do you understand what I'm saying? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Yes. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, because we're still doing a complete analysis . So we're doing what's taxable and then we're also bringing into the fold also what, you know, what was paid in BP and Merc compared to what would be paid in payroll prep and so looking at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 it a bunch of different ways and compiling all of that information together . MR. GAUGHAN : All those in favor of the motion to accept public comment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. SCHUSTER : Not at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I have two things. So I don't know if everybody realizes it's -- time is running out for the census. Tomorrow is the deadline . It takes 10 minutes to complete . I know prior to tomorrow you could start the process and then log back in. But, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 you know, it's recommended now that because tomorrow is the deadline to please sit down and do it in one sitting . And then as I mentioned in caucus, next Tuesday I have a contractual obligation as a teacher at the Career Technology Center for back to school night. So I will be unable to attend. I just wanted to explain my absence in advance . But with that said, tonight in caucus we had a problem with some technical difficultie s. But Mr. Deeley was presenting a couple different things. One thing that I requested a couple weeks ago is an update from the task force and -- to Council and to see where they're at with their self-assessment with regards to, you know, corrective actions moving forward . But my issue which -- why I brought it up was, so I'm not going to be here next week. Is it at all possible or allowed that I could prepare questions because I wanted to be part of that process because I'm not here maybe have someone read them for me, a colleague on Council because the issue I have still is with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Kenneth Bond illegally operating in the City. Like I stated before, you know, the taxpayer s that pay their taxes and their garbage fees want answers just like I do. So I want to know where we're at with that. So if someone would -- if that's allowable . I apologize for not being able to attend next week. But, you know, it's a work thing so if allowed , President Gaughan , may I prepare a couple questions that could be read on my behalf? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, oh, that makes total sense. Yep, and if you want to get those to Lori, she could give them to the administration in advance and then someone will pose them or hopefully they'll come prepare d with answers and give those publically at the meeting . But, yep, that makes sense. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you very much. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just have one comment . And I don't remember if anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 brought it up in the previous meeting s. I don't think that we did. As we get closer to the general election , I think a lot of voters are still choosing to use mail in ballots to vote as opposed to going to vote in person. And I just wanted to remind everyone that you need to include your ballot in the secrecy envelope and then that needs to go into the outer envelope that you then sign in order for your vote to count. It won't count if -- my dogs are ready to vote. It won't count if you don't have it inside that inner secrecy envelope and if you just put it in the bigger envelope . So I wanted to make sure that the public was made aware of that. I probably should have made that in the announcements . But I didn't want to forget to say it since some people may already be receiving those mail-in ballots and voting now. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you so much. Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, just one thing. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Back in July I had gotten a couple complaints or -- a couple inquiries about the PA American Water project on Birch Street in between South Washington and Cedar Avenue. The street's been closed for about a year and a half now. And back then we were informed that the work was going to be done by the end of September and that full restoration of the road would be done by the end of October . This week we got -- we had Miss Reed forwarded an e-mail from Director Preambo that he got an update from Pennsylvania American Water that the road or the project will continue until at least until the end of the year and that the project will also include Bergen Court from Birch Street to Willow Street. Solicitor Hayes, would you be able to look into and see if the City has anything on the books limiting the amount of time a utility could close down a street? ATTY. HAYES: Absolutely . I don't know off hand, but I'll look into that for you. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. And then if not, you know, what is possible if it's possible to limit the time a utility could shut 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 down a street because , I mean, there's a business at the bottom of that that is a trucking distribution center. You know, and they're there at all hours. There's, you know, many residents on that street that lives have been impacted for, you know, over a year and a half now. ATTY. HAYES: This is at the bottom of Willow Street in South Side? MR. DONAHUE : So it's Birch Street from Cedar Avenue until the South Washington . ATTY. HAYES: Got it. Okay. Oh, yeah, that has been -- a block over from South Intermediate . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: That has been blocked off for a while. Yeah, I know exactly and there's a moving company on that street. So, yeah, I will look into that, Councilman Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : All right. Thank you. That's all I have for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have a few things. The first thing I want to talk about tonight is the issues or not the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 issues but questions that have come up from Mr. Coyne about Scranton Tomorrow . So I just want to clear a few things up. The first thing is, there was money budgeted in 2020 for Scranton Tomorrow just as there has been for a number of previous years. And I did speak with Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow . They are going to be coming into a Council caucus at some point either in October or November to give us a quarterly update, which I think should clear up a lot of issues. But they have not received any money or a portion of the money that was allocated from the City yet. They did receive funding from the University of Scranton in the amount of a hundred thousand dollars . That was part of their pilot payment . So the University of Scranton gives a payment in lieu of taxes to the City. The idea behind this from a few years ago was in the past, a nonprofit would give a payment in lieu of taxes to the City. And it would go right into the general fund and into the black hole. I think the previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 administration came to an agreement with the local nonprofit s to say that if you're going to give us a payment in lieu of taxes, we'd like to partner to allocate that money towards a specific project , towards parks and recreation , a number of different things which I thought was a good idea rather than again, just putting it in the general fund and, you know, letting it float out in the middle of nowhere . So that is the way that it is currently done. The arrangement was that part of the University 's pilot payment would go towards Scranton Tomorrow . Now, questioning , you know, Scranton Tomorrow , I think we have to remember that this funding commitment on behalf of the City was part of a larger economic development plan through the National Resource Network . And that was adopted I think back in 2015. So the National Resource Network , NRN was hired by the City. NRN is a federally funded economic assistance organization that helps distressed cities like Scranton to create a downtown revitalization plan and more of a strategic vision. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 So as part of that plan, Scranton Tomorrow is tasked to lead the charge, sort of takeover and to run with all of the recommendation s that were in the plan. The NRN plan is available if anybody would like a copy of it. It's in -- I know it's in our file back in our office in the Clerk's Office. So Lori could e-mail that to you if you'd like a copy of it and you would like to take a look at it. I know from looking at it a while ago, there was a three year implementation plan that laid out several initiatives like sanitation , street cleaning . There was an ambassador program that Scranton Tomorrow has championed , trash removal, graffiti removal all in the general area of the downtown , general maintenance upkeep, events, marketing , holiday lighting , so on and so forth, capital improvements. So Scranton Tomorrow is the group that took that on. And they've been more than transparent with Council in terms of coming every quarter to give us an update on exactly , number one, how they spent that money and how their -- how the whole plan is going and what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 they've done in terms of the strategic vision. The other part of that plan was to have Scranton Tomorrow to lead the creation of a downtown business improvement district . Districts in other parts of the country have been real economic drivers for their cities. And business improvement districts in other cities are always usually partially funded by their municipalities , by their cities. So this isn't just like, you know -- I understand Mr. Coyne's comments . But it's not like the City is just throwing money at Scranton Tomorrow so three or four people could go sit at an office and stare at each other. They're actually doing things. And it's part of an overall plan that was put together with benchmarks and goals. And it was really comprehensive from what I would remember . So if anybody would like to take a look at that letter, either a member of the public or Council , you could feel free to reach out to us or reach out to Lori and take a look at that. As part of that, there was a downtown master plan. The City a few years ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 finally signed onto the Scranton Abington Planning Association , so SAPA. And we were tasked with coming up with a larger comprehensive plan. And there was lot of benefit s to that that we discuss ed a few years ago. But part of that was a downtown master plan. And that is what Scranton Tomorrow took on. So I know that they've been working to help small businesses during the pandemic , so on and so forth. So there is value to this. It's not again, like, you know, we're just throwing money away at organization s. I would not be in favor of that. So hopefully that clears some things up on Scranton Tomorrow . I also wanted to mention that there had been -- I have been contacted about a recent rash of car burglaries and garage break-ins in Minooka . They were hit twice in two weeks. A lot of resident s back in Minooka are concerned . They do have a somewhat picture -- not really clear of the people that are involved in this. So I was asked by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 members of -- or residents of Minooka if we can reach out to the police department and ask if there could be regular patrols over there randomly between midnight and 4 a.m. That seems to be when this is happening. So Chief Namiotka was copied on that and I'm confident that the Police Department will step up patrols there. Also, a gentleman reached out to me about the intersection of Capouse Avenue and Olive Street. Apparently that area is in pretty rough condition in terms of blight including the All-Phase building . So we did send that out to the Licensing and Inspections Department . And this gentleman also brought up the New Jersey Central building on Lackawanna Avenue that's been vacant for years. I know that there was talk a few years ago about something being done with that or some kind of funding being put into it. But it's been quiet ever since. So I'm going reach out to Mrs. Reed and ask if we could try to find out who owns the property and whether or not there is any plans to revitalize that. I think at one point there may have been some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 OECD involvement . But I'm not sure so we'll look into that. Also, I'd like, Mrs. Reed, if we could send correspondence to our Police Chief and copy Laurel Woods which is a development in the Minooka section of Scranton . I have been contact ed by resident s living in that development who have been complaining about loud noise, harassment , violence , people threatening them. It's more than one person. And there's been -- police reports have been filed in the past. And they've been dealing with this for about two years now. So if we can have just the Police Chief notified again and we'll copy Laurel Woods on that to let them know that we are not pleased with what's going on over there based on the information that I received . And that's all I have this week. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.
