PERRY: I make a motion to nominate Wayne Evans to fill the unexpired term of former Mayor William L. Courtright for the remainder of the year with said term scheduled to expire at 12 noon on January 6th, 2020. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 MR. GAUGHAN : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question . Roll call please. MR. GAUGHAN : Hang on. MR. ROGAN: After you. MR. GAUGHAN : First, I want to thank every person who applied for temporary appointment to be Mayor of Scranton . As I sat through the 3 and a half hours of interviews on Monday, it was clear to me that there are good people in this city who love Scranton and want to give back in any way that they can and who are really interest ed in public service . This has been an extremely difficult year so far to be involve d in public service and to be a citizen of Scranton . I'm asking once again, the people of this city not to lose faith because it's my firm belief that we are going to turn the corner and better days are ahead. And I've always been taught that it's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness . Today I will be voting for Councilman Evans. At this point in the city's history , there is a need for leadership and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 restoration of confidence in the Office of Mayor. Although the length of this appointment is relatively short, the next few months leading into 2020 will be extremely crucial . We need someone who is ready and prepared on day one. And I believe that Councilman Evans is that person, especially after going through all the interviews for three and a half hours. I have worked along side Councilman Evans for the past few years. And I'm confident in his abilities to perform the duties of mayor and to begin to rebuild confidence in our city. Based on his interview, he clearly had a grasp of the issues facing the city and an understanding of what exactly has to be done. My decision to vote for Councilman Evans supersedes party affiliation . These are not normal times. We just had a mayor resign. There is so much uncertainty going on in this city. I cannot think of a better person at this time to fulfill a five month appointment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 and really keep the city steady and on its feet. Throughout this process I had been really guided by the simple question of what is the right thing to do for this city. And this, in my judgment , is the right thing to do. And that is why I'm voting yes for Wayne Evans. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : On the question . Like Mr. Gaughan , I would like to thank every candidate that applied for this. Coming to my decision I asked myself one question . What is in the best interest of the citizens of the city and how do we move forward away from these extraordinary times. I'm not basing my decision on which political party someone belongs to what, you know, where they stood on certain issues in the past. It's how do we move forward . We're in this position right now because a politician put his own self-interest s above the interest of each and every citizen . And that needs to stop if we're going to move the city forward . So for that reason, that's why I will also be support ing Mr. Evans. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. ROGAN: A couple quick comments . When this first happened , obviously we knew we had a vacancy . My first call was to Council man Evans as our Finance Chair to get together on a number of items that were outstanding with the city. Obviously for the past three and a half weeks I have been serving as interim Mayor keeping the city operations going. And during that time, we've as a body have -- it's been my opinion every one of us up here has done a tremendous job of putting together this process , going through this process , hours of interviews . And I also want to thank everyone else that did submit their resumes . There were a number of good candidates that were interested . But Mr. Evans is uniquely qualified as the Finance Chair for this body. He knows what project s are going on. He knows to pick up right from day one. Because it's such a short-term appointment , it's critical that the person who gets appointed , Mr. Evans in this case, is able to go in on day one and keep the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 ball rolling , keep the progress that this Council has worked so hard over many years to bring our city back moving forward . As others mention ed, it's certainly not a time for a political decision . This is a decision on who is the most qualified candidate . There are many great candidate s that put in. But I don't think anyone could argue that Mr. Evans was not the most qualified and the best to go in and lead from day one when he's sworn in as Mayor tomorrow . So for those reasons, I will be supporting enthusiastically Wayne Evans for this appointment . Anyone else? (No response .) MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Abstain . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 MR. ROGAN: Yes. By unanimous vote it passes. Before continuing with the regular meeting , I want again to thank everyone who submitted a resume for their sincere interest in serving our city and for the time each individual dedicate d to this process of selecting the next mayor. Our next task at hand will be to fill the unexpired term of Councilman Evans, which expires at the end of this year on the first Monday, January , 2020. Letters of interest and resumes for the vacant Council position will be accepted until next Wednesday , July 31st at 12 noon, exactly one week from today. As was the case with the appointment for mayor, if you are interested , please do not contact anyone from Council directly . Please contact our office to submit your resume. Contact the office. They will answer any questions you have. And I do want to thank for the vast majority of the people that applied they did not come and contact us to lobby on their behalf. We have a process that's in place. And we're going to honor that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 same process for this appointment as well. Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: No, just to follow up on what was said already , you know, this -- from day one, this process has been daunting and it's just -- hung heavy over everybody 's head in the city. It was scarey at times. And at best, it was -- we were unsure of the path that we were going to take. And I'm just proud of the way City Hall, the residents and City Council and everybody in here just kind of pulled together , kept business as usual and started that process of restoring the faith in our government , especially our local government here. I commend my colleague s on a standup job on the way we went about this process . I think we were upfront, upright and we did everything above board and like we always have. This is nothing new for us. This is how we operate . Although it's an unfortunate situation , I'm glad that we were the people here to do the job because I know we were going to do it correctly . And we went through this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 process meticulously . You know, there was e-mails, phone calls, meeting s. And we wanted to make sure everything that was done -- you're never going to make a decision that there's going to be 100 percent of the people on board with. That's just an impossibility . And we understand that. But the one thing that we were going to make sure was, there was going to be no doubt in anybody 's mind how we went through the process and how we found our candidate . That was one thing we wanted to make sure. And I believe that we were successful in doing that. And then out of the process of doing that, I believe we did find the best person for this job for this city for the next five months. I have no doubt in my mind that Mr. Evans is going to go there day one this afternoon and start taking care of business . One of the things where I was concerned , everybody knows when you go on vacation you come back from vacation , one of the worst parts of vacation is coming back and digging yourself out of that work that you have to do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Well, now multiply that by not having a mayor for a month and walking in there day one all that work that has to be done. So it was crucial that we do not lose one day of lag time. And I believe Mr. Evans also fits that aspect of the job too. You know, we're going to get a lot of things done. There is already topics that we discussed and timeline , things that were on the back burner that I think we can take care of now. And, you know, it's just -- I'm really excited to turn the page and get moving again in the right direction , which I feel like this was a big step. Step number two is going to be as Mr. Rogan said finding someone to fill that vacancy . And the process that we do to fill Mr. Evan's vacancy is going to be the same way as we did to fill the interim mayor, step by step the same way. We'll have dates to follow. We already announced that we are going to accept letters of interest until next week. And once we get those letters of interest , we'll set up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 interview times. And we'll do it the same way as we did for the mayor step by step. But again, I'm real proud of the work we did. And I'm very proud of everybody in City Hall and our residents for stepping up and it was just -- it restored my faith in what good government could be when it wants to be. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I got nothing at this time. MR. ROGAN: Mayor Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Oh, not yet. First of all, I'll always be a Councilman . That's very important for me to say. When I was notified very recently that I might be chosen for this position , I did have a chance to write down a few thought s that I wanted to express to everybody . What a long strange trip it's been. Five years ago, I said those same words, what a long strange trip it's been to describe my journey to my appointment on City Council and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 here we are again. So I'm humbled and honored to be named Mayor for this five month interim period. For me, it's a culmination of a lifetime of service to our city. And I will do everything that I can to make you all proud. Thank you, Tim and Kyle and Bill and Pat for your faith in my ability to move this city forward for what may be one of the most devastating events in our history . These are extraordinary times and we will face them head on. We will stand together and we will stand united in one purpose to restore the trust and confidence of our citizen s. And we will not fail. To the employees of the City of Scranton , many of them who were here today, I will tell you, you will find an ally to assist you in doing the best job that you could do. I only ask that you continue to work hard and represent yourself with pride as a city employee . To the current cabinet, many of you who were also here earlier today, many of you have done extraordinary work after being blind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 sided by someone that you trusted and someone that you believed in. I want you to trust. I want your trust and I want you to believe that we are only going to do the right thing all the time. To my family and friends , I'll see you in January -- just kidding . You are the reason that I can do this. You always have been my support ers and my adviser s and my compass . And I will be lost without you. We have a lot work to do together . It begins tomorrow . And for some of us, it will end on the first Monday in January . But if we do what we set out to do, we will change this city forever . So for everyone who enters this building , for everyone who wants to make a difference , for everyone who loves Scranton , join me because every day is your chance to make this city a little better. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Next week is extremely important because we do have a public caucus with the Pennsylvania Economy League. And we are going to be discussing our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 eventual exit from Act 47. We discussed this in the caucus earlier today. I would like an update on the status of each recommendation that was in the three year Exit Plan. I think that's very important . And I will be looking forward to talking to the Pennsylvania Economy League on where the city stands in regards to our exit from Act 47. I also mentioned in the caucus that I would like updates on the following properties : 342 Harrison Avenue, 107-109 North Sumner Avenue, 950 James Avenue, Division Street between Keyser and Dale Avenue. There was an issue with that area; 824 Pittston Avenue. So if we can have that before the recess next week, Mrs. Reed, I would appreciate it. Also there was a resident who has come here quite often over the last two years about an issue with stormwater runoff on the corner of Church and Ferdinand Street. I just want to read into the record a correspondence from Jeremy Hull from Pennsylvania American Water. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 He's a senior superintendant of Field Operations . In regarding this problem area he said the following : "The basin on Church and Ferdinand is a little complicated . But nonetheless we are taking care of it. The two by four box that needs to be installed at the low spot will have an aboveground pipe about halfway to the basin on the corner. We will need to lower the basin on the corner and install the new basin at the depression so the pipe can be deeper. We have this schedule d and it will be done this year." I wanted to make sure that the two residents who have been asking about this know that it will be done according to Mr. Hull this year. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Very briefly I just want to mention once again to thank every one of us sitting up here. Obviously at times there are times when Council is divided , 3-2 votes, 4-1 votes. I've been on every side of every vote imaginable . But when it came down to it, the most important decision that is probably ever 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 had to have been made by a City Council , we were united in the process . We had differences of opinions at times. But we compromise d. And every step in this process from day one until today's vote was done on a unanimous basis by every member up here. So I just want to thank all of my colleagues for all of their hard work. I know this has been a tremendous amount of work and effort to get to the point where we have today. But I think the end result shows that all of this work was worth it. And we all look forward to working with our new mayor, appoint ing a new member of Council for the remainder of Mr. Evans' term. And we're going to continue to work for the resident s of Scranton . Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL LEASE PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND MANUFACTURERS AND TRADERS TRUST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 COMPANY (“M & T BANK”) FOR THE LEASE OF 2 NEW FREIGHTLINER /HEIL HIGH COMPACTION REAR LOADER DURAPACK 5000 TRUCKS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS FOR A TERM OF FIVE (5) YEARS. MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-E be introduced into its proper committee. MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I just want to take a moment to explain the reason for this lease agreement . It's my understanding that in the last few weeks there has been -- I don't know if would you call it a slowdown in garbage pickup or not being able to stay on schedule . It's my understanding that we are down at this point four garbage trucks. So I want to take a second and read the memo that we received from Mr. Bulzoni on this issue. "We have an acute need for additional refuse and recycle vehicles with the recent damage to the 2015 Mac refuse packer.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 In addition to the accident , the Department of Public Works recently was require d to take two vehicles out of service due to rust issues. The refuse and recycling trucks were 17 and 12 years old. While much of the fleet has been replaced, the remaining older vehicles have been serviced as well as possible given their age and use. The two that were recently taken out of service could not be repaired to any extent considered service able." The remedy will be to lease two packers as noted in the proposal that we're voting on today. Those vehicles will replace the trucks subject to accident damage which likely will be a total vehicle loss and the recycling truck sideline due to age. The city also has two Mac trucks on order which will be a direct 2019 budget purchase . The city will opt for the five year lease. In order to fund the 2019 lease payment , the city will use the 4299-15337 lease budget of $100,000.
