MR. KING: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially for the three young individuals from the Abingtons , Michael Comerford , Christian Schimelfenig and Tucker Schimelfenig who were killed on the Schuylkill Expressway just the other day. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MR. MCANDREW : I would like to make a motion to take from the table File of the Council No. 53, 2023. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MR. KING: There's a motion on the floor and a second to take from the table File of the Council No. 53, 2023. This ordinance establish es an Environmental Advisory Council for the city. It had been tabled until additional request and information were provide d. It's being taken from the table and placed in Sixth Order. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I'd like to keep this on the table -- or off the table, I mean. Council has still -- I feel hasn't had a chance to discuss more fully as a group as to how to move forward with this. MR. MCANDREW : On the question too, I mean, of course, it was in the guide for me to bring it off the table. But as you just stated, the reason we're doing that is because we asked for information and we got it. I just don't remember getting it. I don't remember getting anything from administration . This is just -- MR. KING: On the question , I believe that we had detailed answers that were provided to all of us. MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, we had a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 presentation from the administration . MR. KING: No, there were answers to the question s that were on -- MR. SMURL: Mr. King, all of those questions were in my -- MR. KING: The questions -- MR. SMURL: -- the questions , I went to the administration with all of these. MR. KING: And they were answered, correct ? MR. SMURL: Yes. Yes. MR. KING: And these were the question s that Mr. Schuster had asked, correct ? MR. SMURL: A few of them he had asked the first evening about the five members instead of three. MR. SCHUSTER : I just -- from my perspective . I wish Council would have a discussion among itself as to how we are going to move forward since we are the body that has the power to create a new board. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I feel like we've had ample time to discuss this. I don't really understand what the holdup needs to be other than what we've already discussed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 was the change in the number of members on this Council . And I would -- I mean if Council man Smurl wants to read the response s that he had gotten to the questions -- do you want to read what you have or -- MR. SMURL: Read all the questions that were submitted to the City? I can. The first question to the City was the ordinance it says -- came through with three members and Council recommended five. And the answer back was to make a motion to change the ordinance to five and the administration hadn't -- didn't care about being five. They were fine with that one. And then my second question was, will Council appoint the members ? I'm still trying to find all of the answers that I received . MR. KING: I believe the answer is Council has the ability to make recommendation s to the administration who would then send the recommendation s to us to approve . Council is responsible for approving all members of this board.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. MCANDREW : Well, yeah, we are. But that's just a formality . But the question -- MR. KING: No, it's not. We could vote it down but -- MR. MCANDREW : I know. Normally it's a formality . Let's be realistic. The question posed is, are we going to appoint the members , not are we going to approve the appointment of the members coming from administration . That was my understanding . And Mr. Schuster made a great point. Any new authority or board we create. This wasn't created by us. This ended up today here. Okay, so we had ample time supposedly or -- we had no discussion . I didn't realize I was making a motion to bring it back. I didn't see that. That wasn't discussed . I'm not against this. MR. KING: No, but this has followed the typical procedure . The administration made a recommendation to begin this advisory council . And it's brought before this board. The board decides -- the City Council decides 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 to introduce it. And then there's three reading s before it actually happens which gives us the opportunity to ask question s, get some input and then ultimately vote on it. And then any members that are appointed to the board have to come back to Council and then we have to vote on them as well. I believe the question was asked if Council members could make recommendation s to the administration to send up to serve on the board and I believe the answer is yes. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , this is also being placed on Sixth Order, right, so final vote is going to be taking place next week. MR. SCHUSTER : I don't plan on voting to move this anywhere until we five have sat down and talked about it. Council is the board that has the power to create this body. And until we sit down and we talk about it -- I understand it got sent down from the administration . We've asked our question s. That's all well and good. But we're the body. MR. KING: Well, does anyone on this Council , Mr. Schuster , with all due respect , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 did anyone on this Council come up with the idea of developing an environment al advisory council ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. KING: I think the answer is no. So the administration came up with that idea, sent it forth to us. I think most of us agree that it's probably a good idea. It's a non paying board of which we would have the opportunity to make recommendation s to the administration who would serve on it. And furthermore , it goes through three reading s and ultimate -- I mean, we could make recommendation s. If we're not happy with who is recommended , we could vote them down. We've done that in the past actually or we -- is there anything further on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, on the question , do -- I mean, do we want Council to be personal ly reviewing all the applications that come in for the council ? Is that what's being suggested ? I don't -- I just -- I don't understand because just like any other appointments to -- to advisory councils we would -- that would come through Council and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 we'd have the option of, you know, or declining that person who was appoint ed to us. MR. MCANDREW : We appoint zoning. We do. MR. KING: I'm not disputing that. MR. MCANDREW : I think we should have at least something at the table besides just recommending people that probably won't get even looked at. I hate to say that. But I don't know. I know it was tabled and all of a sudden I had to read it tonight . I apologize , maybe I didn't take a better look at this because I was really concern ed about the other meetings and the hearing tonight . But I don't know. I'm not against it. I hope you understand . I'm not against this. But I want it to be done right. A lot of these -- a lot of these things that come down to us aren't done right or they're done late for reappoint ing somebody and then choosing someone over us when we had 30 -- they had 30 days to -- so, like, and I want to get this right. So I want another week. We get another week. I'll move it, but I want to take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 a deeper dive at this and look at this. MR. KING: So there's been a motion to made to table and it's been seconded . Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SCHUSTER : This roll call is just to take it from the table. MR. KING: Right. You made a motion to not reintroduce it and to keep it tabled. MR. SMURL: So which motion are we going on? MR. KING: So Mr. Schuster made a motion to keep -- to keep this amendment or to keep this ordinance tabled and it was seconded by Mr. McAndrew . MR. SMURL: Okay. MR. KING: So we're voting on whether to keep it tabled or to introduce it. MR. SMURL: Okay. Got it. MS. CARERRA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Just to clarify , this is a motion to keep it tabled. MR. KING: Right.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 MR. SCHUSTER : Then yes to keep it tabled. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : I know I seconded this. I'll vote yes. I mean, I'll vote no to keep it tabled. But we need a discussion . Just because you got answers doesn't mean we all discussed it. I haven't seen the answers . And I'm thrilled you got them. And I hope you are satisfied with them. But I agree with Mr. Schuster , we're the body that is going to have to finally approve this and in some fashion approve the people or disapprove . Are we comfortable with all the answers ? We didn't have that discussion . I think we should. So I'll move -- I'll remove it from the table and move it for one more week. But in that week's time I think we have to have a conversation if we're okay with it. That was never brought up. MR. KING: So is your vote no? MR. MCANDREW : I voted no to -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. KING: If you voted yes -- MR. MCANDREW : I just said I voted no. So I'm voting no to not move it off the table only so it can move one more week. But if I'm not happy in a week I'll be a no. We need some discussion on this. MR. KING: No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King, no, okay. Okay. MR. KING: So the motion dies four to one. Now, that puts us back to actually voting to the motion. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. KING: Well, actually -- actually , we actually did have the motion and it was seconded . So I guess I should say on the motion. If there's no -- if there's nothing on the motion then we can vote on putting it back on the table into Sixth Order. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. So moved. The ayes have it and so moved. Please dispense with the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A.

HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton , can I make a suggestion that you close that window? It's kind of a breezy thing coming in. MR. KING: That's fine. Most of the people are gone. So it was getting kind of stuffy in here. Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Do we have a date for a caucus on the 2021 audit? MR. KING: We do not at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : And has the Mayor made a decision on the 10 percent penalty ? MR. KING: I have not -- I didn't have my meeting with her. She was away.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MS. HODOWANITZ : I know she was busy in Ireland . Why haven't we seen legislation for the new auditor ? MR. KING: I believe that's going to be sent up shortly probably even next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, they got to get going on it because they promise d to have an audit by the end of August. And when are we going to see the DPW contract posted on the website ? You know the one that was approved seven months ago? MR. KING: I'll have an answer for you in a minute. We'll look into that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I saw in the paper that the City paid the school district 2.26 million dollars after that tax mixup. What I would like to know in Fifth Order is what budget transfer or financial transaction was enacted to make that check payable to the school district ? 2.26 million dollars is a lot more than the contingency fund. So if you don't know, please make sure you have the answer for next week. MR. KING: I believe it's 2.26 million. We will check on that.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And also in the paper was a story about the firefighters ' arbitration award for their union, which was also on the City's website under the labor agreements . It's a file that's dated April 5th, I believe . And it was very interest ing if you saw, you know, that 138 firefighters , they're going to be getting $2,000 lump sum payment for 2022 and a 2 percent wage increase for 2023. And, of course, the police arbitration should be finalized in the next few weeks. But what I found really interesting and irritating at the same time was a comment made by Larry West who said that they factored in a potential wage increase when they did the 2023 budget. And that didn't ring true. So I went and pulled the budget. Now for the firefighters 138 people, most of the line items -- the salary items are flat with one exception . That was for the 69 privates . They got a 3.25 percent pay increase . The other 69 people got zilch, okay? And then I went and looked at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 police department . And I got to tell you, the police department union members got screwed royally because they have a 142 members that are in the union. And there are -- back in 2022 there were 89 regular patrolmen who got paid a certain amount. But that number jumped up to 93 patrolmen and they got paid a certain amount. And it increased or at least the total figure did. But when you did the math and divided one figure by 89 and the second figure by 93, well, guess what, their pay went down $187,000 per patrolman . That's called getting screwed . So I'd like to know from Mr. West hopefully you could get an answer for me next week, how does this reflect that he factored in a potential wage increase because of these union contracts ? It doesn't look like it to me. And I want to know where all of this money is coming from because I suspect the police are going to get the same deal that the firefighters got, $2,000 lump sum payment , 2 percent wage increase . And those legal fees, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching. Where is that money coming from? Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Joan. Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Council , I'd like to ask you as an investigative body if you would please look into something for me. Three people have contact ed me already and inquire d about this but I have no way of knowing . It may be a rumor but it may be very true. And I'd like to explain this to you so you could look into it. At 1420 Meylert Avenue right by the Laceworks around March 9th there was a raid by the Pennsylvania State Police and the Scranton Police. And what they found was -- MR. KING: When did that occur? MS. FRANUS: March 9th, I believe . MR. KING: March 9th. MS. FRANUS: 1420 Meylert next to the Laceworks. And what they found was a biker gang that was renting there. And the charges were supposedly are drugs, guns, chicken fighting and prostitution . And I have the deed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 right here from Lackawanna County Assessor 's Office. The City of Scranton owns that property where this biker gang rented since 2018. So if you could please check into that I would appreciate it. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , would you please check into that for us? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MS. FRANUS: The Scranton Times have not said anything about it and I wish they would investigate that and Channel 16. Nobody seems to know anything about it. But I think the people in Scranton need to know if that's true because the State Police were there. Okay, now another thing, you know how I've been going after the recyclable s from the DPW picking up the recyclables from the business es, the bars and restaurants and the VFWs. Well, as it turns out -- and I have the City Code right here. Here's the City Code. It states that Cecelia Monroe, the Recycling Coordinator Supervisor , she is the person who is suppose d to send forms out to every business .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 They are suppose d to turn them in to her with affidavit s notarized saying that they have a private hauler. Now, that's something they must do every year. They have to put -- and they also have to show the tonnage that they have -- the weight when the recyclable s go to the Recycling Center. Well, I would like to know all the businesses that do not have a form filled out. I think there many, many, many that don't have a form filled out saying that they have a private hauler. So if that's the case, we could only assume that the DPW still might be picking up the recyclable s there for free like they have for the last seven years without paying a garbage fee and without paying a tonnage fee that we are paying for, the taxpayers , $40 a ton. And you know the bars have cans and cans, 20 cans every other week, $40 a ton that the taxpayers are paying. And they're getting away scot-free. Another thing, Mr. Smurl, remember when you asked Mr. Voldenberg to check into Railroad Avenue, all the holes that the utility companies -- were you aware that DPW 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 went and filled those potholes , not the utilities ? MR. SMURL: No, I was not aware of that. MS. FRANUS: Well, that's what happened because I was there. DPW did that work, not the water company . So that's a use of our time, our equipment , our blacktop equipment . It's not right. And, Mr. Schuster , you asked two weeks ago how do we get $191,000 for the first three months of the year in overtime . There's been maybe two snowstorms all in December until now. How do you justify -- did you find out the reason why there was 191,000? You didn't even ask last week to get the answer. You didn't follow up. How you could -- anybody explain -- Mr. Smurl, somebody up there explain how $191,000 was spent on overtime for the first three months and there's no storms. And there's no reasons for the overtime . Now, I asked you, Mr. King, to have the Director of DPW to come in and Chris Smith the supervisor of the refuse. You said that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 the Mayor has to give that permission . No, she does not. You're the -- the City Code says you are the legislative branch. You are the oversight . You are the ones that have the right to bring them in. You could even subpoena them. So it's not up to the Mayor. That's just a copout. It is up to you. You could go over and say will you please come in. If they don't want to come in, fine, just let us know. But in the meantime , you're complicit . All of you are complicit as a part of helping them get overtime with no accountability and no verifiable overtime . So I would wish that would you contact the director again Mr. Pietreface and Chris Smith who Chris Smith by the way told me that Cecilia Monroe has nothing to do with getting the contract s signed from the businesses to show that they have a private hauler. Well, he's wrong. So I think he needs to learn what his job is as well. Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Franus. Brian Reap. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. King? MR. KING: Yes. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. Pietreface and Mr. Smith are working to get Rubicon in here for the following Tuesday after the -- after April 18th, one of the two following Tuesdays . MR. KING: Okay. Thank you thank you very much. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll firm it up. MR. KING: I appreciate that. MR. REAP: Good evening , Council , Brian Reap, resident of East Mountain , Scranton , Pennsylvania . This is kind of a homecoming in some way. I haven't been in this room in 22 years. About 26 years ago I sat on the same dais as a member of the Planning Commission . And at that time we had just passed what was called the Master Plan for the City of Scranton , an endeavor that cost the taxpayers about three-quarters of a million dollars . But it was to be the bible for all planning from that day forward in the City of Scranton . Someone asked me to look into the issue or the concern of the Geisinger 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 development in the Hill Section . They knew I was a planner at one point. They knew I was a councilman at another point. And I went back to my Planning Commission mentor, a gentleman by the name of Pete Noto who was our Chair back in 1997 who I tapped into him as a resource concerning this matter. And back then right after the Master Plan was passed, there was some stipulation s that were stated in the Master Plan that in residential zones such as the one that we're talking about -- and I'll make reference to what Peter Noto said at that time, "Residential areas are the first consideration in the Master Plan for City of Scranton . The first consideration of zoning is to protect residential property values." That was when neighborhoods in 1997 were like the king of our town. Neighborhood movement was big. Neighborhood s were protected . Neighborhood s had voices as to how they were living out their lives. This is a major decision that not only reflect s obviously , you know, the neighborhood , of course, the institution and at the end the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 quality of healthcare for each and every one of us. I understand that discussions between the neighborhood and with Geisinger and obviously with your body has led us to a position that a compromise can't be reached . Is that my -- been told the right information ? No compromise has been discussed on this plan? Or if there was, there's been no cooperation by Geisinger . MR. KING: We had Geisinger come in here tonight , Mr. Reap. And we heard from the citizen s. And we heard from Geisinger . So I believe that there's some question s that members of this body have now to go back to Geisinger with prior to voting for this. MR. REAP: And one of the biggest concerns I heard is the height of the propose d structure being at a hundred feet where I was visiting in the area three times to look at this. Right now I think the highest point of the existing Geisinger building is somewhere around 50 feet. So you're talking about double the height of what you see on the skyline of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Geisinger . So if I'm a resident on the side of Colfax facing that, there's a good chance I'm not going to see sunlight on any given morning . So now it comes down to a question are the residents going to ever see sunlight back there, see sunlight . Something that simple, maybe something that we take for granted; but, you know, it's a consideration because now their neighborhood is completely changed and will change obviously for eternity . But do we still follow the Master Plan in our zoning and our Planning Commission ? Do we still follow that; do you know? The Master Plan, is it still a document that's in play that we use for planning purposes ? Because back then neighborhoods were king in the Master Plan that I knew back in 1997. Certainly , I don't see where the consideration -- well, I see you're trying to lean towards consideration of the residents . But clearly , I mean, if both the resident s and the institution are going to coexist in that part of our city, there certainly has to be some compromise so that both parties and both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 interests have been, you know, obviously covered . So I just question about what ever happened to all that money we spent 26 years ago creating this Master Plan which was suppose d to be the bible of our planned community called Scranton , whatever happened to that and is it still being followed ? That's all, because I was part of it 26 years ago. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Reap. MR. REAP: Thank you. MR. KING: Bob Reuther . MR. REUTHER : Good evening , Council , Bob Reuther , East Mountain resident , taxpayer . You know, I got a few calls within the last few days that people told me don't bother showing up at City Council . It's a waste of your time. It's politics and you're not going to win. So I really considered not coming here tonight . But then I started thinking of all the hard work my wife and I did to purchase land on East Mountain , build a home for our family. And I couldn't sit back and let this just be pushed through . So a good place to start would be could anybody on Council explain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 why the single family zoning on East Mountain that's been there for decades is being changed ? MR. KING: I believe it's R7 suburban single residential -- excuse me, R6. MR. REUTHER : R6. MR. KING: Excuse me. MR. REUTHER : R6. MR. KING: The most restrictive in the city. MR. REUTHER : So you're aware what that contains . MR. KING: I know that there's special exceptions listed in there, like such things as apartment s or townhouses . They would require having to go before the zoning for exceptions . Presently we have townhouses and apartments on East Mountain , Oakmont Apartments , the apartments up by -- MR. REUTHER : That's zoned differently . That's zoned differently . MR. KING: Okay. So the new zoning it's listed under special exceptions so that if someone wanted to do an apartment or a townhouse, it would be require d to go through planning , zoning and follow that process .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. REUTHER : Does anybody else have an answer to that? So let's call it what it really is. It's up-zoning. Does anybody know on Council what up-zoning is? Nobody? You guys are going to vote on this in seven days and you don't know what you're voting on? I just happen to have the definition of up-zoning right here. And up-zoning is the changing of single family zoning codes to allow for taller and denser housing like duplexes, accessory dwelling s, ADUs, and townhouses also known as garden apartments . Do you guys know about that? MR. KING: There's already duplexes on East Mountain . MR. REUTHER : When were they approved ? MR. KING: I know for a fact an individual that grew up in a duplex on East Mountain Road. MR. REUTHER : How long ago was that, Mr. King? MR. KING: I can't say the exact time. It's been a while. MR. REUTHER : Well, I have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 amended -- the zoning from 1993 and it wasn't allowed . Duplexes weren't allowed. So I think this whole issue of zoning eliminating R1 zoning, single family zoning is probably an ideology of the Mayor and the City. Can anybody up there tell me if the City is going to get any money from changing the zoning laws from the federal government ? Can anybody go on the record and say that? MR. MCANDREW : We're not aware of that. It was never presented to us. MR. REUTHER : I'm sorry? MR. MCANDREW : We're not aware of that. It was never presented to us. If you have information , please share. MR. REUTHER : Sure. That's in Biden's infrastructure plan. He's going to allow grants and tax breaks to any city that changes their zoning laws. Nobody is aware of that? DR. ROTHCHILD : I mean, we're doing this as a regional authority like throughout the county with other municipalities . So -- yeah, I'm not aware of that -- MR. REUTHER : You're not aware of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 that. DR. ROTHCHILD : -- from updating our zoning ordinance . MR. REUTHER : All right. Five minutes isn't enough. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Reuther . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Lee Morgan one more time. What I'd like to say is that the zoning really needs to be explained to the resident s like I said prior to this meeting . Now, I'm the person who pulled the SAPA out of the garbage . And Mr. McGoff and myself debated it for a Council race and it was a dead agenda. I understand SAPA. I've got it at home, the whole -- the whole thing. I think we got a lot of problems here. And I think that Dr. Rothchild brought it complete ly into view and Mr. McAndrew to a point because you're saying you don't have any knowledge . So how can we vote on something as an informed body without a thorough and complete understanding of the legislation and the law that you are going to create here and the affects of that law on all the resident s in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 the city. And what in the pipeline, what kind of money are we trying to bring into this city. Who's sharing all this information with you? Because if you are just voting on things with no knowledge , then you're helping to destroy the very fabric of this city by being an uninformed legisla tive branch passing laws without knowledge . It's a very, very, very troubling thing. And it shouldn 't take place here. That vote shouldn 't take place next week. There should be a map created here and the five Council members should explain to the residents of this city the zoning changes and what it means for every resident because they are -- they're all shareholders here. They're property owners. It's their major investment is their home and their families . Don't forget what I said about what happened on the hill when I was a kid and what the University of Scranton did. And when you look at what's taken place there, it may take 20 years for it to happen, but the destruction you will cause in this city will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 mind-boggling . And look it, not saying you don't know is not a satisfactory answer. And the other thing I have here is, you know the Mayor was in Ireland this week so I didn't get -- and next week I've taken a couple of days off because I'm going to call the Mayor. I asked her to reintroduce legislation to this Council to recreate the public access component of ECTV. And I'm going to ask the five Council members to also communicate with the Mayor about bringing that agenda forward in the next Council meeting because that legislation needs to come up from the Mayor. Now, you know, people can file anything they want in court. There's not a doubt in my mind that I won't prevail , not the slightest doubt that I won't prevail is in my mind, okay? But I want the people to have to get into their head whether the Mayor and this Council actually work for the public because I can't see why we would stifle the right of a free people to have access to a public access channel that funds this city to the point of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 1.5 million dollars . And the only people we want to shut out is the average citizen and any comment s they may make. And when you read the legislation that the Congress and the Senate created that PEG channel , that was the whole purpose of it all. And when you look at the government that's having meetings and present ing things, just look what's happened here today. You acknowledged that you have no knowledge of something that's taking place. But yet, you're on ECTV. You're presenting things as a body representing the residents but you have no facts. And if people had the ability to come forward with their facts on ECTV, what would that change for this city? What change would that drive in this city, not to cause ruffled feathers but to inform the electorate on maybe we're going the wrong way. And maybe the hill wouldn't be all ripped up like it is now. Maybe we could actually do some things and start a real conversation on where to go. And look it, maybe some people would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 be on ECTV, I don't know, doing graduations from high school. Maybe they'd be talking about making recipes at home because that's what it was about. But, you know, I think what the Congress and Senate wanted to do is inject the public into the politic s of their local communities to make changes that enhance the life of the resident s. And that's what we need in Scranton . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Don Jones. David Cawley. That exhausts the list. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka , stepping up for a second run. It's interesting with this -- since I have some extra time since I already had five minutes touching on the zoning again. It's interesting that if I went into the zoning office and I walked in with a proposal to have my land rezoned and I said, this is what I want for my zoning but I have no plan. I have no documents . I've done no research . I've done no water layout. I've done nothing on parking . It's all in my head. Will you give me the zoning variance that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 require ? I would be laughed out of the Zoning Board. Plain and simple without that documentation going into the Zoning Board for a variance you can't get those changes . They look at you and say you're deficient . Yet this body wants to accept a hospital who comes forward and says the same exact thing. I have absolute ly nothing to show you. Give me the change without anything to show. That way when -- I won't have to go to the zoning board and show them something before I build it. That's the 40 -- the 60 -- the 60 foot difference is the difference between them having to go before the zoning board and showing cause. Dr. Rothchild mentioned and asked how many doctors and staff were up there on call on a shift. That was danced around. It was avoided. It was ignored. But I wish what was asked was, how many doctors does the emergency room have, not on call but physically in the ER seeing and triaging people on every shift. And as a matter to clarify , not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 student doctors who can look at but cannot actually prescribe or do anything . They could look at it and then have another doctor who is certified come in there afterward s. A lot of facilities use student doctors who come in there, do the initial work and then have a doctor float in the room and float out after giving his blessing . Unfortunately , they skipped how many physicians they have physically on duty. I know a number is hard to come up with because they don't like numbers . They wanted to build back at North Scranton Expressway and Providence Road back behind the Sheetz. They wanted to extend it to a civic zone back there. I think that is the perfect place that should have been that wasn't because it would allow a facility there to grow up behind a gas station in the nook behind a highway with quick and easy access that could be used for dialysis and all sorts of other businesses . It would take the impact out of the Nay Aug Park and move it over next to the school on the opposite side of the highway . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 There's limited impact there. I don't see why that isn't being proposed . Emergency services could be left up there, fine. But that hospital just isn't emergency services . Now to move on with the environmental advisory council that we started off this argument with. My concern in that is in Section 1836B. It says the Mayor may appoint with the advice of Council up to two alternate members . Note the wording of that. You get to choose per the wording on that, two alternate members . It doesn't say that this body gets to choose any members at all. It specifically says in there you get to choose alternates . By the reading of the law and the reading of the word of it, she gets to appoint everyone on staff on there because it specifically directs in this law by the verbiage that this body gets to approve alternate s only. That needs to be corrected and edited. It's wrong. And it's a nice step through that would allow this body to be completely removed from the process . I have a problem about commissions anyway at this point 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 when we're looking at all the legal fees coming down because every commission does have fees to operate , legal fees, paperwork , even if they're small. But we have a ton coming down in the budget at this point that needs to be looked at before feel good commissions , whether valid or not, there are more pressing things on the table that are a financial trouble to the City. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. RINALDI : Council , Dave Rinaldi , Colfax Avenue. I just want to make a couple comments on some of the information that was provided by people who testified on behalf of Geisinger . We had one trauma physician who -- and he was the second one who testified . And he talked about a shooting in West Side. Well, we never heard about the murder right in front of their front entrance at 3 West Olive. I mean, this is what happens when you don't have a neighborhood , these kind of things, crime increases , things like that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 So that's one point that I want to make. The other thing that he said specifically was that the population was increasing . Now, I read to Council at the last Council meeting or the one before from their own study, their most recent study that said population was declining. It said births were declining. Yet, they're telling you we need this. We need this. You know, I don't know whether doctors live in a bubble or what. I know lawyers do. But I could speak for that. But, I mean, I just don't know what they're even talking about. And that brings me to the Dean. Well, we have a shortage of doctors . Well, we have a shortage of doctors because they restrict the number of people who go to medical school. It's a closed society . That's why they make a million dollars . And I don't think they -- they understand all the impact it has on the people who live there. So that's all I wanted to say. Thanks very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Rinaldi .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. MATYJEVICH : Joe Matyjevich , Scranton resident , Vice President of Tripp Park Civic Association , Executive Director of the Bulls Head Weston Field Neighborhood Association . I come here again tonight to ask you if you don't get the answers from CMC that you asked that you leave that item on the table. Don't bring it off the table if they're not going to provide you the answers . Otherwise , we know what's going to happen. There'll be an amendment , reduce the height. It will fail. The zoning will get approved 3 to 2. The people, they don't get anything . They lose again. Neighborhoods , it's part of the Master Plan. Neighborhoods built this city. Years ago there was 13 neighbor hood associations in the city. I don't know how many are left. I know there's Green Ridge. There's North Scranton . There's Bulls Head. There's Tripp Park, the West Side Hyde Park, that's on and off. You know, we've got Oakmont Neighborhood Association . We've got East 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Mountain Residents Association , South Scranton Residents Association , the Dutch Hallow group. There's a number of them but not as active as they were before when they used to have neighborhood council meetings . You know every president or representative from those neighborhoods got together around the table either here or next door to discuss the issues, bring them in here as a collective voice to get things done. I don't see that happening now where this Council , not all of the members of this Council are listening to the people of the city. So I ask you again to leave it on the table if you don't get the answers. And if you don't have it in your heart that it's for the people, vote no or accept the amendment , lower the height, vote yes, let them go back. As Attorney Scacchitti said, it's going to take years if that happens , so be it. We'll still be able to get our service in the hospital if we get sick, not there, down the road. Hate to say leave the city but go to Dickson. You know, you need small quick 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 emergency , Lehigh Valley is right up the road there, you know. They could stitch you up if you get bit by a dog or you break your leg. They could put a cast on. You know, there's plenty of places that we could go. We don't need all of this expansion if it's going to impact the neighbors . And on the second item that you discussed in the beginning of this meeting by bringing the Environmental Advisory Council off of the table moving it to Sixth Order, if in Sixth Order you do not have any motions to make those changes that were recommended here tonight or mentioned here tonight in regard to the alternate s and if Councilman Smurl says it's going to go from three to five and in the Mayor's agreement , if that Mayor appointment s with the advice and consent of Council and five members on this Council say no, if it's with the advice and consent of Council . You maybe want to ask your solicit or to take a look at that, look at past practice s in prior administrations . If Council says no and that person is appoint ed by the Mayor to one of these commissions or board with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 exception of the zoning in which you have authorization , that person can sit at that meeting . I know it for a fact. I know two boards. I know two people. I know what one of those people who sat at the board. He's standing right here in front of you. I was turned down by City Council . I was appointed to the Scranton Parking Authority . I sat there for many years as a member and as a Chairman . Council said no. The solicitor for the Parking Authority said that Mr. Matyjevich was appoint ed by the Mayor. He is dually entitle d to that seat. So if you don't -- if you don't go through and look at that legislation and have a 3-2, you know, where Council gets to appoint , the Mayor gets to appoint , you split an alternate , you will be inn trouble with her appointing or the future Mayor appointing. And this Council has no say on that appointment . So I ask you to consider that. I ask you to consider the vote. And I ask you to remember the people because the people are what makes this city. And without the people here, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 we don't have a city. We don't have a neighborhood . And we need that because in today's world if we're not together , we don't have anything . And thank you for your time. And I ask you to reconsider , you know, those amendment s that were placed here to lower that height. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Matyjevich . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , Virgil Argenta , a/k/a Victor Arnetta . I'm here tonight in regards to some public health issues regarding the homeless camps. Well, first of all, the lack of running water and no toilets makes definitely an unsanitary living environment . Here's Geisinger 's chance to step up to the plate and check and see how many children are living in those homeless camps, how many sick individual s are in need of care. I had open heart surgery , triple bypass. It was no joy coming home. I needed somebody to take care of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 me. How many people are in these camps that we don't know about, the spread of disease and bacteria that attack the vermin and rats. If we don't clean this up now, we may find ourselves in the middle of something more serious , a health epidemic . These camps can be very hazardous to the resident s. Most frequent diseases are due to the unhygienic conditions , TB, HIV, AIDS, Hep C, which spread very quickly -- the doctor can attest to that, blood born pathogens . There are large amounts of trash left behind, aren't just every day household items. Leaving these materials unattended can result in tremendous risk to both the homeless population and the people living nearby. They create a negative impact on the environment . They are threats to businesses . There's high criminal activity in the area. Did anybody take their grandchildren or children or just their wives or significant other for a walk on that trail? Come back and let me know how you think. Guaranteed you won't go back unless your locked and loaded. Check the pavilion on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 Olive Street, see if you want to sit there and have a drink and a hoagie from Catalano 's or Nicky's. Guarantee you won't. There are few of these homeless camps with propane tanks. Does anybody find that an issue? When it's cold out we have code blue. We take over Weston Field. When it's hot weather advisories and it's hot we have code red. We were on a fire watch list last week. Did anyone check the area and the surround ings to make sure none of these vinyl and nylon tents weren't in a fire zone for hazardous conditions ? These guys are human lives too. Think about that. Thank for your time. I'll be back. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: A few comments . I visited the DPW last week with a few questions . First was about Rubicon , and I asked about when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 they were going to implement or what was going on with it. And I was advised that they have a two-year window to complete a route. And they are nearing that completion now is what I was told. It should be up and running by mid-May. And then they will start doing their test runs in different areas of the city. It won't be implemented all at once because of, I guess, too much confusion. And at this time when they start doing that, they don't plan on making any changes to the pickup day schedule . Everything should stay the same for now. I also went to the 1300 block of Prospect Avenue where I saw a bunch of City equipment there. And it turned out they we were replacing 120 feet of underground drainage line because the other utilities could not complete their project s over there until that was done. That as on a stormwater drain that was under there. And the Monroe Avenue, the gentleman that was here from Monroe Avenue, I went and looked at that road. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MR. KING: Mr. Raines. MR. SMURL: I'm sorry? MR. KING: Mr. Raines. MR. SMURL: Mr. Raines, yes. Yeah, I went and look at it I believe last Thursday night we were going by there and I got out and looked at it. It seems both ends of the street are higher and all the mud and stuff seems to go down to the right of his driveway . So I did ask Director Pietreface , you know, what are we going to do about it. He advised me they have a plate grinder or a plate something . They are going to go down and I guess core the macadam and see how deep it is and then recommend how far down the street should be taken, milled down before it actually is paved. It is on the paving list. I saw it on the list they have down there for the fall. And I asked while he was there with that equipment if he would maybe take a skid steer down and run both sides of the street because whoever the contractor was, all of the mud and stuff is all over the street. And I asked if he would scrape that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 all down and then, you know, do one side one night, no parking and then, you know, take care of the mud and stuff and run the street sweeper there a few times and get that clean. And then the following night to do the other side of the street. And they said they would take care of that this week. So I called on Monday and they said they were still on schedule . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have two items tonight . One was discussed in public comment . Two weeks ago I asked Mr. Voldenberg to reach out to the Scranton Police Department or any other members of the administration about the homeless camps that were visible along the express way. I do know that there's others. I didn't see that we got any information back on that. I do know that in the fall when I mention ed it the police were out there within two hours of our meeting. So can we just follow up on that? It seems that those camps have grown in the last two weeks. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up with it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. And I did get an address to be sent to code enforcement , 305-307 Putnam Street in North Scranton if we could also send that over to code enforcement . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No, I have no motions or comment s at this time. Thank you. MR. KING: Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so last night I was at the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association and a resident had a concern . So she saw not in Scranton but very close at the Forest Hill Cemetery on the other side I guess of the School of the Deaf, big equipment , big piping. She was wondering if that's the start or part of the Meadow Brook Project that, you know, we haven't been updated on. So I told her I would look into it for her. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please either reach out to Mr. King -- not this one -- Don King or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 administration just to see if this is the start of it and we're jumping in or where are we at with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to all parties . MR. MCANDREW : Okay. And then I do remember maybe two years ago there was a problem with the homeless camps that Mr. Argenta just brought up. I remember it was a huge issue on Olive Street, the trail, that the big pavilion where there was a lot of needles and a lot of, you know, some unsanitary stuff and starting around this time of the year. And I know that there's a process for that and that was cleaned up. And so maybe we have to take a look at these different areas so they don't get out of control . You got to love them, you know, we want to try to help them; but I think we need to take another look at that if you would please do that or remind the people to do it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And that's all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Having said that, I had the opportunity on Sunday morning to join Mr. Smurl and Dr. Rothchild and several other individuals who help out up at Nay Aug Park and Rec Authority to do a cleanup on the hill there on I guess that would be -- still considered South Main Avenue, right, coming up the hill from the expressway ? Yeah, it's North Main. Yeah, I guess it's North Main there. And I was just impressed with the -- like, I know that these individuals that helped out and did a tremendous amount of time and work. It was amazing , the cleanup that was done and the grass cutting. And actually I picked up a needle myself with, you know, fortunately I had a grabber. But to your point about the, you know, the homeless , you know by going down there cutting all of those weeds and picking up all that garbage and cleaning up that area and kind of opening it up a little bit more, it kind of helps to open up the area so that it would lend itself to make them more visible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 which would then prevent I think from things like that happening .
