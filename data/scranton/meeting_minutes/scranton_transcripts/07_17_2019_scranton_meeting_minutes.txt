Regarding the mayoral appointment by Council , Council is working on this process . We've collected 16 letters of interest and resumes from potential appoint ees. I would like to thank everyone who made a submission . We're reviewing them and we've begun discuss ing our next steps. Tentatively we're hoping to hold interviews next Monday with candidates and then move from there. So there will be a public advertisement placed in the newspaper regarding when these interviews are going to take place. And there will be more to come on that. Secondly , Council will hold a public caucus in Council Chambers with PEL on Wednesday , July 21st at 12 noon to discuss the city's exit plan -- 31st. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 (The following speakers offered public comment as follows : Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Fay Franus spoke on matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on matters of general concern . Len Srebro spoke on matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A motions . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, just very quickly . I just want to take time and I know my colleagues will speak on this a little bit. I just want to thank everybody for their letters of interest we received this week for the vacancy of mayor for our city. I know it takes a lot of time, a lot of thought and a lot of consideration to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 actually put yourself forward and knowing full well the job at hand. On a good day, the job at hand of running our city is immense . So I could only imagine what those people must feel walking into a situation right now where we really need a fantastic leader with the qualifications and the intestinal fortitude to do the job at hand. So I appreciate everybody who stepped forward to submit those letters of interest along with their resumes. And I know the five of us are right now currently pouring over everything . Again, we'll talk more on the process of how we're going to handle that. I know Mr. Rogan already did. Mr. Bolus made a comment about having the Council stay on as the Executive Branch until November . Unfortunately , you know, we've been eating and sleeping this process for the last month now. And that's just something that's just not -- it's just not by law available . If we don't make a decision within 30 days, if Council s fails to make a decision 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 on appointment , the judges will just make that decision for us. So we don't have that option to stay on as the Executive Branch and keep the city running until an election in November and a swearing in in January . It's just not -- it's just not on the table. And the whole time the process and the mindset behind this Council was to take this decision of the mayor out of the hands of the few and put it in the hands of the many. And that's why we don't want it to go to the courts. We want to make this short-term appointment right here with five and then give that to a November election . Now, the November election isn't perfect either. But that's the system that we have. Right now how it's going to work is the November election if there is any independent candidates who qualify with a signed petition , they're going to be able to be on the ballot as well as any -- as well as the two parties ' candidates that come of their choosing . There won't be a primary like there normally is. But the general -- once the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Democratic party, Republican party and any qualifying independent s, they will get their chance on the ballot and then there will be an election . All the plans that were laid out to us to get ourselves a leader that we need I felt and we all felt that that was the best way to do it. You know, we did not want to have to make a decision of the five us to see who's going to be in charge of the city for five years -- or for the next two and a half years. I think that was just -- that was just too immense . So, you know, that's kind of the situation that we have right now. And, you know, we're going to make -- next week we're going to make painstaking measure s to go over and talk to as many candidates as possible . I guarantee you every candidate who submitted a letter of interest will be contacted and notified . And if we get a chance to interview everybody , we will. If not, you know, that's just -- everybody will be notified and contacted . Because again, that is something that when you take the time to submit a resume 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 and a letter of interest for a job this immense , it comes with -- respect works both ways. And I think we owe that to everybody . And I thank them for stepping up to do their role. And also Mr. Srebro was here with that ongoing problem that you're having. I'm going to just -- you want a different response . I'm thinking as you're talking not being an engineer and not being able to dig the hole myself, unfortunately , we're a -- I know I say this quite often. We're a conduit . This body right here is a conduit to get citizens ' issues and issues of our community into the right hands of the people who can actually get the problem done. And the problem right now hasn't been fixed even though we have given that information to the people who have the ability to fix it. So sometimes that's kind of where the roadblock is. You're coming to us. We already went to them. The problem is not fixed. You come back to us. And, you know, we already handed that off to the people who should have that taken care of.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Now, if there is not information coming back to the resident , then that's also an issue. So that's kind of where we are right now. Is there an issue? Is there a timetable ? So I'll make a -- I'll call the engineer myself in the next couple of days. And I still have your number, Mr. Srebro. So I'll get information off to him and see where we are with this. But unfortunately , you know, it's just -- that's just not something that we delve into every day. We make sure we take the information . We give it to the right person. And, you know, nothing feels worse than someone coming to me for help or one of us for help and we're not able to fulfill our obligations . You know, it's kind of -- it's definitely not satisfying . I know you're not happy with it either or why should you be. But that's something that we'll just keep working on. And that's all I have for today. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. ROGAN: Mr. Evans, any motions or comment s? MR. EVANS: Yeah, very briefly . A little before the noon deadline , I delivered to our City Council Office my letter of interest for the interim Mayor position . This was not an easy decision for me. Those closest to me know how much I struggled with making it. But in the end at this moment at this time and in my heart, I feel I made the right choice. So to the many people who urged me to bypass this entire scenario and run for the full two-year term in November , thank you for your support and your kind words along the way. I know you may be disappoint ed in this particular decision . But I know that you care more about Wayne Evans the person than Wayne Evans the political candidate . So because of this, I now am a candidate for this position . I will be removing myself from the decision making process to appoint the interim mayor. These four capable gentlemen to my right will now have the full responsibility . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 And I know they will take it very seriously . And in the end, they will do what they believe is the right thing to do for the City of Scranton . So that's all I have tonight. Who knows what the future will bring. In the meantime , every day is your chance to make this city a little better. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Thank you. Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit the 300 block of Harrison Avenue. Mrs. Reed has been helping me with a property on this block. I visited with the neighbors who live next door. I thought 913-915 Eynon Street was one of the worst homes that I had seen in the city in regards to being blighted . But this one might be on par with that. The people who live next door are elderly. They had been calling the city over a number of different years. The interesting thing is this house has not been occupied in 20 years. The porch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 is falling in. I could go on and on. But anyways, I'm going to try to get together with the Council , the LIPS Department to see if we can find some sort of resolution to that issue. Also, we receive d a complaint about 107-109 North Sumner Avenue. I talked to the neighbor last night about that. So we're going to try to help him get that safety issue taken care of. Also, Mrs. Reed, 950 James Avenue, the property 's been abandoned since 2013. It's been foreclosed since 2014, same thing, issues with the property , quality of life issues. Also, Mrs. Reed, if you could check when the utility project is set to begin on Oram Street. I've gotten several calls about the condition . We were in touch with DPW. We did receive word back that they weren't going to put it on the paving list or improve it because the utility company is doing a project . But they would like to know at this point when that's going to occur. Also, the city was awarded a Green Light-Go project grant in the amount of $135,200 from PennDOT for traffic signal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 replacement at Green Ridge Street and Wyoming Avenue. And the city will put up $33,800 as a cash match. I also just want to say that I'm still obviously going through all of the resumes that were submitted . I think now we're at 16. I would like to thank everyone who submitted their name. In the last few weeks with what has gone on, I've actually never been more hopeful for this city. Never in my five and a half years have I had more hope. And that is because I have spoken to so many people in this city who are not ready to throw in the towel and they're not ready to give up. Last week I met with some neighbors up on East Mountain , same thing. People have invested their time, their money. They've lived here their entire lives. And they are hopeful . So whoever the next mayor is, if it's Councilman Evans or any of the other 15 people that submitted their names, I think all of us, this Council and all of the people in the city need to rally around whoever that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 person is because for all the negative things that you hear about Scranton -- and some of them are true; there are a lot of positive things that have gone on in the last few years and are currently going on. One of the things that we have going for us in the city is our people and our neighborhoods . We have very strong neighborhoods . We have very strong neighborhood groups. Whoever the next Mayor is really needs to focus on holding our neighborhoods together . That is the most important thing I think that is going to have to be accomplished here in the next few years. Because once the neighborhoods go, then we're in trouble . So I think we have great people. We have strong neighborhoods . We need to bring people together . Whoever the next mayor is we do need to stand behind them. And as I mentioned last week, there's no place to go in my opinion but up. So, you know, I pledge as a member of this Council and I think my colleagues would agree with me that we are all going to work together .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 We're taking this process very seriously . And we're going to try our best to make the best choice for the citizens of Scranton . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just a couple quick comments regarding the appointment . I would first like to thank everyone who reached out to me and encouraged me to apply. For me, the timing certainly wasn't right. And I really do appreciate Councilman Evans stepping up as well as the other 15 people who have put in their applications . It is as I'm seeing as Active Mayor over the last few weeks, it is a very important and very stressful job. And it's one that certainly requires 100 percent attention from the applicants . Although it's something I would be interested in doing at some time in my life, I have a one-year-old daughter at home who I love spending time with. So unfortunately , the timing for me wasn't right. But I do appreciate all of those that have put in, especially our colleague 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Mr. Evans. I just want to remind the folks who did apply and we did mention this at our first meeting . We are requesting the applicant s not to contact individual Council people to lobby them. And we've also asked them not to contact others to lobby us. We want to do this process , do the interviews , debate amongst ourselves without any outside influence from other people involved in politics or the community trying to pressure Council people to vote for a certain candidate . I know that's happened unfortunately in the past when there's been appointments for City Council . I know all of our phones rang off the hooks during that time period. So we want to do this process amongst ourselves. Obviously if there's members of the public that have input they are free to speak at our public meeting s. But we are going to work through this process . I think we have a good idea of how this is going to go as far as having the special meeting to hear from candidates , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 whittle it down and then debate amongst ourselves and come to a conclusion . One important point I do want to make and I think all of us up here express support for having a special election . But a special election does not happen unless Council makes an appointment . If it does go to the courts, the courts would make the pick for two and a half years. So this is a very critical process for Council to come to a consensus regarding one of these applicants for the short term six month appointment to allow that special election to take place. That is all. MS. REED: 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. PREVIOUSLY TABLED FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR ADOPTION RESOLUTION NUMBER 128 2019 APPROVING AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER AND APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ENTER IN A SETTLEMENT AND MUTUAL GENERAL RELEASE WITH 500 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 LACKAWANNA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY CONCERNING PROJECT NUMBER AS NOTED FROM THE URBAN DEVELOP MENT ACTION GRANT PROGRAM FOR LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $550,000 PASSED BY RESOLUTION NUMBER 39 2006. MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. DONAHUE : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . We had a caucus before the meeting with Attorney Kelly from the Redevelopment Authority , Attorney Gallagher who represented OECD, and Mary-Pat Ward who is the Executive Director of OECD. I'm going to be voting in favor of this legislation if for no other reason than if we all vote against it after speaking with everyone in the caucus, we're going to continue to embroil ourselves in further cost and litigation . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 This has been going on now for a number of different years. So that would be the reason that I would vote for it. The second reason is that this vacant lot that currently sits next to Buona Pizza on Lackawanna Avenue will become now a tax producing property . According to the settlement agreement , the owners of this property now either have put up a building , some kind of improvement there or make it a green space. And the third reason is the city would get -- the SRA would get $197,000 now free to redevelop other projects or other properties or to start another development . So again, the benefits here in my opinion outweigh the negatives . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: Yeah, on the question . I want to touch on the SRA component for a little bit. That is truly the silver lining in this process is the critical funding of the Scranton Redevelopment Authority . You know, I've long been an advocate for the -- creating more active and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 re-energized SRA. And crazy enough, this legislation found a way to do that and put $197,000 into the SRA is going to be a big, big deal for them as well as the city. And if they use that property , we can see some great activity going on in the city with that money. So that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS.
