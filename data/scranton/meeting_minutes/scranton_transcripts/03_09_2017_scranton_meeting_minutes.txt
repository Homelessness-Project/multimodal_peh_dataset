Theschool district ,thecityandthecounty areparticipating intheabatement soI'm goingtorequest theadministration tosee iftheycandosomething onthemarketing approach tosomeoftheseideasthatweput forthoutthereinthepublic sowecanget someactivity andgrowth inthecity.

Onpension reforms,following upon mycomments lastweek,Iwouldliketooffer abasicoutline ofsomeofthereformsI wouldliketoseerelative tothepensions andsomeoftheircomments aboutpension reform itself.Clearly ,thenumber one thingthathastobedoneisthehiring and theimplementation ofanindependent third partyadministrator whowillhavespecific duties relative todisability pensions . Thishastobeinplacepriortoany infusion ofthefundsintothepension plan. Ialsothinkit'simperative to reduce thecurrent rateofreturn.It's current lyatarateof8percent ,whichis toohighandcertainly notsustain able. Whenwedon'treachthatnumber,ithasa negative impact ontheMMO.Conversely ,if1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 welowertherateofreturn tosay7.5 percent ,andweexceed ourexpectations we canactually lowertheMMOwiththeexcess proceeds beyond therateofreturn.Totake itfurther ,Iwouldliketoseeanyexcess proceed orsomeoftheexcessproceeds receive dbeyond therateofreturn to further buydownthatrateuntilwereachan evenmorerealistic rateofreturn assumption .Thisissomething thatthe Auditor General wasadamant aboutinhis report aboutScranton 'spension s.Oneof hisrecommendations wastocallfor,andI quote,"Theuseofhonest estimates of investment returns ." Butforthecitytogetevena.25 percent reduction itwouldtakealmost $4.5 million tobuythatreduction ,butIthink it'smoneywellspentbecause theeffects of thiswillbepositive fordecades .Wecan't continue tohaveashort-termviewon everything thatwedo.Weneedtolookat ourdecision withaviewtowards long-term impact asforourcityandourtaxpayers . Another reformthatIwouldliketo1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 seewouldbeaclarification ofthequota funding onlyaftertheplanreaches the50 percent level.Thecurrent theplanisnot absolutely clearanddoesnoteven percentage level.Whilethismayrequire legislation ormayrequire andMOUwiththe unions,thisissomething thattheCourts haveviewed inourfavorinthepastandI thinkit'ssomething thatweallagreecan happen relatively easily. Thecurrent rulesthatgovern the pension boards are,quitefrankly ,allover theplaceanddisjointed atbest.Ifeela comprehensive ordinance thatcodifies allof therulesofthepension fundshould be developed andpassed asasingle new ordinance .Thisissomething thatwecan discuss withAttorney Durkin whenhecomes tovisitusatourcaucus nextweek. Iwouldalsoliketoseesome changes inthemakeup ofthepension boards. Mygoal,attheveryleast,wouldbetoadd another boardmember toeachpension board whowouldbeacitizen representative , someonewhoisclearly independent ofthe1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 boardandthepensionsandwhohasa background infinances and/oraccounting . Inaddition ,orasananother alternative ,Iwassuggest creating an independent boardofaninvestment experts thatcanbeusedasaresource forthe existing pension boards.Oncereformsare made,Iwouldfurther recommend thatthe fundsfromtheproceed oftheSSAsalethat arededicated tothepensions beplacedina trustandmanaged outside ofthecurrent pension boardstructure .Theremaybe additional reformstobediscussed aswell withsomeofmycolleagues andhopefully somefromtheadministration .Ifnot,even offeradditional proposalastimemoveson orasthecoming weeksapproach ,butwealso havetokeepinmindthatbecause therehas notbeenfiscal reformdoneatthestate level,someofwhatIdiscussed mayoccurin oversight bystatestatute andmaynoteven beallowed sowearegoingtofindout.We aregoingtoaskAttorney Durkin andwewill askAttorney Minora whenhereturns tosee ifwecanreconcile thosereformswithsome1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 ofthestatelawsthatgovern thepensions . Tothatpoint,clearly therehas beenalackofvision orcommitment onthe statelevelindealing withmunicipal pension reform.Forexample ,inCalifornia , specifically SanDiego,statestatute sallow foracomplete restructuring ofSanDiego's pension boardsothatthemajority of pension boardmembers are,infact, independent members withfinancial and investment expertise asopposed tounionand cityrepresentatives whohaveaninherent conflict ofinterest whendetermining the pension benefits . InRhodeIsland,statelawdictates thatCOLAadjustments weresuspended for pensions iftheywerefunded lessthan80 percent .Ourstatelawdoesn'tdefine a number. InMichigan ,asfarbackas1997, allnewhireswiththestatewere automatically enrolled inadefined contribution or401-Kstyleplaninwhich thestatecontributes 4percent toeach employee 'ssalary.Thatwasnearly 20years1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 ago.WhenIcamebefore andsaid401-Kfor newhiresatthestateandlocallevelthey seemed likeitsentshivers doesthespines andthebacksofeverybureaucrat Italked to.Weareshortchanging newhiresand future employees butnotoffering this option,aswellasourtaxpayers . Asanexample ofhowemployees may feelaboutthedifference between adefined benefit planandadefinedcontribution plan,again,a401-K-typeplan,whenyou haveachoice youonlyneedtolookatthe StateofNewYork.Nearly 100yearsago, theStateUniversity ofNewYorkhadadopted apension system thatallows workers to choseatraditional defined benefit planor tochoseadefined contribution planora 401-K.In2010,71percent ofalluniversity employees wereinthe401-Kplan. Attheendoftheday,weneedto moveforward toourpension management system thatshould beapolitical , transparent ,andperformance driven.While thismaybeaworkinprogress ,Iwould remind allcurrent pension boardmembers1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 thattheyhaveafiduciary dutytopreserve theplan'slong-termsustain ability andto makedecisions aboutpension reform that reflect thatdutynowandinthefuture. Weareallinthistogether andwe allwantahealthy ,sustainable pension plan forallcurrent andfuture retirees ,while balancing ourobligations toourtaxpayers asaprimary consideration .Itwouldbe irresponsible ofusaselected official sto infuse thepensions withcashwithout reasonable andlonglasting reforms.That's allIhaveonthattonight .Thankyou.

Wehaverepeatedly hereoncouncil talked aboutthecondemnation ordinance and thefactthatweneedtoreviewitandwe needtochange it,andwedidgetavery interesting proposalfromthedirector of theLackawanna County TaxClaimBureau,and I'djustliketoreadsomeofwhathesaid andthenIwouldlikeoursolicitor tooka lookatthissowecanpossibly form legislation .Hegoesontosayinthis e-mailtocouncil that,"Wehavehadsuccess selling property intheCityofScranton ,1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 however ,Iamgetting lessactivity on condemned citydwellings because ofwhatI believe isalegislative glitch incity condemned property ordinance .Letmesay,I believe yourordinance isfinetohold landlords whohavelettheirproperties beingblighted innon-compliance withthe citycodesaccountable fortheiractions by aposted bondpriortosecuring abuilding permit.WhereItakeexception tothisis whenanewownerfromthecounty judicial saleisheldtothesamestandard .These owners werenottheonesthatputinthe property incondemnation .Thesepeople are theonestrying togetitoutof condemnation ,repair ittocode,soldor leased andbackonthetaxrollandblight eliminated .
