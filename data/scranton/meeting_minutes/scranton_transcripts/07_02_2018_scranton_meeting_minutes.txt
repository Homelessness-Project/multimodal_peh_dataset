PERRY: The only comment I have for today is Fourth of July is coming up, be safe, enjoy it, and I'll see you next Monday. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MR. DONAHUE : Really the only comment I have is I completely agree with what Joan brought up about the Tax Claim Bureau. I think we should be involved in that. So, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send a letter to the county asking for information regarding the privatization of the Tax Claim Bureau? And that's all I have. Everyone have a safe and happy Fourth of July. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Well, since I wasn't here last week I guess I get a little extra time so I'll espouse a little bit. The recent report that the so-called Castle house is once again moving towards demolition only exacerbates the viewpoint that our condemnation policy as well as our demolition policy is clearly in need of a full review. When we cannot find solutions to solving the Castle House dilemma then we are doing something wrong. When we condemn houses only because they may be vacant and because they have tall grass then we are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 doing something wrong. When we have homes that should be and could be rehabbed consistently facing the wrecking ball then we are doing something wrong. We need to take a different look at vacant and abandoned properties and begin to categorize and prioritize them, allowing for different approaches and solutions to individual properties . Each abandoned property can be viewed differently and should be treated differently . The first example would be if a house is abandoned , but it can be repaired right now, then LIPS needs to do everything possible to bring that building in compliance through enforcement of existing laws. Condemnation cannot be the sole answer because it simply is not the only answer. In fact, when a home is condemned in Scranton you have effectively sentenced that property in many cases to a slow death toward demolition and marketability . You have immediate ly reduced that property 's market value. You have reduced the market value of the neighboring properties and you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 could have very well reduced the market value of the entire block in that neighborhood . The resolution to removing a home from condemnation can be long and it can be difficult and it can be costly. While I'm not suggesting that property should never be condemned , that would be a naive viewpoint on my part, but it should be a process used with great care and with great consideration to the possible outcomes of the decision to condemn . To get back to my averments that vacant and abandoned properties should be reviewed different ly and in different categories , the second example of vacant homes would be those that can be repaired but only at a later time. The castle house would fit into this category , and this is where we struggle to do what we need to do. We struggle most in that case and this is where we need to get a coherent and consistent plan that allows for rehab even if takes time to get there. Demolition should always be the last solution to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 problem . Some states have recently enacted good samaritan laws that allow any person or group to clean up and mow the grass around a house that has been determined to be abandoned without concern for liability . This could be a valuable tool in buying time to avoid demolition while keeping the outside of the property from being a neighborhood eyesore. And the final example would be houses that cannot be repaired for various other reasons . This might be the only time that demolition may, in fact, be appropriate . While we have made great strides with the advent of the land bank, there are properties that are abandoned or just vacant that sometimes do not fit neatly in that category that allows the land bank to step in. There may be other avenues like receivership that may be looked into where the code enforcement department can ask the Courts to name a nonprofit or another qualified person to make essential repairs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 and place a lien on that abandoned property which would be reimbursed when the property is sold. So while there no easy solutions and we need to begin to address this before we lose more houses that should be rehabbed , before we lose more blocks and more neighborhoods to blight, condemnation and demolition . We need to make decision s based on new algorithms , data driven decisions and, of course, common sense decisions . The lifeblood of our neighbor hoods are single family homes and the homeowners that live in them. We have an amazing stock of historic homes with lots of character and when those homes are vacant and abandoned demolition should be far down the list of options. So I'd like to further discuss this with my colleagues as far as how do we begin the process of offering solutions while making some positive changes maybe through a public caucus or work session or even a task force. Whatever form that is chosen is fine with me, but we need to get a handle on this issue and soon. So first we would like to commit to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 resolving the issues of the castle house and quite possibly may found through that process we can begin to create a blueprint to solve future problems as well. In the meantime, Attorney Minora, if you could research state law to see if we have anything that mirrors the good samaritan laws that are used by other states as well the concept of receivership if that would work for some properties as another tool in our fight against blight. So that's all I have for this evening . Thank you. Or this afternoon , I should say. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, Mrs. Reed, if we could send something to the DPW or the city engineer asking about the retention pond that Mr. Srebro brought up I would appreciate that. Also, I had a question , I meant to mention this last week, I read in the minutes of one of the Pension Board meetings about the city possibly splitting the cost of doctor's fees with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Pension Board so if we could send a letter to the city solicitor and ask if they have a cost estimate for that yet and how much that would cost the city and I would actually like to know more about how that would be run. Also, in the caucus I asked for an update on the status of the various lawsuits currently against the city. I would like to know where they are procedurally in the Courts, and we also asked for a caucus with the city solicitor to give us an update on that. Several citizen concerns , quite a few in the plot. Traffic concerns on Bates, Brighton and Grace Street, heavy traffic . The gentlemen that reached out to me would like the chief of the police to be aware of several issues here so we are going to send something to Chief Graziano . Also, I ask for an update, and I think I mentioned this two weeks ago, there is flooding issues on Kirst Court, 400 block of Duncan Street, serious flooding is actually when it rains the water is pouring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 into this gentleman 's in ground pool so I'd like an update on that from the DPW if anybody has been out to take a look at that. Also, I did meet with a neighbor in the vicinity of the 1120 Columbia Street just this morning and she did split and wanted me to submit to this council a petition , I'm going to read that in a second. There are several pages of signatures here and then there are pictures of property at 1120 Columbia Street, so I do want to read this petition into the record. "To the Honorable City Council of the City of Scranton : We, the undersigned , are property owners in the vicinity of 1120 Columbia Street, Scranton . Please be advised that for the last nine years we have watched this building and property deteriorate and become an eyesore in the neighborhood . Furthermore , be assured that it has had an adverse effect on our property values. Recently a developer purchased the property and much to our dismiss became aware of Thursday , June 28, 2018, that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 City Department of Licenses and Inspections on the order of it's director Patrick Hinton issued a stop work order to the developer to halt cleaning up the property and removing all debris from the property . The developer is a well-respected property owner in Greenridge . We have watched him rehabilitate numerous blighted properties throughout the city. We can attest to the great work he has done to improve dilapidated buildings throughout this municipality . The new owner of the property applied for building permits on May 31, 2018. In addition , he provided the city with a $10,000 bond as required for all condemned properties . He also informed the Department of Licenses , Inspections and Permits that the timetable to work would be completed . Mr. Hinton has failed to approve his permits within the legal framework of 15 days from submission of the application . Therefore , under Pennsylvania State Code, which is attached , we urge council to advise Mr. Hinton to issue said permits so that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 developer can complete this project immediately . Mr. Hinton informed the owner he would need to apply to the city Housing Appeals Board to remove the property from the demolition list. The developer was assured he would be placed on the June Housing Appeals Board agenda. The housing appeal -- the Housing Board of Appeals canceled their June meeting due to lack of a quorum. We urge the department to immediately allow the work to be started as per the timetable outlined in the original permit application since we cannot be assured that the board will have a quorum in the months of July and August. This eyesore should be of the upmost concern if the members of council not only because of its condition but moreover the safety hazard it presents . One needs to look no further than last week's arson in an abandoned home on East Mountain that tragically killed one person due to a fire. Urge Mr. Hinton to comply with Pennsylvania State Code and issue these building permits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 immediately . Sincerely , the undersigned . See attached petitions ." And, as I mentioned , there is about three, three and a half pages of residents of Greenridge who have signed these petitions , and there are also pictures that are attached that show the dilapidated condition of the building . First of all, I would like to know if we can actually ask Mr. Hinton to come into a caucus and explain why he has not approved these permits , number one; and number two, you know, exactly why the City of Scranton and the Licensing and Inspections Departments is not working with these developers who want to put money into these properties and to fix them up? It seems to me that instead of working with people, instead of working with developers we are working against them as Mr. Evans correct ly pointed out a minute ago, and it's my belief that the city has been putting up too many road blocks in front of these people for far too long. Demolition should be a last resort, and it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 my suggest ion on top of what Mr. Evans said that maybe we should meet with contractors in the city and developers and find out exactly what their opinions are on how they think we can move forward, and I would also support looking into a good samaritan law. There is many times where people are sick and tired of waiting for the bank to send somebody out or a property owner to cut the grass and they would just like to go and clean it up themselves so they don't have to look at it any longer. So there are people that are willing to help and willing to go out of their way. But, again, the city prevents them from doing that because of the liability . And I have similar concerns and feelings about the castle house in Greenridge . It is a beautiful building and the city does want to demolish that. I think we should give people the opportunity to either purchase it or rehab it, and I was glad to hear today that the grass has finally been cut there. So, again, the city should be building up instead of tearing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 down. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just one brief comment then I have a couple of comments on agenda items. I would like to echo the sentiments of my colleagues . The Fourth of July is coming up in a couple of days. Hope everyone has a very happy and safe holiday . Please enjoy it responsibly . I know there will be lots of fireworks going off in the city so, again, please be safe and we look forward to seeing everyone next week. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE CAPITAL PROGRAM (RACP) THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA 'S OFFICE OF THE BUDGET IN THE AMOUNT OF (2,000,000.00) DOLLARS ; ACCEPTING AND DISBURSING THE GRANT AND COORDINATE THE USE OF THE GRANT FUNDS WITH "SCRANTON -CHERRY, LP", FOR THE PROJECT TO BE NAMED THE "SCRANTON COUNSELING CENTER". MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , that has come before us I think a few months ago and last year, so I think total the state has invested $4 million in this project , which I couldn't be happier about, because this is going to revitalize the former button factory on Cherry Street, the 300 block of Cherry Street, so it's going to revitalize that building , which really needs it, anybody who has driven by that can understand . And it's also going to be provide a great opportunity for the redevelopment of the entire 300 block of Adams Avenue as a follow-up project which is, again, sorely needed. Anybody who works downtown or who travels downtown knows that the 300 block of Adams Avenue gets congested very quickly because of the drop off and pick up at the Scranton Counseling Center, and the building there is really not meant for that type of environment . So this is going to revitalize really two neighbor hoods in the 300 block of Adams Avenue and in South Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 So, again, I want to thank Governor Wolf for his commitment to this project and look forward to seeing it to it's finality . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Regarding this project , I agree with much of what Councilman Gaughan mentioned , but I do have a couple of different questions . As was mentioned , this is actually the third piece of legislation we have received regarding this project . The first was in 2017, which was a $1 million grant, earlier this year they received another million dollar grant, and this is for an additional $2 million grant from the state. While I fully support this project and want to see it happen, I would like to understand a little bit more maybe possibly from the Governor 's office or Senator Blake's office the process of approval for the RACP grants. It seems that an awful lot is going to one developer , and again, not speaking ill of the project or the work that he does, because he does great projects , I just want to have a better understanding on how these funds are finally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 approved , because I know there are number of other large projects going on throughout the city that have not received the significant infusion of public dollars. So I definitely do want to look into that a little bit further before the final vote, but as was mentioned , I do support the project , I think it will help revitalize that portion of the city, just looking for a little bit of a better understanding why one project could draw from the same pot three, four times when another project may not receive any funding . I'm sure there is a good reason for it, but just so we could understand better on our end. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye.
