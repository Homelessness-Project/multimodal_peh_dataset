CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED JANUARY 3, 2023 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR CITY COUNCIL . MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have two comment s on Third Order items. One, we did get an answer from Mr. West, the Business Administrator about DPW overtime for the month of November and the year ending. Frank, if we could please put that in Third Order for next week? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : And the other thing is, we did get several e-mails about different 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 budget transfers in the last week if we can also add them to Third Order for next week. I did like that these were in Third Order for public view. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. KING: Thank you. Anyone else? Fourth Order. Citizens Participation . If not received and filed, sorry. MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Do we have any more information on the 2021 audit? MR. KING: We did. I think we got some information this afternoon , Mr. Voldenberg , concern ing the audit. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did, Mr. King, this afternoon . It was late. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, well, you could explain that in Fifth Order. MR. KING: Sure. MS. HODOWANITZ : How about the firefighter and police union contracts ? Are they making any progress ? MR. KING: I spoke to the Mayor this afternoon . And it appears as though both the fire and police are going to arbitration . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 believe that is coming up in the next few weeks. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I was looking at the City's website . I noticed that the DPW contract which was approved last September is still not posted. The one they have up there is the one that expired in 2021. I think someone really needs to take a hard look at that website because it's not being well-maintained . But that's where your financial information should be disclose d. Although I was impressed to see that they updated the garbage fee delinquent database . It's now as of November 30th. And apparently as of that date it had an outstanding balance of 11.5 million dollars . I would love to see the property database go up there too. Items 7-A, B, and C, did you ever get the resumes for those three individuals ? They just didn't get posted in time? MR. KING: We did. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did and it should be posted now.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I noticed a very interesting article in Sunday's paper for Brian Fulton's Day in History 115 years ago, January 8th, 1908. Nay Aug Park to get swimming pool. CR Acker, Scranton 's Director of Public Works recommended the creation of a public swimming pool Nay Aug Park in his annual expenditure report. Sometime ago this City Council formally asked Acker to investigate the cost for the creation of the pool somewhere in the city. He felt Nay Aug Park would be the proper place for the pool. He requested -- listen to this -- $8,000 for the project . Go figure. With regard to I believe it's 5-B or 5-C changing the compensation to be paid to the position of City Controller beginning in 2024, that man is getting paid $40,000 a year. Do you realize that that's one of the lowest full-time paid positions in the city for a man who holds a CPA? Now, I like John Murray. But one of these days he's going to move on. And I don't think you'll ever get another CPA to work for 40 grand. On top of that, the payroll clerk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 and DPW administration makes more than he does. And the Treasurer 's cashier makes more than he does. Almost all the secretaries make more than he does. Now I understand that, you know, Council 's been reluctant over the past years on pay raises. But you've got to do something about the Controller 's position . That's one of the most important and sensitive roles in the city. He is your internal watchdog. And you want to make sure that you have someone in there that's competent and is eager to serve the city. You're not going to get many people with qualifications that position requires to do that for $40,000 a year. Even the $13,300 raise is not what you would find most CPAs making, but I hope you get that moving and get that passed as quickly as possible . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here today is that on Thursday -- I don't know when they're going to play it; but I'm going to do a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 video on ECTV that has to do with politics in the city. And I have a guest who is going to come in and speak on that issue. So I just want everybody to -- I would appreciate if people would look at the videos I've done up to this point and reach your own conclusion and your own opinion on what you think of that content and just pay attention because I think that what you do and what you say is very important . And I call on the residents to make a change in this city for the next generation . And it's not going to be easy. But it's going to be something that is extremely necessary . And I'd like to thank the residents of the city who stood up to the Scranton School District and had them remove themselves from the recovery plan. The next thing we need here is a preschool program that covers every child in this city. We need to get our State Rep and our State Senator to come up with about 300 million dollars to refurbish the Scranton Schools and to give the students in the city the tools they need to be successful and become 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 educated . And we can't accept any excuse why it can't be done. And it's time for the state to pay the teachers ' pensions , not the local taxpayers . The other thing I have here is, Mr. King and Mr. Smurl and the whole Council at large, I've made arrangements with ECTV on the 26th at 5:30. And I would like Mr. King and Mr. Smurl to come in and sit at a table and have a discussion on what took place at Nay Aug Park how the pool was removed , the decisions that led to that, the request if there were any from the Scranton Recreational Authority . I'd like to know a timeline on the replacement of the pool. There's just a host of really important issues. Now, the host on a local radio station didn't think, Mr. King, that you would come and sit at a table and inform the residents of what had taken place at Nay Aug. And there's really a total lack of faith in our government from the presidency all the way down. When you see what's taking place, I think it's time for, Mr. Smurl, he was on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Rec Authority to come forward and let's talk about how the Rec Authority surrendered its ownership of the pool and the slide and those assets. And I think we need to talk about all the money that we spent there in grants and how we -- how we came to the conclusion that that's the way we should have proceeded and what role the Mayor played in this whole thing. And I'd like to highlight that I think the residents need to look at the Pine Ridge pool complex that when Ozzie Quinn was the President of the Scranton Lackawanna Taxpayer and Citizens Association , Mr. Doherty wouldn't grant them access to that site to see if the plumbing was still in place to fill the pool because allegedly that's the reason they closed the pool because somebody had taken the copper pipes. MR. KING: Mr. Morgan, you mean the Pine Brook pool? MR. MORGAN: Yes, I mean that pool. MR. KING: Okay, I'm sorry. MR. MORGAN: And now I just think we need to take a very hard look at where all this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 grant money's going to. I think the citizens have a right to know what's happening in their city. And my question is, Mr. King and the Council at large, do you have any interest to sit down and meet on camera with -- at ECTV in an open forum and discuss that issue? MR. KING: I will tell you this that I did approach the Mayor concerning this issue. And late this afternoon she sent us a memo with updates concerning Nay Aug slide removal . And during Fifth Order I believe that Mr. Smurl is going to speak to that. And we are on ECTV right now, I believe so -- MR. MORGAN: You're right -- MR. KING: -- to do it. MR. MORGAN: I'm looking for a forum where there is a give and a take and there's information provided by you, okay, where there could be a dialogue . And this isn't a dialogue . This is like elected official s talking just to the lowly resident s who have never ever had an open dialogue with its Council because this Council and previous ones, they come up with great ideas but then they hide everything . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 You do right to knows and these documents don't exist. So if the Mayor is giving you something , the right to know office says they don't exist. And I think that you, sir, as the -- MR. KING: We can put it in Third Order for next week. MR. MORGAN: Well, I think you should appear. And I think you should bring Mr. Smurl with you. MR. KING: I'm here this evening . MR. MORGAN: Why would you hide? I'll ask you next week. I don't think you should hide from the people you represent , none of the Council members . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner , taxpayer . Back in the summer I was here talking about that I witnessed a pit bull attack on a lady in the Pine Brook section . And it just so happened that the Mayor and police chief were here that night. And I spoke to her and the chief. And I know something was passed a while back. But the Mayor agreed with me and she said she 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 was going to meet with Council because the legislation needs more teeth to it because it's not strong enough. So has anything happened ? MR. KING: Les, where did that occur again? MR. SPINDLER : It was on Capouse Avenue in the Pine Brook Section . I reported it. The police chief knew about it. He was suppose d to send people over to the area. I saw -- luckily the people that owned the dog came running and saved that lady and her dog. She was, like -- and I stopped and said, are you okay? And she said, yeah. But she -- I said, well, you should call the police. She was afraid to because of where she lives. They are afraid there might be retribution . DR. ROTHCHILD : Over the fall time I had a few meetings about changes in the animal legislation for the city. But nothing has happened recently that I know of. So I'll request an update on that. MR. SPINDLER : Okay, because the Mayor did say she agreed with me that the law needs more teeth to it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, Mr. Spindler , I think I spoke on it a little. But, I mean, I'm not in favor of breed specific laws; but if we're going to put the onus on the owner to be more responsible . MR. SPINDLER : Okay, moving on. I brought this up quite a while ago. I used to deliver auto parts for an auto part store in the Hill Section . And I said our parking enforcement people use selective enforcement. I parked the wrong way facing my house a few years ago. I wasn't in the house for that long. I came out. There was a ticket on my car. I wasn't putting anybody in danger. It's not a busy street. I go up -- used to go up and down Vine Street. The kids at the University park right to the corner and I mean right to the corner. And the parking authority -- the parking enforcement people were made aware of it and nothing happened . There was a time up there where there was a jeep parked right to the corner. For three days that jeep wasn't moved, no ticket on it. I face the wrong way on my house 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 and I get a ticket. And here's another example that was just brought to my attention yesterday . I got my oil changed yesterday where I get it changed . I think it's on the 1200 block of Washington Avenue. The mechanic told me he had a car towed there that the tow truck put the car facing the wrong way. He went out to get the car to do something with the car. There was a ticket on it. Right across the street, that's where it happened , the storage building s are being built there on Washington Avenue. There was a pickup truck facing the wrong way. And it was, like, within like 5 feet of a fire hydrant . You have to be 15 feet away, so two violations . That truck was there in the morning when I dropped my car off and the afternoon I picked my car up, no ticket on it. That's what I mean by selective enforcement . Something 's got to be done. If you're going to ticket one car, you got to ticket everybody . Don't play favorites . Lastly, I brought this up last week about my daughter who is a professional wrestler . And I have more information .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 You know, she broke her collarbone. She needed surgery . And this Sunday, the 15th at Classics Bar and Grill, 1259 Bryn Mawr Street they're having a benefit . And I got more information . There's at least two bands. They said there's more to be announced possibly , food and drink. And I just learned tonight that there's going to be baskets for raffles. So it's $10 to get in. It's pay at the door, no tickets . So I hope everybody can show up. I know there's going to be a lot of wrestlers there if you want to come and meet some wrestlers . We'd appreciate it. It should be a good time. So thank you for your time and hope to see everyone Sunday. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Charles Cortese . MR. CORTESE : Good evening, members of Council . My name is Charles Cortese . Myself and my family are resident s and multiple property owners in the 200 block of Wheeler Avenue. I'm here tonight concerning the zoning of the 200 block of Colfax Avenue which will affect the 200 block of Wheeler Avenue, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 1700 block of Roselynn and the entire community of Scranton . It's my understand ing that the new proposal for zoning is to split the 200 block of Colfax Avenue into two separate zones, one side of the street is to be zoned institutional and the other side of the street is to be zoned civic. The major difference is that the primary structure is 45 feet for the institutional and 100 feet for the civic. I cannot wrap my mind around why any reason to split a single block into two separate zoning areas with distinct restrictions on opposite sides of the street. What value added would there be for the City of Scranton to do this? With this new proposal , we, the resident s of the 200 block of Wheeler Avenue will have an 100 foot high wall in our backyard which will further depreciate the value of our property and a 45 foot high wall will be of no consequences facing Nay Aug Park. We now live in a residential area and have for a long time had the burden of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 hospital s both Geisinger and Community Medical Center's aggressive expansion plans. The tax base loss due to Geisinger and the Community Medical Center expansion plan has been and will continue to be a burden to the residents of Scranton property owners. The devaluation of our property is immeasurable and our tax base will never reflect this devaluation . Please do not let Geisinger force the will on the residents of the Nay Aug area community and the citizens of Scranton , the total disregard for citizens and its tax base. We, the Nay Aug area community strongly support the zoning criteria of institution al with 45 feet tall buildings and permitted use for the entire 200 block of Colfax Avenue. We are able to compromise for it is the American way to resolve our difference s. Thank you and have a good evening . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Cortese . Mr. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello, Council . I guess if anybody is going to ruin your day it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 me. I went to court today. Of course, I lost. I guess there's been several phone calls made about this. I don't know if any of you saw this last Tuesday . I'm going to tell you what it says, just one sentence . The gentleman 's man -- I don't know if I'm saying it right -- Garranin {phonetic } he sued the city and several city officials for violating his due process rights. He also alleged the city unfairly targeted several of his properties because code enforcement employees disliked him. He won the suit. He got 285,000 from the city. This is exactly what I've been going through with Oleski and Mr. Sunday. Today in court Mr. Sunday presented a picture that was taken in November of my front porch with two cases of cokes on it. There's an American flag. They call that rubbish . And the side of my house was a dog carrier , you know, I don't know the proper -- that's been gone for weeks. He said in court today he took these pictures yesterday . I said to Mr. Ware that is a blatant lie. My mailman can even -- I could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 bring my mailman in here. My house has been different for weeks. This is what I've been going through with those people. I'm going to appeal that. And you want to put this city on the map, I'll put it on the map. But the Mayor won't like it. This place is just consumed -- these two men are consume d with their hatred for me. And this was nothing but a vindictive response to all my complaints in here. And I don't know how many years I've complained about everything . Nothing ever is answered . You could go tomorrow and make a big circle of my neighborhood and everything I've complained about for two, three years is there, broken down cars in the street right there where my property is. It goes back 160-something feet. On Throop Street, there's a car been there for four years. There's a school bus I've complained about in his driveway . The house next door is full of broken down junk in the backyard and driveway . At the end of Throop Street by the railroad tracks there's a car been there a year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 People are parking on the lawns and ruined them. Nothing like this was ever, you know, five, six, eight years ago. My neighborhood is deteriorated because Mr. Oleski's office has hired one incompetent after another . And if anybody wants to see my insurance papers, I'll bring them next week. And you could examine them. It says on -- my house was insured for 100 and -- I forgot 140,000 or something . They told me it's worth about half that now because of my neighborhood declining so much. And it's declining so much because of this incompetent Mayor that wants all of these people that aren't any good. Like I said, if anybody wants to see it I'll bring it next week. If I was on Council , I'd subpoena those two clowns to be sitting at this desk next week and confront me for what I'm saying. You got the subpoena power. Use it. They belong in here to answer for what they're doing. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Joann Williams . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 MS. WILLIAMS : Good evening. I've come here tonight -- I've come several times in the past years because I think it's my duty as a resident and citizen of Scranton all my life. But I'm very discouraged , okay? I'm here once again about the CMC renovation s and moving on. Proposal has come up where the even side of the 200 block of Colfax was going to be institutional and the odd side is going to be civic. At one time there was 17 homes on that block, beautiful homes, beautiful neighborhood , 35 children . And, of course, the CMC progressed . And I have said here that they need to progress . I understand that. One of the homes in the 200 block of Colfax partially belongs to me, okay, and it's empty now. The CMC doesn't want to talk about it. Five homes remain on that even side. They don't want to talk about it. Now, we've had realtors . Those five homes, the value of them have depreciated . If the CMC wants -- and they say they do want those homes, what games are they playing ? We were neighbor s that stood behind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 them for years, put up with a lot. We still do. I'm not happy. And seeing those homes go down was grief to me, okay. I know progress has to take over and that's the way it is. But I want to know when yous are going to vote on this proposal to do institutional and civic. MR. KING: I'll be covering that in Fifth Order, Mrs. Williams . MS. WILLIAMS : Okay, because our houses, those five homes that are in really nice condition there. It looks like a war zone sometimes , okay, up there. We've had realtors . You're not going to get nothing for those. Who is going to buy a home that next door garage is going to be going and the hospital is going to expand? We elect you people. And I've always had the faith in who I elected to your seats to serve the people and the neighborhoods . It's time you people spoke up to Geisinger and said -- and ask them what's going on. The games have to stop. Our neighborhood is gone. It's gone. They just want to leave it sitting there now. I'm very upset. Anyway, another thing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 about the pools because I grew up -- I grew up right there. I heard -- and I don't know if it's true that the Mayor gave the go-ahead to get rid of the pool and smash the slide into pieces. Why? Why don't the resident s and neighborhoods know what is going on in this city? I've never been so upset over City Council as I am with you people. And I know a few of yous. It's time -- I'm going to say it again -- that you start speaking up for the neighbors and the taxpayers and the residents and the children of this city because the children don't have much. The playgrounds are deplorable even at Nay Aug. Years ago Mayor Doherty -- we all got together and made a playground up there. Deplorable -- even other parks in the city. When are we going to start to come together ? A hospital , yes, we need hospitals . But I'm asking you people to start thinking -- thinking about who put you people in those seats, who we have faith in. Who's going to fight for us? Somebody has to. Please think about that. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Williams . Is there anyone else that would like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I wish with all of these grand expansion plans the CMC would take in patient s from Scranton . I've been on a circling pattern for a whole year with a 90 percent blocked carotid artery. It would be a help if they get me in there. Probably the tests are already out of date. So do I trust them to take more tests and have them put me on another one year circling pattern until something serious happens or do I go to another hospital ? Enough of that. Poor me. Once again, taxes, 38 percent tax exempt and growing . Now here's my idea, tax exempts institutions , etc., should be willing to help get compensation from the state to offset the tax loss because the city's growing into trouble and it's just going to be -- you know, it's liable to be a couple more years and we'll be right back to where we were back in whenever. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 And it wasn't too bad by the end of the Connors' administration but the debts just kept growing . And there's several religious groups popping up that -- they're preaching mainly hate. And we should look into that. I'm tired of seeing them get by tax free. And schools no matter what they are should teach science , math, and uncensored history , age appropriate . There is -- down in Florida there's 1,000 books have been -- including -- the name just drifted out of my mind but the girl that was in the Holocaust , Anne Frank, her history book was outlawed in Florida school districts . And we have people like that in Pennsylvania . So now last week I spoke about the PUC rates and how we were actually paying for people -- much more wealthier than we are paying for their sewage treatment and for the water company to buy them out and run them for them. And that's just grand. But we shouldn 't have to pay anything . It should be deducted out of our payments . We were banned from it by the consumer commissions in Pennsylvania . And now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 I have a new one. I'm starting to run low on time here. Meanwhile -- this is January 1st editorial . Meanwhile the DEP should begin the new year by rejecting the landfill 's request to partially evade a costly step in waste water disposal by dumping up to 200,000 gallons a day into little Roaring Brook which feeds into Roaring Brook, runs over the falls in Nay Aug and down to the Lackawanna River and Susquehanna and Chesapeake Bay. They call it reverse osmosis . To me what that means is that the money flows up to the landfill and I get the pollution and get to pay a bigger bill because the water never gets cleaned up going into the Chesapeake Bay. I get stuck with more stringent standard s if they test Lackawanna River water and realize , oh, my God, we got all of these pollutants . The question is, if you have a D-Cell battery or a 9-volt battery or a lot of other nasty substances , what do you do with them? They go in the trash. They just go in the trash. They get dissolved by the universal solvent, water. And they wash out in their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 crudite water or whatever the hell you want to call it. So thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . You too. MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening. I would like to introduce you to this young man on his five minutes , I might add. But you might remember a short time ago he made a presentation or prepared a presentation that I gave for him on the Sol Vapor sign that was on Moosic Street and blocking vision. And he -- yesterday he had a new issue. And so this time I said, you know, you're capable . I think you should come and present it yourself. So I'm going to stand aside. And he's going to tell you his issue. MR. VERCHUK : Hello, I'm Eli Verchuk from Leslie Drive. I'm here to talk to you about the Leslie Drive street sign. On Leslie Drive in the East Mountain section of Scranton , a utility pole has recently been removed due to an automobile accident at the corner of Leslie Drive and 307 North. However , the pole housed the street sign for Leslie Drive must be replaced. I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 request ing that you use another pole to house the street sign, however , placed further back so it does not require drivers to pull out into the road to see if the coast is clear as the previous utility pole was blocking the sight of traffic . The red circle on the handout I just gave you marks the area where a Leslie Drive street sign is needed. I don't know how people are suppose d to get around the city without street signs. But I am asking you to please contact the Department of Public Works or DPW to please have a new Leslie Drive street sign installed . Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, my turn. I'm having a hard time every day that goes by and I don't get a recycle calendar . I have a hard time believing that they were mailed on December 16th. This is -- I know it's available . And I know I could access it. But it's wrong. Everybody knew the year was going to end. That could have been prepared and out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 before the holiday . Now -- MR. KING: You still haven't received one? MS. SCHUMACHER : I still have not. MR. KING: Okay. MS. SCHUMACHER : Acoustics in this room, could somebody maybe during Fifth Order or Fifth Order next week give us the status of when the acoustics in this room are going to be improved? That is critical . Now, I would like to end with last week, Mr. King, you said that you were looking forward to working with all of you to help move our city forward in a positive direction . MR. KING: Correct . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. And what I'd like you to do with the rest of my time if you would please tell us what vision you have for how will we tell the difference between this time 2022 -- or 2023 and 2024? I would -- someday I would like to have -- I was going to ask each of you what you see happening over the next 12 months. MR. KING: Okay, well, how about I come back here next week and I will lay out all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the things I'm hoping to see us accomplish over this next year, okay? MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, sounds good to me. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I only have one thing to ask and maybe you're going to mention it later about the Martin Luther King activities . Maybe, Jessica , you have something or someone up there is going to talk about the activities that were in place. I was just -- someone was just texting me and seems like the information was sent to City Hall and to the Mayor's office. So I hope one of you do have the activities that are going to be taking place and you can mention that. I don't have them. I only know that there's a dinner on Sunday at the University . So maybe one of you have the information to share, okay. MR. KING: I apologize , Mrs. Jeffries , I skipped over announcements for Council . So we will get back to that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to address Council ? Announcements on behalf of the Council members for this evening . MR. SMURL: I have a few. Last week I was appointed to the Chair of the Committee on Public Works. So I decided to see what Public Works was all about. I had met with Larry West who is overseeing the Public Works Department at this time. We went to multiple sites, mostly on water runoff sites, roads freezing over and flooded areas. We were on multiple parts of the city. And some of the places were being repaired by the DPW Department with the equipment that they have. A lot of the other sites where there is a lot of flooding and water damage can't be done by DPW so, therefore , has to be -- studies be done on them. And they got to be bid out and repaired from there. Places like Parrott Avenue, I thought that was just a blocked drain. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 It turns out it's not just a blocked drain. It's 18 feet into the ground. The city simply doesn't have the equipment to dig an 18 foot hole and they have to drop steel cages in there to repipe the stuff. So everything that I thought was a simple fix I guess really isn't a simple fix until you go out and see what actually is going on. He also took me to seven bridges that are being replaced in the City of Scranton probably over the next 10 years. Most have been cut down in size and in weight class because of the age. Some of them are just rotting away because of poor design years ago. Another thing we did was go down to the DPW Department . And I went over all of the equipment that the city owns and what all the equipment does. I learned how many Pak Masters , garbage trucks we have and how many workers it takes to run each of the trucks, also went to the traffic division to see what they do. I didn't know there was so many multiple divisions down there. There are. There's a garage. There's an engineer down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 there. There's a bunch of things that I didn't know. And Mr. West spent hours with me yesterday . And we travelled throughout the city and went through all of this. So we spoke of the paving program that's coming, also different aspects of the DPW workers and what they actually do and what we can't do because we're simply not big enough. Our department is not big enough to do a lot of that work. And a few other things I went over how many employees there were and what project s that the city actually is doing and where they have paved prior. And the paving project is being compiled right now. It seems that they get a thousand requests . They've got to go to each site, check each of those blocks and see if some of the -- if they really do require paving. Some of the streets we went on there's really nothing wrong. It's just somebody wants to get it paved because there's a crack in it. Some of them don't require paving, but a lot of them do. A lot of them we were in the 500 block of one street, but the 600 block 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 is even worse. So, you know, that's why it's taking a time to go out and find these things. You just can't say, okay, who wants their street paved. You have to go out and make a list. And then we have to prioritize them because real simply, we don't have 20 million dollars to pave the city. So that is something else we're working on. And one last thing with the DPW, the DPW advised that the catch basin on the corner of East Gibson Street and Monroe Avenue, that will be repaired by Leeward Construction . And there are other ones that I had concerns with on East Mountain . There's probably 15 spots of runoff up there. That's years of work. And so things like that they are working on certain things where they can handle it. But there's a lot of stuff that's going to have to be studied and put out to bid. That's pretty much on the DPW. On the Nay Aug Park pools, I was on the Recreation Authority when this all took place. I was there and had a big part in what had occurred up there. A lot of the things we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 were forced to do at one point because of safety concerns . The large pool where the sliding boards -- or the diving boards were, that pool was losing thousands of gallons of water a day. We found that out because one day I was asked about the water bill. So we start checking it. We start monitoring the meter. And overnight when you lose 6 or 7,000 gallons of water, where is it going which led us into a deeper look at the pool. We are no pool experts . The Recreation Authority is suppose d to oversee the park. But we took it upon ourselves to try to find out what was going on. You could hear the water running constantly . You could see the meter running constant ly and the sidewalks were beginning to sink at that pool. So that pool at that point I decided I was going to close it. I went to the board and explained to them of the safety hazard. I didn't know if it was being washed out from underneath but -- nor can you dump 6 or 7,000 gallons of water a day of chlorinated water into where. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 We just simply don't know where it was going. So that pool was closed by the Recreation Authority . It had nothing to do with the city. The following year our second pool where the slides go into it, the slides -- great park but that became the big pool now and it was very busy. The liner had began to peel from the inside. There was -- one day there was like a 15 foot round bubble in the center of the pool where the liner had pushed back up. So we called the pool people and places and asked, you know, what's the cure. There is no cure for that. Evidently water had gotten underneath that also and that ruined the adhesive , whatever was holding it together . Now, granted , the liner was very old and the pools are 50, 60 years old. So at that point, the liner we started pushing -- trying to keep the liner down and tried to keep the pool open for the rest of the summer which we did. But that also began to lose massive amounts of water. And it became the last few days it was just a ridiculous price to pay to keep a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 pool open to spend thousands of dollars on water and clean the pools and whatever else we had to do to try to maintain it. So we closed that pool. We, being the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority , we closed that pool. Then the pools -- our idea was to on the -- where the diving boards were was to put a large splash pad, large enough -- a handicap style splash pad but a very large splash pad. Of course, we don't know where we were getting the money. But that was our idea. And we wanted to replace the existing slide pool and tear that one out and put a new one in. We were thinking at a time to put a new liner into that pool. But structurally it was there so many years we don't know what's underneath it. We do know if it was leaking so, you know, to spend 40 or $50,000 on a liner seemed kind of foolish so we didn't do it. We actually worked with the city. The city paid and put out for bid the backfilling of the pools. The pools had to be demolished . The concrete walls, floors had to be cut up into the certain size stone so that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 it could compact after a few years and that would -- we would be able to after it was backfilled and compact , it would be able to drop down and we would be able to then put our splash pad in. That is something that couldn't happen overnight because of the size of them. We were advised to do it that way. The City of Scranton paid for all of that, not the Recreation Authority . We simply don't have that money. They didn't have that money. So that was all paid by the city and agreed to by the Recreation Authority . We also agreed to remove the old pump house because it was falling down. There were holes in it. The doors -- you could just crawl underneath the doors and get in. That structure was extremely old. So our plan was to move the electricity from that port, all of that -- a giant service went in there. Over 400 amp service went into that building . It was dispersed from there out to different parts of the park. So we could not just eliminate that. So we had to move it to a building behind that pool which was at one time 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 I was told it was called the Clam House. But we put a roof on that. We put doors on it, painted and cleaned it up. And the city paid to have the entire electric system moved from the pump house to that bath building -- or to the back building . And that was also done by the city with the -- I guess permission of the Recreation Authority . We didn't have the money. It was put out for bid. We all knew it was put out to bid. I was up there with the engineers and went over everything . Now what happened after that, after everything was taken down a year goes by. And naturally we feel that we want this giant splash pad. And we also want the pool replaced to accommodate our existing slides. We thought that was the best thing to do. And we all agreed on that and that didn't quite happen. So next thing that happened was the slides were taken down and dismantled . I also tried to find out and as of last night that was when my questions went into the Mayor's office. And we received this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 afternoon her response to that. I don't think it's fair to go over this right now without , you know, reading the entire thing. So I read through it quickly . I see her complains -- her concerns . And I understand she would like a master plan of doing the entire area over instead of just dropping a pool down under the slides, not what I wanted to do; but it's your tax dollars . So that's something that's going to have to be worked out with the new Recreation Authority or with the new Municipal Recreation Authority and the city. But all of the other things were agreed upon removing the pools, doing everything . The only thing I had no knowledge of was removal of the slides. I did quickly read this over. And I understand the funding . No one wants to raise their taxes including me. But if we're going to do -- my idea of the original plan was a 14 million dollar plan. We simply don't have that money. We would have to finance it. And we're just getting out of distressed city status. So are we looking to dump another 14 million dollars ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 I don't know the answer to Nay Aug Park. I guess that's for the Recreation Authority and the Mayor to do. I would like to get involved in it. I will be up at the meeting s at the Recreation Authority and try to figure it out from there. But that's what's going on with the pools, nothing secret, nothing -- that's what happened . The age -- and everybody knows the age. When I was a kid I swam there at that same structure and same pools. So they got old and they were -- it was time. It was time to move on. So I don't want to be without a pool up there to be honest with you. I wish that we had 14 million dollars to do that. But believe me, I will fight for every nickel to put it back the way it was. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Anyone else have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I had two. And just want to -- Miss Jeffries asked about the MLK celebration dinner. I do have some more of the detail on that that I could share 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 so that's going to be taking place this Sunday, January 15th from 1:30 to 4:00. And there's going to be a hybrid event. So first there's going to be featured a dinner followed by a virtual live stream with a keynote speaker and an in-person guest panel discussion . So you could decide whether or not you want to attend an in-person or virtually for that. The ticket cost is $25. And you could find a link for registration through the Scranton Area Community Foundation . And so that's the Greater Scranton MLK Commission Annual Celebration dinner that will be taking place at the University of Scranton in the DeNaples Center in the ballroom on the fourth floor. So those were the details that I have on that. I'm not sure of if we received anything else for additional celebration s or MLK events. I know Bethel Ame Church usually has theirs as well. And the second thing I just wanted to bring up, I wanted to congratulate the Scranton School District for their exit from recovery status. I think that it speaks to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 positive financial direction that the city is moving in. I think there are still plenty of issues that need to be addressed with the school district and ways that we could improve our schools . But I'm happy to see that they're on a better footing and that the state thinks so as well and that they can move forward out of recovery . So now the city is out of Act 47. The school district is out of recovery . I think this is a really positive thing that I'm excited about. And that's all that I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. KING: Okay. Now, we'll move onto -- Jess, I'm not sure, did you mention associated with the Greater Scranton Martin Luther King Commission that one of the activities that's going happen at Scranton High School? I don't know if I heard you say that. DR. ROTHCHILD : I did not. MR. KING: -- (inaudible ) affects society . It's hosted at Scranton High School from 4 until 6 p.m. In addition , they're also sponsoring The Mountain by Katori Hall, a play 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 of fictional adaptation in the life of Martin Luther King, Junior at the Providence Playhouse . For times and tickets go to www.actorscircle.com/main3b.php. Thank you. So now moving to Fifth Order. I'll ask, Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments for Fifth Order? MR. SMURL: Not at this time. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : I spoke on it on Third Order, but if we can get that information from the Business Administrator about the overtime if we could just have that in Third Order for next week. Also, the street sign on Leslie Drive if we could send that over to DPW. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King, you're going to speak about the zoning tonight . This here, was this something that was decided upon by Council or was it just something that got sent over from the administration as the timeline of events? MR. KING: This was something that I requested from the administration . And it was forwarded to me this afternoon .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. All right. That's all. MR. KING: Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Just want to mention that last week I had some questions about a few of the resolutions for appointment s that were on our agenda that are in Seventh Order this evening . So now the resumes have been attached for the ones that were missing last week. That's all. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have two. We'll start with the acoustics . Where are we at with it? We've been talking about it for almost three years. So please inquire with the administration where we're at with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And then secondly , I would like also the project status of the pocket park on Washington Avenue. I want the status of the project . I want an update to include how much money is still set aside for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 that. I believe it was like 4 or $500,000. Let's see where we're at, what's the holdup and then an overall project status. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to Scranton Tomorrow on that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And that is all I have. MR. KING: Okay. I have several items. So I'll start out with some responses from last week. Doris Koloski is here. Richard Iannuzo , the Scranton Police Department Traffic Officer will instruct Scranton Police Patrol to enforce the permit parking violations in the 400 block of Colfax that you had mentioned . Also, a request was sent to DPW to review and repair the remaining handicap corner cutout at the corner of Colfax and Olive Street as well that you had requested . And per Don King, the City Planner , the large group of vacant lots on Monroe and Madison Avenue between the two hospitals have no immediate plans for development . Planning will advise Council with any updates as that occurs. As with 421 Colfax Avenue is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 currently in a condemned status. Code enforcement management is following up with OECD regarding possible demolition of that property . Mrs. Hodowanitz had questions concerning IT. IT advised that as of January 9th that website issues are being address ed. The issues regarding historical items are being address ed. Any current information submitted is placed on the website within 14 hours of receipt . Although , he clearly pointed out there's some things that they have received for quite a while that still need to be updated . So we'll stay on top of that. Mrs. Schumacher had questions . City Parks and Rec Director advised any single signs designating the pool have been removed . Only multi-informational signs that contain a pool reference remain and need to be replaced. You were provided with some updated documentation via e-mail attachment s for inquires related to Nossaman , LERTA, SSA escrow account balance s and Nay Aug Park master plan update. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 I would also like to announce that I was at the Scranton School District this afternoon -- or morning at 1:00 for the signing by Dr. Eric Haggerty the Acting Secretary of Education along with Candice Finan who is the recovery officer , Superintendent Miss McTernian and all the administration and the Mayor was there along with our city tax collector and several other dignitaries from the city. I thought it was a great of celebration that our school district is now out of recover y financially . They went into recovery in 2019. And they got out a lot earlier than was expected . And, in fact, I believe they now have a 17 million dollar surplus . I don't want to say surplus . They have in their rainy day fund available which they never really had in the past. I thought it was a great day as I said for our city, for our school district . Now both the city and the school district are out of recovery . Yet, plenty of work continues and exists. We all know that we have to stay diligent . And hopefully, you know, the city and school district can work together when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 possible with shared services and things of this nature. And hopefully I'm optimistic that our school district will rise to where it was in the past. They're certainly on the right track. I commend the school boards that had worked on that and had to make hard decisions . So I thought that was a great day for our city and for the school district and most importantly for the student s of the City of Scranton . In terms of the zoning ordinance timeline , I know, Doris, I had mentioned that I thought we were going to be reintroducing that this week. However , I spoke with the Law Department and to the Mayor and they want to make sure that we do our due diligence and we follow to the letter of the law to make sure proper vetting and advertising of this zoning ordinance before it ultimately goes back here to City Council for introduction and final vote. So during the week of January 23rd, the Planning Commission will have a public hearing on the changes and the updates to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 zoning ordinance . On January 31st, City Council will introduce the proposed ordinance . On February 7th, City Council will vote to advance the proposed ordinance on a second reading then we will table it. Then on March 21st, City Council will have a public hearing on the new zoning ordinance . And it's expected that that evening March 21st, there will be a vote onto enact the propose d zoning ordinance . So the key dates for us on City Council are January 31st, February 7th, and then again on March 21st it's expected for final vote -- sure. Can we place this in Third Order, Frank, or post it somewhere ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I believe we can at least the pertinent sections of it we can. MR. MCANDREW : You could have my copy before you leave. MR. KING: Also, it was mentioned about the Nay Aug slide removal . And I did have a conversation with our Mayor concerning the Nay Aug slide removal . As far as I know, this Council was never involved in any decision making that occur with the demolition of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the slide. So for -- I know that Mr. Morgan wants me to come in here some day on ECTV to address this. I'm addressing it right now on ECTV. As far as I know Council was not involved in any decision making concerning the demolition of the slide at Nay Aug pool. That was made between the administration and with the Rec Authority . So I asked her for an update and for some information concerning exactly what occurred . In all fairness as Mr. Smurl indicated , we just got this literally I would say probably 4, 4:30 this afternoon . So I want to be able to take some time to read through it. And then maybe we can report back on this maybe next week. But at the end of the day, I know, you know, as I said Mr. Morgan is not here. Typically he'll speak and then he leaves. So he's not here to be able to hear this. Hopefully he's watching it at home. I don't know. But truly I requested the information from the administration who were involved in these decisions . As far as I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 there was never a vote. There was never any contact to Council to be involved -- MR. SCHUSTER : We found out that day that slides had come down. MR. KING: It really wouldn't make sense for us to sit there -- plus, we're telling you what we know now and we requested information from the administration , just got it literally late this afternoon , want to be able to read through it. And then we'll get back to all of you. And I believe we got a memo from Larry West and you mentioned that earlier on DPW for end of year overtime . Did we say we're going to post that? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MR. KING: That will be in Third Order for next week. I think I covered everything . MR. SCHUSTER : Did we receive something on the audit? MR. KING: The only thing I have on the audit -- MR. SCHUSTER : I just checked my e-mail. I didn't see anything . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. King, there's two outstand ing items. One is the Scranton Sewer Authority audit and the other is the fixed asset report. There was some conflicting information due to OpenGov . So they're correcting that. And the auditors will be in the building tomorrow . MR. KING: Okay. So we could expect that in short order hopefully before the end of January . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up and get a date. MR. KING: Thank you very much. If you could get a date for us on that, I'd greatly appreciate it. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING PERMIT PARKING ON THE 1500 BLOCK ON PINE STREET. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I know we reached out several times to the authors of the petition that was sent in. I know we discuss ed some of the pros and the cons. And at this point in time it seems like maybe the cons outweigh the pros. But I would hope that -- well, as we move forward this item is going to be tabled and we're going to do a public hearing . So I would hope that the authors and signers of the petition come in to let Council know what they were thinking when they got this ball rolling . Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'll vote to introduce the legislation again. But I also have some questions and concerns still and that I'll be looking for answers for. So I'd like to hear from some more of the resident s who live on that street and sign the petition for the permit parking during that time of the public hearing . MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : I make a motion to table Item 5-B. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. KING: There's been a motion on the floor and second to table Item 5-B. This piece of legislation is being tabled to allow for advertisement of a public hearing to be held Tuesday , January 24 at 5:45 p.m. On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE - ESTABLISHING COMPENSATION TO BE PAID TO THE POSITION OF CONTROLLER BEGINNING IN 2024. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree with the salary increase for the Controller position . I think it's a shame that it's been so long that that position has had an increase . I'm fully support ive. I believe Mrs. Hodowanitz had some very good points when she was speaking during public comment which I agree with. MR. KING: And on the question also, this salary has sat at $40,000 since the year 2000. We are bumping it up to 53,3 which is equal to the Scranton Tax Collector and actually believe it's long overdue. So I will be supporting this as well. MR. MCANDREW : Also on the question , I agree wholeheartedly . There is lot of new position s over the past years that make a lot more than the Controller 's position . And with the amount of responsibility that him and his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 office has, it's greatly warranted . MR. KING: If I could also note, if this ultimately passes, this raise will not begin until January , 2024. It could only occur in the year of an election -- an election is happening. We're really raising the salary of the Controller and not necessarily the person present ly sitting in Controller 's office. Hopefully -- and I believe he's going to run again. But that raise would not be realized until January 1 of 2024 if this goes through . All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D.
