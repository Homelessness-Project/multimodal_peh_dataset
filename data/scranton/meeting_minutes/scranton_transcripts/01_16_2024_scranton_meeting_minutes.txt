MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially John Liptai. Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Also especially including in our thoughts and prayers for the very courageous Detective Gilmartin , his family, the Scranton Police Department and the entire city as this horrific shooting has deeply affected us all. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Roll call, please. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. There will be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 motion this evening to suspend the rules and move Item 5-C to Seventh Order for a final vote. This resolution is an easement agreement between the city and PPL Electric Utilities along Main Avenue. Anyone who would like to speak on this piece of legislation may do so in Fourth Order during Citizens Participation . Dispense with the minutes , please. MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION FOR A BUDGET TRANSFER FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I have an announcement , Mr. President . So on January 30th the PUC is going to be here in Scranton . They are going to be doing a public hearing at 1 p.m. at the Scranton Cultural Center and at 6 p.m. at the Scranton Cultural Center. Therefore , I asked President Smurl to take a poll to see if we could possibly move 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 our Council meeting from Tuesday , January 30th so that we could attend the public hearing at 6 p.m. that evening and move our Council meeting to Wednesday , January 31st. And it looks like we have consensus that we're going to be doing that. So Frank Voldenberg is going to get that advertised in the newspaper . And I encourage if anyone has an opportunity to file a complaint -- a PUC complaint and there's an office across the street that has the forms and also if you could get to the public hearing either at 1:00 on January 30th or at 6 p.m. on January 30th here at the Scranton Cultural Center. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : So I have a comment regarding recycling . I did speak to Director Pietreface . And he let me know that last week they caught up with recycling by Saturday . And then this week we did move onto cardboard . They had to shut a run down today due to snow removal. So some of the garbage and recycling is still out. DPW will be caught up by Friday this week if there are no more storms. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. SMURL: Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I just wanted to say a couple words about the events of last week. I think it's horrible what had happened . And I think it's really scary for the public and the number of shootings in different locations throughout the city. I know we're just a few blocks away from where the one was in the Hill Section . And so understand ably people are shaken up. And I'm really glad that we have the Scranton Police Department that we do and that knowing that they're hard at work along with partnering with other agencies to make sure that they catch anyone who is involved and try to prevent further gang violence and shootings within the city and it's, you know, very important to me and I know the rest of Council that that happens . And I believe Councilman McAndrew will speak further , I'm not sure, maybe later in the meeting regarding his meeting that he had with Chief Carroll earlier and will provide a further update. But I just wanted to give my thoughts and prayers to Detective Gilmartin and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 sounds like he has a long journey ahead of him. But I'm glad he's still with us and we appreciate all that our police officers do to protect our city. Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So there are a multitude of future scheduled fundraiser s for Detective Gilmartin , too many to mention here. But a great resource to see where they are and when they're going to take place I noticed is on the WNEP TV website ; and, of course, other vehicles through social media. That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Item 7-A, the grant for property acquisition , 2 and a half million dollars ; I'm glad that's moving forward . But hopefully in Fifth Order if you would brief us on the progress for tax relief for those who suffered during the September 9th flood. I would like to see where we stand on that at least, at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 least on the city's perspective . Item 7-B, the $123,000 grant for recruitment incentives for the police department . I hope people understand just what kind of personal challenges the police department has. I'm going to read from their narrative . The City of Scranton 's Police Department has 147 sworn officers budgeted for 2024. Currently the department has 14 permanent vacancies and 6 officers identified to retire in 2024. Due mainly to officer injuries , the police department continuously operates at 80 percent strength . Additionally , the collective -- due to the collective bargaining practices , there are no controls in place to sufficiently forecast retirements . But there are currently 24 officers -- that's 24 officers who are eligible to retire in 2024. Now, how do you expect the police department to continue to operate at 80 percent operational strength ? Overtime is not the answer. What happened last week with this gang violence , they're not talking about graffiti on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 public buildings . We're talking about one night in which three sections of the section were shot up like the wild wild west. I would recommend that you bring in Chief Carroll again and the Mayor and maybe the president of the various neighborhood associations . I would like to know what the police department -- what kind of help the general public can give the police department in terms of being eyes and ears, reporting what they see and they hear. Do we have active crime watches in our neighborhoods ? Do we? Is that something that would help both the city and the police department ? We're not going to cure their personnel shortage s overnight. It's going to take years. And it's not going to be easy to do. I'd also like to know what kind of support we're getting from the county and from the school district where, you know, who is seeing the indicators and the triggers from a lot of this gang activity ? What can the general public do to report things that are going on? I think, you know, we all have skin in this game. So we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 should all be part of the solution . So hopefully you could talk about that also in Fifth Order. But a caucus I think would be very useful to educate general public. I remember when Chief Carroll was here talking about the vehicle thefts. A lot people said, gee, I didn't know that. I didn't know that was going on. And finally once again, we're still waiting on the contracts for the firefighters and the police unions to be posted on the City's website . For the firefighters it's 289 days. For the police it's 172 days. So hopefully we could get that going. I think dotting I's and crossing T's just doesn't take that long. I don't care how many pages they have to retype and coordinate . This is dragging it out too long. That's taxpayer revenue that's going to pay those contracts . And they earned their money. But it should be public. Those contracts should be on the website sooner rather than later. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. We had a meeting , Mr. McAndrew and myself, with Chief. And he did offer to come in after this all calms down a little bit. So I'm sure he will come in. Bob Bolus. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . Mr. Smurl, I'm glad you're appoint ed to the seat there. I hope you'll do an honor for all us by being in this position now. Happy to say you did a hell of a job with the Christmas lights on the house. That was a great thing for the city. What I'd like to do tonight , I'd like to thank all those volunteers and the people, the press that attended my 30th Bob Bolus Christmas Day Dinner. That was an all-day buffet. Wegmans , Giant markets and Weiss contributed baked goods that ordinarily would have went into the garbage . They donated them out. And it was good what they did. But Plainville Turkey Farms donated the turkey breast this year because a customer backed out and they asked me if I wanted them. So we had that. So we had over 3,000 people showed up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 and sat down at the buffet tables. We delivered over 600 meals and that wasn't counting people that actually showed up and took out takeouts. So everybody on Christmas Day who didn't want to be home alone on Christmas came and had a Christmas Day meal and the comradery that's developed over 30 years. And I want to thank All Saints Academy and St. Pat's Church for use of the hall, because without their help this wouldn't have happened . And as far as Officer Gilmartin , I think we need to put the blame where the blame belongs and that's at our judges, the District Attorney by putting these low life scum bags out on the street and Joe Biden for bringing them into this country . We got to close the borders and start protect ing us as American citizens and what these people are -- they're not doing their job. Officer Gilmartin should not have been a victim with this scum who walked out with a smile on his face, should have had his ass kicked before anything else. Enough is enough. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Maybe what we need to do is start arming our citizens here and let these clowns know you take on one, you take us all on. That's what Scranton used to be. And it's not like that anymore and it's got to change. I think everybody here including the Mayor should go to over to Coopers and look on the wall at what Lake Lincoln used to look like when everybody went to Lake Lincoln , not the mud hole you all turned it into with Gaughan and everybody else doing what they did to this. They destroyed the culture of this city. And now you want to play games and listen to this one, millions here, millions there. There's nobody out there that's telling you what you should really do. They're just looking to screwing us out of money. And I want to know why Israel flag and the Ukraine flag aren't flying out in front this building , in front of the Lackawanna County Courthouse or the Government Center. I bought them. I paid for them. And I donated them. And it's an insult to all those people who are being butcher ed by these animals over there that we're taking sides by not supporting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Israeli and Ukraine . Remember Hamas fired into them. I've been all over the Middle East and the Far East. I've spent a lot of time there. I've been through Israel. I've been through Hamas, saw what they did in Gaza. It's got to end and we need to support these people -- butchering young men, women, raping young girls for no purpose and still shooting missiles . And now we got -- we're into World War III, thank you, Joe Biden because now we're getting shot at from the other countries , Iran, Iraq and everybody else. We're going to be where we shouldn 't be. And it's coming back to haunt all of us. There is another thing I would like to bring up is -- well, you guys could do it here. I'd like you to file a motion to ask PennDOT to remove off Interstate 81 the signs that say President Biden Expressway . They could revert it back to Scranton next exit, just like we do Moosic Street or Dunmore . It's an embarrassment . I own properties in Florida where people come and stay and drive through here and think we're all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 support ing this idiot. And I'll call him that. He's not my president . And I'm an American and that's prior service and all. He's not defending this country . He's killing us and destroying it. I want to see those signs off the Interstate 81. You may not take them off the expressway because Gaughan put them there for political purposes . We're not behind him. Put it on a referendum and let us have our say as the voice of the people, not the voice of the politicians who are filling their pockets on (inaudible ) and getting things done. See if they'll take that sign down and honor all of us for a change. It's about time we got our voice heard in this city. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Bolus, and thank you for the meal that you put on for all the people in Scranton . MR. BOLUS: Pardon? MR. SMURL: Thank you for the meal that you give out every Christmas for everyone in Scranton .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. BOLUS: Appreciate it. Thank you very much. I'm honored . The guys upstairs gave me the opportunity to do this. And I'm very proud to say I am a Scranton ian. That's what -- I'm born and raised here, business is here. My families have been here. Our company in the trucking industry has been here almost 100 years. And I'm very proud to say that they gave me the opportunity from childhood until now, the principles that we all live by here. And that's what I want to see come back. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. BOLUS: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . First off, my thoughts and prayers are with Detective Gilmartin and his family. It's a terrible thing that happened . I hear he's improving so that's a good thing. I hope the best for him and his family. And I want to thank Bob for doing what he does every Christmas . I volunteered 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 for 22 years now. And the first year I did it, I walked out of there so rewarded . I've done it for 22 years now. It's a great thing. It's a great thing that he does. I hope he keeps it going. Okay, moving on, Joan said we need more police officers . I've been talking about these parking enforcement people that don't do their job that ticket people that shouldn 't be ticketed . I said do without the parking enforcement people and use that money to hire more police officers . I was driving Green Ridge Street last week and there's a parking enforcement person giving a ticket to a person parked on the sidewalk . They have nowhere else to park. You can't park on Green Ridge Street. If you don't have a driveway , you have to park up on the sidewalk . And instead of ticketing these kids from the University when they block people's view up in the Hill Section , they are ticketing citizen s that pay taxes and the guy had nowhere else to park his car. He got a ticket. Get rid of the parking enforcement people and get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 more police officers . Next thing, does the city recycle Christmas trees anymore? Does anyone know? I know they used to. MR. SCHUSTER : At this point I don't know if they do but I could find out. MR. SPINDLER : I see a lot of people putting them out in the garbage . I know years ago they used to put them down at the end of Bulwer Street where the baseball fields are. And they used to pick them up and recycle them. My neighbor from a quarter of a block away, his tree ended up on my property because it was so windy. But if they put them in one pile and recycle them instead of taking them to the dump. I think it's a waste. And while we're on the subject , I guess Councilman Schuster answered my question . My garbage was suppose d to be picked up today and it wasn't. My recycling was. The garbage wasn't. So I don't know why one was and the other one wasn't. MR. SCHUSTER : I know in Tripp Park some people I spoke to today said that their garbage wasn't picked up. I know like 1600 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 block of Hawthorne was. But I don't think the 1400 -- MR. SPINDLER : Oh, really? They did one street and not the other one? MR. SCHUSTER : I don't know what -- MR. SPINDLER : Okay. An article in the paper today about Marty Flynn's mother getting fired from the city, which Mr. Mancini spoke about last week. It just takes me back to what the Mayor is doing. We had a wonderful DPW Director , Tom Preambo who was put on leave and mysteriously resigned. When I asked the Mayor what happened , oh, it's a personnel issue. I can't talk about it. And then we had the Police Chief Len Namiotka relieved of his duties and put back down to Captain . And I asked the Mayor about that, oh, it's a personnel issue. I can't talk about it. Whenever something is a little fishy, they say they don't talk about it. And she admitted Len Namiotka did a great job. So I asked her. I said, well, why was he replaced as Police Chief? It's a personnel issue. I can't talk about it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Now she fires Marty Flynn's mother for no reason at all along with another person. And I'm just going to read one part of the article that was in the paper today. This is talking about Marty Flynn's mother. It says, on September 7th, she got a letter saying she could return to work saying September 11th if she signed a performance approval plan. She said she planned to be out of town September 9th to the 13th and not put for time off because she was on administrative leave. The city fired her claiming she abandoned her job by not returning when ordered . She was on administrative leave. She didn't abandon her job. How do you fire a person for that? I'm not a lawyer. When they told her to report back September 11th she said she was going to be out of down the 9th to the 13. She told them. Listen, I'm not an attorney . But I think it's another lawsuit the city is going to lose. I supported this Mayor but, you know, I don't anymore. She's turning into Chris Doherty and he caused us 40 million 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 dollars trying to break the unions. Lucky -- it was 80 million dollars . Luckily the unions took half of that. And this Mayor is turning into a dictator just like he was. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : She's firing these people for no reason at all and it's going to hurt us, the taxpayers . MR. SMURL: Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . The first thing I'd like to do is, I'd like to start with legal terminations -- or legal terms. And, Mr. King, you know, I hope you hear these. Corruption , a dishonest , fraudulent or even criminal act of an individual or organization used in entrusted authority or power to make a personal gain or another gain or unethical or illegal benefit . Corruption , corruption , improper or usually unlawful conduct intended to secure a benefit for one's self or another . Its forms include bribery , extortion , and misuse of inside information . It exists where there is community indifference or lack of enforcement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 policies . Now, gave the Scranton Times a letter from somebody who had worked in the inspections department . You know, I find it really troubling here that the Council didn't seem to care about this individual and didn't use its authority to do investigation s to find out what's going on in the inspections department because Mr. Olecki seems to be accused of violating zoning law and issuing permits to people and the Ethics Board didn't do a thing. The Mayor doesn't seem to care because she seemed to have said report it to union heads. I mean -- and considering that the Mayor doesn't even live in Scranton , I mean, I find it so very troubling that the Council just doesn't care. And that's the pinnacle of corruption because you appoint all of these boards and have over -- have a working relationship with the Mayor. And your job is to protect the citizens and make our lives better and it's just not happening. I'm not the only one that feels that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 way. And winning an election where the vast majority of the people don't participate should tell you something . You've allowed your office to be corrupt ed. And, you know, at the end of the meeting you could take shots at me. I really don't care. You could scream and yell about how you're not corrupt . Look it, we have county commissioner s that were corrupt . They went to jail, Munchak and Cordaro , okay. Mr. Courtright was from West Side. He went to jail. The only thing was when the Feds came in to investigate him, they didn't go after him for the Sewer Authority deal or the parking garage deal. And when you go and you look at what's happening here and all the horse and pony show with the PUC here, that's because the Council President decided to sell the Sewer Authority even though he didn't support the deal. Nobody's made any smart choices . Mr. Bolus talked about the pool project , the silliest most corrupt thing I've ever seen. Taking down a half a million dollar slide -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 okay, well, more than that. It's probably worth more than that. I hope some citizens would take the Recreation al Board to court and the Mayor and the Council and see if you could extinguish their immunity and you ask the Court to give an award to replace the slide and then just take the income from the people that were responsible , the people that had oversight , the people that were appoint ed by the Mayor. You know, having an Ethics Commission that doesn't work and being a Councilman who doesn't do anything at all except talk about not being corrupt in a city this corrupt , think about it for a minute. Where did all the millions and millions and millions of dollars of grant money go here? It funded the destruction of the city. It's been wasted. We could talk about individual projects . Look what happened with ECTV. It was a PEG channel . But you can't let the people have access to that channel because then they could talk about things they see and the things they want changed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 And then it wouldn't be your propaganda channel because then you couldn't control format. And that's what scares you and the Mayor the most. But the most troubling thing is the Mayor doesn't live in the city. The Scranton Times doesn't care. The Council doesn't care. And a lot people know she doesn't live in the city. It's corruption and you are corrupt . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . I certainly agree with some of Mr. Bolus's thoughts tonight . People, if we had more Boluses in our government , we would be a lot better off. I hear so many comments -- negative comments about the city the past year or two. And this preposterous idea of a buyout, how could you think of that? That's setting a precedent that would last forever for anything . We would be in legal trouble for a thousand years if she started with something like that. Just because there's grant money now, doesn't mean there's going to be grant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 money in the future for tragedies . Now, don't think I'm heartless or something . These houses, six or eight houses were flooded . I don't know. I know it's -- six, eight, ten people over the years that lost everything in the basements and a couple of the houses were condemned and nobody could feel any worse about it than me. But you can't have something as ridiculous as a buyout. You know the Friends of Lackawanna which they certainly aren't, they have been trying to get a buyout for the whole bunch of them up there. The Courts just laughed them out. I don't know where some of these -- this lunacy comes from that the city comes up with. It would be nice for 19 people but for 27,000, that would be losing some more tax money. It just won't work out. It shouldn 't even be considered . It's like all of these consultants , if people did their job they wouldn't need consultant s. And if they can't do their job, fire them. I don't have anybody in mind. I'm just saying. I hear so many comments about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 like I just said adversities in this city, people in here and write in the paper two years or so they've been putting up street signs. Why is this an endless project when there's 200 and some miles of streets? I don't know how many signs they need. Why don't they just put them up and stop and do something else? The traffic bureau, I don't know. They could put some -- I've asked for some stop signs, three-way stop signs to impede the traffic on North Main, nobody cares. Somebody was slaughtered in front of my house two years ago, no charges pending. Does that make sense a car going more than twice the speed limit hits a guy? The front tire on that car was 4 inches from the curb. That's not where the traffic is. I don't know. It's the city, the state, whatever . It doesn't take forever to file charges . People that -- I realize there's a difference of opinion here with so many of you. But I get my opinion from the people I talk to. I don't know where the Mayor gets some of these ideas that have been a total 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 waste, $240,000 to walk -- learn how to walk. You can't walk down half the streets because cars are on them. And cars are on them because of the zoning board allowing single family homes to become very large -- my neighborhood is just going downhill so bad. Thank you, Mr. Smurl. But here my taxes are three times what they were when I bought the house and my neighborhood is just like a garbage dump. The people in it are like garbage up and down the street parking , speeding , radios blaring . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: This isn't a Scranton no more. This isn't a flourishing city. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all on our list -- our sign-in sheet. Does anybody else want to address Council ? MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Addressing City Council tonight with a heavy heart as we pray for Detective Kyle Gilmartin and his family. To the Council person who supports deport the police, you are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 a disgrace . You know who you are. Two years ago in July the city Mayor, City Council order to Muflehun , a Washington DC company $75,000 to conduct a study to help the city contend with gang violence . After the first year Muflehun was back to renew the study for another year. This time Council requested Muflehun provide facts, findings, and recommendations from the first study only to be met with resistance from the administration refusing to share the report with City Council under the guise of it being sensitive material and that Council would have to make an appointment with the Law Department to view the material in question , common practice from this administration . When Council did have the opportunity to review the report, certain members were very appalled for what was being labeled a threat to our community . They were labelling United States veteran 's as the potential threat and that the real concern of gangs were that they were just wannabees. However , ironic, the Mayor states 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 this week we will be meeting this week with Muflehun . We should have a complete report by late spring, early summer just in time to renew it for a third year. She was also stating we speak with officials from and follow the examples of others, usually larger cities that deal with gangs and youth violence . Can Council provide any tips the city implemented that worked? Good. We talked with other cities. So do we have gangs or do we not have gangs? We may have been able to save an awful lot of money and get some very valuable truthful reliable information and intelligence that would have been confirmed by reaching out to the Pennsylvania State Police, United States Marshals , the DEA, the FBI and the DA's office in order to know that gangs are alive and well in the City of Scranton . And that information would have been free of charge. Better yet, a phone call to the Warden at the Lackawanna County Prison would tell you that 60 percent to 70 percent of the prison population as of today is local gangs. It's real. It's big and many juvenile s are in prison. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 They're in there educated as adults. This administration had 70 million dollars in ARPA funds. Do you have a listing or can you prove how much was spent on our youth in the form of after school activities , programs or youth shelters ? To your knowledge , has the Mayor or her administration met with the Scranton School District or any of the students to educate them and explain that the city is not going to be providing any activities or after school programs for them and that doesn't give them an excuse to go out shooting up houses and live streaming it and having shootouts with your local police department . This isn't a hobby. This is serious and it has life and death consequences . Has anybody went to the schools to try to educate these young children ? That's what I thought . This Mayor and her administration can say what they want. There is nowhere never enough officers to mean a deterrent present in our neighborhood s when there are only 50 patrol officers when fully staffed when at one time there were 90. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 That's 40 spots open for a new generation of Scranton men and women ready to join Scranton Police Department . We're not safe. The public is not safe. It's not safe. And the police are not safe. With no police presence is around, it gives the green light for gangs and other criminal activities to come and take over. It's been very evident lately. It's the Mayor's job to protect our police department and protect us. Use the money to protect the men and women who protect us. Council , get a backbone already . Demand action. A police officer was shot, is clinging for his life. The city was down 40 vacant spots. The administration wanted to play games with the hiring process changing to a third party civil exam online from a company out on the west coast. Stop the nonsense changing things that worked for many years. Make it simple. Have the civil service reissue the LEAB Exam, LEAB. Reverse allowing officer s that live out of the city. Live in the city you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 represent . Visibility is key right now. Give extra points to resident s who are taking these exams to be police officer s in the City of Scranton . When you neglect law and order, this is a situation that happens in the city, just what we're getting . We have a police chief, a deputy chief, the captain of patrol, chain of command on all shifts. We're sure they understand when there isn't enough manpower that's required , not only are they in danger, so is the public. We don't need a Mayor interfering with police department . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : The same Mayor who was passing out -- MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : -- during a protest on Courthouse square to protest safely. MR. SMURL: Are you finished ? MR. ARGENTA : She was at a press conference -- MR. SMURL: Would you please remove him? MR. ARGENTA : She was laughing , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 smirking -- MR. SMURL: Thank you. Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini resident of the City of Scranton . The City of Scranton was tested this past week. We need each one of you to do your best to help the city during a very troubling time. If I were to put this body on the side of Lake Scranton over the lookout, my Mount Lake Scranton would be John Pocius. Tom, I know you live close to them. Mike Melnick . Gary DiBileo , Mark, you're close. Jessica -- and I want to apologize last week for calling you by your improper name. I apologize to you and those who had voted you into office. You heard this name quite a few times over the years, Janet Evans. All right. Most importantly City Council President the late great Bob McGoff. I expect each one of you to strive to fill those chairs and respect those who have come before you to ensure that this city overcomes what we've endured very recently . We have a Mayor that does not even want to say the word gangs, okay. I saw this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 firsthand 4:42 in the morning . I was awake. I live half a block from there. Shots rang out. I immediately called 911. I saw red and blue. They said the police were on scene. I felt safe, ran downstairs , ran outside . I saw five police officers and a women police officer running down North Decker Court in the line of fire not knowing just to make sure everything was okay. They protect us on a daily basis. I've seen this firsthand . Not less than 10 seconds later I heard shots -- not shots, but I heard the words officer down. And that's heart wrenching. And even to this day I'm shaking because of it. I haven't been able to sleep, you know? And for a brave police officer to confront somebody and have to pull a revolver , not a lot of them even pull a revolver . All right. We're pulling ours a lot more often and to have a Mayor just blatantly disagree with finding s knowing that they're notified on a quarterly basis. They've been notified quarterly since the Doherty administration regarding gang 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 activity and undesirable s. I mentioned to this Council about blight. Somebody from Eugene, Oregon does not understand blight in our area because they haven't seen what our city -- she hasn't seen what our city truly looks like. All right. Ask yourselves, over the last 20 years -- most of you lived in your same property over the last 20 years. How many neighbors do you actually know now? When you bring blight to the area, you also bring undesirable s. It only makes it more desirable for people that are coming from out of the area and into the area and taking the easy way out. Sixty percent of us live paycheck to paycheck . So if somebody from out of the area coming into this area taking the short step, slinging drugs, selling guns and gang activity is not something that we need. That's not the Scranton I know. That's not the West Scranton I know. We could do better. I expect this body to do better. I mentioned about public safety director back in the 90s then Jim Klee came up with a great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 idea. We had saturation patrols on two blocks, Monroe and Clay. Back then we didn't have computer s. So the police officer s would manually write up their reports. So they would rotate into those areas, have a strong police presence and then rotate out when somebody else had to do a report. Quickly quashed the issue. But now it's all over. We're talking about crime. We're talking about kids breaking into vehicle s. And how about these stash houses? You know, each officer on average gets two calls a week. That's two calls too many. I expect this Council to do better. And while you're at it, I expect you also to take a look at the Sewer Authority documents because I am in fear that there's a Rain Tax in those documents . All right. We could do better. We need to pay attention . And we need to clearly understand what's ahead of us and we need to become proactive . Thank you, Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Have a good evening 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 and God bless Kyle Martin and the rest of the Scranton Police Department . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Other than, you know, mentioning once again Officer Kyle Gilmartin and our brave Scranton Police Department and on top of that it was mentioned all the other law enforcement department s that seized upon our city. You know a lot of times our police get taken for granted until you need them. And we need them. And I think, you know, this grant that we're going to approve tonight is going help us in the recruitment process because we want a full complement of police officers out there. And we realize how important our police officers are. And it's just like, you know, our or firemen as well. You know, people see the firemen stopping for lunch, what have you, and some people get mad about that. Well, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 guess what, when your house is on fire guess who's there, guess who's going in there while the flames are blazing toward them. So I just want to say that, you know, on behalf of Council and myself that all of our thought s and prayers are with Officer Kyle Gilmartin . We're praying for his full and absolute recovery . And we pray for our men in blue each and every day because they're out there protecting us. They're the ones running down the street towards the shots as Mr. Mancini indicated . I'd probably be running in the other direction but not our men in blue. So the Scranton Police Department , I give them a tremendous amount of credit and thank them for what they do for us each and every day to keep us safe. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, my only comment tonight is about the tragedy that occurred last week. And I think it overshadows anything else tonight . But I would just like to say I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 absolutely disgusted with that tragedy . It's a very sobering moment for the city and this type of issue isn't a norm for the City of Scranton . It's not the City of Scranton I grew up in. I would like to let Detective Gilmartin and his family know that they are in my thought s and prayers, my family's thought s and prayers. And we're sending prayers for his recovery . I would also like to let the Scranton Police Department know that myself and my family are keeping you in my thought s and prayers as well. So thank you for all that you do. Thank those officer s that were with Detective Gilmartin for their quick response and that were at the scene that night or that morning . I'm very proud of our city for the outpouring that they've shown for Detective Gilmartin , for his family and the Scranton Police Department . Last thing I would like to say is, I would like to thank the many groups that are involved in the arrests and investigation s that are ongoing and have been happening .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Out in the front is the Scranton Police Department , the Pennsylvania State Police, Lackawanna DA's office, the FBI, the DEA and the US Marshals . So thank you for all that you're doing right now and prayers for a full recovery for Detective Gilmartin . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I just have one item to bring up an e-mail that I received about 117 St. Francis Cabrini Avenue which -- oh, I'm sorry, 125 and 127 St. Francis Cabrini Avenue, which I believe has been a problem property . And there's been a number of issues and complaint s there that previously that I believe have been brought to Council . So I'll be looking for any updates that we have on that property and if it's being consider ed a nuisance property or what to anticipate so I can let the person know. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 MR. MCANDREW : I do. So as the Chairman for the Committee on Public Safety, I would like to report out that President Smurl and I met with Chief Carroll and Assistant Chief Monahan yesterday to discuss a long-term strategy to address the very real gang activity that we are facing in this city and surrounding areas. The investigation is ongoing and it will be extensive . The strategy will be a regional one because of how it ties together with these gangs. As witnessed the past week, there's a strong collaborative law enforcement partnership with the Scranton Police Department to include Pennsylvania State Police, the DEA, the FBI, the Lackawanna District Attorney 's Office and their task force, the U.S. Marshals and Homeland Security . I was assured and want to assure -- reassure the public that this collaborative law enforcement partnership will continue to work together sharing data and their resources to eradicate this horrific gang presence in our community . Last week's shooting and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 injuries suffered by Detective Gilmartin is one too many. The very brave and courageous Detective Gilmartin was in pursuit to prevent a shooting . God bless him and his family. I'm also so very proud of our community and surrounding communities that have come together and showed their support and generosity for the Gilmartin family. This is why I love our community . They always rise to the occasion and help those in need. And next I have -- I was contacted by a concerned resident that an RV is being parked which the resident believe s is on city-owned property between Main and Court Street on Euclid Avenue. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please request code enforcement to investigate this? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I have also been receiving complaint s from a very patient resident whose patience is running thin and so is mine regarding this nuisance property . I have been reporting out as required on this or inquiring about this since January of 2023. And I know there was some issues 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 even before that. Almost weekly they are either -- they're either -- there's a police presence , county vehicles , city probation , code enforcement have been observed responding to some type of call. So, Mr. Voldenberg , you know the property I'm referring to. I mention ed it to you today. It's the one on South Cabrini -- I'm sorry, North Cabrini that we've been talking about in correspondence . I think that's the one you're mention ing from another resident . But, you know, could you please reach out, okay, and see has the nuisance threshold in our city's ordinance -- we got there because I believe they have. The number of calls that have been called in since -- in the year of 2023 probably satisfies that nuisance piece in the ordinance . So with that, also request a status to include the next steps that will be taken on this property . And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I also -- I want to bring up the amount of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 support for Detective Gilmartin from the citizens of Scranton and surrounding areas. It really is overwhelm ing. And it really makes you proud to live in a city where you have people that still come around and care about each other and help each other in time of need from -- there is so many things, the Go Fund Me page, Gerrity 's, Cooper's restaurant s, all of the benefit s that are online you could see. And there are a lot of places you could get all of this information . On Facebook is the Go Fund Me thing. And also, on the Scranton Police Department , there are other links on their website about shirts and sweatshirt s and things that they're going to sell to help the family at this time. That's all I have on that. This was the concrete barrier at the intersection of Biden Express way and Jefferson Avenue. PennDOT has notified us that they are going to paint the sloped barrier and -- with yellow traffic line paint and install -- basically install reflectors on the top of it. And I guess try to make that so that it could be seen. That was a concern brought 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 to us multiple times. They anticipate the work to start in early April basically after the winter has left. 128 Throop Street, Mr. Ellman, I have visited your house. And the abandon ed car was cited and ticketed . And they assured me that they will go back and tow it if it is not removed by the owner. The 700 block -- oh, this is another street. We're working on Genett Street. But we have a mix-up on the streets there. So we'll get back to that one. But we are working on Genett Street for that lady that is concerned that her street isn't being plowed. We are still on that. Also a large hole 2201 Adams Avenue, DPW will get to that after they are finished with the snow condition s. Mr. Markovitch {phonetic }, code enforcement , I had gotten e-mail as everyone else did. I forwarded it to the administration and code enforcement . I believe it is their situation to correct . I was told that they had contacted you on Friday. So I hope we can get that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 squared up. We're also working on legislation for (inaudible ) those containers on the streets. And the pave cut at 1405 South Webster that's been going from utility to utility . I was told today that the DPW is just going to take care of it already . And since no one take -- I guess no one wants responsibility for it. And last thing, Attorney Gilbride , will you give us a brief update on where we are with the tax relief program that we have? ATTY. GILBRIDE : Certainly . I had spoken with the administration in regards to potential ideas and ways in which to put into practice what the Council has asked me to research . I will be meeting with the City Solicitor , the County Solicitor , School District Solicitor this week to talk more about the overall project so that we'll have a better understanding of what we can do and cannot do. Of course after that I will report back to the Council with my finding s. And we'll proceed with drafting legislation to make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 that happen. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you very much. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN EASEMENT SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE FORM ATTACHED HERETO AS EXHIBIT “A” BY AND BETWEEN PPL ELECTRIC UTILITIES CORPORATION (“GRANTEE ”) AND THE CITY OF SCRANTON (“GRANTOR ”) FOR THE PROPERTY IDENTIFIED AS COUNTY TAX PARCEL NUMBERS 13501 030 003; 13501 030 006; 13501 030 007 AND 13501 030 004 LOCATED ALONG AMELIA AVENUE. MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , just to -- Mr. King made note of it in caucus tonight . We did get this into Seventh Order and tabled it. It died at the end of the year so we're bringing it up. We're going to suspend the rules to move it towards Seventh Order. But it was in Seventh Order when we last discussed this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MR. SMURL: Okay, well, I assumed once it died I think we'd have to -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, we're moving through . MR. SMURL: We're not -- we're not pushing it. MR. SCHUSTER : But we're not -- this is the second time around with this process here on this piece of legislation . MR. KING: In 2023 it went through introduction in Fifth Order. It made it through Sixth Order. We had some questions . We made it to Seventh Order. And we still didn't have the answers by the time it hit Seventh Order. So we tabled it into Eighth Order and it died as the year ended. So we got the answers that we, you know, had -- finally got the answer we were looking for and I think that Council is ready now to move this forward . And I believe that we're waiving the rules tonight after introducing this to then move it to Seventh Order -- to suspend the rules, move it to Seventh Order so we would pass it. Nothing has really changed with it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 It's just that we got some questions answered. MR. SCHUSTER : So, yeah, it had to be reintro duced as per procedure but we've spoken about this for quite some time and got answers to the question s we needed. MR. SMURL: Yeah, and it's not -- the rush is because we need to get this finished so that they could move forward on replacing the bridge down there. So we don't want to be holding that up either. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. MCANDREW : I make a motion to suspend the rules and move Item 5-C to Seventh Order for a final vote. MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: There's a motion on the floor and a second to suspend the rules and move Item 5-C to Seventh Order for a final vote. All those in favor signify by saying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR.

SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I did have a -- I asked the question of the administration last week about if we've reached our FEMA disaster cap. And I did get an answer to that that might be fitting at this point in time. So Tri-County total was 25.3 million dollars , which was 2.2 above the required threshold for those counties . The city's portion was 7.3 million dollars in damage. And a disaster declaration from the federal government was given on November 8th of 2023. It says 2024 but I would assume it's 2023. We have not receive d a formal notification of the status of the request , but it's their understanding that the declaration has been rejected and there's an appeal that is in process . MR. SMURL: Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR.
