DONAHUE : Yes, I have a few. Friends of Connors Park will hold their annual craft fair this Saturday , July 28, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 from 11 to 4 at the park at 515 Orchard Street. All proceeds benefit park improvements . And, also, the annual Bob McGoff 5-K Run/One-Mile Fun Walk will take place on Sunday, August 26, at 9 a.m. starting at Connors Park. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : And I just wanted to mention ed, Mr. Perry mention ed in the beginning of the meeting about Nicole Pettinato and I just wanted to also send my condolences out. You know, I worked -- I think everyone on council worked very closely with Nicole over the last few years as she was the president of the Hill Neighborhood Association and it's very rare to find somebody who gives that type of commitment and that type of energy to a position like that and gave her time outside of her regular job and, you know, her regular family duties. So I just want to, again, send my condolences out to her family and she will be missed and I'm hoping that somebody in the Hill Neighborhood Association will step up, you know, to try 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 and do what Nicole did and put all of their commitment and time towards changing that neighborhood , to continue changing that neighborhood . Thank you. MR. EVANS: I would certainly echo those comments . When we lost Ozzie it was a big step for Nicole to step into that position and she did a phenomenal job. The Hill Section was very happy to have her and she will absolutely be missed. As a former president of a neighborhood association , I know how much time and energy goes into that position , a volunteer position , of course, that you don't get paid for but you get a lot of self-worth and self-reward for the actions you take, so my condolences to Nicole's family and her dear friends . MR. PERRY: I have one announcement to make, National Night Out will be held on Tuesday , August 7, this year at Scranton High School from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. This is a great event held nationally each year on the first Tuesday in August to promote police and community partnership . There will be police and fire demonstration s and lots of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 activities for kids, including free food. And anybody who has ever been at any of these events know how fantastic it is. The police and fire are so gracious with their time. There is fire trucks there to get in and climb on and police cruisers , it's a great time to partner up with your local safety employees and just promote goodwill between everybody . Every year they put on a great show so please attend if you could. Thank you. Fourth Order. Citizens ' participation . (The following speakers offered public comment as follows : Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on city business . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. PERRY: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments today? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, I just have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 couple of issues to pass along from a couple of neighborhood meetings I attended last week. I will be passing along a couple of issues to Chief Graziano . And, also, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to send a letter to LIPS regarding issues at the following properties : A house on the 500 block of Morgan Court, which is in the rear of South Irving Avenue. The building is condemned and the neighbors have concerns about the structural integrity of the house. Also, the old Garcia's Market on the 800 block of Pittston Avenue, the property is overgrown and there is also a big crack in the front window. A house on the 300 block of Cedar Avenue across from the Old Sun Hotel, I will get you that exact address later. Apparently , the occupants are just throwing trash in the yard and just leaving it there and not bringing it to the curb and it's just sitting there. And, also, 305 Willow Street is condemned but apparently there is still people living in the house. And that's all I have. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Mr. Evans, any motions or comments today? MR. EVANS: Yes, thank you. First of all, in the year of a reassessment you must be revenue neutral to all of the taxing bodies so you don't raise taxes because of reassessment and the $13 million dollar amount that was quoted on the question is a bogus number made up by people that don't even understand reassessment so my estimate is probably more like 5 or 7 million dollars but it's still the responsibility of the county, so while we're on the subject I'll just talk about reassessment for the rest of my time in motions because I know Mr. Ellman will enjoy that. For nearly four years as an elected official , I have advocated for countywide reassessment . I stated my case many times during city council meetings and most any other opportunity I might have to extol the many positive reasons for reassessment for our citizens and our city. I went so far as to be the first elected official to suggest that if the county did not act on their own then the city should sue Lackawanna County to force a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 reassessment , so I was grateful to find support from my colleagues as well as some members of the administration . But let it be known for the record that we were ready and willing to move on that front, but along the way more than several months ago opportunity seemed be your unfolding and we hit the pause button o let it play itself out and play itself out it did. On July 16, 2018, at approximately 3:15 p.m. a court docket was filed and the rest, as they say, just may be history . So first I'd like to thank Mr. Scotch, Ms. Holmes and Mr. Monroe, who are the plaintiffs in the case, suing Lackawanna County to force that entity to conduct a countywide property tax reassessment . Thank you for stepping up, thank you that it's something the commissioners not named Notarianni have failed to do. Thank you for the Community Justice Project for providing the talents of lead attorneys Mario Mather, Donald Driscoll and Kevin Quizberry . I am confident that they will provide proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that Lackawanna 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 County has severely and repeatedly violated the Pennsylvania 's Constitution Uniformity Clause as well as the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution . This violation of the 14th Amendment is very interesting and let me explain why by telling you a little bit about the Community Justice Project. First let me read one line from their mission statement . "Our mission is to protect the civil rights of low income people." Let me repeat that, "Our mission is to protect the civil rights of low income people in Pennsylvania ." This organization 's primary purpose , as their mission statement clearly says, is to protect the rights of low income people and because they have that they decided that a countywide reassessment is away to further that mission . There is no doubt that they know what I and others have been saying and have known for quite awhile that tax inequity hurts the poor. Tax inequity hurts our seniors , and that tax fairness is ultimately good for everyone . This, by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 way, is in total contrast to the nonsense , the scare tactics and the false narrative that have been part of the political spin invoked by two commissioners who have shown by their actions that they are only in fear of reassessment because they are in fear of their jobs. So I would urge those two commissioners to not wait one dime of taxpayers ' money defending an indefensible position . They should finally agree that this is their responsibility . They should finally agree that they will now accept accountability . Furthermore , I would say to the County, the blueprint for success in this lawsuit for the plaintiffs has already been established in existing case law. You cannot win. Every expert in reassessment across the state knows that Lackawanna County is the poster child for tax inequity so I urge you to do the right thing. Finally do what you were elected to do. After all, it has always been part of your job description to ensure tax fairness for all. Reassessment for the City of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 would be a game changer in both fairness and in future growth. So as this trial begins it promises to be quite a show, but I plan on having a front row seat every step of the way unless, of course, at least two people in the commissioners ' office finally come to their senses. In the meantime , I won't hold my breath. That's all I have for today. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, I just want to ask Mrs. Reed if we can ask the administration for a follow-up on Al Young's property on Wyoming Avenue. I had a chance to speak with the Youngs in the last two weeks and the amount of money that they've had to spend now in legal fees is astronomical and not something that I think a family in the City of Scranton can afford when they did not create this problem , the hole that's in their backyard . It seems that the city is hung up on the hold harmless part of the agreement and there is a disconnect there, but if we can get an update on that I would appreciate it because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 there is a lack of communication between both parties and I am seriously concerned about that. Second, I believe it was asked last week about Mrs. Hodowanitz asked about the paving project , the city's paving project , we did receive a memorandum from the business administrator so the project is being awarded to American Asphalt for a total bid of one point eight three nine million dollars . The project funding will be derived from three sources , as was mention ed last week, the Public Works Roadway improvement budget in the 2018 budget is $875,000. The city received funds remaining from the defeasement of the 2012 and 2013 bonds via transfer from the paying agent at the time M & T Bank. The total amount was $710,780.82. Those funds were assigned by city council through ordinance 133 of 2017 for roadway improvements through the creation of a special city's account specifically for that purpose ; and then the third component , and I think it was asked about last week, the city's 2018 liquid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 fuels allocation was $2,307,505.30. Dollars specifically assigned include $413,345 for the street lighting lease, $244,988.88 for the Pennsylvania infrastructure bank loan, PIB loan. The remaining $1,649,172.30 would be allocated to the general fund for eligible expenditures which would include an offset for the $875,000 roadway improvement project . So of this remaining amount approximately $254.074.68 will be assigned to complete the roadway project funding sources . This amount will factor in any interest accrual from the special cities account , so if anybody wants a copy of this to take a look at I have that. Regarding the much discussed laborer contract the past few weeks, we did receive something , a document from Mr. Abrahamsen as a follow-up to our correspondence dated July 16, 2018, we just received this Friday. I haven't had a chance to go through everything . I appreciate the follow-up correspondence though. I will be asking -- Councilman Donahue and I are meeting with the city solicitor tomorrow evening and I am 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 going to ask that this contract be rebid for a number of different reasons , but the biggest reason is back in 2014, as I mentioned last weak, the city issued an RFP. Fast forward to 2018 and really the only difference in the RFP was a line that was added giving preference to firms who know and understand the unique culture of Scranton 's labor unions, and I really don't think that that was fair and that may be the reason that we only receive two bidders for this contract . So I am going to ask that it be rebid in the interest of getting more firms to bid on that contract and hopefully the law department will go along with that and I'm sure we will be discussing that next week. This was also brought up last week, but I just want to say it's becoming harder and harder for me and I think other members of council to ignore complaints that we get about the Licensing and Inspections Department , specifically , that they do not return phone calls. The director of Licensing and Inspections Mr. Hinton, does 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 not return phone calls to people. You know, this isn't anyone attacking Mr. Hinton but this is a fact, and Councilman Donahue can attest and other attest when we go to neighborhood meetings this is literally the number one complaint . So I do want to read into the record a letter that I sent to Mayor Courtright just to let him know that I continually receive when attending neighborhood group meetings the fact that will the Licensing and Inspections Department does not return phone calls, in particular , the department director . I was just stopped before the meeting by a gentleman , who is a contractor for 50 years, and he gave me his card and he is having trouble pulling permits and getting return phone calls, so I would hope, and I think it's unique that the legislative branch of government would get involved in this way, but I would hope the mayor takes these concerns from this council seriously and starts to address this because everywhere I go I hear it at least once or twice a week from different people.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Mr. Srebro last week mentioned the North Keyser Avenue and North/South Road intersection , there was issues there. John Pocius, who is our city engineer , his office went out and did a site visit. I just want to read a section of the letter that he sent to the city solicitor . He says, "Our office is very familiar with this intersection and performed a site recognizance visit on Saturday , June 20, 2018. North/South Road intersects North Keyser Avenue at a severe screw. Our office ran auto turn for passenger car, city bus and WB-67 tractor trailer . Only the passenger car is able to make a left-hand turn but only by encroaching on the right shoulder of North/South Road. The city bus and WB-67 tractor trailer cannot negotiate a left turn. Therefore , based on the information currently available to us, and also upon our professional engineering experience and knowledge , it is our opinion with a reasonable degree of engineering judgment that the following recommendations be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 implemented ." And they are asking that the city install a "No Left turn" sign below the existing stop sign and that is going to require approval of ordinance by city council , so we should be seeing this hopefully very soon, but I wanted to make Mr. Srebro aware that they were looking into that issue. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Gaughan . And very briefly , I had some complaints on a stop sign that is not exactly where it should be. I don't know if was weather or wind or what happened to it but that needs to put back upright , it's kind of at an angle. That's at the corner of Pittston Avenue and Kane Street. Also, I'm aware there is many accidents in that area. There is a one-way street that butts up against a two-way street, so between that and that Kane Street is the very first crossing intersection and a lot of times there are cars coming up the wrong way, they miss where the two-way turns into a one-way. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 if we could send a message out to Officer Mitchell , maybe do a traffic study, is there something that we can do to make that transition from two-way to one-way more apparent . I know it's -- I don't know want to say an ongoing issue it's just the way that was the street was engineered and developed and built a long time ago but there has got to be a better way to secure that area for drivers on both sides. And that's all I have for today. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND EXECUTE A GRANT FOR THE REDEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE CAPITAL PROGRAM (RACP) THROUGH THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA ’S OFFICE OF THE BUDGET IN THE AMOUNT OF EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ( $800,000.00) DOLLARS ; ACCEPTING AND DISBURSING THE GRANT; AND COORDINATE THE USE OF THE GRANT FUNDS WITH SCRANTON -SAMTER, LP, FOR THE PROJECT TO BE NAMED THE “SAMTER REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT ”. MR. PERRY: At this time, I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. EVANS: So moved. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. PERRY: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I just want to read what this project will entail from the backup legislation . This $800,000 will go towards the rehab of the former five-story department store building into 24 one and two bedroom apartments with modern layouts and amenities . Downtown require people to live in them to succeed bringing 24 new units to the 100 block of Penn Avenue needs more than 30 people living in this building and walking in and out on a regular basis. In addition , the return of ground floor retail to this marquee corner will translate into even more people on the street, job creation and tax revenues . I think this is a great project . I think it's a great reinvestment into the 100 block of Penn Avenue and I think this adds to the already growing chorus of people and businesses that are moving into this area, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 and as the backup says I think this will translate into a catalyst for this block of Penn Avenue and even further into downtown and it's a great addition as well. If we remember from few weeks ago, the money that we received from the state for the 300 block of Adams Avenue the Scranton Counseling Center is moving over to Cherry Street in South Scranton so I think this is good news.
