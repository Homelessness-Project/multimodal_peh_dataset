MR. ROGAN: I have a number of announcements . First, this Thursday , June 21, is dump the pump day. The public may ride Colts buses for free on all routes on this day. This is an annual event intended to promote the use of public transportation . Pool season has officially begun with the opening of Nay Aug Pool. Fees start at $5 for a single pass and $75 for a family season pass. Nay Aug Pool will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 operate seven days a week from noon to 6:00 p.m. New this year, children 12 and younger must be accompanied by an adult. The cities other pools Weston Park and Weston Field and Connell Park do not have opening dates due to staffing issues. All of the lifeguards have not yet been hired. The city is still taking application s, which are available in Weston Fieldhouse on Providence Road and at city hall on the third floor of the HR Department , so if you know anyone that wants to be a lifeguard for the city, we are hiring. Mary Mother of God parish in North Scranton is holding their annual block party this week June 21 through 23. It's held on the corner of West Market Street and Wayne Avenue by Cole Muffler. Hours are 6:00 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Thursday and Friday, and 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturday .

(The following speakers offered public comment : Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Les Spindler spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Bob Bolus spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Lee Mogan spoke on matters of general concern . Giovanni Piccolino spoke on matters of general concern . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, just quickly . I wanted to ask Mr. Spindler while I was here, but he left, about Dorothy Street he had a question about that several times about it not getting taken care of, we didn't hear anything back about Dorothy Street; right? So I'll follow-up on that to see if there has been a more permanent fix. Mrs. Reed did run into our Parks and Rec director , which we had a couple of questions . We are being promised an update on the tree house shortly , which once I'll be glad to share with everybody , and also, I know I've been kept busy with pool, unfortunately the pool that's not in service at Novembrino Park in West Side which is just -- it's full of water, stagnant water and it's starting to become a breeding ground for insects and there's a lot of request s to get that pool drained and just, you know, to make the area just better for everybody and it was delayed , but we did get an answer. Thanks again for Mrs. Reed for to getting that answer for us from Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Fallon. The hold up on the drainage was they are waiting on a treatment for the pool. So what's going to happen is they are going to drain the pool and then wash the pool down with an anti-insect treatment , that way even during the summer weather if it does get rain and there is some kind of stagnant water it's not going be a breeding ground for any further this summer and also on a more positive note with that park, we have been in contact with some of the people there, the designers , there will be some demolition starting on Novembrin o Park. If you remember , we allocated many grants for that park, for the splash park and that's going to start, actually start seeing the fruits of our labor in the West Side and actually , you know, it will turn that from a negative situation to a positive where the kids are actually going to have somewhere to go and play in the summer months. Mr. Lockwood, I believe reading the backup, 110 cameras is what is going to be with B-5 and I could talk more on that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 during Fifth Order, but I will be speaking with Mr. Graziano this week and if you want to call me later that week I might have some more answers on the roll out of the program and things of that nature. But as of that, that's all I have for you today. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to touch on we had Jim Hoover in our caucus tonight from Pennsylvania American Water and, Mr. Dobrzyn , you brought up a couple of weeks ago the 200 and 300 blocks of Crown Avenue, more specifically the beginning of the 300 block of Crown Avenue, so I asked him about that and there was a brand new valve that broke on it so they made the cut to repair the valve but by the end of this year, by the end of the summer they were going to do a project off Orchard Street that's going to cross Crown Avenue and when they do that they are going to move in about ten feet or 20 feet on Crown Avenue and do the curb to curb so they are just waiting to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 get that work done and then they are going to repaving the whole thing. On Friday I attended the protest of Attorney General Jeff Sessions outside of Lackawanna College . I was in complete awe not only by the nearly 300 people in attendance , but also by the passion and determination to stand up for what they believe in. The images of the children who have been separated from their parents and being warehoused in detention centers like they are animals in chain link cages is not only disturbing , it's utterly disgusting . This is not an American we can all be proud of. As Congressman Joe Kennedy, III, stated over the weekend , "Humanity does not require citizenship ." This policy is being shamelessly embraces by ideological extremists such as Congressman Lou Barletta , who wants the privilege of becoming a United States Senator from Pennsylvania . The Trump administration has used a wide variety of reasons to defend the policy, but the most disturbing is when Jeff Sessions cherry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 picked a passage from Romans 13 that states, "Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority to which God has established ." This is the same passage that has been used throughout history by loyalist preachers during the Revolutionary War in defense of the British Crown, by southern preachers in defense of slavery before and during the Civil War, to defend Nazism in World War II, and also Apartheid in South Africa. We must ask ourselves if this is the side of history we want to be on in. If the answer is no, I encourage you to stand up and speak out against these fascists policies so each and every American can once again be proud of their country . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: A brief comment , on many occasions being civil to each other in a public forum while having a public discussion is no longer the norm but the exception , nationally , at the state level and even at the local level, but I will say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 tonight 's meeting was actually somewhat encouraging . However , it sometimes seems that we are no longer able to achieve civil discourse in our debates and discuss ions and that can be a serious blow to the Democratic process . I respect the public right to speak their minds. In fact, I encourage it, but I also respect and follow the basic rules of civil discourse to be respectful and don't make it personal . And, by the way, it also helps to stick to the issues. In civil discourse you use logic, you use persuasion , you use facts and information to make your point or defend your position . In a civil discourse , you would not attack someone personally . Yes, of course, you are entitled to your opinion and if someone disagrees with that opinion they also be treated with respect . The reality is that if you really truly believe and want to convince someone that your position or opinion is valid, you can achieve that through civil discourse . You will never convince someone to side with your position by using derogatory terms, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 insults and by ridiculing them. It just won't happen. And I think deep down most people know this, but if you don't practice the basic rules of the civil discourse then the only conclusion I can come up to is this that you may not be interested or you may be more interested in insulting someone than convincing them that your position is really worthy of consideration . Over my time on council I have debated my colleagues on many issues many times. In fact, just recently , Councilman Gaughan and I had a spirited debate on the residency waiver issue. We disagree with each other's position , and I think both made valid points to our argument . At the end of the meeting we shook hands and moved onto the next task. We debated the issue not the person. That was civil discourse . We followed the basic rules. We were respectful and we didn't make it personal . Just some food for thought . That's all I have tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. I just wanted to remind everyone that the city is participating in the county recycling program . All of the details are on the city's website . They are holding them two days this year, July 13 and July 20, so it would be for electronics recycling , there will be no fee. You can drop off the electronics at DPW 101 West Popular Street from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. on both days. The street sweeper will be in the Minooka section of the city Saginaw Street to Wet Pond Avenue this June 18 through June 22. I did send several e-mails to our city solicitor regarding our shared services meeting and I did run into her and let her know that he we did want to meet with her regarding shared legal services between the school district and the city and I have not heard back from her yet. So, Mrs. Reed, if we can send an official letter and ask her please respond so that we can set up a meeting as soon as possible . One of the things that was brought 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 up tonight that I have heard over the past few weeks is the city's issue with getting lifeguards to man our pools throughout the city, and I was actually approached by a neighbor of mine, who is the president of the North Scranton Neighborhood Watch and I don't believe they are able to open Weston Park at this point for the family fun day which is upcoming because of the lack of lifeguards. So one of the ideas that I had was if the city in the future were to create some kind of a grant program to pay for the certification , because what's happening in my opinion is young people want to be lifeguards, they want to sign up for it, but the registration and the course fee could be a couple of hundred dollars . Even the recertification fee I think is $150 to $200, so I think it would be in the city's best interest to set up in the future some kind of program where the city pays for the certification for the new lifeguards or they partially pay for. I also think, I'm not sure if the city does this at this point, but I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 set up a table similar to how they do it at job fairs at Scranton High School, West Scranton High School, Marywood , Lackawanna College, University of Scranton , letting people know, young people know we are looking for lifeguards. I know they do a lot through the media, but I think their presence in the high schools would also be good, especially if we can set up the grant program to help them pay for the certification fee. So I will ask that we send a letter to the mayor's office and see if the administration would be interested in that. I did receive quite a few citizens ' request for the past week, and I just want to apologize , I think Mr. Perry touched on this two weeks ago, something happened with the city e-mail server and this weekend , as Mrs. Reed knows because I flooded her e-mail box with forwarding requests , I had not been receiving e-mails for quite sometime and then this weekend I received a number of them, so I did not want people to think I was ignoring them, there was something wrong 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 with the city's e-mail server. We did receive a letter about 1428-1430 Linden Street. Neighbors are concerned that it's a serious safety and fire hazard so if we could forward that to Licensing and Inspection . A gentlemen has been contacting me twice now about dumping in the 1,000 block of Hitchcock Court. There is several bags and debris that are littering the Court. One is in the area behind 1027 Quincy Avenue, the other is other 1009 Quincy Avenue. We did ask the DPW to pick that debris up and we ask to send a request to them, more neighbors are calling and complaining . Also, a complaint that I received this weekend from several neighbors about a double home multi-dwelling on the corner of Geraldine Street and Slader. They have called police several times for noise, fighting , and the neighbors are concerned that the home is a sober house so if we can forward that to the police department and Licensing and Inspections . Also, on Meadow Avenue neighbors in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 that area are complaining of several potholes . I received a call about a catch basin that's blocked going over Interstate 81 onto River Street, the bridge there. 800-811 Grandview Street is being renovated at this point by an out-of-town landlord who apparently is planning to put 12 college students there. Neighbors contacted me who are concerned about the potential impact on parking so Mrs. Reed did notify Licensing and Inspection and our zoning officer so will await to hear back from them on that. Also, high grass in the area of rear 107 Davis Street and some other issues with a house back there so if we can send that to Licensing and Inspections as well. And I was on the phone with a gentleman yesterday about Kurst Court, which is right behind William Edwards florist in Minooka , apparently there is a major issue with flooding . The gentlemen sent me a video and two pictures and I forwarded those to Mrs. Reed, who sent those to the DPW, I'm hoping that this problem will be taken care of. The gentlemen explained to me that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 water is flooding , has flooded in his inground pool and he actually had to pay a couple of thousand dollars to get a new liner, so anything the city could do to alleviate that gentleman 's problem would be greatly appreciated and I'll follow-up on that next week and that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just following up on a couple of items that were mentioned , I believe Councilman Donahue brought up our caucus that we had with PA American Water. The water company has been very forthcoming with information regarding projects that they have going on and obviously it's the utility that is doing work in your neighborhood but it's certainly that something does need to be done. They are hoping to not run into the issues that we're running into in the Hill Section where the water company and the gas company were doing work simultaneously in the same areas and they were running into problems that, you know, on of the wanted to work in one area, they both wanted to be in one area at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 the same time and what was a good idea in practice which was to do both water and gas lines at the same time sounded like a good idea to get it done quickly and get the road paved and move on, in practicality it seems that it really didn't work, you know, especially if two utilities were working in the same area the road was shut down, the street entirely so it caused quite a bit of issues, but we are going to continue to keep lines of communication with the utilities companies , the water and gas company open. As was mentioned numerous times when the water company has been a little bit better to be able and the gas company then we hope that they will send representatives as well. We would love to meet the gas utility contractors to try and get a handle on those issues as well. The only other comments I have are on agenda items so that will be all. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION - AUTHORIZING THE CHIEF OF POLICE FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MASTER SERVICES 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 AND PURCHASING AGREEMENT BY AND BETWEEN AXON ENTERPRISE , INC. (“AXON”) A DELAWARE CORPORATION AND THE SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT (“AGENCY”) SETTING FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR THE PURCHASE , DELIVERY , USE, AND SUPPORT COSTS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR BODY CAMERA PROJECT . MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. PERRY: On the question , as I stated earlier , this is to enter into an agreement to roll out our Go Pro Body Cam Program . Last year we allocated money through the Justice Assistant Grant Program which our police department is very visual in getting money for us to upgrade and get tools for our police department and this is just one of the latest grants coming to fruition . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 I just wanted to say that I also support this project because , number one, I think it protects the citizens and most importantly it protects the officers . As we have seen over the last few years a number of incidents that have gone in the country with police offers and individuals who say a police officer did something and they didn't actually do it, these body cameras will help keep everyone accountable and I think it's important to keep our police officers safe. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: I concur with my colleagues and about a year or two years ago there was a rash of incidents all throughout the country . In a few cases, the officers weren't at fault but in my more cases individuals made claims against police officers that may or may not have been true and there was no true way to tell if the officers was in the right or the wrong and other areas of the country are causing -- as far as causing rights in some parts of the country . So these body cameras will protect 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 our police officers from being falsely accused and it will also protect the residents if there is an incident where a police officer does something that's inappropriate .

EVANS: I make a motion to amend Item 6-C per the following : On page three of the second amendment to concession and lease agreement in the "Now, therefore ," clause, Section 3 (c), Subsection (iii) in the first sentence omit the words "Shall be released " and insert "is not to be released until Scranton City Council, as a body, concurs on an improved downtown residential monthly parking program as well as further evaluation and recommendation of the proposed kiosk meter system thereafter up to $1,804,00.00 shall be released ." MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: There is a motion on the floor and a second to amend 6-C. On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. EVANS: On the question , personally I think the importance of incentivizing the downtown residential community into a parking garages has several advantages , one is to increase occupancy , which in the garage system in the evening night hours when occupancy is at it's lowest, bring in new monthly customers to increase the revenue and have a minimal impact on expenses. It also frees up on-street parking spaces in the evening hours for the customers for our many excellent restaurants and shops downtown . In my opinion , NDC has been honestly to slow to responding to my request to develop plans for downtown residential parking . Many downtown developers have requested the same. Only after our public caucus last week did they finally request an expedited study on this issue. This amendment simply puts some mild pressure on the garage operators to address this issue and the satisfaction of city council , the residents of downtown and the developers of residential living downtown who have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 invested millions of dollars and will continue to invest millions more if we can get this right. Downtown residential development is one of our city's largest growth industries so we cannot allow the momentum we have gained over the last five years or longer to be slowed by a lack of action and innovation in the parking sector. That's all I have on the question . MR. ROGAN: I'd just like to follow-up with one point that Councilman Evans didn't mention is by pushing more residential parkers into the garages specifically at night that freezes up parking on our city streets for those who use downtown restaurants , bars who come to visit the downtown , so it not only has a benefit to those that live in the downtown but it also has a benefit to business owners downtown and anyone from Scranton or outside of the city that wants to come in our city to park and enjoy a lot of restaurants and shops that we have in the city. I do plan on talking to -- I did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 talk to a couple of develop ers that do plan on talking to a few more of our downtown developers and business owners before the final vote on this package to get some more input from them but I do agree with the amendment to hold back some of these funds until we get a better handling of residential parking in our downtown . Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. PERRY: I move that Item 6-C, as amended , pass reading by title. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . As I mentioned last week, I had several questions about this legislation that I posted regarding the Electric City garage and if and when any capital expenditures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 were to going to be expended there and I also had several questions for NDC that I submitted so I would like those to be answered before final passage next week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS.

MR. GAUGHAN : I make a motion to further amend Item 7-B by amending the 2018 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 Action Plan under the Community Block Grant Program per the following changes : To reduce paving 2018 by $50,000 for a funding total of $601,671, and transfer $50,000 to the project McLain Park improvement project by increasing the funding amount to $150,000. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: There's a motion and a second, on the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I make this amendment for several reasons : One, this park has not had any money put into it in nearly three decades . A few years ago the North Scranton Neighborhood Association Watch successfully lobbied the city for CDBG funding in the amount of $150,000. Phase One of that project is currently ongoing and it's very successful at this point. This park is extremely important to this neighborhood in North Scranton . The softball field is it used every single night. This park before Phase One was started was in shambles to say the least 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 equipment wise. The fencing around the softball field was very dangerous , the field itself is dangerous and needs to be updated . The basketball court is dangerous , so right now in Phase One it's going to be ADA accessible and it's going to be really a great park for all of the children in this neighborhood , and one of the things about this neighborhood is there are a large number of children who live here and use this park. So I would ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment so that we can continue to invest in this neighborhood , in all of our parks in the city and in the children of the City of Scranton . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: On the question , what's important also is we have the opportunity I think to move this project to completion instead of waiting another year and looking for additional funding down the road so it's always important when we are close to finishing a program not to let it twist in the wind and not to get it halfway done but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 to complete the project and then move onto the next project so I'll be voting yes on this as well. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , Mr. Young was here last week and had a few questions and we did pose those questions to the administration and the answer that we got was that they would not respond to those questions because of the ongoing litigation between Mr. Young and the City of Scranton . I don't really understand, I mean, I can understand it a little bit, but I don't understand it in the sense that we are just asking questions specifically about the legislation and I don't think this is really has anything to do with the lawsuit . I think he was just -- he just wanted to know whether or not this money was going to be specifically for the issues that him and Mr. Kennedy were facing. But anyways, I'm going to support this obviously and hope that this project gets started and gets completed before the summer. Thank you. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. DAVIDSON : Mr. Perry. MR.
