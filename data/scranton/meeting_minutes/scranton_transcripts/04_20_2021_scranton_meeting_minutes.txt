CONTROLLER 'S REPORT FOR MONTH ENDING MARCH 31, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Do any Council members have any announcements at this time -- or, I'm sorry. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Just on Item 3-C, I'm glad they're appoint ing Mr. Judge there as Emergency Management Coordinator . I know this was something we knew was occurring or happening, but I think some of the question s that came up over the last two weeks may have prompted them to send that along. So I'm glad to see that's there. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. I just want to commend the 60 student s and staff from Marywood University that teamed up with Gattens and his crew and donated their time to help clean Nay Aug today. Great job. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 else? MR. DONAHUE : There is also a Nay Aug Park cleanup, you know, it's open for the community this weekend . I believe it starts at 10 a.m. And they're asking that everybody meet at 10 at the Community Room at Nay Aug Park by the pool. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Very good. Anyone else? Okay. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Marie Schumacher and Thomas Coyne. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 O Going into the sale of the Sewer Authority all were aware the City held the MS4 Stormwater Permit. The City has invested money in more than one contractor to study the issue but for four years and almost four months the City has been dancing around the May Pole without proposing , let alone selecting , a stormwater Plan. How will the Plan be implemented ? Will it be in-house or through an Authority ? Is this foot-dragging because it's an election year and the City doesn't want us to know how much deeper into our pockets you will reach to fund the Plan? If there is another reason, please share that reason. O What is the date of the last request for RACP funding for the renovation of the Municipal Building ? While on the subject of grants I would like to request the City Clerk keep a Grant Log that would provide , when requested , the date of the grantors expiration , if any, and date awarded . O It has been over two years since 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 the City received the Highland Associates Report on the condition of City Hall and the estimated cost of the full renovation . Thanks to Jim Lockwood and the Times-Tribune for reporting the North Washington Street side of the building 's stained glass windows are being repaired but we've heard nothing from Council . What is to be done with the other deficiencies of City Hall and when? I am concerned about employees (and perhaps the Mayor's daughter ) health as the mold issue was raised in the Report as City Hall should be opening to the public even without an appointment very shortly . MS. REED: The second submission is from Mr. Tom Coyne as follows : Well it's obvious we will not have a pool installed for a few years as it has been pushed to 2022 at a minimum , if the pool was agreed to and financed today. That being said, I would suggest going with the splash pad and getting it operational first. I know we have a vendor who is supplying plans for the build, but I am 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 curious on the pads themselves , how many people will be bidding on supply of the materials ? Can we split the project to pad and then pool vs slowing it by dual construction splitting construction resources ? Fresh water/potable is preferred for splash pads and cheaper for insurance instead of recycled water. Insurance liability with recycling systems , compounds due to bacteria , kids in diapers and running and laughing ingesting water, kids faces go into the water and they drink, so fresh water is preferred . Try to keep a kid from drinking from a hose. Let's also consider in the project , wastewater produced by the system. It would seem reasonable to install toilets and urinals that use gray water for flushing . The entire splash pad run off could be collected and pumped into a holding tank that gravity feeds the toilets and urinals . This eliminates the water cost for toilets and urinals , by reuse of the splash pad runoff. Cisterns have been used for this for ages and it may qualify for grants as it reduces water waste. The landfill donates 100k a year for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 police vehicles , trash trucks, and any other equipment necessary for the health and safety of the City residents . I believe Nay Aug Park promotes the health and safety of the populous . So it may be reasonable to use this as part of matching for the equipment of the splashpad . Please note the agreement for the donation was for the life of the settlement /landfill . It was expected to be 30 years, but it is defined clearly as the life of the landfill . So the expected 30 years ends in 2030, or based on capacity and possible expansion , as long as the landfill is open and operational ; the city gets 100k a year. Second, Is City Council agreeable to separation of the Garbage funds to an account that is not co-mingled with the general fund? Are they willing to put in language to ban line item or any transfer of garbage funds to any non garbage related expense ? Trash/recycling has been moved in the budget notes prior, nothing prevents the movement of budgeted and collected garbage funds to be reallocated by line assigning them anywhere else.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Third, I understand the reason people want to speak at council and have a “Voice”. The inflection words produce is much more than the context of dry text. Public Speech can move people more than just words... and that is missing . Fourth, speaking of water runoff, I believe during the Wenzel administration pre election , an improvement was approved for the Minooka section . I got this information second hand from neighbors , but I have verified myself. On the 3200 block of Oak Avenue, Storm drains/cement pits were installed and the runoff pipes were placed in front of people's homes. A number of months later the City collected all the pipes and never installed them. This left large concrete wastewater drainage pits connected to nothing . One of my neighbors has issues with basement flooding and I suspect it is cause by the large concrete basin collecting and saturating the ground in front of her house as it is filled days and sometimes weeks after rainfall . Instead of rainwater running off, it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 holds and saturates the areas around our properties and water table, and causes basement issues due to constant water pressure and inflitration . Someone needs to repair/complete this installation . A fair bit of 3200 Cedar avenue water is dumped on Oak from home sump pumps running to the non connected wastewater basins as well. Last the obscenity ruling. You perched this on the Colts Bus incident of long ago, that ruling was due to not wanting to allow atheist advertisement but allowing secular . The amended obscenity change falls short and just removing the vagueness is not enough. The court also discussed Mr. McAndrew 's obvious discomfort . The 2019 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court takes it out of your hands. The case, Iancu v. Brunetti , a First Amendment case about “immoral or scandalous ” trademarks . The ruling stemmed from a trademark the Patent office disallowed . A sign or doing business as is so close to a business trademark it falls well into the ruling.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 The Supreme Court defended free speech Monday, even for four-letter words. Faced with a clothing line called FUCT, the justices struck down federal prohibitions against granting trademark protection for "immoral " or "scandalous " material as unconstitutional . The vote was 6-3 in an opinion written by Associate Justice Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor dissented . "The First Amendment does not allow the government to penalize views just because many people, whether rightly or wrongly , see them as offensive ," Kagan said from the bench in announcing the decision . Due to this it is clear any enforcement of this section is a violation of federal law. There is not much to discuss , not just the struck section from city code, but from the entire section . (This concludes public comment as submitted to Council ) MS. REED: And that concludes the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 citizens participation . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just to answer, you know, partially answer Marie's question about stormwater is, the one thing that has changed since we got our last update was the passage of the American Recovery Act which does have certain stipulations in it that the money could be used for stormwater or waste water -- or water or sewage treatment . So I think it's getting into that and how much money we could use from that because that would, you know, could hopefully be a big, you know, plus in terms of moving this project forward , you know, stormwater forward . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? I want to thank Miss Schumacher and Mr. Coyne for submitting their comments and questions . And we will attempt to get answers to those questions by next week, if possible . All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have three comments . So first I'd like thank Mrs. Cipriani for getting back to me today. There was some complaints coming out of the West Scranton area about the Inspections Department and who was taking the place of Mr. Liptai who had retired. So she did get back to me rather quickly and let me know that there was a new replacement there with inspections . Secondly , I'd like to thank PennDOT for meeting with me and Mr. Donahue with the Oram Street neighbors and to Kyle and Lori for getting and Kevin Hayes for getting that letter out to PennDOT and awaiting their response . And lastly, I'd like to thank Kevin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Hayes who reached out to the Parking Authority for me. After we got the 2019 audit done, there was an adverse opinion regarding the Scranton Parking Authority . So Mr. Hayes reached out to them to see what needs to be done there and if there's a need for a possible audit of the Parking Authority . So thank you all for helping out with those issues. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : A few question s or concerns that I had were address ed in caucus so I'm good. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few which I'd also mentioned in caucus but I'll repeat again. I spoke with the administration regarding some concerns about the speed of vehicles on Harrison Avenue and the lack of pedestrian safety for the crosswalks . And they sent a request to PennDOT for a traffic study because it is a state road. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 So it's, you know, not necessarily something that they can do anything about but hopefully PennDOT would be interested in performing that traffic study so we can get a better idea how to increase the safety there along that road. I also received some questions , a request for updates on the Birch Street project , which I know that was spoken a lot about mainly some concerns along the 400 block of Birch Street and the 800 block of Cedar Avenue and the pave cuts that were -- we were told that there would be a permanent restoration sometime this month. And now I've received an update that tomorrow weather permitting that that part of restoration should be completed which is good news for the neighbors and commute rs in that neighborhood . And then lastly, I expressed some concerns over just the lack of transparency in changes to personnel in City Hall. And, you know, that's difficult for us to do I think keep track and what positions are changing . And I wanted to make a motion to request that we send a letter from Council to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 administration for a regular update on our personnel . MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second that motion. MR. GAUGHAN : We have a motion and a second. On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question -- MR. MCANDREW : -- in the caucus I agree. We had something similar at the school district where we would have a personnel report that entailed everything that -- that was mentioned earlier . So I'm definitely in favor of this. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, on the question , thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I was also thinking the same thing. The monthly personnel report was helpful for knowing what was coming. And I think that might -- something similar to that, you know, might cover some of Jess's concerns . MR. GAUGHAN : Very good. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motions passes. DR. ROTHCHILD : That was all that I had. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I just want to thank my colleagues and everyone else who's reached out over the last week congratulating us on the birth of our daughter Maggie. Both Mary Kate and Maggie are doing great. I'm just over the moon. I've always heard people say that you never know love until you hold your first child. And now I know exactly what they are talking about. I wasn't here last week because of the birth of our daughter , but I want to take a moment just to congratulate Lori on her retirement . Over the last three years your friendship , your advice, your institutional knowledge have just been invaluable on both a personnel and professional level. Although you'll be greatly missed, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 hope you -- I wish you a happy, healthy retirement that's filled with time -- extended time with your family, especial ly your grandchildren . And I just want to thank you for your service . You know, you will be greatly missed. I don't know what we're going to do without you. Also, you know, I know Jess brought up the speed of vehicles . I've actually noticed that especially on Pittston Avenue and some of the side streets , you know, especially in South Scranton going up and down the hills. It just seems like people are going faster and faster. So hopefully we can get something going there. You know, not only there but City wide just looking into that and especially with I've been getting a little bit of complaint s about ATVs, mopeds, dirt bikes that are starting up again. So hopefully , you know, the police department will step up some patrols there. I know -- I believe Mark brought up the issues of St. Francis Cabrini . I got a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 couple of those complaints . I believe he brought them up last week but I wasn't here. But there was also an incident there overnight . So, Mrs. Reed -- because I don't think we got a response on that too. So, Mrs. Reed, if you could look into see if there's been any progress over there. A few -- a couple of times last year I brought up a complaint about a storm drain on the 500 block of Emmett Street. We passed it along to the water company who said they were going to go out and fix it. I did -- Miss Reed did ask for an update on that and that should be fixed by the end of this week. Also, Miss Reed, if you could, send it -- send a correspondence to the DPW Director and the parks -- the new Parks Director . I don't know exactly who these -- we're suppose d to -- I guess we got an e-mail today that correspondence should go to the DPW's administrative assistant . So if you could just send it to them and also copy the new Parks Director and DPW Director regarding what the plan is for park maintenance this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 year. I know we are, you know, we're waiting on that parks study that's going to give us recommendation s on how to properly maintain our parks, you know, moving forward . But I don't think that's going to, you know, solve the need for this year. So I just wanted to see, you know, what our maintenance plan is for this year and make sure our parks are properly maintained . And also if there is any other -- if we know if there is any other issues with any of the other City pools and if that's going to, you know, affect their openings . And then also on that point is -- and I'll put all of this in an e-mail to you too -- but how we're making out in terms of hiring lifeguards because I know in the past we've closed down pools not because of the state of the pool but because we didn't have enough lifeguards to properly man the pools. And then one other issue and it's one of my pet peeves is since we're in the political season, is political signs in right-of-ways and on City properties . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I know in the past DPW has gone out and collected the signs for the candidate s to pick up down at DPW that are on right-of-ways. So maybe if we could just send correspondence to the administration , DPW Director if, you know, they plan on doing anything like that because usually what happens there is, they put them out and don't come and pick them back up. And it just looks terrible . And usually , it's in entrance points to the City whether it be on the, you know, Central Scranton Expressway or on the McDade Expressway and places like that. And it's just not a good look coming in. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . Just one thing -- actually two things. Mrs. Reed, did we get a response from our request last week regarding Mr. Young's property over on Wyoming Avenue? MS. REED: I don't believe so, Councilman Donahue , but I'll go back through my e-mails. But I don't believe so. I would have forwarded that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Can we just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 followup on that? You know, I know we mentioned it last weekend . Mr. Young had submitted comments on it so if there is any way that we can help them out -- or the administration could help them out, that would be great. The second thing I wanted to mentioned and we all discussed this in caucus was the fact that the Mayor had issued an emergency declaration hiring a company called Bedrock Technology in the amount of $12,750 a month to fill the gap that has been created by the resignation of the Network Systems Manager Frank Swietnicki who used to be the IT Director . So it's come to our attention that the IT Director position has been vacant for quite some time. So I know that Council has some concerns with this. So I have the following question s that I'd like to pose to the administration and if we can have these answered by next week. So the first one is how long exactly has the IT Director position been open for. We do know that Frank Swietnicki who was the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 long-time IT Director moved into a Network Systems Manager position . So that's the first question . The second request would be a copy of the contract with Bedrock Technologies . Number three, I think we need to know a timeline or what the plan is in terms of, you know, when the City is going to hire an IT Director and a Network Systems Manager, how long they expect this company to perform the work. Does the administration expect the contract with this company to cease when an IT Director and a Network Systems Manager is hired or is there a period of time after that they plan on keeping him on. How will the current employees within the IT Department work with this company , what will the employees be responsible for? What will their duties be now that this company is coming on and will be doing the work of the network systems manager ? And I'm not quite sure what else because we don't have a copy of the contract in front of us. The next question I have is how is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 the administration , the Mayor and her administration planning on paying for this? What account are they paying this -- these funds out of? I know that the professional services budget in the IT Department was large. And that was going towards the hiring of OpenGov which we -- the City executed that contract a few weeks ago after we passed that legislation . So there are these things I think we need clarification on. My concern as I stated in the caucus is that $12,750 a month for a whole year that's $300,000. And this is -- it's open ended. And I just want to make sure that we -- that the administration has a plan in place and can, you know, let Council know what that plan is so that we don't have, you know, this company in for months and months and months and we're shelling out a significant amount of money because someone resigned. So that's all I have this week. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION AN ORDINANCE CREATING AND 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 ESTABLISHING SPECIAL CITY ACCOUNT NO. 02.229641 ENTITLED “HARRY AND JEANNETTE WEINBERG FOUNDATION WESTON FIELD GRANT” FOR THE RECEIPT AND DISBURSEMENT OF CAPITAL GRANT FUNDS FROM THE HARRY AND JEANNETTE WEINBERG FOUNDATION , INC. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I have three questions regarding this legislation . Mrs. Reed, if you could reach out to OECD, I'd like to know how much money is currently in the Weston Foundation Trust, how much money does the City receive from the trust annually and if they could give us a few examples of how much money has been used or given to the City in the past and what that money has been used for. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION - A RESOLUTION RATIFYING AND APPROVING OF THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE PROJECT TO BE KNOWN AS THE CONNELL PARK REHABILITATION LOCATED AT CONNELL PARK, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , AND AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE OFFICIALS OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , TO ACCEPT THE GRANT, IF SUCCESSFUL , AND EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A GRANT CONTRACT AND COMMITMENT LETTER AWARDED FOR SUCH PROJECT . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , and this goes for the next two pieces of legislation as well. I'd like a copy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 of the actual grant application . Usually in the past when Council has passed this type of legislation where we're executing or we're approving the execution and submission of the grant application by the City, we usually always receive a grant application that goes into great detail on what the project details, drawing s, things like that that have been compiled in order to submit the application . So I would make that request before final passage next week for this and 5-D and 5-E. Also, as I mentioned in the caucus it states that the grant application was due to DCNR April 15th, 2021. It's my understanding that the grant application has already been submitted in order to comply with the deadline . I would like to double-check on this though because I believe in the past, Council has always had to pass the legislation first and then the grant application was submitted . I could be wrong on that. But I just want to double-check. I know even in the past few months as I stated earlier , Council or the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 administration rather has come to Council with a grant application and an emergency declaration attached in order to get the grant application in on time to DCNR or whatever other program they were going for. So I want a clarification on that. And that's all I have on 5-C. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-D.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-D be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , as I stated in caucus, with this one I just would want clarification . It's not clear from this legislation what options the City was going with in terms of all the options that were present ed by the pool consultant MKSD which came to us twice within the last two months. So I just would just like clarification on if the City is definitively choosing one of those options that was presented . I think Council would like to know that. And also, it states that the City's committing a 3.1 million dollar cash match to the project . I'd like to know where that matched money is coming from, what account it's coming 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 out of and what the plan is there how they're going to get their hands on those funds.
