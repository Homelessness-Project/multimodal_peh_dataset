Ihadsaidsocial media,obviously Facebook wasmyfirstthought .Ididnotdothat because ,obviously ,onthe27th--orthe 24thwehadsomebadnewsandthenthefirst surgery .Ijust--Ineedtoletyouall knowthatIhavecreated aFacebook page called NEPASupporters ofDeltaMedix.And Ididthatforthereason thatafewdays afterthearticle appeared aboutMark,which wasSeptember 1,thedayofhissurgery ,a fewdaysafterthatagagorderwasplaced onDeltaMedix.Theyare--sopeople are nowcalling asking about,youknow,their continuation ofcareornewcareormaking appointments andsimply puteventomethey can'tspeaktoanybody .SotheFacebook1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 pageisaforumforthat. Youknow,MargoSosnik istheCEOof DeltaMedix.Sheisobviously extremely upsetaboutthefactthatshethinks,you know,people --theperception outthereis thattheDeltaMedixdoctors ,theDelta MedixCEOsimply don'tcareabouttheir 13,000plusemployees andthatreally isn't thecase.Theyweretoldthattherewould nofurther negotiations .Theysigned a confidential ityagreement sowhenpeople do callDeltaMedixtheywon'tgetanywhere, butthrough theFacebook pageit'samazing theamount ofpeople thathavereached out tomyself andmyhusband ,oneofwhichI'll speaktoaboutinasecond,withquestions soI'mkindoftrying to--youknow,when I'mupmaking dinner at4:30inthemorning forwhenIgethomefromworkItryand fieldwhatIcan,because asMarkhadsaid andIsay,it'saboutmorethanus. Sotothatitbrings metothefact thatonegentleman reached outtomefrom California .Thisgentleman isUCLA graduate .Heisabusiness management1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 graduate whohisnameisBenQuirkfrom QuirkHealthCareSolutions .Ihadposted on--because I'mjustthatkindofagirl, posted theDelta--ortheletter from Highmark --orthePennsylvania Insurance Commission aboutHighmark .Inthatletter, andI'mgoingtoquotetoyoujustoneor twolinesfromthatletter:"Please be advised yourplanisadministered by Highmark BlueCrossofNEPAundera self-funded contract andisnotinsurance thatisunderthejurisdiction ofthe Pennsylvania Insurance Commission ." Thisgentleman hadcontacted meand said,"Youbetter talktoyouremployer if that'sthecase." SoIkindoftossed itaround butI thinkalotofthesequestions Attorney Minora isprobably goingtohavetoposeor answer foryou.Thelittle Idoknowwedo havesomeSIR'sthroughout theCityof Scranton ,andIhade-mailed Jessica Boyle today,whoistremendous girl.Ifshe doesn'tknowtheanswer sheisgoingtofind theanswer andIthinkwehavearealasset1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 inherfortheCityofScranton ,soIhad posedseveral questions toherand,you know,again,Ithinkthatit'svery important thatyouallaskthesequestions , butheroneresponse specifically wasthat wasIasking wasHighmarkthethirdparty administrator .Theyare,infact,thethird partyadministrator .Inotherwords,the cityiseither theinsurance company quote/unquoteorwehavetopaysomebody to administer theplan. Soitreally comesintoplaybecause forifthatisthecase,andI'm99.9 percent surethatthatisthecaseforusas acity,theproblem thenbecomes ifthereis astocklossforcatastrophic orunplanned medical thecitywouldassume that liability .Inotherwords,theCityof Scranton willnowhavetopayinsurance billsthatHighmarkarbitrarily doesnot cover. Additionally ,whenIspoken tothis bodythelasttimeItalked aboutspeaking tothegentleman atBlueCrossHighmarkand hekepttelling mebackandforthyes,we1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 areHighmark,thenhesaid,no,weareBlue Cross.Jessica didconfirm withmetodayin writing thatthemerger doesnottakeeffect untilJanuary of2017,sowehaveareal-- I'mnottrying tobedifficult atall,I'm justtrying toinform you,inform the public,I'msograteful ,again,forour health insurance ,therearesomanythings thatwehavetogetdonehereinthecity andIknowthisislowonthetotempole, butitspeaks totheissueofcosts. Acouple otherquestions thatI have,thereisonlythreefourthatI'm goingtoaskyouif,infact,number one,do weemploy anadministrator orarewethe administrator ?That'snumber one.Ihave asked,andyoucandowhatyouwantto obtain copies ofallhealth insurance contracts between thecityinsurance carrier sforthepastfiveyears,atthe veryleast,wehadAetnapriortoBlueCross someyearsago,andtheyarepretty much obsolete inthearea,determine thetermfor eachcontract andcostpaideachyear. Iwouldsuggest oraskyouto1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 suggest thatreally urgethemayor,HR director ,BA,fromsigning anycontract with Highmark oranyotherpartythatcan'tgive ussignificant timetables andsignificant contracts.Again,finally ,haveweobtained quotes fromotherinsurance carriers within thearea. SoIknowI'mkindofjumbled here, butreally thiswasaspurofthemoment thingformetocome,butIreally dothink it'sanextremely important think.My homework isself-funded,andIquestion ed somebody fromNewJersey andalsothe California gentleman ,withacompany asbig astheCityofScranton youhavetogoto self-funded.Itismorecosteffective to doitthatway,butnowwiththisHighmark issueinthepicture ,whichtheUniversity ofPittsburgh hadtheirissues withitandI thinkreally,again,itsomething forthe statelegislature ,Ithinkthatwe--you really needtotakeaquickcloselookand havesomeone fromHighmark --thecityis probably oneoftheirbiggest accounts ,soI thinkitwouldbehoovetheHighmark1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 administration toreally pinpoint andset thisup,youknow,whattheircost reimbursement isbecause Iknowforsure, andI'msurethatyougentleman wouldnever wantaninsurance executive totellyouwhat testyoucantake,whatdoctor youcansee, whatyourquality ofcareshould be.

Thecomments thatweremadethis evening aboutthepedestrian problems inthe CityofScranton showed theirheadagain together whenanother pedestrian wasstruck onLackawanna Avenue andPennAvenuetoday. OnceIheardaboutthisIimmediately contacted MayorCourtright whocontacted ChiefGraziano andwediscussed the immediate needforastudyofthecrosswalks indowntownScranton .Partsofthestudy, also,wouldhavetobetocontact PennDOT as wellbecause someofthecrosswalksare maintained bythestateandsomeofthemare theresponsibility ofthecity,butthisis something thatwearegoingtohavetogeta handle onbecause it'sjusthappening way toooften.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 Ioccasion allywalkindowntown Scranton ,also,andtomethetraffic --the crosswalksareconfusing tomeaswell,so wedoneedanupgradeonthat.

Ihavesentnumerous correspondence tothemayor'soffice without anyreply.I continue toaskaboutthisbecause Ithink it'sextremely important ,especially aswe arequickly approaching budget time.The mayorextended thesecontracts forfour1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 yearsandtouted thattheywouldsavethe taxpayers asignificant amount ofmoney.I justwanttoseewherethesavings are.So hopefully nextweekwewillgetsomekindof response fromthemayor.
