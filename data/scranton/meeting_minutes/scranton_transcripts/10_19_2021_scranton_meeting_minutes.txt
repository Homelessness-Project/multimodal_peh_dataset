COMPOSITE PENSION BOARD MEETING AGENDA THAT WILL BE HELD OCTOBER 20, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just want to make two comments . First of all, we have the minutes from the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority meeting that was held September 2nd on the agenda tonight . I want to thank Bob Shoemaker and Tim Woody who have resigned from the board. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 They did a wonderful job. And I know we thank this board and the volunteers up there led by Bob Gattens a lot. If you look at the backup, they have listed all of the completed projects in the park by Jerry Smurl and volunteers . I won't go through all of them. But it's an -- they do -- are doing an unbelievable job up there. And it is all volunteer work, their own time, mostly their own equipment in conjunction with the parks and recreation department and the employees . So I just want to thank them. Even the simple act of getting rid of some of the weeds and the brush up there has made the park look better -- so much better in a lot of different spots. So I want to say thank you again to them. Anyone else have any comment s on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have one. There's going to be a Lackawanna County Job Fair taking place next Thursday , October 28th from 12 to 4 p.m. It's free and open to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 public. And it will be at the PNC Field up on Montage Mountain Road. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Before I call the first speaker , I noticed that there's quite a few people here tonight that may be new to speaking at Council meeting s. So I just want go over some of the rules. First, you have five minutes to speak. When you come up to the podium, please state your first and last name and where you live. You do have to be a Scranton resident to speak at Council meetings . You'll notice that there is a clock there that will count down from five minutes . And it will blink I think at a minute to let you know that your time is coming to a close. Also, please keep to things that are related to City business and agenda items. The first speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . So what's the deal on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 audit? MR. DONAHUE : The update I got this morning was it was the same as last week. We're waiting for the Sewer and Redevelopment Authority audits that have to be included in the audit. MS. HODOWANITZ : There's a saying in the Army, second verse same as the first which reminds me of the discussion s we've been having on the Home Rule Charter . Can you tell me -- can anybody tell me when the charter was written that we are operating under right now? When was it written ? MR. GAUGHAN : I want to say 1972 or '73. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I don't think that charter was written with the 21st century in mind. It certainly predates the information age. Do you think back in '72 they could have envisioned having employees work remotely from home? I don't think so. I'm not necessarily concerned about whether we need to get rid of the strong Mayor-Council type government . But I am concerned that we're working with a document 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 that's upwards of 50 years old. And there are a lot of things in there that need to be tweaked . One is the audit which is suppose d to be completed by May 31st every year. And you know how often that's been done in the last 20 years. Okay. The other one I used to complain about was residency requirements . I complained a long time about Mr. Bulzoni . But I will say this. Maybe we need to relook at that require ment. Maybe it's sufficient that City employees pay the wage tax. I mean, there's got to be a lot of City employees who are not property owners. So they're not paying property tax. But they reside within the City. Just think, you know, here you have mayor -- Mayor Courtright who is a City resident paying City taxes. Look how he turned out. Then you have to Mr. Bulzoni who was not a City resident and he was probably one of the best business administrators we ever had. That is a lot within that document that needs to be relooked without necessarily changing the structure of government .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 So I would strongly advise you not to dismiss the concerns out of hand. Also, in listening to the caucus this evening , one of the things that disturbs me is in the military we're very good about detailing job descriptions for every person in the military . In your performance evaluation every year, you know, they look at that job description . And that's how you're evaluated . It has to be measurable achievements , not well, you know, I run "X" department and that's my job description . If we went to HR, I mean, how many job descriptions would we see? If we're going to add a new person on the 2022 budget, the job description should be written first not after the fact. So there is a lot of work that needs to be done there. Also, I heard Mr. Deeley mention about using Bedrock to train personnel . I mentioned this many years ago and I still believe it's true. Your local colleges like the University of Scranton could have been training your IT personnel , your people working in finance , up in the BA's office for auditing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 and that kind of thing in lieu of paying taxes. You know, we just kind of written off that possibility . So it's nice that Bedrock would train our personnel . But it's something that -- I mean, we could have handled that -- we should have been handling that across the City taking advantage of all of these educational institutions we have. And finally I was happy to see that Channel 16 covered the renovations to City Hall. But I remind you as you do the future budgets that what we need is just not a one time capital improvement project but long-term maintenance on every building and every vehicle the City owns. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Frank Sluzis. ATTY. SLUZIS: Honorable members of the Council , I thank you for allowing me to speak. I am an attorney that represents some of the industry hospital ity industry members here in the City of Scranton that hold in particular liquor licenses . And I'm here -- MR. GAUGHAN : Could you state your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 full name for the record, sir? ATTY. SLUZIS: Yes, I am sorry. My first name is Frank, last name Sluzis, S-L-U-Z-I-S. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. ATTY. SLUZIS: I am an attorney out of Harrisburg , Pennsylvania specializing in the hospitality industry , hospital ity law, particularly liquor law and liquor law issues. I'm here to speak in support . I noticed there is a motion coming up later on in your business about authorizing the City to exempt or opt out the -- what we call Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board noise ordinance . That's 493 Subsection 34. Just in general , that subsection says that any amplified sound that could be heard off of a license e's property line is subject to a citation or that particular section of Liquor Code. Now 493.1 of the Liquor Code and Section 5.32 of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board regulations allow a municipality like the City of Scranton to opt out and substitute for Subsection 34, its own noise ordinance if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 City has one. I urge you to adopt the motion because in the past several years, especially with the pandemic , the hospital ity industry has been hurting . Prior to the pandemic years, municipalities across the state have done just this, opted out, exempted itself from the noise ordinance of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and has been quite successful in bringing back the industry , the entertainment industry , hospitality industry . This past almost two years has been the death toll for many, many restaurant s whether regardless if they hold a liquor license or not. It was hard to -- with the mandate and the pandemic and the Governor 's orders, you need something to bring this back, bring this back to -- the industry back to a healthy stance again. And I do believe that this is a mechanism to do that. I know there are several members of the industry here that have come to support this motion that will be discussed anyway I would think later on this evening . And they said certain municipalities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 that I know of, it's been very successful , City of Harrisburg , City of -- and Dauphin County obviously , City of Pottsville and Schuylkill County -- sort of your neighbor , Borough of Highspire in Dauphin County. And it could be structured any way that Council sees fit. I've seen ordinance -- I don't know what the City's ordinance says with respect to noise. But the most successful ones that I've seen have been sort of decibel level and can be enforced through its zoning or code enforcement officials , city police. I think that the more that I see really from the Administrative Code enforcement side instead of the -- because I'm sure the City of Scranton Police Department , you know, has other things on their plate much more important than going around and measuring decibel levels. So I urge you to help out the industry . It is truly, truly on its last gasp. And from my past experience even prepandemic , I've seen that this is such a way to bring that back -- to bring the people back into the City, into the town, into the various municipalities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 (inaudible ) this wonderful woman here talking about taxes. The economy , the local economy can really get a boost of people coming in and spending money here albeit food, albeit alcohol , albeit (inaudible .) Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. The next speaker is Jessica Osborne . ATTY. HAYES: Council President ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: The stenographer just wanted me to remind every speaker to speak into the microphone in order for her to transcribe their testimony . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, yeah. You were drifting off a little bit. That's okay. Go ahead. Thank you. MS. OSBORNE : Thank you. Good evening City Council members . My name is Jessica Osborne . And I live at 1348 Sanderson Avenue. And I have been there for the last 24 years. Just this past Thursday night our zoning official s approved rezoning a residential area to a light industrial zone for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 a microbrewery , a business that intends to have 30 patrons taste testing, live music, occasion al food trucks, local deliveries to and from the brewery , a storefront with a to go -- four packs to go, three employees , three co-owners with only parking for eight cars. I -- where is this overflow going to go on Sanderson and Glenn Street where I live? I rely on street parking . I do not have a driveway . Most of the resident s that live there do not. I have signatures here among myself for people who are asking you guys to give us permit parking similar to those by Marywood University and the park and the jail where the brewery currently is. I would just like to say I would urge you to seriously consider this and would ask the same courtesy . The audacity that the brewery had put on their Facebook page to say that they loved our neighborhood is not what the resident s or I feel matches their approach or what they want the public to see. It is not neighborly . And it is inconsider ate to ask the resident s to give up their neighborhood parking so that a business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that was rezoned could go there and take over the street for their patrons . Along with this, there needs to be more safety measure s in place at the intersection of Sanderson and Glenn Street. Currently , there is a only 3-way stop sign, stop signs that no one stops at. People fly up and down that street. I have video proof of this from just one day. On top of every day heavy traffic , City buses up and down all day long, there is a large amount of truck traffic from 18 wheelers , dump trucks, heavy equipment and wide loads, not to mention the extra amount of traffic that happens when Green Ridge is flooded . Trucks from Keystone Blocks making the turn from Sanderson to Glenn and vice versa that occasionally knocks over the stop sign. It is a dangerous turn, one that needs to have no trucks allowed . It is zoned as a light residential . All behind on Glenn Street and Albright Ave., and Nay Aug Ave., are light industrial . Why aren't those trucks taking those roads? My family and I have lost one car 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 that was complete ly hit and totaled , two cars that had damages $5,000 or more, lost countless mirrors . And all this was while the cars were parked on the street. And I'd like to remind you that these are all incidents that are happening now before the microbrewery comes in there. It is not pedestrian friendly or safe. You fear for your life just crossing the street hoping they're going to slow down and actually stop at the stop sign. There needs to be something done with the traffic safety and truckloads in that area. Since parking is already a huge issue, I implore you to please consider permit parking for us residents on Sanderson Avenue. Thank you for your time and your thoughtful consideration in this pressing matter. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Miss Osborne , thank you for coming tonight . Do you have a petition ? Did you already get a petition filled out? Okay. Great. Okay, thank you. Can you give that to Miss Carrera and then leave your number with Miss Carrera as well and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Mr. Voldenberg will be in touch with you because we'll submit that to the police department and the city engineer . And then there's a whole process that they have to go through . And then you'll get communication on whether or not they approve it or deny it. Okay? MS. OSBORNE : Yeah. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. MS. OSBORNE : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : The next speaker is Maury Guse. MS. GUSE: My first name is Maury -- MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I apologize . MS. GUSE: That's okay. It's M-A-U-R-Y, Guse, G-U-S-E. I live at 1348 Sanderson Avenue. That's my daughter Jessica . Again, you know, we have the issue with the parking . It's -- and I have a handicap in front of my home because I am handicapped . You know, I pay the $10 to have that there. So if they're going to have this microbrewery across the street, you know, like we said 30 people he has for parking . There's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 not enough parking for 30 people. So I can't leave my home. I'm going come and find that, well, you know, it's a city street. There's nothing we can do with the handicap parking . Anybody with a handicap can park there. So I have to then walk a block to, you know, wait until he closes at 9:00? We're just asking for, you know, residential , the permit parking , you know, on the 1348 side of Sanderson . There is also a home next door to where he wants to go. You know, there's houses. There's not parking on Glenn Street either. I don't know where they think -- because the railroad tracks are there. I don't know where this parking is coming from. So, you know, we're just asking that you give us that consideration . And again, you know, the stop sign, the traffic , you know, you could even write the word stop. Paint the word stop. Put crosswalk s in. Put something on the stop signs. They come flying through . Like we said, we lose that stop sign at least once a month. We've gone out ourselves and put it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 back up, you know, then they just come flying. You know, you have Scranton Lace that's working down there, the brick company . You have a warehouse . They're all coming up on Sanderson to get over to Green Ridge to get over, you know. Like, it would be nice if something was done that somebody could look and see and -- traffic . You have Scranton Prep, kids that practice there. You have their parents that are parking . It becomes a one-way street. You have 18 wheelers trying to come around this corner. So, you know, we're just asking for the consideration with the microbrewery that, you know, we have parking for our residents . You know, you have them in other spots. Like we said, it was across from where he's coming now. We're just looking for that for us. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And I will have Mr. Voldenberg reach out to the police department , DPW, our City engineer to assess that area for potential improvements to safety. And then we will send the petition to the appropriate people and get the process 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 started . MS. GUSE: Now, with this handicap parking though, will that -- like I said, what am I suppose d to do when somebody parks there? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, well, the only recourse that you would have there is if someone parked in your spot that did not have a handicap placard . MS. GUSE: Right. Exactly . I understand that but if someone has a handicap plate and then they're going to go across the street and they're going to go for this taste testing -- MR. GAUGHAN : Unfortunately you're out of luck there, yeah. I've been down this road with several people. MS. GUSE: So that's why I'm asking for the permit parking for that side so that, you know, I do have -- you know -- MR. GAUGHAN : No, I totally -- MS. GUSE: -- to park in front of my home. MR. GAUGHAN : I understand . Unfortunately though as you're aware, if because you have the handicap parking spot in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 front of your home, if a resident were to come with a handicap placard , they could legally park in your spot and not be in any trouble . MS. GUSE: Even if there is permit parking for that side? MR. GAUGHAN : So if it was permit parking and they parked there and didn't have the permit parking sticker or whatever it is, they could potentially be in trouble . MS. GUSE: So that's why we're looking . MR. GAUGHAN : But the permit parking is not guaranteed . This has to go through . MS. GUSE: No, I understand . MR. GAUGHAN : Right. MS. GUSE: We're just asking, you know, because they plan on, you know, doing this brewery . I believe in the paper it was saying they're looking for March of 2022 of next year. So, you know, it's -- you know, we're looking for something to happen very soon. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Yes. We'll be in touch. Our office will be in touch with you once we get the report back from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 appropriate departments , okay? MS. GUSE: Would I be able to leave my name and number with this -- also -- okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Certainly . Yes, please do. Thank you so much. MS. GUSE: Thank you so much. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The next speaker is Richard Laurito . MR. LAURITO : Rich Laurito , South Webster Avenue, Scranton . Bill, I have a question for you. Was there any report on the facade, the right of the Lackawanna -- the old Lackawanna Station ? MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, the wall at the Radison , yes. Actually , so I did talk to Brian Jeffers , the Chief of Staff for the County. So the -- there was a grant awarded. The County was the entity that was submitting -- we were submitting the grant on behalf of the City. So they were working together . We were awarded the grant right before the pandemic hit -- I think was in the amount of somewhere of $350,000. Then the pandemic happened obviously . So things slowed down. We're in contact now with City officials to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 find out and the Radison to find out where this project is going and what's going to happen next. So there was an effort. I know Senator Blake was involve d when he was in office to work to get funding to fix that whole wall and make it look like, you know, respectable . It looks terrible now. So I'm waiting to hear back from City officials . But there is a discussion about it. MR. LAURITO : Okay. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. LAURITO : How about that short stretch of Stafford Avenue between Davis Street and the post office? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, so we sent that to DPW Director Preambo . And he did get back to us and tell us that he was taking that under advisement for the next round of paving. So they were going to go out and inspect the area and potentially put it on the paving list. MR. LAURITO : Okay. Thank you. In the fall of 2020, I was watching the news and I saw where a whole bunch of Donald Trump support ers were basically trying to disrupt Joe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Biden speaking in Mountain Top, Pennsylvania . I thought it was a disgrace to act that way in our democracy . I have been following Donald Trump for 35 years before he got involve d in the election of 2016. I didn't really care for him all that time. I hoped for the best for him when he became president . I hope he made the right decisions . But in my mind time after time he flaunted our norms and he made the wrong decisions . But if he came to Scranton I still would not go and protest against him because he has the right to speak. It's a free country . I don't think that people should be harassed when they are on the campaign trail by detractors . I'm just hoping that when President Biden comes to the City people will have the decency to honor our president who was born and raised until the age of 10 in this City. He did not abandon the City. His parents said we're moving to Delaware . And at 10 years old, you don't say to your parents , no, we're not moving to Delaware . And he has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 always come back here. He has been a great friend to this City and a great asset to this City. I'm a proud Scranton ian. I'm here for the betterment of the City. My only -- the reason for coming to these meeting s to try to make the City a better place. I'm very proud of it. I have friends that come in from Erie a lot and they just absolutely love the City. We have here what Erie doesn't have. We have a gorgeous downtown . The architect is beautiful downtown. And I just want to try to make it just a little bit better. You know, the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro said I don't have enough hate in -- I don't have enough hate inside of me to be a democrat . I think that is projection . I think that's when you're trying to throw something at somebody else, put that title or that tag on somebody else when it's really you that has that inside of you. I'm hoping that we have no protest when our president comes for the unveiling of Biden Street and the expressway . I think it would be a negative for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 the City to have that happen. And I hope the people who don't support the president will just be civil and be decent and honor him in being here. He is our native son. He deserves that much. Thank you very much. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The next speaker is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I seem to always come back to an old subject . You know, I keep these little folders in a cabinet and this one is marked parking . So since I had spoken at City Council in the past, it was with great interest that I read the article in the October 14th Scranton Times paper by Jim Lockwood. Parking Authority members say street garage rates too high. I said, oh, that's interesting because I have to agree. I was able to look at the material I had from previous discussions . And the material supplied to me by you, Councilman Gaughan , was not -- I don't throw it away. I keep it in my folders because I know it's going to come back again for me to refer to.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 One of the things that I saw in there was it list the current rate and the new rate. And it listed it for 2020 current rates. It looks like this. Current rates for the rate structure . So when they were talking about the, you know, not having the rates increase at the kiosks and the parking garages I thought there's a done deal I thought to myself because somewhere along the way there must be a 2021 rate schedule . I didn't get a chance to look on the website to see if it's available to the public. And when I say that, it's not only to me. I park in downtown . I never know whether the kiosk is going to take a credit card, my debit card or if it's going to take quarters . So I have this little container , a Tupperware contain er that I put all my quarters in and I keep it upside down in my car because I never know which kiosk is going to take what which is a big fallacy as to the operation of those kiosks. So recently the article talked about the Parking Authority Board. I thought what the devil is that? Parking Authority Board on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 the information that I still have it talked about the Community Development Properties in Scranton and corporate which is a seven board -- member board, four members from the NDC and three from the City of Scranton . So when I read it, it said board Chairman Alex Malfetas and Micah Woodward are members of that board. And I thought -- I kept thinking what board are they talking about? Are they talking about this Scranton Parking Authority or are they talking about this Community Development Property of Scranton or is it all the same? So I thought to myself, I said, I'm confused and I've been following this NDC corporation and how the money comes from the kiosk -- and what does the general public out there know and how are we to keep things straight as to what's going on with these kiosks. And maybe it's just me that I didn't understand what the -- the difference between the two. My hats off to Mr. Malfetas and Micah Woodward . If they could do anything about those -- keeping rates from going up at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the parking kiosks, you know, my hats off to them. All of us in the City would love for those rates not to go up. I use them a lot. And it only benefits the City for us to come downtown and shop in town where there are some stores. I love Spruce Street, those little shops along there and along Washington Avenue. And I don't know that little side street. But if you're going to always be wondering do I have my quarters , do I have my debit card, what am I going to use; so I'm just hoping that something can be done and that they are successful in their quest. And for parking tickets, that's another thing. It's $35 because I got one and it's a $3 processing fee. Well, I scoured all of this paperwork that I have here. And I scoured the online site trying to see if there is some place I could go and pay for my $35 because I was wrong. I didn't put enough money in the meter but I really objected to the $3 processing fee. But it didn't seem I could go anywhere to pay that. So that is some of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 things that this Scranton Parking Authority whoever they are and this Community Development Properties of Scranton Corporate with the seven board members really need to look into that because we're the people who are trying to shop downtown . And it's costing us more than some items we buy, you know? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And, Mr. Voldenberg , correct me if I'm wrong, but the gentlemen from this company are coming November 2nd, I think? MR. VOLDENBERG : November 2nd, Mr. Gaughan , yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. November 2nd, the gentlemen from the parking operation will be in here. They usually give us a quarterly update. MS. JEFFRIES : From NDC? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, from NDC. Okay? Thank you. The next speaker is Karen Dukerich . I apologize if I mispronounce your last name. MS. DUKERICH : You were close. My name is Karen Dukerich . And I'm a resident of City of Scranton . I live back in the Keyser Valley section of West Scranton . There is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 bar next to my mother's that there has been complaints about the music. Now, if anybody at all should complain about the music, it should be myself. Okay, the bar -- I sit on the porch with my mom. My mother has dementia , okay, that man plays oldies music. He plays all of this -- it's nice music. It's what you could understand . We all enjoy it. You know, my mom sits on the porch. She listens . And he is so respectful that he came to my mom's house and asked is the music too loud. And it's not. If you came -- you could come to my mother's house anytime. You could sit in my mother's house and you could hardly hear it. When you sit -- my mother's kitchen is in the back of the house. When you sit there you really can't hear at all. And I promise you I'm not exaggerating . If you sit in her living room which is in front of the house, you can't even hear the music. We enjoy it. The neighbors next door, there's an apartment building . They enjoy it. The people that go in and out of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 there are very, very respect ful. It's families . It's not just people going in there, you know, to have a drink. It's a restaurant . He made it so beautiful next door to our home. Again, my mom lives there but I stay with her. So his one promise was the music will be done at 10:00. And it's done. On Sundays when he has it, I'm probably going to be wrong here. He said the music will probably -- no, not probably . It would be until 6:00. 6:00 it's done. It doesn't matter if there is anybody at the place or not. It's always done. He's always been very respectful . He's been very respectful of my mother. He's been respect ful of the neighbors . Again, we sit in my mother's yard and listen to the music. We don't have to pay for nothing . Do you understand what I mean? It's not that I'm standing here sticking up for him because I frequent the bar. I'm standing up for him because it's so nice. I grew up there. I'm 57 years old, okay, I grew up there. There was always a bar next door. Without -- how can I put this -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 without there being music at the bar from way back, the bar was louder then than it is now. And that's the honest to God's truth. So if there is anything you could do to help him it would be greatly appreciated . I, myself personally miss the music. Now, I live -- that's on Jackson Street. It's a dead-end street. I live the next block up, okay. I can hardly hear the music. I would rather be sitting at my mom's house listening to it. It is enjoyable. And again, I grew up with noise my whole life living there. So to have a little bit of music, it's nice. You know, tell me when you're sitting at home or in your car if you're listening to music it relaxes you. It makes you feel good. Well, that's what this does. And to have anybody complain about the music being loud, again, any one of you up there, you could come to my mother's. I'll give you her address . Come and sit in the house. You could you hardly hear it. So if anybody in the neighborhood is going to complain , it would be us right next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 door. The only thing separating him and my mother's is a driveway . So if there is anything at all you could do to help him solve this problem with the music, I'll stand up for him and anything he tries to do because it's comfort . It's relaxing . It's, you know, sit back, relax and I don't know, enjoy the music. And I hope you understand that because it's not bothering anybody . If it's bothering anybody , it's that they have the problem , you know. It's not a problem with the music at all. Again, if it was music that you couldn't understand what they were saying, well, yeah, then I would probably complain . But he's very respectful and I really hope you could help him. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Next speaker is John Zelinski . MR. ZELINSKI : How are you doing? My name is John Zelinski . I'm a resident of Scranton , 1437 Fellows Street. And I also am the owner of Backstreets Tiki Bar, 2225 Jackson Street. I, along with 20-plus other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 restaurant and bar owners have put this petition in order to remove the noise ordinance out of the PLCB hands and place it back into the City's hands. We all pay an annual entertainment tax to the City in order to provide entertainment for our patrons . I, myself have always followed the local noise ordinance which I was zoned in for. I actually cut my music off at the correct time which you just heard. I'm always looking out for my neighbors . The guidelines , in fact, the neighbors who have, in fact, have come in personally and offered to help me out and provide this order to bring back the entertain ment at my establishment . My establishment has held many fundraisers for local communities -- for the local community including our local veteran s, which I did last year. I was sad to say that I had to turn down the fundraiser for the veteran s this year because I was not allowed to have live music. So last year we raised over $2,300 during COVID. We had a drivethrough barbecue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 to go through . The City of Scranton let me shut down the street. We were selling tickets for the barbecue . We had Chris Shrive who was a local veteran country music singer. We had EJ the DJ. We had the Wanabees . We had all different kinds -- we had the B-Street band come up here. And raised over $2,300 for our local veterans . I'm sad to say that I wasn't able to do that this year because of this ordinance that is in place. That's why I'm here to change this. However , it's impossible to do this because there is no time limits with the PLCB. I am zoned in currently from the zoning meeting to have music. I even backed it down to 9:00 for the neighbor s during week. It's 11:00. I said 10:00 on the weekend s for the neighbors . 10:00, that's more than fair. And they agree. But according to the PLCB, liquor control board there is no time. You cannot even have music playing at 1:00 in the afternoon which is unfair. It's a local establishment like me and all the other ones 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 that signed this. If you stand outside your property line and they hear music, you get fined. And music can't stop over the property line. You try to keep it fair as she said before with the noise and keep it down, keep it within the ordinances . All I'm trying to do is follow the City ordinance which I was zoned in for and do what you guys allowed me to do, the City and provide nice entertainment , a nice family restaurant . We're closed early. 11:00 on the weekend s we're out of there. During week -- I'm just trying to do the right thing for the City here too. For myself, I'm a single dad raising two young boys. Anybody who comes to me -- we've been doing funerals there, fundraisers, any kind of graduation parties , a lot of good positive stuff to bring back their Backstreets . When you have a graduation party, I'm sure you want to have a DJ. When you win an election party, they have the music, talk over the loudspeaker . It's illegal to talk over the loudspeaker to go over the -- that has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 to stop. So I'm asking -- I'm begging you to take this into consideration for not only myself, all the other local restaurant s and bars in Scranton here to get this law changed , move forward to follow the law that you guys put in place for me. MR. GAUGHAN : I have a question for you, Mr. Zelinski . First, thanks for coming to speak tonight . So if someone complains , you know, you're following the law that you are zoned in as you stated from the City's perspective . When someone calls to complain , what happened when the PL -- what happens next? Do you get fined or what -- MR. ZELINSKI : They were calling the Scranton Police numerous times. Scranton Police, they have a letter there that you guys have that I am zoned in with the City. Scranton Police took this. They stopped taking the calls. They said unless you play music outside after 10:00, do not bother calling us. We're not going to come there. He's obeying the City ordinance . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 He's doing the law. So I haven't been doing that. So they did stop coming there. The issue is, if you call the PLCB, you don't even know they're there. They come in. You get a letter that states that they were here from this day and this date and they heard music over the property line on this date there. And I didn't even know who came in or who was there or nothing . I did receive a letter and a fine. MR. GAUGHAN : And a fine. How much is the fine? MR. ZELINSKI : $250. And it keeps going as you keep going up there. We're in the process of talking with my attorney to fight the fines with the PLCB. But it's just -- it's not fair to have -- even if it's 1:00 in the afternoon , I'm going play music. I mean, the loudspeakers over the -- for the games next door for the kids are louder, you know? MR. GAUGHAN : Right. Okay. Thank you very much for coming tonight . MR. ZELINSKI : I appreciate it. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 speaker is Barbara Cook. MS. COOK: My name is Barbara Cook. I live back in Keyser Valley and back there probably for 45 years. And I'm here for John. We do not hear any of the music at all. The neighbors that lived across the street, when he told me there was noise, I said, oh, you mean across the street? They had -- they would come in with cars that -- beemers and everything else and they would put speakers on top of their cars and play their radio and you were vibrating in the house. And that's what I thought the complaint was. Him, no. We've had fundraisers . As a matter of fact, I was just with my grandson and my family. They had a fundraiser for the West Scranton Invader Wrestling Club. I could take my grandchildren there. And like I said, I know John for a long time, probably since he's a little boy. He was very good friends with my son Tommy. He passed away about five years ago. And John has come up to our house. He knows my husband needs open heart surgery . He comes up, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 brings us things if we needed. His arms are always around me, take it easy, Mrs. Cook. You could do this. I have been doing this for a long time, taking care of my son. The other two are good. But like I said, John, he's an asset. And what he did down there is absolutely beautiful . You could hear the music from the little league field when they play the music for the little guys to play football . I love listening to that. But we don't hear John. Like I said, the neighbor , yeah. It doesn't bother us. It's nice like Karen said to be out there. We're a little village back there, Keyser Valley. And when John asked me to speak it was not a problem . I know him forever . He was at our pool as my boys grew up and probably half of you might even know them. Do they, John? I don't even know. But I'm proud of where I live and proud of who I am. And I'm proud of him. He became something . I watched him grow. I watched him graduate , walk off the stage. Things I hope like that could happen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 again. And to destroy what he -- we walked in the place. It was so beautiful . I mean, what he did in there was -- it was like you were on vacation . You were on an island. I felt like I was on an island because we haven't been able to take a vacation . And he stopped at my house today. I said I'll be there. I'm all scruffy . But I told him, I said, we just got a puppy. We just adopted a dog. He's one year old. And I said early this morning I'm trying to chase the dog. Now I keep a leash on him. But the yard is fenced. But again, please help John. We don't want to see him have to go. He has children . And for anybody not to care about kids is beyond me. I thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. That exhausts the sign-in sheet. Would anybody else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Oak Avenue, Minooka . In looking at the proposal last week the information on a third class city. It called back me going to a commission report from 1973. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 And one of the comments in there was referring to only the third class city code. In the event that the city reverts to third class city, the initial form of government would be a commission form. Commissioner (inaudible ) asked why. And Mr. O'Connell responded because that is the way the third class city code reads. The next step in a third class city code is then to create a commission . Just as this commission exists, you would then have the option of selecting a councilmanic form of government commissioned government or a mayor-council form of government . I'm not sure if that has been updated or changed . But it is something of concern that if we go to a third class city at the point that we move into that, the Mayor and Council may no longer effectively exist. And we'd be going into a commission to again decide. Just a point for thought . You also had mention ed last week why people had -- wanted to change the Home Rule Charter . What were some of the issues that might have been involved in it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 One is approval by cowardice . The normal branch of government which this mimics is the legislative and the executive branch in the federal government . In the federal government , when a bill -- an ordinance goes to the mayor or president to sign, there are three options. Options is approval , veto, or in the federal government , a pocket veto. In the city government , we have approval by cowardice . Instead of a pocket veto, we have a pocket approval where the Mayor can sit on something for a period of time. It expires and automatically is approved as law. Obviously , the reason for this is they could then say I didn't vote for this. I never signed it. It just happened. If there is something that is going to put something into law, it should be changed where it should be a yes, not an acceptance by avoidance . Act 511, we talk -- because we're a Home Rule Charter , we're not bound by Act 511. In the original documents it talked about that. And it also talked about possibility of following Act 511 and putting any extra 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 expenditures to a referendum by the people. That's something to consider . Violation s of charters , when a government body or person or body violate s the government al charter , there seems to be no direct implications , a stern letter. But it could happen over and over again without any implication s to the people who have violated the charter . Budget changes , I'd love to see the budget being mandated to be supplied to you by September 1st complete so that the community and the Council has months to review audit and look at what's there. By having it at the last minute, it becomes a rush every single year of we have three sessions left to approve it so we can't look at it because we have to get it done. That's a disservice to the community , disservice to everyone who wants to look at that budget itself. In lieu of taxes distribution , when it gets targeted to specific neighborhoods and not fairly among all of them. Financial collection numbers , that we have finance s that are reported on that somehow we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 inconsistencies repeatedly from finances that come to this body. Is there no resolution for someone who is not competent enough to double-check the numbers for their job? If they cannot control the numbers supplying to the body, how can they control the numbers for the City? If they cannot do that, how do we get rid of them because obviously they are not qualified or not doing their job. I'll leave it at that because there's a lot more to say. But that's just a bite of what we would want to look at changing for the Home Rule Charter , some of the structural foundations in this government to make account ability viable for everyone . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I am glad there's going to be some discussion on 5-C because I tried to read that today, and I could not make a lot of sense out of it. And the usual boilerplate that is behind was not there. So I'm looking forward to what it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 actually does. And to tell Joan that the Sewer Authority at their last meeting did agree to sign a contract with an audit -- for an audit. So that is underway . At least that one is. I'm going to start now with the things that have been after my time is up. So about five weeks ago I asked about the collection of the delinquent refuse fees by Portnoff . And you said we could get them. But I have not seen anything yet. Can you tell me during Fifth Order when we are going to get those numbers ? MR. GAUGHAN : Um hum, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. And then Scranton Tomorrow , I go by the -- that Pocket Park twice at least every week. And it appears to be stalled . And it seems to me there's been a lot longer of a pause on Scranton Tomorrow coming in and giving a report than there used to be. So I wonder if it's really stalled or what's going on down there. Is it going to move forward again? And I'm still curious about whether or not that -- what was being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 worked on there had something to do with the evacuation of the federal building even though it was brief. I would like to know that just because I'm curious . Now, this afternoon -- well, actually yesterday I was looking through something and I thought , gee, it's getting close to the 15th of November and we'll be getting a budget. And last year's budget for this year was filled with a lot of things because there was so much change that was happening in that. So I went to go back and look. And in -- I did find in there that there was one section on page 21 I think perhaps where they said they had a compilation of grants that had been asked for but not determined yet and ones that have been won, etc. And the SAFER Grant was in the one that had been -- had been waiting . So I thought , well, okay, I'm going to go back to the 2019 -- some of the 2019 agendas and see if that was ever brought before Council . Well, first, I couldn't get through and I don't know -- I couldn't get through on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 the past business -- past meetings . Then I tried later. I got through on them but when I got to the -- to actually looking at one just from 2019 it said something like, sorry, this page -- this material is not available . So I don't know what IT is doing but it's very frustrating when you don't have a lot of time and you keep getting -- running into brick walls. And you don't know when it's going to happen. So I think IT really needs to get their act together . And is there an end date for when this new software is going to be 100 percent in effect? Again, if you know that I would like to hear about that in Fifth Order. And then the other thing that's on the City's website is integrity and transparency . The failure to distribute the ARF funds made the capital budget null and void. And I'm hoping that doesn't go over into the operating budget. But that needs to happen. I don't know why the mayor, the administration is not making that distribution , just plugging it in every time you need money. And so I look forward to that happening soon. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else in the audience like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MS. SCHUSTER : Just a couple comment s. We asked about a personnel report last week. Mr. Voldenberg , did we get any updates on a personnel report or if we would be receiving one of those? MR. VOLDENBERG : The request was made, Mr. Schuster , but no report as yet. MS. SCHUSTER : All right. Can we possibly add -- could we also add City job descriptions to that with the presentation we just got from the IT Department maybe specifical ly those job descriptions . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll add them tomorrow . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Also Third Order, we got correspondence about the stop sign removal and -- over in Green Ridge. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Can we, maybe, put that in Third Order for next week? And I'd like to thank the DPW for adding the crosswalk at Woodlawn and North Washington Street. And there was also -- I got a citizen 's complain t today from the 1600 block of Hawthorne which I'll follow up with you after the meeting , Mr. Voldenberg . That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : A few. So in recent weeks we brought up the issue with the truck traffic in the Bellevue section of West Side and the ordinance that is suppose d to prevent it. So we were back and forth with some dialogue between the various department s. And it was unclear , I mean, there was a gentleman -- an officer that retired that, you know, was certified in the weights and measures . So last week we heard that no one else is and the training 's in the spring. So I want to report out that -- because we inquire d 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 about the Sheriff 's Department maybe helping us out with that. So I received today -- so I want to report out some more information . So this is from the Police Chief and I want to thank him because he's always very quick with a response , the inquiries that I have on behalf of citizens . So the Sheriff 's Department is not able to perform these types of details. Okay, we know that. The SPD has several officers trained in weights and measures . So last week we heard there was none. So this is good news and that he'll be coordinating with shift supervisors to keep the truck details going in Bellevue . So I'm glad to report that out. I'm sure that the Bellevue people will be happy to hear that. Go ahead. MS. SCHUSTER : Do we know when Officer Guida's last day is going to be? MR. MCANDREW : Last week. I think it was last week. MS. SCHUSTER : I think there were some citations issued. And I'm not sure he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 would be showing up at the magistrate 's office to make sure that they are not thrown out. So maybe we could follow up with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay. So recently the Code Enforcement Department formed a committee . They met twice and, you know, did some brainstorming , collaboration , recommendation , which is good moving forward . But from the meetings , some questions have been posed to me because , you know, the meeting minutes are out there. And on behalf of them, I want to ask a question . So there is, you know, NEIC is a private contractor that does whatever we can't do, okay, in addition to our -- the code enforcement inspector . So the question posed to me is that we have a certified uniform BCO for mechanical on payroll . So we can, you know, we have one in house we can use. If so, this would definitely save money for the City and the people being inspected . If so, why isn't that employment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 being utilize d for such? Okay, can you please inquire about that to Mrs. Cipriani ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Let's see. And also, you know, while you're at it, can you please provide Council a copy of the NEIC contract also? That would be most helpful for the questions -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : -- I might get. Okay, and then, I also have a complaint . There is an abandon ed house on the 600 of Palm Street with junk cars with no license plate. So can we please send that over also to code enforcement ? And last May there was a great rollout with the Hometown Heros Program over in West Side. It was the pilot, which was great. It was a collaborative effort between Leadership Lackawanna which was one of their projects and NeighborWorks . But I have been receiving a bunch of complaints as the banners are not holding up too well. You know, most municipalities , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 they're up there for years and they look great. I mean, we know that this was a project with leadership Lackawanna . It was suppose d to be handed off. And it has been handed off. So it's handed off to NeighborWorks which eventual ly the West Scranton Neighborhood Group graciously took it upon themselves to continue this process . So my concern is the piloted banners that were rolled out under this, you know, collaborative effort, the responsibility maintain ing these. I mean, a couple times I called on behalf of owners of these -- or sponsors of these banners saying, you know, it's a hardware issue because some of them are falling down. The hardware holding them is, I guess is, you know, is cheaper than we probably should have used or some -- they look terrible . Some are torn, some are gone. And, you know, Veterans Day is coming up Thursday , November 11th. So can you please -- and I know Chris Smith was the contact with the Mayor's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 office. Todd Pousley is still involved in the transition . But we need to have -- take some responsibility of the ones that were rolled out as a pilot. So could you please share these concerns with Todd Pousley from NeighborWorks , Chris Smith from the Mayor's office. And let's see if we can get these fixed because they were installed by a contractor of the City in kind. But we need some followup on this because they don't look that great. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just have one update. Last week it was suggested in Citizens Participation that we have better communication with our state legislator s and I was in agreement with that. And so I've reached out to Representative Kyle Mullins who is happy to come in to speak with Council and to provide an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 update on what he's been doing and what's going on in the State Legislature -- at least the House of Representatives that could impact the City of Scranton . I know for me personally it's hard to stay up-to-date on state politics because we're very focused on the local here. But knowing that things happening on the state level certainly have an impact on us, I think it would be helpful for him to come in and provide that update. He represents the 112th District . That includes part of Scranton . There's also the 113th District for the state house and that seat current ly is up for a special election . And I'll also be reaching out to Senator Marty Flynn to see if he would like to come into also speak with Council . So I'll have that set up through Mr. Voldenberg to see when Mr. Mullins would be able to come in to speak with us. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Council Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly . Mr. Voldenberg , I've gotten some more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 complaints about the repair shop on the corner of the 1600 of South Webster and Palm Street. It had the tires in the backyard . But now there's cars that are parked on the sidewalks . They don't have any license plates on them. So would we be able to pass that along to Licensing , Inspections ? Also, I got a request for a stop sign at the corner of Wales and Durkin in North Scranton that I'll be passing along. And I've got a lot of complaint s about some alleys and courts and the condition of them in South Scranton . And I'll be talking to DPW Director Preambo about those in the next few days. And that's all I have for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Miss Schumacher , I don't believe that we received any report on the delinquent refuse fees from Portnoff . I know that we requested it. But, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could request that again? I would also be interested in seeing that. We sent question s about the SAFER Grant as well a few weeks ago. We haven't received anything on that. Although I did talk to the Mayor briefly about it. And the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 was granted I believe a 30-day extension on the grant. They were still discussing what to do with it. And finally I want to thank the DPW and Director Preambo for the quick action on the crosswalk at North Washington Avenue and Woodlawn Street. There was a gentleman last week that came with a petition and within a day or two, they were right out there and took care of it. So I want to thank the crew at DPW and Mr. Preambo for that. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION â€“ A RESOLUTION â€“ APPOINTMENT OF J.

Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION â€“ A RESOLUTION â€“ RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING CITY OF SCRANTON TO SEEK EXEMPTION FROM SECTION 4-493(34) OF THE LIQUOR CODE. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , Solicitor Hayes, before we have comment s on this, can you just take us through from start to finish how this legislation ended up on the agenda and then, you know, your involvement with it and just explain it to the public? ATTY. HAYES: Certainly . Section 49334 of the Liquor Code prohibits licensed liquor establishments from using or permitting loudspeaker s or similar devices to project the sound of music that would be heard beyond their property line. The Liquor Code also provide s that municipalities have the ability to exempt themselves from that provision of the Liquor Code with regard to noise. That has to be done through a resolution that would then be provide d to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and the Liquor Control board could then have -- will then have a hearing and entertain the resolution and either approve it, modify 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 it, or deny it. It's my understanding that several members of Council had been approached by owners of restaurants , bars, and taverns who have made investment s in outdoor dining and bar areas largely to address the social distancing and other government mandate s that arise from the COVID-19 pandemic in order to offer their patrons a more comfortable environment which is outside . They have reached out to Council members indicating that this provision of the Liquor Code essentially prohibits them from operating those outdoor dining and bar spaces because there is music in the outdoor space. So what they asked -- a dozen or so approached -- have submitted their recognition that they would like for the City of Scranton to follow the lead of other municipalities including Pottsville and Allentown who have exempted their municipality from the noise regulation contained in the Liquor Code. So essentially what this propose d resolution does is -- would allow the City of Scranton to be exempt from the noise 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 regulations in the Liquor Code and enforce its own noise ordinance for a period of one year. At the expiration of the one year, Council could either and the Mayor could either allow it to -- just allow it to expire or could renew it. My firm has reached out to the solicitors for Pottsville and Allentown , both of whom indicated that it's been a successful change to their -- the laws that govern their municipalities . So essentially , it's putting the local control over noise enforcement . Now because our City is situated where the bars and restaurant s are located within neighborhood s, there is no way for us to just identify a single business district or single district that would be exempt from the liquor code. So what's proposed is a citywide exemption from the noise regulation of the Liquor Code. And that's what's before Council for introduction here today. MR. GAUGHAN : So just so I'm clear on this, for those who may be watching at home that might think, okay, well, what if a bar or an establishment is actually playing music 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 outside of the limits or is playing it so loud that it is -- not in the case of -- that was present ed here tonight , but it is an actual hindrance to the neighborhood . Is it correct , Solicitor Hayes, that our police department would still be able to enforce our own laws so it's not like we're wiping it off the books and bars and restaurant s and establishes can do whatever they want? ATTY. HAYES: So the City has its own noise ordinance . And the police department and other code enforcement official s have been enforcing that for years. So that will continue . All this does is take the Liquor Control Board out of the enforcement process of noise violations because they are imposing a different standard than what the City official s are doing. You heard earlier today from an owner of a bar who has been granted permission by the Zoning Hearing Board to operate an outdoor bar and restaurant during certain periods of time. Well, that -- if the Liquor Control Board is contacted regarding that particular bar and they come to the property 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 line and they heard audible music, they can under their ordinance issue a fine or other penalty against that licensee even though that license e is in compliance with the City ordinances . So it's -- there's -- this is fostering contradictory laws which is causing problem s for the owners of the bars, taverns , and restaurant s in the City. So what we only -- we only ask for one year so we can see how it works and see how -- if it's problematic for the police department , if it's problematic for the residents then we can let it expire. But I think what I've heard from Council and from the Council members and elsewhere is that these business owners need assistance . They need help especially after what they've gone through in the last year and a half because of the pandemic . MR. GAUGHAN : In terms of next steps, so this is a resolution . So it will be on if it moves forward tonight and then next week will potentially be final passage . So if next week there are three votes and it passes, what are the next steps? When will it take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 effect? ATTY. HAYES: So now when the resolution is adopted or if the -- if and when the resolution is adopted , it is then sent to the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board who will schedule a hearing . I believe it's within 60 days. They will offer the opportunity for residents and business owners to voice their support or opposition to the proposed change, the proposed exemption from the Liquor Code. And then they will issue a decision . They could approve it or they could modify it. In other words, they could restrict our citywide exemption . They could -- they technically could limit the amount of time that we would be exempt from -- although I don't anticipate that that would be the case because we've put such a short timeframe on this exemption . So then after that, we would be exempt for their jurisdiction for purposes of noise only. You know, it's only with regard to noise violations . It's not with regard to any other violations of the Liquor Code. So in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 other words, you know, liquor license es still can't serve after hours. They can't -- they still can't serve minors. They still can't serve visibly intoxicated individual s. They're all -- those provisions remain in place. This is only with respect to noise violations . I think that was my cue to stop talking . MR. GAUGHAN : That was your cue. I think you explained it well. Okay. Any comment s from Council or -- on the question , yes, on the question . MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , I fully support this legislation . I worked in every sector in the hospitality industry over the course of my career. I sympathize . You guys are the hardest hit -- I believe the hardest hit with regard to the pandemic . So this legislation will provide realistic parameters , okay, to make sense. It's fair and equitable . Also, you know, out of necessity , outdoor venues were created last year. They're everywhere. So not being able to entertain your customer s that you had that were forced to eat outside , just doesn't make 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 any sense. So this is just a way to recoup some loses. I mean, it was a tough year for everybody . I get it but still believe hospitality were hit the hardest with this. So I'm fully support ing voting yes for this, the movement of this. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I would also like to add that I'm in support of this motion. Our local neighborhood bars are important to the City of Scranton , to businesses , to our economy . And I know I have a neighborhood bar just a few doors down from me. And they -- I know them to be very respectful and responsible owners. I would probably say the only issue is parking on the weekend s generally as far as a concern over in the Pine Brook neighborhood . But in terms of noise it's, you know, never been an issue for us. And I think as long as we're enforcing the ordinance that we have which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 fair with the times that are laid out in there and the decibels , and it's very specific for the guidelines -- for enforcement from the SPD, then I'm happy to vote for this to make it easier for bars to bring in customers and to have music and entertainment . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? On the question , you know, the current situation obviously is unreasonable . But the whole notion that you have businesses that have gone through terrible times during the pandemic and who have struggle d and the way that they try to recoup some of those losses is to have entertainment and, you know, eating and drinking outside . And then to turn around and penalize them for doing that it just doesn't make any sense. So I think that this action is reasonable . I don't think it ties the hands of our City police department in terms of dealing with the businesses not following the rules. So I will be voting in favor of it. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. READING BY TITLE - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 88, 2021 â€“ AN ORDINANCE â€“ AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND BEDROCK TECHNOLOGY A/K/A KEYSTONE TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING , LLC TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT SERVICES . MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I'm not totally sold on this contract yet. As we stated during the caucus, I really think we need to see the budget for the IT Department which it was promise d that we will see that before next week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 I am certainly not in any rush to approve this next week. I think depending on when we receive those figures , we can take our time with this. The budget, you know, we're not going to go get the budget until the middle of November . And this is going to be a major cost. Over a four year period we're talking about nearly a million dollars . Does it make sense? Yes, I think it makes sense. We obviously have had problems with the IT Department . Any other entity with many users has a third party vender for the most part unless you are going to hire more people and pay higher salary to the IT Director which has been discussed here before. What I'm interested in is what the department is going to look like. We went from three employees including a director to five employees . I'm not clear on -- and I should have asked but I completely forgot how many people are actually in the department right now. I know there is five positions . We do not have a director . I don't know if all the positions are filled yet. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 may only be three. So again, I'm not totally sold on this contract yet. I think we need to see in the big picture how it fits within the budget. But I will be voting yes to move it forward . And I think if we have to table it next week that's not a big deal. Anyone else on the question ? MS. SCHUSTER : On the question , I've expressed concern s in the past especially with this department . So I'd echo your concerns , Mr. Gaughan , some of the concerns we raised in caucus. And I do want to see the IT budget projection for 22 before this vote. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : I just agree that this can't be done piecemeal . It has to be looked at, you know, at the full budget of the IT Department . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm in agreement with what's already been said. I also plan on speaking with Mr. Deeley, the network manager to get a bigger perspective as to the plans for the IT Department , you know, what we could be looking at not just a year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 from now but a few years and better understand ing of what our needs are and to justify this contract . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, of course, I agree with my colleagues here. And during caucus we heard a lot. We heard a lot of great things that can happen. But we didn't hear the figures , what it's going to totally cost and the bodies that are going to support that versus last year. So I'm also going to vote to move it forward . But let's see. I still need information . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 THE COUNCIL NO. 87, 2021 â€“ SETTING FORTH ITS INTENT TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO PREPAY IN FULL ITS OUTSTANDING FEDERALLY TAXABLE GENERAL OBLIGATION NOTE, SERIES OF 2018; PROVIDING WHEN THIS ORDINANCE SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE ; AUTHORIZING AND DIRECTING THE PREPARATION , EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF ALL OTHER REQUIRED DOCUMENTS AND THE TAKING OF ALL OTHER REQUIRED ACTION BY SPECIFIED OFFICERS OF THE CITY; PROVIDING FOR SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS ; PROVIDING FOR THE REPEALING OF ALL ORDINANCES OR PARTS OF ORDINANCES INSOFAR AS THE SAME SHALL BE INCONSISTENT HEREWITH . MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. DONAHUE : Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , back when we first took out this note back in 2018, it was to infuse the money that we already had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 set aside from the Sewer Authority into the pension system. Just the way that state law is written when it comes to pension s, by taking out a loan and putting the money in we were able to take advantage of reduced MMO payments , which is the minimum municipal obligation s that we pay every year. So those were reduced then. So the savings that we realized over the last three years more than covered the 1.4 million that we're going to have to pay to cover the interest payments on this. And it was always the plan to pay this off early. So not only will it help, you know, our financing moving forward ; but we're also in a good position with them. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR.

We are going to bring this back I think next week, correct , Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : The week after. MR. GAUGHAN : The week after, okay, so two weeks. But that was tabled to allow for public comment . So there will be a motion next week to place it in Sixth Order. And then 8-B on the agenda tonight is the HARB recommendation for the Plotkin Shoe Store.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 Next week there's going to be a motion to place it in Seventh Order for a final vote.
