I would now like to call the members of the Providence United Presbyterian Church up to the front of the Chambers . We are going to present them with a proclamation celebrating their 175th anniversary . WHEREAS the Methodist faith was established in the area early in its settlement . The Presbyterians at the time, worshipped with them until they decided that they wanted their own place of worship ; and WHEREAS , on July 27, 1846, the citizens of Providence village met, and it was voted upon at that meeting , that a meeting house should be built under the control of the Presbyterian denomination ; and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 WHEREAS , on August 19, 1846, an offer of land from N. Gotrill was accepted and a draft for a “meeting house” was adopted . The proposed building cost was $2,000.00; and WHEREAS , on October 5, 1846, The First Presbyterian Church of Providence , Pennsylvania was organized as the first Presbyterian congregation in Scranton . Descendants of one of the original founders , William E. Cahoon, remain active in the church to this day; and WHEREAS an application for a charter was signed and granted by the Luzerne County Court on January 5, 1847. On July 7, 1847, construction began on the first church, built on the corner of Church Avenue and Oak Street, completed in 1848 and dedicated on July 25, 1849. The first pastor was Reverend Joseph Barlow. WHEREAS a parsonage was built in 1862 and a lecture and bible classroom were added to the building in 1869. This building housed the First Presbyterian Church of Providence until 1886 when the stone building in the 2000 block of North Main Avenue was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 completed and dedicated . The old church was sold and in 1882, a lot was purchased from Ira Tripp for $2,250.00 to erect a new house of worship ; and WHEREAS , in 1884, the parsonage built in 1869, was sold with the proceeds going to the cost of the new church building . In 1886, the congregation moved into the new church building at 2020 North Main Avenue and continued to occupy that building until the merger with Suburban Presbyterian Church in 1971; and WHEREAS , in 2008, a new church building was dedicated at 1145 Providence Road in Scranton . The congregation is a result of the merger of four different Presbyterian congregations that closed in past years. NOW, THEREFORE , BE IT RESOLVED , that on Tuesday , September 21, 2021, Scranton City Council wishes to recognize “Providence United Presbyterian Church” as they celebrate their 175th anniversary on October 4, 2021, and for their work of spreading the good news of the Gospel. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Proclamation be made a permanent part of the Record of this Council , as lasting tribute to “Providence United Presbyterian Church." Thank you very much. Would any of you like to speak? If, Corey, you would like to speak for a moment. You want to say a few words? Go ahead, sir. This gentleman is the Pastor. PASTOR: I'm currently serving as Pastor at Providence United Presbyterian Church where for the past four and a half years, it's been an honor and a privilege being among this particular manifestation of the spirit and these people of God. If you think for just a moment what this represents in and around the year the church was initiated and organized 175 years ago, that was a timeframe when James Pope was President of the United States. It was also the timeframe when as all of you probably are aware, the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia was struck to celebrate the birthday of George Washington . And that was the year that the bell actually cracked 175 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 years ago. This valley at that time was still considered to be a part of what was then known as the Connecticut territory still a part of the territory belonging to the eastern seaboard. When you think of that timeframe and consider what was going on in these United States and in this valley, we have arrived at the point in God's time whereas you well know we have people surfing over us with satellite s and space station s and rovers on the planet Mars. This represents that much time. It also represent s an enormous amount of time, energy, intelligence and imagination shared about this congregation for all of these years have pushed forward and witness to the gospel of Jesus Christ. In my humble opinion , they are to be applauded and celebrated . Thank you very much. And thank you, Council . We sincerely appreciate your recognition today. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. DR.

The City is seeking volunteer s to help create a bicycle pump at Connell Park from October 6th through the 9th for two shifts per day from either 9 a.m. to noon or 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. For details or sign up, please visit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Anthracite Bicycle Coalition on Facebook or show up at the park at 800 Gibbons Street any day from October 6th through the 9th. Volunteer s are encouraged to bring their own gloves and/or shovels. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I would just like to announce that the Scranton Fringe Festival this week is beginning Fringe Under the Glass. They had started that version of their Fringe Festival last year with the pandemic . So it's a way to safely engage the community and in the arts and so you could find out some more on Scranton fringe.org and buy some tickets . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? There will be a public caucus next Tuesday , September 28th, 2021, at 5 p.m., in Council Chamber s with members of the Cognetti administration , Reilly Associates and the Department of Environmental Protection regarding the Meadow Creek Project . This is a long time coming. There's many neighbors -- I know Council members have questions , neighbors have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 questions . So they will be here next week to give us an update on this project and to answer any questions from Council and that will be after at 5 p.m. Directly following that caucus, representatives from HRG will present Council with their final submission for the regional stormwater plan. So those caucuses will be back to back next week. And that is open to the public. There is an opening on the Ethics Board. Dr. Matthew Meyer informed Council that he had to resign from the board. Mr. Voldenberg will run an advertisement in the newspaper this week. Please submit your letters of interest and resumes to City Council by e-mailing Frank Voldenberg , our City Clerk at Fvoldenberg , F-V-O-L-D-E-N-B-E-R-G at scrantonpa .gov or mail it to 340 North Washington Avenue, Scranton , 18503. Those letters of interest and resumes must be in by next Wednesday , September 29th at 4 p.m. And then we'll make a decision within the next week or two after that. Just a reminder that masks are required if you are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 attending the Council meeting s and you're speaking at the meetings . Please do not take your mask down even when speaking . If you are ill or not feeling well, please stay home. Also when speaking , please try to speak about agenda items and things that would pertain to anything , anything at all related to the City. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker tonight is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . So what's the word on the audit? MR. GAUGHAN : Same as last week unfortunate ly. It's in process . They are exchanging information between the audit company Kohanski and the City. And they're -- Kyle, did -- MR. DONAHUE : They were -- I know they were in Thursday last week to go over the one or two missing pieces. Once they figure those out, then we would be getting it. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I checked the City's website earlier today. And the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 basic Collect ive Bargaining Agreement for the firefighter s still has not have been posted. This would be a document that covers the period 2008 through 2021. What they've posted is the 2018 amendment to that agreement . Now, if -- the fact that the labor contract is going to expire at the end of this year, I'm assuming that the City is in the process of negotiating a new contract with the union. And that that will come up in legislation before the end of the year. Unless you have that basic document and I'm not aware of that, I don't see how you're going to do your due diligence as legislators when that legislation comes before you because all you're going to be looking at is at the duty descriptions and the IME physician 's list and a few other details of that nature that they added in in 2018. But asking for this since June and hopefully it will get posted. I don't know if IT doesn't understand and they say, oh, we got it on the website since July. But they are not reading what they're posting . So I could just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 keep asking week after week kind of like my, God, give me the audit prayer. Next, I did mention the other week about Minimum Municipal Obligation for 2021 being 14.9 million . Now I understand that a lot of budget items can be easily covered by tapping into the ARP funding . But if we didn't have that ARP funding , would the MMO be a problem because it's going to continue year after year. So that would be a question you might want to be looking at as you consider the operating budget for next year. And with regard to the Controller 's August report which was in the backup for this week, can you explain the expenditure of $367,994.04 under special items? I could not marry it to the various TANs. So I would be curious as to where that number popped up. It's got to be a couple items added together . Again, I've asked when you have these extraordinary figures popping up on a nebulous terms like special items that it should be footnoted or mentioned somewhere . But hopefully that will change. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 You mentioned the caucus for next week. Do you have any idea of when we're going to hear about the Serrenti Center in a public caucus? MR. GAUGHAN : So they got back to us. They are putting together a summary of answers to the question s that we had posed because we had posed quite a few. And we're working with Mr. Voldenberg to set up a date I'm hoping within the next two or three weeks. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. How about the promise d caucus with the Mayor and her administration , her department heads, any idea when that will take place? MR. GAUGHAN : So I'm going to bring that up again in Fifth Order to have Mr. Voldenberg reach out. We are willing to have it on Tuesdays any day of the week at any time I think 5:00 on. But I believe that that is of great importance . So it will get done. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. I would recommend you might want to consider a caucus with OECD for them to give you a summary of their various loans and everything else so that's made clear to the public also. That 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 would be a great caucus. And when are they going to finish the Pocket Park on the corner of Linden and Wyoming ? Some days they're working on it, most days they're not. Obviously it's not going to be finished this year. MR. GAUGHAN : We can reach out to Leslie Collins from Scranton Tomorrow who is heading that project . MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, that's an outstanding capital budget project . And I would love to get a memo on how to change the Home Rule Charter , okay? Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. There is no one else that has signed in to speak tonight . Would anyone else from the public that's here like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Before Council there was some discussion on what was exactly involved with the Keystone -- with the landfill and fees involved in it. I took a look at my document just for clarification . And the contract between the City and the landfill locked in a $43.25 per ton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 tipping fee. And that is locked in for perpetuity . Originally it was set for a specific number of years but the City had the ability to continue it onwards at that locked in price automatically . And that was based upon the capacity of the landfill . As long as the landfill had the capacity , that tipping fee would be locked in place. So 43.25 is the tipping fee. As for the agreement for equipment , there was $100,000 a year set aside as the donation from the landfill to the City of Scranton . There is a precedent set forward due to the start of the agreement , the funds were held -- basically held for two years and passed forward and the initial grant was on -- on the paperwork filed was $300,000 which shows it does roll over and continue . And when they originally came to that agreement , they actually took two prior years and added it to together . The terms of that was it was set for any equipment necessary for the health and safety of citizens -- the City residents . It's broad. It could cover anything from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 vehicles and consider ing its equipment for safety, it could even go as far as equipment at Nay Aug Park or it could go for salt for the City's trucks if you needed to buy salt and have it put in for then since it would fall under the safety and health of the citizens . I'd like to take a moment to note that COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. have now exceeded the 1918 pandemic . There's been a lot of debate on how bad this has been whether or not it was as bad as the flu, whether or not it was going to be over when the sunshine came out in April of the year where it originally came to the U.S. We've hit a milestone where we crossed over into the largest pandemic that has caused deaths in the United States. It is a sad point in history but it's a poignant one to remember how diligent it is to take care of yourself and your family and to take care of others because this is a pandemic that has killed a massive amount of people even though we were getting desensitized to it because of constant bombardment , it has still taken on a massive toll. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 I understand that there was information put forward on a request for fentanyl test strips to be used. And I understand there is going to be some discussion on this later. Usually when a police department is instructed , they do it under the ability to -- for leeway and not to prosecute crimes. The federal government has done -- the states have done this before with marijuana or the federal government has made it prosecutable and illegal . But the executive branch has pushed down an order saying that we wish for our police not to enforce that regulation . That is strictly the authority of the police department based upon the executive to offer leeway in what they choose to prosecute . I believe that is correct that these safety measure s are a good idea. But we have to take the steps responsibile . And that is done by executive edict not by anything else because there is no authority to override. That's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 I'd like to start off too with the some day to be Pocket Park downtown . I couldn't help but notice that a humongous concrete slab on the Linden Street side, and it was my understanding from a former county employee who headed up the funding for the cleanup that it was to be totally cleaned up. Now I see that concrete slab makes me curious about whether or not it is still partially contaminated . I couldn't help but wonder the other day when they said the federal building was -- had the gas leak and people had to go outside for a while if the work on that Pocket Park was what had anything to do with that. Does anybody know? MR. GAUGHAN : I do not. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Isn't it about time that Scranton Tomorrow comes up to -- I thought they came every -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, they usually come quarterly . I believe they'll be coming soon. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. I would like to know about that contamination . Regarding the capital budget, there are other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 things but I'm concerned about all of this money that is being or all the funding that's being drawn from the Recovery Plan or I guess now it's a rescue plan I believe because without -- and I really very strongly believe you guys have to do something with the Mayor. You have to get at -- have a public hearing and prioritize what projects get that money because if it's first come first serve, that's not right. I mean, I have -- I believe number one, it should be stormwater personally . And I think there would be a lot of other people, especially from East Mountain and Keyser Valley and that would feel that way too. But I really hope you push for that before the budget comes out. And then who are the program managers that the budget -- the capital budget also said they started last year with having program managers for every highlighted program . Do we have any identification of who by name who the project manager s are? MR. GAUGHAN : I believe -- well, no. There is one project manager that was included in the 2021 budget so the City hired a project 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 manager . I can't think of her name off the top of my head. But there is one designated person now that works I think out of the Business Administrator 's office to manage a lot of these projects . MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, so it's one person for all projects , okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Well, not for all of them. But I think for many of them the problem in the past was that there was project s, for example , in DPW in years past that were getting -- falling through the cracks because there wasn't one person that was kind of coordinating everything . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, well, I guess when the budget comes out we'll find out. Also, is -- just out of curiosity , is the -- does the LIPS program still exist or is it now code enforcement ? And if not, what is the split as far as job duties and the number of employees ? MR. GAUGHAN : What program do you mean -- the department ? MS. SCHUMACHER : The department , the LIPS Department is it LIPS or is it code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 enforcement ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, they changed the title of it. But nothing really changed within the department . I think they gave more responsibility to Eileen Cipriani . Years ago OECD -- LIPS fell under the umbrella of the Office of Economic and Community Development . So I think they took it back to what it used to be but not much has changed there. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And can you tell me if the -- all of the -- if the Human Resources Department has completed the job descriptions of all employees or all employee categories ? MR. GAUGHAN : Sure, we can check. They should have, but we can check. Mr. McAndrew is shaking his head no. MR. MCANDREW : I don't believe so as of yet. MS. SCHUMACHER : Do we know what percent are done and are prioritized by the numbers of people. MR. MCANDREW : (Inaudible .) MR. GAUGHAN : We don't know but we could check. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, again, okay. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Next speaker . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer in Scranton . Okay, my number one is already taken care of. We now are represented by the police force at our Council meetings . I mention ed that off the cuff last week. And I'm glad to see that they're here. There's a correction on something I said last week. It's Colfax Avenue that Geisinger is interested in. And if you need information on it, our former Mayor or interim Mayor Wayne Evans' company is handling the sales proposals of the houses on Colfax Avenue, Evans Real Estate. So I'm not trying to make a federal crime about it. But we constantly hear -- we hear it outside the valley. We hear it from people in the Scranton Times in the letters to Editor all about how us dimwits can't handle our City and pay for our City services . And excuse me, but we were at 36 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 percent and those are upscale houses. So it's about time that the state starts to kick in because we are benefitting everybody by having those institutions here. If you get a heart attack in Clarks Summit or Waverly , you're headed to Geisinger or the other one. And they are a for profit hospital . So that being the case, we were denied 40 million dollars a year for our school district . And it can't keep going on. It started during the Corbett administration and it just can't keep going on. Once again on COVID which we have enough patient s for that, it is a City issue. Unattended gunshot wounds, heart attacks , accidents , one heart attack in Texas sent to six different hospitals in an ambulance . Another one was sent from Alabama to 43 hospital were called before he was finally accepted out of state. Now, this has to do with getting vaccinated and wearing your mask. Three antivax radio hosts passed spreading all of this. And their family has reversed please get vaccinated . We lost a guy and he didn't see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 the good sense. And recently today a person from Iowa who was double vaccinated passed away because he was an artist or something and he threw an art display and 12 or 14 people came unvaccinated , no masks and he caught COVID after he was fully vaccinated and passed away. His wife also caught COVID. She survived . She didn't have as many co-problems as her -- as him. And on the voting, we have Mr. Corman, senior man in Republican Senate in Pennsylvania asking for your driver's license numbers , asking for Social Security information , asking for addresses and everything else. And apparently he plans to turn it over to more of the fraudit people. So, you know, we're not an island here. And what people do from outside do affect us. And that -- it's entirely ridiculous . It's ungodly the amount of information they're asking just because you voted in last election . And that goes for you people out in TV land too because , you know, 99.9999 percent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 of people vote honestly . A few people cheat. And it never ever, ever, ever affects the election outcome . It's just a few people insist on being a jerk. Well, hopefully when they get caught they'll wind up in hoosegow . Thank you and have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. SHAW: Good afternoon , Council , Darwin Shaw, resident of Scranton , Pennsylvania , address 615 Beech Street. Today I would like to talk about the resolution that the Mayor is trying to legalize fentanyl test strips. Anybody that is from Scranton , especially in the 90s and the 2000s, Scranton was hit with a big opioid -- including crack cocaine and a lot of other drugs that almost destroyed our City. So to legalize beyond we'll say controlled substance what is an easy way for a person who is addicted to that type of opioid to get from a doctor and not be criminalize d for that aspect but say you could call it a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 pack of cigars or anything else and be charged with it, for you to get not charged with a fentanyl strip where you would break it down and use it and that is not helping anybody kick any type of drug or anything . I would like to see Council honestly sit down with the Mayor and talk about -- they could sit and establish something with mental health, help that individual mentally kick that drug and give them the proper support they need instead of just putting a band aid on it and say, we'll decriminalize this if you get caught with it and you use it or break it down or anything , we will just give you a slap on the wrist. That's not going to fix a problem . It's going to bring Scranton back into a dark time that every individual including you guys fought very hard to get us where we are today. And then also I would like to thank everybody including Mr. Gaughan for sending the proper resolution to the proper committee for looking at Leach Creek and Leggetts Creek and the flooding . And also, I would like to know if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 somebody could please pinpoint what pipes are eroded or what pipes keep exploding due to gas and water leaks especially in north side and help the individuals whose basement gets flooded from you say rain or anything like that because it is an astronomical amount of money to replace a furnace or anything like that. And that's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just one comment I guess. I'm happy to see that the administration is going to be able to attend caucus next Tuesday at 5 p.m. to discuss Meadow Brook. I think we'll get a lot of answers that we've been waiting for some time there. I would also like to thank Miss Cipriani . There were two properties , one was 736 Prescott Avenue I believe . There was a hearing today at Magistrate Hailstone's office. I didn't get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 the results of that but happy to get the update there as well as the property on Dorothy Street. So thanks, Mrs. Cipriani and thanks Mr. Voldenberg . That's all. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a comment . So the first one is from -- I'm sorry about that. So the first one I have is from our friends over in Green Ridge. They have an issue with stop signs at Wyoming and Woodlawn . They are saying they are being ignored . So they would like to see if we could place a second sign on the other side of the street so the signs can be seen if one is obstructed . So if, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could look into that. Let's see, so this should be done going up and down the same intersection . Third complaint -- that had a third complaint about speeding and parking on Fisk Street. Please make sure the demolition of the garage happens quickly over on Wyoming Avenue. So I know we are going to talk about that when it comes to the Meadow Brook, which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 is next week which is good. All right. Secondly , I think we all got this e-mail but I don't know if someone else is going to bring it up. But this property is on Clearview Street. 1836 is the most specific problem , but the two properties next to it are just as bad. They said that the hedges are 8 to 10 feet tall. They completely obstruct the sidewalk and also 3 to 4 feet into west path. So the children walking to school are forced into the busy streets . The other property is 1835 Bundy Street. That grass is 4 feet, loose garbage , dog feces, rodents. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I will send you this. That is just a little synopsis of this issue. This I will forward it to you so you could forward to the proper department s. I have another question and this was posed to me by a resident . And he lives on Landis Street, 635 Landis Street. So he at one point had a blacktop curb in front of his house. And I think it was done during the paving process . I'm not sure when it was -- what year or, you know, when it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 was done. But his concern is that DPW over the past two years during the winter plowing removed that curb. So I don't know if in the past this -- they're replaced because of that. I don't know what the process or protocol is for that. So if you could please send correspondence for that. All right. So last week I made a motion. So this is week three I'm asking for information regarding the separation or the divorce from NRS which was the previous company that collected for the City and were involved in the pay to play and identified by the FBI as co-conspirators . So we met a couple of times again like I mentioned last week. You know, we met in September and then we met in June. And it was separation from this company they wanted, you know, they wanted some money. So, I mean, I was against it. So last week our Solicitor Hayes said he -- I did an official request . And he requested if you could please report out what the update is that we asked for. ATTY. HAYES: Councilman McAndrew , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 did send a request to the Law Department requesting the status of the City's relationship with NRS and whether any additional payment s have been made to NRS since January of 2020. And if so, how much and when were they made and whether -- what's the status of winding down the relationship with NRS. So I did put that request out. MR. MCANDREW : So you haven't heard anything yet? ATTY. HAYES: The Law Department did report that payments have been made to NRS. Those payments they indicated were for fees and costs advanced by NRS on specific accounts . They did not have the specific amount or the dates that they made those payments . But they would provide that information to me and that the -- no final agreement had been entered in terms of severing the relationship between the City and NRS. MR. MCANDREW : All right. So can I follow up one more time? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. MR. MCANDREW : So I would like right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 now since they are being paid and we -- I didn't think they were going to be paid because we didn't agree to that separation . Now they're paying, I don't know, monthly -- I don't understand . So I would like to request as followup , a copy of any and all vouchers executed in the past year for NRS. And I want this correspondence sent to the City Controller , the Law Department and the Business Administrator . Thank you. That is all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments tonight ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just one. I feel like I've sent quite a few this week already to Mr. Voldenberg some other complaint s to be sent to department s, but one I believe I failed to mention that we received complaints of is 1805 North Washington Avenue in Green Ridge. There's a -- it's a condemned property . And the neighbors over in Green Ridge are asking for an update on what's going on with the property . There's been issues with rodents coming from there. So if we can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 request an update I would appreciate that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to touch on what Dr. Rothchild mentioned about the address at Washington Avenue, I did drive by there today, and they were cutting grass and cleaning up that. I mean, there is still some structural issues there but I did see that today. Just to touch on some of the citizen participation comments , Miss Hodowanitz brought up the CBAs. I know personally I won't even introduce a CBA unless the original is attached to that legislation . So there could be some comparisons . But I do -- I have agreed with you in the past and I continue to agree with you that those originals should be on the website . So we will follow up with the firefighter one again this week. I did make -- meant to put together an explanation on the MMOs for you this week. I'm sorry I didn't get to that. I will have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that for you next week. And on Miss Schumacher 's comment s regarding the capital budget, we still have very vague guidelines in terms of how the ARP money could be spent. So that's why some of that's in there. And another moving part to that is any federal legislation as it relates to infrastructure that may or may not be passed and how that affects our capital budget moving forward . Also, I haven't had access to my City e-mail for the past few weeks. So I've been working with IT to get the issue fixed. So if anyone's e-mailed me I apologize that I haven't gotten back to you. I'm hoping to get that fixed this week at the latest -- by the end of this week at the latest. A couple DPW requests I'd like to follow up on, Farr Street, a speed sign in the 1500 block of Farr Street has been spray painted to point it is confusing to distinguish if the speed limit is 25 or 35 if we could have DPW go out and take a look at that. And then also the condition of the 2000 block of Lavelle Court I got some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 complaint s from resident s especially with some of the storms we got that the road really has or the alley really has washed out there. Mr. Voldenberg , could we also send correspondence to the police department ? Back in July we sent correspondence requesting them to look into a four-way stop sign at Capouse and Walnut. I know they have put up a speed -- one of those speed readers that gathers data on the speed of every car that passes through . So could you just check and see if they have any update or if they've gathered enough data to make any determination on that one? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And then also, we did get a LIPS update today regarding the property on the 1600 block of South Webster Avenue. I believe it's 1602. It's at the corner of South Webster and Palm Street that have the tires piled up in the back. The License and Inspections Department is working on an injunction on this property through zoning, Don King and Joe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 O'Brien also trying both DPW and DEP action with Fire Department . Cars and site quality of life issues worked out without citation based on weekly visits to site. Tires do remain an issue but stored away from the building and less than 2000 and piled under 6 feet tall avoiding SFD signs. We also got an update that on September 9th, 2021, they spoke with the DEP regional representative in regards to this property . And they're forwarding the complaint to the Solid Waste Inspect or and the West Nile inspector . She was also advised that this is an ongoing issue with the property and that the property is situated in a residential neighborhood . So, Mr. Voldenberg , would we be able to just ask them for continuous updates on that property ? Also in terms of three properties I brought up in the past that I would like an update on, one is 539 Gibbons Street, 524 Gibbons Street, the front and the rear; 2208 Prospect Avenue. I've also been made aware of issues regarding zoning on the 1200 block of Oliver 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Court over in West Side by the high school. This was a property in the past where the property was torn down. Now a business has bought that property and is using it to park cars on that property that's not properly zoned for that. And on another issue that was brought to my attention on the 600 block of Hemlock Street there is an RV in the driveway and there's extension cords coming out being plugged into the RV. So can we just have them look into that and see if there's any issues with that? I wouldn't imagine that's kosher but we'll see. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I have a few comments tonight . The first is to kind of piggyback off of the comment s made last week regarding the SAFER Grant. So last week it was announced that the City was being awarded 2.6 million dollars funding through the Federal Emergency Management Agency Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grant Program . And that was announce d by Congress man Matt Cartwright . And that funding 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 would allow Scranton to cover the salary and benefit s of 10 new firefighters in addition to the complement that we already have of 135 for three years. So I think everyone on Council was surprised to read that article and that announcement in the newspaper . So when that happened I immediately had sent an e-mail to Mayor Cognetti and the Business Administrator Larry West expressing my concerns and the questions that I had in terms of how we would be able to continue to pay for that once the grant ran out and if we did not get an additional grant in year four and year five. I had requested the SAFER Grant application to take a look at it. And I did receive that and went through it. One of the first things that stuck out to me is that if the City were to accept this grant, in year four it would cost the City over 1 million dollars with 10 additional firemen ; in year five it would cost the City 1.2 million dollars ; year four, $780,000 in salaries and $310,000 in benefits ; year five, $890,000 in salaries and $320,000 in benefits . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 So my initial concerns about how we would pay for that I think were validated by the fact that those are very, very large amounts of money. One of the things that I was very surprised by was an article that ran in the Scranton Times basically stating that the Mayor and the Business Administrator were also concerned . They share the same concern s as City Council . The Business Administrator was quoted as saying, the administration would be looking at where and if we can utilize that grant and how we can use it effectively and whether the City ultimately uses the grant for that purpose remains to be scene. The original article with the Fire Chief, Chief Judge made it seem like the grant was already going to be accepted and those 10 firemen were going to hired almost immediately . So when I requested the grant and I had the opportunity to go through it, I was very surprised by what I found within the application . One of the question s that is asked within this grant application is very simple. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 It states, "Is it your department 's intent to sustain the awarded positions after the completion of the period of performance ?" The City of Scranton replied yes. This is very concerning . How could the Mayor and the Business Administrator and the Fire Chief submit an application and clearly state to the federal government that yes, it was, in fact, their intent to sustain the awarded positions after the completion of the period of performance which would have been three years and then turn around and say, jeez, we share the same concern s as Council ? We're not sure what we're going to do with it yet. There is two conflict ing things going on here. They're saying one thing in the application and then they're turning around and saying another thing to the newspaper and to City Council . That's very concerning . So I would like to ask a followup question . Who submitted this grant? Was it the City of Scranton through the Mayor and the Business Administrator ? Did they sign off on this? If they did, that's concerning . If they did not and it was submitted just by the Fire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Department and Chief Judge without the Mayor and Mr. West's approval or acknowledgement , that is also concerning . I've never seen that done before. Also, I would like to know why City Council is not involved in this process . In my tenure here, every time the City submits a grant we approve it. We approve the submission and the acceptance of that grant. So I would like to know the answers to those questions . Also another thing within the grant it says,"Please provide a brief description on how the positions would be sustain ed." One of the things it states in here is that the City is in the process of implement ing a fire based EMS system that will potentially yield revenue as a result of this endeavor . The City will be able to use this revenue stream to help sustain the positions awarded under the SAFER Grant. I am not aware of the ability to bill for fire based EMS beyond the actual cost. And how could this be considered a funding stream? I have never even heard that we were consider ing that. And it's never -- to my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 knowledge , never been discuss ed with Council as a whole and definitely has not been discussed with me. And again, for the Mayor and the Business Administrator to make the public think and Council think that they are also concerned about this and they're not yet sure how to use it and then to look at the grant application and see there had to be some rational e and thought put into this, does not make sense to me at all. The other thing it states in here is that the City has now developed a plan to emerge from financial distress and requires SAFER funds to assist with its long range plans. SAFER funds as everyone knows are not guaranteed . I reached out to the recovery coordinator Jerry Cross from the Pennsylvania Economy League and he stated if you look in the Recovery Plan it recommends a City maintain and employ a complement at the 2020 number and through 2021. That recommendation is based on the financial projection s in the plan that uses the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 2020 count of employees . So we would be getting way far off the ball in terms of our Recovery Plan. There is also details in here regarding four man crews. We need more -- I think more information on whether or not that is going to increase overtime . There is also a section in here regarding -- it says the requested position s will ensure this company will remained staffed . Does this mean the City will not be able to brown out companies if needed as it's done in the past? There are quite a few things in here that are concerning and would lead me to believe that either the Mayor and the Business Administrator did not know that this grant was going out or they did and they didn't care enough until Council spoke up and said, wait a minute, this is concern ing to then turn around and say, oh, we have concerns too. It does not make a lick of sense. So I would like to know the answers to questions I posed and get to the bottom of it. And by the way, you know, I don't believe you get to decide how you use this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 In other words, Congress man Cartwright doesn't just stand up there and announce that we get 2.3 million dollars and then we say, oh, jeez, maybe we'll use it for this or that. We stated very clearly in the application what we were going to use it for to hire 10 firemen and to keep that complement of firemen on. And there was a narrative in there that said how we were going to do that. So it does not make sense. And I think it should have been thought out prior to the submission of the grant and City Council should have been included in those conversations . We could have avoided the announcement by a Congress man that we received those funds. Also, it was -- the Serrenti Center was brought up tonight . And, of course, we've asked questions on this several times now and Mr. Voldenberg is in touch with members of the administration and hopefully we will get a caucus very soon and answers to our questions . Also, we've asked several times now about the meeting s with department heads. The Mayor has graciously agreed to this. We both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 think that it's good government . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could continue to reach out to them and schedule these caucuses . We are willing to meet -- it doesn't have to be Tuesdays . It can be any day of the week. We'll coordinate it with the rest of Council . And we can certainly do it before 6:30 p.m. Also, I asked last week about the plan for the 2022 budget process . Council has still not been brought in on this process . I'm hoping that that will occur very soon. The draft budget has to go to PEL in the middle of October . Also and I think most of us were aware of this -- and I can't remember if we got an answer on this the last time we asked. But members of the administration have cell phones that are paid for by the City. I would like to know, Mr. Voldenberg , how much we are paying for these a month and what account does this come out of out of the general budget. And last thing I'll mention tonight as everyone is aware that we have a very serious pandemic going on. And one of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 things that Council had requested of the Mayor was back in July to ask the Mayor to consider mandating vaccines for City employees . And when we raised that matter and I raised that matter back in July, the Mayor stated that she was considering requiring any employee who chooses not to submit a proof of vaccination to get tested on a regular basis. We have not heard any update on this. So, Mr. Voldenberg , I'd like you to reach out to the administration and see what the status is on this. I personally believe now with the seriousness of the Delta variant that we need to find a way to mandate the vaccine immediately for all City employees , the Police Department , Fire Department , Clerical Union, DPW. This is in the interest of the employee . And it's also in the interest of the people in the public that they interact with sometime s on a daily basis. So I do think that if there is a way that we can mandate this, the Mayor should do it immediately because that is being done throughout the federal government and in other places around the country . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 As of June according to the Scranton Times article , only 69 percent of police officers in the City were fully vaccinated . I'd like to know what the percentage is now, Mr. Voldenberg . And if we have a percentage on the Fire Department , the DPW, Clerical Union, all City's employees . If you are unvaccinated you are putting people's lives at risk period. And I think when the public comes in this building all the time and we need to make sure that every City employee is vaccinate d and the Mayor should mandate that immediately if we can do that. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – IMPLEMENTING POLICY REGARDING THE POSSESSION AND/OR DISTRIBUTION OF FENTANYL TEST STRIPS FOR HARM REDUCTION PURPOSES . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , in a second I'll make a motion to table this agenda item. I just -- well, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 actually let me make a motion now and then I'll explain why. I'd like to make a motion to table agenda Item 5-C. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a motion to table agenda Item 5-C. On the question ? On the question , I had spoken earlier to Solicitor Hayes and raised a few concern s about this piece of legislation . My initial concern is how this could actually be permitted as this contradict s a state ordinance . I'll ask Solicitor Hayes in a second to explain . But my original concern was simply that the state has a law that limits the or bans the possession and distribution of fentanyl strips in the State of Pennsylvania . This ordinance is effectively going against that. So how does the -- how can we do that? How can we legally do that, number one. And then number two, the Mayor essentially within this ordinance which there's a question of whether or not this even should be an ordinance is essentially changing the policy within the police department . And this is not something that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 would typically vote on as an ordinance . There is policy changes all the time in City Hall. For example , the Mayor changes a policy for workers to come in at 8 a.m. rather than 7 p.m. -- or 7 a.m. rather. You know, we don't vote on that. We don't vote on every policy change. But the biggest concern of mine is, you know, are we violating or contradicting rather an ordinance and a law that is already on the books in the state? Solicitor Hayes, do you want to add to that? ATTY. HAYES: Sure. The legislation that was proposed by the Law Department and the administration essential ly states that the police department would not arrest individual s for possessing or distributing fentanyl test strips. Fentanyl test strips are considered drug paraphernalia under the Controlled Substance Drug Device and Cosmetic Act which is a state statute . And that statute says basically the local ordinance cannot contradict and apply that objective of that state act. So in other words, we can't adopt 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 legislation which contradict s a state law. And this ordinance would effectively do that. So I have to work with the Law Department to, you know, understand , you know, what the objective is here and to see if there is a better means to achieve what the Mayor is trying to -- what she's trying to do here. And we all agree is a meritorious effort to try to address the opioid issue. But I think an ordinance which effectively says that we won't arrest individuals who are essentially violating a state statute is not something we want to do here. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Solicitor Hayes. As I've stated previously , I do agree with this -- the policy regarding not arresting people for the possession and/or distribution of fentanyl test strips. But we need to make sure that we're doing things procedurally correct . We would not want to set a precedent here. As I stated publically before, I think if one life is saved by this measure then it would be -- the whole thing would be worth it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 However , again, Council cannot do things that are not procedurally correct . Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I stated earlier I understand that two cities in the Commonwealth have already accomplish ed this, the policy change. If that's the case, why are we entertaining , you know, putting -- presenting it as ordinance ? So that is concerning to me. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ?

FALCHEK WILL BE APPOINTED TO A TWO (2) YEAR TERM SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON AUGUST 31, 2023. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'd like to -- I'd like to amend this piece of legislation for it to read three-year term scheduled to expire on August 31st, 2024. When we first created or when we first reestablished the Ethics Board with the appointment of board members , we did staggering terms and then each one was suppose d to be three years after that. So we just missed that in this legislation . So this amendment would just put in what should have been in there in the first place. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. There's a motion on the floor. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's a second. There's a motion on the floor and a second. On the question ? Can you just restate that for the record, Kyle, I'm sorry. MR. DONAHUE : So when we first 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 reestablished the Ethics Board, each appointee was suppose d to be a three-year term. But the first term was suppose d to be staggered so that there were new members appointed every year. So it should read that it should be a three-year term scheduled to expire on August 31st, 2024. MR. GAUGHAN : Got it. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion to amend agenda Item 5-H signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and agenda Item 5-H is amended . Anyone else on the question for the original motion? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I would just like to thank Mr. Falchek for the work that he's already done on the Board of Ethics and that we appreciate his interest in being reappoint ed to the board. I believe we'll have a few spots 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 opening up as was mentioned earlier in our caucus. And we will be looking for additional members to serve on the Board of Ethics. But I'm glad to see that we won't be losing Mr. Falchek . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction of agenda Item 5-H as amended signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ?
