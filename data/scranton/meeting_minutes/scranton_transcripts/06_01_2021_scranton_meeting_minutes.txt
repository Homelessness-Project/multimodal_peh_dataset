MINUTES OF THE COMPOSITE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 PENSION BOARD MEETING HELD APRIL 21, 2021. 3-C. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON POLICE PENSION COMMISSION MEETINGS HELD MARCH 17 AND APRIL 21, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have two of them. A quick reminder I brought up last week, St. Lucy's spaghetti dinner is Thursday -- this Thursday , June 3rd between 3 and 6. It's a drivethrough and it's $10. Also, I miss this every year and I think it's a great thing. So this is the Bedrock Technology , it's the 2021 electronic recycling event. I know everybody has a TV laying around, a big one. I forget this every year. So when is it? It's this Saturday , June 5th, 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. And it's going to be at 50 Alberigi Drive, Jessup, PA. Okay, the cost is accepting cash or check only, $20 per car, $40 for trailer and $100 per business ; so accepting materials everything , computers , TVs, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 printers . You know, they are not accepting batteries , anything containing mercury , stuff like that. All right. So like I said, this is something I think that a lot of people forget. This is a good thing. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. Today is the 1st of June so it's officially the month of June which is Pride Month. And I just wanted to wish LGBTQ community a happy Pride Month. We did have the flag raising earlier today outside of City Hall. I think it's maybe the third or the fourth year that we've been able to do that which I'm really -- I'm sad that I had missed today but I'm happy it's something that we do to make our City a more welcoming place and to help celebrate Pride Month. That's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have one. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 It's only one comment , but the Marywood University is having a leadership celebration to honor Jim and Kathy Gavin. The celebration is going to occur Thursday , June 10th. And tickets are available on the Marywood website . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : First speaker for tonight 's meeting is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I just gave you a copy of a flyer, the Lackawanna County Library System Home Delivery Service . We used to have a books by mail program for people who were homebound or physically disabled . But we have now expanded that service that anybody can request home delivery of library books, tapes, DVDs and CDs, talking books, whatever we have. Those who are interested you would contact the library either via the internet, www.lclshome.org or you can call the Scranton Public Library at 570-348-3000, extension 3035. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Place your order, and as soon as they get their hands on it, they will send it to you in the mail. And then all you have to do is return it to any one of the county's seven libraries . So if you can't get to the library , we'll get to you. Next, I've given a copy of my request for information and questions and here they are. First, the City fixed a pipe without a permit back in October . I would like to pursue that topic. I would like to know how that happened, were there internal controls in place to make sure that such a situation does not occur. If they weren't in place in October , are they in place now and what are they? What's it going to cost the City to replace that undersized pipe so that we don't have a flooding situation . And if flooding does occur before we replace the pipe, does the City have the funds to pay for any damages that result? Next, there was an article in the Times about Scranton -County at odds over taxes. I'm confused . I would like to know what is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 status of the dispute with Lackawanna County with regard to the Tax Claim Bureau's policy on the collection of delinquent property taxes. Are our residents paying more in legal fees than they did when Northeast Revenue collect ed those taxes? Next, as you mentioned during the caucus, I want to know the status of the 2020 audit. I've heard an anticipated completion date of September 30th. I would like to know if that's firm. And I would also like to know if we're still paying Rainey and Rainey to do the audit prep work which they began in 2014. It seems like it's the contract with the never-ending date. Why haven't our people been trained to perform that audit prep work? They should be trained by now. Next, there was an article in the Times, CPA firm to help county ensure compliance with fund guidelines . The county is using its auditor to make sure that they adhere to federal and state guideline s on COVID-19 funds. I want to know whether the City is taking a similar approach to make sure that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 meet all guidelines so we don't find ourselves in trouble down the road. Those were my written questions . I was happy to see that Larry West will be coming in as the new City Business Administrator . I wish he had been here for your caucus tonight even if it's with training wheels, but I think he'll do a good job. And I think Mr. Deeley will do a very good job in IT. And no one has to worry, Mr. West is a City resident because I sold him my apartment last year. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. And we'll make sure that those questions get to the right departments . Thank you. Next speaker is Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I'm here tonight to speak on behalf of the Nay Aug Park and the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority . And the first thing that I want to mention is that we do have a new website . And I encourage everyone to go to the website because it's filled with a lot of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 great information . One of the things that you could do by going to the website is that you can make reservations for the different pavilion s that are there. You can also -- which is a very popular thing now is to -- the tree house and a lot of weddings have been -- taken place there. So you can make reservations for that as well. And if you're going to, you know, be married -- you want to be married there. And, like I said, it's a very popular activity now that's going on at the park. So the site of our new website is Nay Aug Park dot org. And Nay Aug Park is all one word. I'll repeat that at the end just in case folks want to get a pencil or a pen. I want to go over the activities that I'm going to be mentioning that are going to be happening over the next few days. On Saturday , June 5th there is a huge craft vendor show there at the park. It's going to be 100 vendors displaying their products , baskets raffles , 50/50s, food, music and more. Enjoy a summer day of outdoor shopping and fresh air and beauty in Nay Aug 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Park. On Sunday and Wednesday , the concerts will start at the park. The Sunday concert s start at 1:00. And there are different local bands from the City of Scranton that perform for us. The only thing we ask is that you bring your chair or unless you want to sit on the grass with your blanket . Either way it's a great afternoon . They usually start about 1:00. On June 8th, they are going to start the Wednesday evening concerts . And they will start at 6:00. And the same activity , different bands from the City will be performing . And again, bring your chair because there's, you know, just sitting on the grass or in your seat. On June 12th -- and if I could give you a flyer on this, this is our kids activity . It's a Kids Family Chalk Art and Fun Day at Nay Aug Park, Saturday , June 12th from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.. Come out and show your art skills. And we're going to mark off different places around the pool and where the kids can -- and their families can do the chalk art. We'll be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 providing them with a tub of chalk that they'll take with them when the finish. They won't be sharing it, you know, everybody has their own bucket of chalk. That begins at 10:00. And there's going to be other kids' activities there as well for the kids to enjoy. So we're asking, you know, that people just turn out and just enjoy the park. We don't have a pool but we can make use of the other things that are going on at the park. Okay, that's all I have about the park. Again, the website is Nayaugpark .org. And I just encourage everyone to go out and sort of look at our new website . I'm not sure if this is the proper format for this but I do have a question . I was going to send an e-mail but time sort of gets away from you. You talked about last week about the resolution that you were going to put in marking signs along Gibson. I think it's up for final resolution tonight . Let me just put on my glasses . Yeah, it's 7-A; and it's up for final reading and resolution . Is that the only way we can go about getting the corners marked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 with signs so that cars don't park so close to the -- so I have to put in the resolution . Is that the process ? MR. GAUGHAN : You can put in a request to Council and we can get that to the police department . And then the Traffic Division -- the gentleman -- the police officer from the Traffic Division will go out with the City Engineer and assess the situation . They'll write a report. And then they'll decide whether or not your request is warranted . MS. JEFFRIES : Because my concern is on Vine and Clay and somebody is going to get into a bad accident there. And I was told that nothing could be done which, you know, though I enjoyed that last week when you said that nothing can be done, those kind of words just get to me too. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. MS. JEFFRIES : So if that's the process I need to go through is to get someone to really look at that intersection of Clay and Vine Street before something terrible happens there. Okay, thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , can you send that to the Traffic Division of the police department ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . I would have been here last week but I thought there would be no place to park and a bigger crowd. So I was surprised people after a year didn't show much more interest . For some of y'all I have I guess the unpleasantness of Council meeting s. I don't know you all. You know, in the past few weeks I have been talking -- now that I'm getting out, I'm talking to people. And I surmise that the general attitude of people, you know, at the grocery store and the Dollar Store, they don't have any confidence in this administration , especially the three commissioners -- county commissioners . I heard so many adverse remarks . I heard things I didn't even know about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 politically . Maybe this new business manager will turn things around. But I don't know about pouring the wine into an old glass. I've always wondered and I've talked about it right here before, every election people come out of the woodwork you never heard of. All five of y'all never attended meeting s, a zoning board, wrote letters . I just don't understand why all of a sudden you and others want to represent us? Some of these people out here have been coming for years. The first time I came was in 1980 with Jimmy Klee. I probably have more hours sitting in this room than all five of you put together the last couple years. It's because I love this City. I live here by choice. Five, six years ago when I was in Memphis playing golf, one of my friends said come back home and I'll give a gravy job, you know. And I'm here because I want to be here in this city. But the city just -- has anybody ever tried to phone one of the departments in this city? You don't get them. It's impossible . Try to phone the license bureau, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 they won't phone you back if you plead on the phone, offer them a bribe. That's how everything is around here. These people have jobs that ought to be fired. North Main Avenue is -- the north side is terrible . There's an abandon ed trailer for months on the 2400 block, cars on the sidewalk , abandoned cars, tractor -trailer s parked. Nobody sees it. That's what diminishes our house values. And I've talked to people. You want to reassess this. I haven't found one person whose house hasn't gone up two, three, four times since 1965 or '68. That's a fallacy . We all know the reassessment is to increase taxes. There's no other reason. All of this nonsense that I -- you know, been shoved down our throats ; you don't need any reassessment right now. How are we going to pay for 15, 20 million dollars at the end of the time, plus the lawsuit we'll lose to the out-of-town attorneys . You people -- not one of you are thinking about 10 or 20 years from now. Look at the School Board, the mess, the buildings . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 What happened two years ago? Y'all give 3 million dollars of grant for the City to Lackawanna College to repair buildings that aren't even on the payroll . That's what goes on. That Lavish overgrown dollar store got 90,000 grant from you when people in this city were begging for loans to stay open. It's just mismanagement every place you turn to. I hate for y'all to start out being mad at me. But this is what I hear. This is what I'm told. I didn't make it up. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. David Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council . You can hear me with my mask on. Still protesting the amount of people that seem to have vaccines available and they don't want to take them. They don't show up for the second visit. And once again, I'll reiterate -- and I'm not crying. I'm still alive. But being on a ventilator isn't a very good experience . And you're potentially exposing people to a serious disease . We had about a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 thousand people in the medical profession died as a result of COVID that they caught from their patients or possibly out in the world. And I'd like to see a 95 percent vaccinated rate pushed more than the 70 percent . I hope we're not getting in front of the cart or behind the cart -- putting the cart in front of the horse because believe me, it's -- people are walking up after 20 days and they don't recognize their -- who they're married to. They don't know how to walk. Maybe Dr. Rothchild has some experience with that retraining people how to take their first steps at 70 or 75 years old. So it's really just a little pinch in the arm and it might be uncomfortable for a day. But even if you have some whiskey around you could pop a couple and forget about it. That was my old solution . I can no longer tolerate alcohol not because I had a problem with it but just because of my health situation . And once again, call Congress on the John Lewis and For the People Act at 202-224-3121 and 202 -- 225-3121. On one of these numbers you could ask for a specific 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Senator . So if you think that somebody 's out of line by not eliminating the filibuster which is a serious problem -- personally I think that any state that would deny voting rights should have to refund your taxes for the last five years along with punitive damage. That's what we should write in the Constitution , not this nonsense where any old -- any old voting -- the way they handle the votes is just A-okay. And if they took your picture when they took your ballot, you know, how many -- you'd have facial recognition and everything else. So it would be absolutely secure. That's the way it's done in a hospital so you can't hand somebody your cards and have them pull a fake -- get some service -- medical services for nothing , whatever . That's -- and, well, once again, we have a problem with guns. And I don't really have a solution for it with -- I would recommend licensing be required for semiautomatic rifles with large magazines so you could possibly even reduce the amount of magazines unless you want to register it and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 license it because then ultimately they would only have a few rounds with them. But I think a lot of people are just going crazy over the last year. And poor people live in the minute. They don't see the future. They feel they don't have a future and a lot of times kids are just -- younger people are just -- they're impulsive . They think things matter that really don't and they go out and do something like what happened last night or the night before, whatever . But I'm a strong Second Amendment person. You can't tell who is going to commit a crime with a gun anyway. Two thirds of them are licensable or pass the background test anyway. So thank you and have a good night. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. The next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . Councilman Gaughan , you mention ed about the speaker s. When I got home from the meeting last week, when I watch a normal show we put our TV on about 40. My wife said she had to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 put it up to 100 to hear me. I don't know what the problem was -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I think that's more internal with the cable channel because we've talked about that before. I don't think that has anything to do with the speakers . But I do get that complaint a lot from people so I know what you're talking about. MR. SPINDLER : The splash pad, I go by there pretty often. I was just by there the other day. And to me it looks like it's almost ready. I don't know how much more they have to do. It looks pretty good. Next, I spoke about this a long time ago. The utilities are killing our streets . I live on Bulwer Street. That was just paved two, three years ago. A couple months ago the gas company was there and dug up two different areas, filled it in. Now there's the one area is starting to sink. They just don't do a good job redoing what they did. You know, and Main Avenue from like Rite Aid to I think it's Jackson Street, they dug up the whole length of those three, four blocks, whatever it is. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 think they are still doing it. Main Avenue was paved not that many years ago. So I hope they're require d to repave all of those blocks that they dug up because it goes all the whole length of -- I'm sure you guys probably go up and down Main Avenue. It's terrible . They shouldn 't be able to get away with this. All right. Last week I spoke about that bridge on Main Avenue again with the trucks getting stuck under there. I -- from time to time I go under there many times a day usually . And I just think about when trucks hit those bridge -- that bridge, are they -- is the structural integrity of that bridge being compromised ? And if you look at the steel beams on each side, they're rusted. I don't know how old that bridge is. They're rusted. There's holes in the beams. That can't be safe, I don't know if that bridge is ever inspect ed by the railroad . I know it's the railroad 's responsibility . But every time I go under that bridge, I see -- I just think about it, how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 safe is that with a train going over that weighs how many thousands of tons. I just don't know how safe it is. I don't know what railroad owns it. MR. GAUGHAN : We can check that out. Mr. Voldenberg , can you followup on that? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, I will. MR. SPINDLER : When is the last time it got inspected ? Holes in steel beams doesn't seem safe to me. MR. GAUGHAN : No. MR. SPINDLER : Oh, okay. It was Memorial Day yesterday and already the fireworks are starting . My area I could see right out my bedroom window. I'm not sure, I think it's coming from the Tripp Park development -- the new development . It's ridiculous . The 4th of July it's ridiculous . Last night it was 11:00 at night they were still doing it. And I can't believe the neighbors there put up with them. If that was me and my neighbor was shooting them off now -- and it's illegal . You have to -- in the City you have to be 100 feet away from a residence . And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 there's no houses in that area that are 100 feet away. So maybe when somebody 's house catches on fire, maybe they'll do something about it. It's ridiculous . It was on the 4th of July. I don't look forward to the 4th of July. Okay, Councilman Donahue , I brought up the Bulwer Street sign last week. Did you talk to the DPW? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I did pass that on. They said they would be out to take care of that. MR. SPINDLER : Okay, because it's been a week now and it's still not there. MR. DONAHUE : There is only two guys, you know, two or three guys that go out and do that. So it's on their list. MR. SPINDLER : Okay. And last week I heard the new that the La Festa Italiana is going to be held this year. I let out the biggest yell that I ever let out. That's one of my favorite times of the year. I love that. And it's good for the whole area. It's good for the City. I'm thrilled that they're going to have that this year. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 Oh, Dave mention ed guns. Again, Miami, another mass shooting over the weekend . Nothing is going to be done unless the Republicans are voted out of office. They're the ones against it because they're afraid of the NRA. The NRA lines their pockets . We got to get the Republicans out of office next election . That's the only way we're going to get gun control and stop these senseless killings . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Greetings Council . First, I'd like to draw the attention that the City Council web page is still reflecting even at this time that all submissions are to go to Lori Reed and Lori Reed's e-mail address . That should have been updated quite a while ago. It's not something that's actually embedded in it. It's just a text on your web page, both Council pages still reflect Lori Reed's e-mail address for submissions . That needs to be addressed . When a new proposal comes before this body which the gun association came before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 this body, there were questions brought up even by Council here where did it come from, where did it originate from. When a new proposal comes before this body, it should be brought up and introduced by the person who actually writes that requested ordinance or that change. The reason for this as I have dealt with the Maryland legislature , is when laws are being put onto the book -- books, there is a judicial responsibility to be able to go back to legislative intent. Devoid of someone coming in before the Council and explaining why a bill or an ordinance should be adopted , the reasons for it and for Council the opportunity to ask about this rather than something else, that has always been done in Senates to give an idea to the body of what the actual legislation meat is about in it. That is devoid in here that it comes forward as something to vote on. No one knows who sponsor s it. And there is no legislative intent if there's a conflict to go back to and say this is what it actually addressed . It did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 not mean to address something different . I was just shocked when I came up here before this body when laws were being passed and there was no discussion of why it was being introduced in the first place by people putting it forward . City -- the City parking app, it might be interest ing to put forward because there are a number of places in Center City that have a limited time span. In Philadelphia as an example and in Baltimore , you can -- beyond the two hour period four -- going from four to six hours; they charge double the amount and beyond six to eight hours; they actually charge quadruple . That would solve -- a little bit more revenue . It would also solve the issue of people at the courthouse who need to be there for four or six hours who don't want to run out and have to move their car while they're waiting to be called up before a judge the ability to re-up on the app for just an extra fee. I've talked before about the taxes and garbage tax as was brought up between the county and the City, there is an issue now -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 there is issues involving what should be paid, what shouldn 't be paid. I don't understand why the City of Scranton cannot handle its own financial footing , why we do not have competent people in the City who can audit, who can collect , who can process and who can bill that we have to farm it out to someone else. That's incomprehensible that your job is the budget that you handle budget and collections , yet it gets handed off to another political entity outside of your direct control . I also submitted on -- 16 months ago a request for a parking space for the press as well as a change in the ordinance allowing for press to park during the -- press to park at meter parking spaces. This was on January 14th, 2020. The benefit of this has shown that in research I brought forward to you the trash collection fee -- the $100,000 from DeNaple s towards equipment , health and safety that somehow disappeared . Through my research I pulled all of that paperwork up and correct -- and brought it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 forward when most of this body was unaware that there was even an agreement to supply equipment to the City of Scranton . Press requires time to do research . That's why I had requested it between -- somewhere between the school board and the county courthouse . And I know that you, Mr. Gaughan , you were going to bring it forward to the Parking Authority . And it probably got lost somewhere in between with the pandemic . But I did bring it forward using the Article 5 Rules of Council , Section 19 which sends it to the -- directly to Mr. McAndrew 's responsibility as public safety. And I'd like to know in Fifth Order what happened to that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is John White. MR. WHITE: John white. Hi. I am John White, historic hill. I hope all of your families are safe and well. I've been writing to you the past few weeks. So everything I'm saying tonight I probably wrote to you. The utility companies are making cuts in the road kicking up dust everywhere . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 I'm in the 500 of Wheeler , but I'm sure it's going on everywhere . They don't clean up. They don't take care of business at the end of the day. And so our houses, our cars, our lungs are getting filled with toxic dust from the roads. And the landfill trucks use Wheeler Avenue I guess to go from Dunmore to somewhere . And they speed. And they speed and that's not enforce d at all that I could see. I understand with the cutting that there's an ordinance that says when this kind of thing is going on, the cutting , that the utility companies have to clean up every day. They're not doing that. Neighbor s are out hosing the road down, sweeping , all of that stuff. I invited you to come up and look and smell our not so fresh air. I made suggestions too for what may help and I'll just run off a few. Why not have the Fire Department come up every day and just hose it down? They have big how power hoses. You wouldn't even have to have the neighbors move their cars, hose on under it. I suggested maybe working with the University of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Scranton or other nonprofits . We, the City, do a lot for them. If you've ever gone on the campus of the University , it's beautiful . Their groundskeeper -- I worked there for 25 years. Their groundskeepers are outstanding . They could help out. The landfill owner whose trucks are barrelling down, perhaps he could help out. It's got to be done every day in order for us to breathe easier. We have children breathing it in, asthma. We have old people with COPD. Pick a lung disease , we got it. They're breathing it in. It's pretty nasty. I think it is. I mean, I'm sure you have bigger fish to fry too. I mean, you're doing good stuff. I don't want to leave that out. You're doing good stuff behind the scenes a lot. I know that. But this is personal at this point. I have this fantasy that at some point and in the future that there is going to be a headline in the Scranton Times that says, "Scranton has been voted one of the cleanest cities in the country ." We're not there. We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 got a ways to go. I must be leaving something out. You can remind me if you want to. It's a great neighborhood . We're friendly. We shovel each other's sidewalks in the summer. And the winter we cut each other's lawns. In the summer it's a great neighborhood . It's safe. We want it to be clean. We want it to be one of the cleanest cities in the country . I had two things. I'm going to move on. I'll let that rest for now. But the other thing is and more recent -- well, it's always been there. The fireworks in the hill, midnight -- I'm not talking little bitty fireworks . I'm talking cherry bombs. I'm talking big boomers in the sky. Kids are hiding under their beds. Dogs are hiding under their beds -- MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. White, I don't want to interrupt you but you're -- MR. WHITE: I'm sorry? MR. GAUGHAN : I don't want to interrupt you in your train of thought but your time was up. You have five minutes to speak.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. WHITE: I'm having a hard time hearing you. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I'm sorry. Your time -- MR. WHITE: You're talking , okay. MR. GAUGHAN : No, me over here. I didn't want to interrupt you in the middle of your thought but your time was up. You have five minutes to speak. MR. WHITE: Noise on the hill. Can I say one more thing? MR. GAUGHAN : No, I -- well and then if I let you say one more -- yeah, so I -- we appreciate your comment s though. And, Mr. Voldenberg , we did send his comment s to the appropriate department s when they came in, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, we did, Mr. Gaughan , including 500 block of Stipp Court also, Mr. White. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. White. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I'd like to say first it was nice to see three 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 of you -- two of you with your children at the dedication of the VFW's vet's park at the -- down in front of the high school yesterday . But now onto city business . Could you tell me tonight what Mr. Deeley's experience is in managing an IT department ? And I would also like to know how many members are actually employed in the department now versus their budget. And I would like to know whether the contract that was given to that company in Jessup is going to be terminated and done inhouse now and just the fact that something needs to be done soon. I mean, I spent hours last night -- well, that's an exaggeration . But I spent at least an hour off and on trying to get in on the website . You get the web page and then you try to get something and you get a message something . I had it written down. But in my haste I left the -- I grabbed the wrong paper. But it was something like there's been a critical error and you start all over and you just keep going through it. And then you think, well, maybe it's something in here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 and you just waste a lot of time. What I wanted to go to was to see the contract that we have with -- I belive it's Portnoff to do the collection of the last five years of delinquent taxes. I think it should be about time to get a report from those people if I'm not mistaken . But it's hard to know when you can't get the contract . So something 's got to be done and got to be done soon to get that department and to get that -- why we didn't keep the existing -- what was the existing thing going -- system going until this one was perfected I will never ever know. But it's very frustrating . Next, 5-B, I think that this should be held until you and the administration decide what you're going to do with this building . That's going to be a big cost of that LED lighting and probably the most expensive part of it. So, you know, I think March 18th the notification of -- the receipt of the count -- analysis of what it would take I believe it was 10.7 million dollars was received . And here we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 are, nothing . We're doing a patch on one of the -- I don't know south towers or whatever . We've done a little bit. But if you are going to keep it we need to know that. And we need to know where the money is going to come from. I know it's in for a grant. I don't know how long that grant is active or when it -- that time expires . But assuming you would want to sell this, it might be for historical purposes and they might not want LED lights in here. And then you'd have to go back. So I think until you people after this two years' worth of knowing what it's going to cost, it should be put off. I appreciate that we need savings, but I don't think we need to spend a lot of money on this building if we're not going to be here even in five years. And then moving on -- oh, also last week you spoke of inviting Chamber of Commerce President , Mr. Durkin to the -- I believe -- maybe on the 8th which will be next week. Did that get put in concrete ? MR. GAUGHAN : Mr. Voldenberg , are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 they coming next week? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not next week, Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. So we're scheduling them though, correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : In June. MR. GAUGHAN : In June, we don't have the date yet but they will be coming at some point in June. And I'll announce that the week before. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. That would be nice. And then I ask about the final report of HRG that was the worst written contract -- one of the worst I've seen. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I sent an e-mail to Don King the City Planner . He didn't get back to me. MS. SCHUMACHER : He didn't get back. That's what I wondered if anybody followed up on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Yep, as soon as I get something I'll report it. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, we need to, yeah, get moving on that. And then the Fourth Order, I do -- I know there are -- I'm sorry, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 I'm out of time. MR. GAUGHAN : You hit the zeros. MS. SCHUMACHER : I did. I just looked up and saw that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Miss Schumacher . Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple. So about two weeks ago there was a concern brought to me via e-mail. And then I was unable to find it. So -- and Mr. Voldenberg , we were looking for it. So we actually -- this gentleman actually reached out to us again. So his concerns are a property on 622 South Irving Avenue. The property is in disrepair . There's a lot of issues with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 garbage and all sorts of stuff that needs to be addressed . So now that we have the address and we found the e-mail, could you please send some correspondence to the code enforcement office on this one? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And also, secondly , Mr. Coyne, I apologize . I do remember you bringing forth a parking spot between here and the administration building for the school district . I thought it was reasonable and I thought it was a great idea. I know we did send correspondence . Maybe we'll have to double-check to the entities that would have to approve this. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would please do that. I'm not sure who to start with. I think last time we sent it to the administration . But it's a parking spot for the press somewhere between here and the school district . And then thirdly , so I got -- so I brought this up in caucus. And I have to pull it up on my phone because that's how I got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 this. So in caucus I brought up that these pods -- and I'm not sure -- in caucus we kind of said, well, maybe we have to clarify it. But there are two pods that have been parked in West Scranton , one for six months, one for a year. They're not in a driveway . They're a pod. And a pod my understanding is you see them on TV, if you're going to move you fill it up with your stuff and then they come and pick up the pod and take it to your new residence . So -- and these are parked on the street. You know, the neighbor s are sick of it. I get it because six months, a year, that's ridiculous . So I know there's issues with snow removal trying to get around them, you know, garbage pickup trying to get around them and just living there and trying to get around them must be horrible . So I know that it's unclear . I guess, you know, they called City Hall these concerned residents . They called the police department . And this person was informed we'd love to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 something but there is nothing on the books. So briefly in caucus we said, well, maybe it might be on the books. Maybe it might have been brought up before. Maybe it can be related as a dumpster versus pod. I don't know. But I would like to make a motion right now that we find out and clarify so everybody is on the same page, the resident , the owner of the pod whoever is renting it and the police department to be able to enforce what they probably want to do and just are following what they're suppose d to do. So I make a motion to actually clarify or if not, put an ordinance in if we don't already have one. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second it. MR. GAUGHAN : A motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , I do know -- and, Solicitor Hayes, if you could look it up, but I know that Council voted in the past on an ordinance for the regulation of storage container s.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 There was a fee schedule . I just haven't looked at it in a while. But I do know that we have one because I do remember there was some controversy involved with that as well from -- if my memory serves me correctly so if you could look that up. ATTY. HAYES: I'll look it up. No problem . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, on the question , if there is something there, that's great. Let's just polish it up or clarify and move forward with that. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and the motion passes. MR. MCANDREW : That's all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comment s? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have two complaints from citizens that I wanted to have forwarded onto the appropriate department s. The first one I believe I sent to Mr. Voldenberg . I just wanted to ensure that you had receive d it and that it will be sent over to LIPS. And that's regarding the 700 block of Saginaw Street. There's an empty vacant lot that -- that's been being used as a dumping ground and has overgrown grass. So I wanted to make sure we can get an inspector out to take a look at that property . And the other one that I have -- that I received just recently is on Myrtle Street, the 1300 block. This one would be for SPD, I believe . And there is a basketball hoop that's out on the street. And children have been playing basketball in the street pretty often and at all hours. And it's a big safety concern . I would love for there to be more basketball courts and appropriate places for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 kids to play around in our neighborhoods but the street is not one of them. So we need to get that corrected so that no one gets injured . And that's all. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have a few things. First, just to address Miss Schumacher 's questions about Mr. Deeley's experience , this is probably something that will be discussed next week because we'll have those -- we should have those two appointment s -- Mr. Deeley to be appoint ed as the IT Director and then Mr. West to be appoint ed as the Business Administrator on the agenda I think next week. So what we've requested in the past is a resume to come along with that. So that will be in the public record hopefully next week. As for the questions on the website , I experienced the same thing with the critical error. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 just double-check with the IT Department and find out what's going on there. I heard a complaint from someone else on that as well. Mr. Coyne brought up a few things. The first thing, Mr. Coyne, regarding the, you know, where the legislation originates from; I agree with you. When I took over as President of Council , one of the things I instituted and it took a little bit of time was if you look in the backup of the legislation there is now a fact sheet. And the fact sheet has a couple of what I thought were really important and pertinent questions . And the first one is, what department is this legislation originating from? Where did the initiative for this legislation originate ? So that is in there. And if you look in the backup tonight you'll see that they do answer it -- now answer those questions . But I do think that is a good point. And I have wanted to see that and the administration has complied with that request . And then there is some other important questions that you'll note in that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 fact sheet, summary and facts, what does the legislation do, what are the upside, the down side, how are you paying for this, why should we unanimously support this legislation . Sometimes in the past since I've been on Council , those questions were answered within the backup. But a lot of times they really weren't and then we would have to, you know, ask those questions which I just thought is silly because we kept going back and forth. So now that is include d in there. That was a good point. As for your point about bringing the collection in-house, I did bring this up when we were voting on Portnoff contract because it does make sense. You would think why can't we just do it inhouse instead of continuing to farm it out. When I asked that question of Mr. Deeley, he said they were going to do an analysis of what that looks like, what that would cost because we would probably have to add employees . How many, I don't know. So I'll followup up with him on that. But when I did speak with him he said that that would be the goal for the future. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 Instead of having to constantly go with a Portnoff and these other companies , why can't we just do it in-house and save a lot of headaches. So we'll followup on that. A few other things in the caucus tonight we did talk about the sound system for anyone who is here. So Mr. Voldenberg is going to reach out to a gentleman who takes care of the sound in the chambers to see how much it would cost to relocate those speakers . You'll notice that if you're at the podium it sometimes is different to hear us. It sounds like it's coming from the back. So that's one of the things I would like to take care of before the end of the year. So Mr. Voldenberg will update us on that. The second thing that I wanted to mention last week I had asked Mr. Voldenberg to reach out to Brook Newhart, the City's Parks and Recreation Director on the pools and when the pools would be open and which ones would be open. So she did respond that they're planning on having pools open for June 19th. And they're doing regular maintenance on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 Connell and Weston Park. She said that Weston Field needs more maintenance with DPW putting something out to bid. So I asked in the caucus Mr. Voldenberg reach out again just for further clarification on what work has to be done and what was bid out. We are working on getting a letter -- the letter is drafted . We're just going to send it out tomorrow to DEP, Senators Casey, Senator Flynn and others about the issues that I mentioned last week about Leggett and Leach Creek. One of the things that I did not mention last week and I think Miss Hodowanitz brought up was the article in the Scranton Times on May 16th, 2021. And that article that DEP was investigating whether the City repaired the underground pipe of Leach Creek in North Scranton last fall without a required permit from DEP. I was told by Mr. Preambo , the DPW Director that they didn't apply for a permit then but they applied afterward s. And there's a dispute going on there about whether -- I think the DPW says that the pipe is big enough. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 DEP -- I don't know where -- and this is the clarification I want, they state that the pipe appears undersized for the creek channel flowing into it. So we want a clarification in their analysis and when they went out there is it actually undersized . They also stated that -- Colleen Connolly stated that the waterway opening is significantly decreased and has the potential to cause backwater and possible flooding upstream . She also stated that the DEP inspection determined that the piping installed by the City was not large enough for the water flow. So the clarification would be, you know, is the pipe undersized or isn't and what was the followup on that. I also asked for a report from the DPW on what work has been done in the past on Leggett 's Creek and Leach Creek and what they plan on doing for the future. There was several meetings held out there with City officials and with a gentleman from DEP. So we'll provide an update on that as soon as we get it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 I also mentioned in terms of Miss Hodowanitz 's question about the audit, Mr. Deeley responded that Tom Rainey was in last week working on the audit prep. And he's going to reach out to him and Kohanski and try to tie down a specific date. I think that probably answers your question as to whether or not Rainey and Rainey is still operating in the BA's office for audit prep. I believe they are. But I will try to get your questions answered as to why that is still taking place because I do remember a few years ago that they were only supposed to be in there for a specific amount of time. The employees would get trained and then their services would no longer be needed. So we'll followup on that. Also, Miss Schumacher asked about the HRG stormwater study. And as I stated to you, we did ask for an update on that. So when we get it, we'll forward that along as well. And the last thing I'll mention is there is going to be a meeting held this week, an update, a stakeholder meeting or briefing on the design of the bridge replacement s on East 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Parker and Elm Street, North Main Avenue over Leggett 's Creek, West Lackawanna Avenue offer the Norfolk Southern Railroad . So Mr. Donahue and Mr. Voldenberg are going to be attending that. And they'll give us an update afterward . And that's all I have this week. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND COMMONWEALTH ENERGY GROUP, LLC TO INSTALL RETROFIT LED LIGHTING . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , a few things with this one, so we're going to introduce this tonight and then we'll ask for further information on one of the disclosures that is listed in the backup. If you notice, it's on page 45 I believe . The CEO of this company is a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 gentleman by the name of Louis T. Evans. In the disclosure he states that the one campaign contribution was given to Bill Courtright in 2017. I'm just trying to pull it up here. So the disclosure is the -- it gives you a list of municipal official s. And then one of the question s is, "Since January 1st, 2015, has the contractor , officer, director , executive level employee or owner of at least 5 percent of the company made any contribution to a municipal official or candidate for municipal office in the City of Scranton . If yes, please identify the recipient , the amount, and date of contribution ." Mr. Evans responded that he gave a contribution to Mayor William Courtright , $1,000 on December 29th, 2017. This raised a red flag for me because I do remember the reporting in the Scranton Times that Mr. Evans had given much more than that. So I went back and looked in archive s and there was an article from February 24th, 2019 that stated since January 1st, 2013 Mr. Evans gave former Mayor Courtright $11,600 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 and that -- and a November 4th, 2017 article that stated Louis Evans, Chief Executive Officer of Commonwealth Energy Corp gave $2,000 2017. So I want to make sure that the information he provided which I don't believe is correct according to the reporting that he fix this and actually put down whatever the correct amount is before we approve it. So we'll let it ride this week and introduce it. But I do want to make sure that that information is cleaned up before final passage . The other thing I wanted to mention in terms of Miss Schumacher 's comment s were what's going to be done with this building . To answer your question , in all reality -- I can't speak for the administration . But I cannot foresee a scenario where we move out of this building . I just think -- there's just too many variables . It would just be too much. And then who's going to move in. This was -- as you know, this was an issue that was addressed under Mayor Evans -- former Mayor Evans. They were looking at a bunch of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 different options . And then I think what they settled on at the time was that we were going to stay here and try to rehab the building because as we know from the report, there has to be a lot of work done. In speaking with the Mayor in the last few months on this issue, when the City was awarded the ARP funding, that may be a potential source of funds to use towards improving the building and the maintenance issues. The other thing as you know, the City applied for RACP grant through the state and got an update from Eileen Cipriani on that. And I'll double-check with her again on when that closes and when the award -- when the awards are announced . But hopefully we get that. This legislation here is to provide a savings to the City. So within the backup -- this company was actually the low bidder, $124,499. And the goal of the contract is to retrofit the lights in all the City buildings which will provide between 115,000 and $130,000 in savings for each year for the City of Scranton . The one question I did have in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 looking this over was the initial cost of the contract is $124,499. So how are we paying for that? Out of what account are we paying for that? So we'll have further details on that hopefully before the end of next week. If not, we'll table it. And that's all I have. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : One more thing on the question , in caucus Kevin -- Mr. Hayes, we did the old retrofit and you'd said you'd get a copy of that contract and forward it over to Council . If you could just get the old retrofit contract to send over to Council , that would be great. Thank you. ATTY. HAYES: Will do. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'll also vote yes only to -- to introduce only because of process . I definitely want accurate disclosure information before I even consider voting any further . Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? At this time I'll entertain -- or, I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 sorry. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.

MR. GAUGHAN : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-A. What is your pleasure ? MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-A pass reading by title. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , this is a no-brainer for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 City. The market conditions and the strength of the City's credit rating made this deal a good one for the City of Scranton . I remember a few years ago when the City's credit rating was -- it was terrible . You probably could not get a deal like this. So over the last few years the City's credit rating is we're in a much better condition . The City's going to save nearly $400,000 over the life of the note. And the interest rate is really good, 1.710 percent . The other thing I want to mention that I appreciate that the administration has done and Councilman Schuster and others brought this to light a few months ago with another deal -- another financial deal was the bond counsel . So the City and the Cognetti administration received quotes. And I don't know that that was always done in the past. And they got the lowest price proposal from Dilworth Paxson which was $13,000 plus expenses . The deals I've seen in the past, they just -- I don't know how they did it. They picked a law firm and that was it. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 that's what we were stuck with. But they actually did get proposal s this time, which is good. That's all I have. Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : I guess I'm happy to say the same thing. I know the last bond counsel was for $20,000. I put in a request for information on that that never really got answered but still waiting on that. So it is nice to see that it was put out. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Just to add quickly to that, I am happy that this is the last variable rate in the City's books. Fix rates are a lot easier to budget for. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SEVENTH ORDER.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS - FOR.
