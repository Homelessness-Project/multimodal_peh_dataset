MCANDREW : Present . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. SINGLE TAX OFFICE CITY FUNDS DISTRIBUTED COMPARISON REPORT FOR YEAR-TO-DATE SEPTEMBER 9, 2024 AND YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISON REPORT FOR SEPTEMBER 7, 2023 TO SEPTEMBER 9, 2024. 3.B. CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MONTH ENDING AUGUST 31, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one announcement for next week's caucus we're going to have PA American Water is going to be attending . I think both -- we're going to have stormwater and sewage, Frank? So if anybody from the public has any questions about PA Water, please get those questions over to Council so we could ask them while they're here in person. Thank you. MR. KING: Frank, with respect to that, in reference to the project going on on North Washington Avenue and Evelyn Street, can you find out from PA American Water, I believe , not sure if we got this answer. We didn't get a direct answer. I want to know what's flowing through those pipes, water, sewage, and is leachate going through it? I appreciate if you'd ask them each of those three question s. And I want an answer of yes or no for each of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 them. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll have that for you tomorrow . MR. KING: And when their anticipated completion date for that is. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Frank, would you like another one for PA American Water or would you like me to wait until Fifth? MR. VOLDENBERG : No, it's in the interim , I'm asking questions all along. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. I got a call on 902 West Elm Street. So in front of the address at 902 West Elm, there's a steel plate that is covering a basin. It's an American Water basin. It's been there for over a year. Can we also contact them and get that basin removed ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll send them out, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so this Saturday there's Paws in the Park Adoption Fair. So it's a collaborative event featuring several local annual welfare groups. You could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 adopt cats, kittens, and dogs. It's a lot of raffles and it starts at 11. And also, this past Sunday I attended a very well-attended fundraiser, Rasing Hell for Hoppy fundraiser . This was for our firefighter , you know, fighting stage four throat cancer. But the amount of support shown for Lieutenant Hopkins was unbelieva ble and very moving. One of the many things I love about Scranton and this community is how we always rise to the occasion and show overwhelming support for one of their own. So I'm very proud of that, very proud of that. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First is Glynis Johns. Glynis, you had signed the original slip before we put it out. Do you still wish to speak? MS. JOHNS: Yes. MR. SMURL: Absolutely . MS. JOHNS: Well, good evening , Council . It's great to stand here before you this afternoon or evening . I'm here today to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 express my profound disappointment with the 2024 Scranton Community Health and Safety Landscape Analysis , 115 page report prepare d by Mulfehan , a Washington DC non-profit at a cost on nearly $70,000 to the city. This report was intended to be the first step in understanding and addressing critical issues such as gang violence and youth violence and other forms of crime as well as to provide strategic solutions for our city. However , despite the high stakes and funding involve d, this analysis fails far short of what Scranton needs to effectively address these challenges . The report provide s a supposed as is assessment of the community and outlines national best practices . But it lacks a clear actually strategies that were -- we were hoping to have to move Scranton forward . I personally involved -- I was personally involved in this project from the beginning . The city administration reached out to me multiple times in February which is also Black History Month, a very busy time for me and my organization for interviews and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 consultations to the point where I felt almost pressured and harassed into giving my time. Despite offering my {inaudible } experience and deep insight as someone who works every day to improve the community health and safety in Scranton , the meeting felt like a significant waste of my energy. I had asked Mulfehan for details about their research methods and strategic approaches . But their responses were very vague at best and today also emphasize that. The lack of clarity in their response s is fully reflective of the final report which is riddled with issues. For example , key data in the report are not properly sourced leaving us to question the validity of their finding s. The graphs and charts are often unreasonable or poorly put together . Figure three, for example , which is meant to illustrate service calls as an example of the graph that is both unclear and cut off. Additionally , the report claims a 15 percent increase in calls for suicide attempts but provides no clear source data to back this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 claim. And I think that's important considering suicide is something that has been affecting someone I know has been affected by that. But also, I just think it's kind of lazy and sloppy just to put things out there without concise information on where you got it. These are not minor oversights . They undermine the entities -- they undermine the entire report's credibility . Beyond these technical issues, the report feels detached from Scranton 's unique challenges . The application of the CREWS method for identify ing risk and protective factors, for example , could have been copied and pasted into any other municipality 's report. Scranton deserves far better than this generic analysis that does not take our local context into account . While I appreciate the mention of improvements like proactive police work and updating hiring policies , this document fails to provide the strategic clarity and concrete steps needed to address the real root causes of violence in Scranton .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 The high risk factors listed in the report, housing , education , health risks and income and equality are not new problem s. And this report does not provide innovative or effective solutions to them. As someone who has spent years working in the field and with a background in sociology having earned a master's degree from St. Johns University , I could tell you that report would not have passed in an academic setting , let alone justify the nearly $70,000 price tag with the federal American Rescue Plan Act funds. Scranton 's residents deserve much more for this investment . And I hoped to hear a full explanation but we didn't. I hoped to hear a full explanation but it kind of fell short. I have one more minute. And I did give three examples . They didn't stick around. But I gave three examples on where this information was lacking . One, I felt like it was very much a copy and paste. We never really got -- they never explained what CREWS was, which means Community Resilience Early Warning Systems .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I was very curious about how the city or the SPD gave the data, like, what kind of data package was provided to them. There was unreliable graphs and poor presentation . An example of that is on page 33. That figure talks about what I just mentioned about certain data. And then the last point I'll just mention briefly too is the lack of data resources from major claims. An example for that is on page 42 to page 43. And I could go on and on and on. And it was just really disappointing to kind of sit there and look and see graphs cut off. You don't really know what you're looking at. And I did actually call them and recommended we had this meeting because I was just in awe by the fact that they truly didn't care. They put one slide up here, no data. They gave us no information that wasn't already shared pubically . They could barely describe what they did for our city. And so I think we should still hold them accountable and ask them to give -- they didn't even pass out any to you to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 have in public. So it feels very sloppily done. And I will yield the floor here. Thank you for listening to me and my concerns . And thank you, everybody . I appreciate us for trying to make this city more safe and understand why there is violence in the city. But that could have been a better approach . And I'm happy to continue the conversation with SPD, the city, and I just hope that the rest of the community goes and takes a look at this document so you could see exactly what I'm talking about. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . What Glynis said, ditto. Friday, September 20th, it is National POW MIA Recognition Day. And it's going to be held at 4 p.m. at the Veterans Memorial Park which is at the entrance of Scranton High School. And I don't know if you know this, but in the course of our nation's history , they estimate there have been 80,000 missing in action service members .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 But that number we figure that 38,000 have the potential to be recovered . Now, I love it when they raise the Irish flag for St. Patrick 's Day and the Italian flag for La Festa. But do you think we could take that POW MIA flag that's right next to the American flag and fly it on Friday in honor of POWs and all our missing in action service people? Whisper that into the Mayor's ear, please. Union contracts are still not available online. And do we know if the DPW negotiations have started ? Their contract expires this year. MR. SMURL: I don't know if they have begun, Joan. MS. HODOWANITZ : I hope they do. I did note however from the Controller 's report that Ufberg got another $27,000. And I also noted Item 5-I on the agenda, the LSA Grant of $150,000 for the digitization of city records . That's fine, but first you have to have a record to digitize . So we need to get going on these union contract s or we're going to turn around and we'll be renegotiating in 2026 and still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 waiting for the expired contract to be printed . Any information on the status of the annual audit? MR. SMURL: They say it's still on track. The only one we're waiting for would be the Parking Authority . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, and how about the investigation into the records that were dumped into Dix Court? MR. SMURL: I don't know the status of that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Can you tell me whether or not the results of that investigation will be made public? MR. SMURL: I don't know that, Joan. I did pose that question . And I have not receive d an answer for that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Item 5-H, the operations and facility usage assessment , you know, somehow I have this bad feeling that this is being done to justify expanding City Hall into another building . I hope that's not the case. But if we do acquire another building based on this assessment , is it going to be open to the public? I would like to know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 that. And apparently this assessment , you know, look at deficiency and want to better serve the public, one of the ways to better serve the public is to give the public access. That would go a long way. Item 5-K, the MOU on Community Violence Intervention and Prevention Program , I looked at the scope of work. And it said covers Scranton and Lackawanna County. Who has been coordinating with Lackawanna County? MR. SMURL: The City of Scranton had met with Lackawanna County, the District Attorney 's Office, the assistant DA -- MS. HODOWANITZ : So there is ongoing coordination . MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : And does Lackawanna County intend to, you know, put any funding towards the -- MR. SMURL: Yes, they are going to put in half. MS. HODOWANITZ : Oh, that's good. Let's see, Item 5-L, the MOU on tourism . Now, The Office Experience , when did the office go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 off the air? MR. SMURL: I don't know. MS. HODOWANITZ : It's been at least 10 years, hasn't it? MR. SMURL: I don't know. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I'm just wondering whether the younger generation 's even, you know, have seen it or know what that's all about. The Scranton Tomorrow , are they going to track visitor data and disclose that data to the public so we could see that this initiative is paying a dividend to us? I hope they do. And can we put the Biden home and the Biden Presidential Library on the tourism map? That would be nice. I'm laughing at that one. Item 5-J, the gateway signature branded signs, I think that's a wonderful initiative . But before that and a higher priority is street and traffic signs which are a matter of public safety. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Next is Dias? MR. SCHUSTER : Frank, back in July or early August, I sent an email asking or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 inquiring about the investigation s, both the one the data breach and also the LIPS Department . Did we -- MR. VOLDENBERG : We didn't receive a reply as of yet. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, if we could just follow up on it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: No, D-I-A-S, your last name? No? Nobody here? All right. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Scranton . Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , Scranton resident and homeowner . And I don't eat dogs. 7-D, we're giving a grant of $157,500 to the University of Scranton . They take so many buildings off the tax rolls. Why are we giving them all of this money? They need that money like I need another head. It's ridiculous . They took all of these building s off the tax rolls. They said when the -- all they do is lie. When Chipak Funeral Home was being sold, they said they weren't interested in it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I came to this podium, I said, you watch. They're going to buy that building . They did and now they're -- took it off the tax rolls and they're putting another building up. They don't need $157,000. Give it to somebody else that needs it. Next thing, years ago when Sheetz wanted to build on Linden Street, parents of the student s of Scranton High came to this meeting and said, oh, they're going to cause traffic jams and blah, blah, blah. And I came to this meeting . I said Sheetz won't cause a traffic jam. It's the parents going and picking up their kids. Go by Scranton High School 3:00 every day. They're lined up on 7th Avenue parked illegally . There's a spot for buses to park. Then they are parked all along 7th Avenue almost back to Memorial Stadium . There's a line about this wide (indicating ) from the curb. They're parked there. They're halfway into the traffic lane blocking traffic . And it's not Sheetz causing the traffic jams. It's the parents of the kids going to that school and it's a safety 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 issue. I tried to avoid that but sometimes I go by and they're all parked illegal . There's signs, no parking and they park there. The police should sit there and ticket them all. Next thing, I'm tired of talking about this. Next month is going to be two years that I was promised our corner was going to be fixed and still nothing 's done. You know, pretty soon it will be winter and another year will pass. I don't know what's going to happen. It's ridiculous . The Mayor gets her street paved. When the taxpayers want something done, nothing 's done. And I'll say it again, if Tom Preambo was the DPW Director , stuff would have been taken care of. I wouldn't have had to wait years to get our corner fixed which I was promised by the -- one of the people from DPW two years ago that it was going to be fixed. So I don't know what has to be done. But that's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Bob Bolus. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Spindler , Mr. Spindler and then Bulwer Street was added to the stormwater work that is going to be done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 in the Tripp Park/North Scranton area. So that did get added to that map. So I know it doesn't help you immediately , but it may help you in the long run. MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . On E, up at Nay Aug they need refrigeration and coolers and freezers there. I've attempt ed to donate dog food and cat food on numerous occasions , Fresh Pet and they couldn't take it. I've donated thousands and thousands of dollars of Fresh Pet Dog Good to the Griffin Pond shelter for animals. And present ly we still have stuff for them stored in cold storage compliments of Gress Refrigeration because they couldn't handle it all. And I bring trailer loads in for them. As far as the University of Scranton and D goes, they don't need any more money. It's a damn joke that we're getting hammered in the city with taxes and you want to hand these people more money. Yet, they haven't reduced tuitions or anything else for anybody . And I brought last week the reasons they have to pay taxes and the violations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 they've done to the Rule of God. It's just ridiculous that what I see going on here. I see these lights are out. If Bill Gaughan was here, he would probably have to go therapy right now his little lights weren't blinking. I see Les was in here with a Trump sucks shirt. I think it's offensive . It's people like this that have created the problem that our president got shot at twice already . I have my trailers showing where he was shot at. I eliminated the Secret Service guy that was behind him and I put the picture of Jesus Christ there, divine intervention . And that's what saved his life, not people like this. And I say it out there where it's been. I don't like radical people in my country that turn toward communism . I don't like the fact that borders were left open by Harris who is the czar that could have shut them down at any time without any permission from anybody . Ask Laken and the other girls that have been murdered , raped and aren't here today 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 on the job she did as a prosecutor , an Attorney General and everything else. She should have been a cattle farmer because they let the cattle out in the afternoon to run. She let the prisoners , convicts , murderers , rapists, drug dealers in our society including everybody that came across the border. And if that shirts represents what this county is headed for, I take offense to it right here and now. Friday the vets are going to be at the Memorial Park. Remember , that flag up there -- the two flags, the American flag, the POW, they gave their lives for this country . How many people are going to go there and honor our fellow vets? The idiots that the President looked at his watch when 13 coffins came off from Afghanistan because him and Harris allowed them to get killed. So if we want to honor people, show up there and honor the vets. When we don't put a flag up for the 80th anniversary , look at all the white tombstones in Normandy and everywhere else and then you have these clowns out protesting . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 And then you want to give the University more money because they allowed them to stand in the streets and bitch about our country and what our people gave us? They gave us the right to be here, not these idiots and it just turns me off. I've been to Hiroshima three times recovered Sargent (inaudible ) who fell in the flag raising an American flag. He's still entombed with two other Marines. And I have one more mission to go there. And I believe I located his cave to bring him home with the honors they're entitled to, not what these idiots are doing in the streets painting , knocking down our statute s and destroying our history for what these people gave their lives for. And it just turns your stomach when I see what's going on here. I have been in campaigns . I've been all over the place. We have a former president get shot at twice because people like this wearing shirts, wearing things go do this, go do that. If you don't like it, go to the polls. You're worried about birth control . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 It's a state issue. You don't want the IRS in in your house. You don't want federal government in your bed telling your people whether you could have an abortion or not. It's a state issue. Federal government cannot jurisdict over a state issue. And somebody better get it through their heads what it is. Stick up for the rights. Put the people in the state. That's where your argument is. You want more government power, federal power in our county? We already have enough of the idiots that are out there. So it's time for the American people to stand up and be counted and counted for what this election is going to mean to our county and take out what it is. I don't want to see communism in my county. And that's where Tampon Tim is taking us with Harris. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I'd like to thank Mr. Bolus for those thoughts . You know, if there's not enough crumby ads for political reasons , here's one of the worst sick, demented 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 invitation to join this party of drugs and abortion I've seen on television . And it's the one with Marie and her daughter trying to glorify the aspects of abortions . You know, I was on the mistaken belief especially for mothers of daughter s you would instill in them values and virtues , ethics, a moral code, morality and so forth. But not this woman in this. She's almost wishing for the worst for her daughter . Everybody in here has had to have seen it because it's on every 15 minutes it seems. Somebody is proud of it. I don't what kind of future that woman will have and her daughter . She's fortunate that her parents weren't proabortionists I suppose . These people just want to use abortion as a birth control at taxpayer s' expense . It's the murder of innocence no matter how you try to describe it and glorify it. I know someplace in your computers there's got to be the number of men that went to jail that were convict ed of a rape or an incest that resulted in a legal abortion . I bet it's such a small number, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 nobody will release it to the public. They keep it hidden. But it's got to be written down. I think too many of you don't want to know the truth too often. Many of you don't know your friends from your enemies . Well, I'd like to know how -- I've had three or four women at the -- senior ladies at Gerrity 's when Rosie puts me on that bench out there. Nobody got vouchers for the farmer's market. How come they weren't given out this year? There has to be some reason. MR. SMURL: Yeah, I didn't know they weren't given out. I knew they were available . But I didn't know -- MR. ELLMAN: Well, that's a disgrace . That's an absolute disgrace when money is blown all over the place wasted on grants to open up taco stands and so forth all over the city. And the seniors , nobody cares about the seniors in this leftist administration we got. Well, I got a minute left. I'd like to some up the debate to me by summing up what I think the last words in the Bible sum it up. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be upon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 you, something like that. The last words of Trump at the debate I thought they were terrific . Why didn't all of these promises Harris was bragging about up there with all those facial expressions and overacting, why weren't they done the past four years? Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lenny Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Lenny Srebro, Keyser Valley flood zone. Boy, it's been a while since I've been here. Miss me? Just like a migraine , right? MR. MCANDREW : I missed you, Lenny. MR. SREBRO: First, I want to publicly thank Joan. I don't know your last name, Joan, for the effort of trying to get us flood victims some tax relief from the flood last year. You know, nothing to jump up and down about, but it was something . And it's appreciated . I also want to thank the DPW, the officials , the directors , the supervisors , those guys for at my property at the corner there, there is a 36 inch drain pipe where the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 stormwater is supposed to go through . You know, the last time they flushed it out was a couple years back and the debris has piled up in it and the foliage and speaking to those guys, you know, they came out in a short amount of time and flushed that pipe out. So I'm thanking them, you know. Now, you know, the pipes they fixed last summer or late in the summer in the immediate area there where I live on Lafayette Street and Merrifield , they did a good job of controlling the stormwater . But now we got a new problem that's taking us back to the same thing of the flooding. All the development that's going on on the North South Road, they had to take out, like, half of that mountain , I would call it, and do something with the dirt. Well, all of that dirt got delivered to Hosko's Scrap Yard right there off of Keyser Avenue. And there's giant mounds of dirt. Now when we're getting any kind of a moderate storm, the stormwater is washing that dirt right out of his property . It's filling up the storm drains on Keyser Avenue. And it's going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 over Keyser Avenue. Now here we go again, all that flood water is coming down. Now the way I understand it talking to some officials here, some city people, is that they went into look at what's going on and he didn't have the right permits in the event of some kind of problem with all of that dirt, all of those mounds of dirt. So they shut him down right away for them taking any more dirt. Now that's been about three or four months ago. I'm wondering , like, what's going on with that? Nothing is being done with those piles of dirt. But since we had a couple of storms, now it's all mud, you know, coming down the roads. And we're back to the flooding problems because it's clogging up the drains. So why can't we get something looked into there, you know, about that pile of dirt? You could actually see the mountains of dirt right from Keyser Avenue as you just drive by Hosko's Scrap Yard. So, you know, so far we didn't have a big storm like last year's storms, multiple ones. But any time, still see the neighbors 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 every time they predict rain it's anxiety galore, you know, like, what might happen again. So please, you know, like, look into it, what's going on there before the next storm and the next flood. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Voldenberg , can you alert -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : -- code enforcement as to, you know, a followup with that amount of dirt to see where we're at? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll report back. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Srebro, did you happen to go to the county and go through the process for tax relief? MR. SREBRO: Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Were you successful with that? MR. SREBRO: Yeah, I believe so were the neighbor s, you know, we got something for that tax relief thanks to Joan for her effort. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I talked to many at the time, but they haven't spoke to me recently to let me know how that -- so thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 you for letting me know. MR. SMURL: Amber Viola. MS. VIOLA: Good evening , everyone . My name is Amber Viola. And I have some comment on the Scranton Community Health and Safety Landscape Analyst . So I am a social worker. I have my master's in social work. I graduate d from Marywood University with a concentration in research . And I would just like to say that I was appalled in reading that whole analyst . A lot of it, the data, I didn't know where it came from. I couldn't have told you where it came from. A lot of the boards that they had that they were using, the graphs and the different pie charts and things were unreadable . And a lot of those, again, did not tell you where the data -- where the studies and who they talked to really came from. Marywood University has one of the largest social work program s here in the area. The next one is down I believe in around East Stroudsburg area or that might have even already closed.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 But you have a center right here of social workers who love research , who are all needing internship s who are already graduated who are now waiting on an internship for their master's. You guys aren't utilizing the resources that we already have in the City of Scranton . And you could have paid local people to do 100 percent better job than that 115 page of mess that they came and did not answer any questions . One of my biggest concern s is the key findings of the report with the housing , social support systems, quality of education , health risk, incoming quality , lack of assets, all of those things, what does that equal at the end of it, they're giving more money to the police department . These things aren't things that policing can help. And if you start overpolicing the Scranton residents more, black resident s and brown residents will be overpoliced more just like they are now. And where in there did it say the offers to help? There's so many community groups. There's a continuum of care that we have here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 There's a lot of things in place that are already being done. Why didn't they reach out to those groups and those organizations and the people that run those organizations and talk to them and speak to them? Why didn't they reach out to the NAACP here chapter that we have to sit down and talk to people about the different things. Again, my biggest takeaway from that is the amount of money that our police department is going to get because of this report and that amount of money is going to go policing black and brown children here in this area. And I just hope that we get some answers . I also hope that we can try to keep things a little bit more local. There's organizations and there's people who are more than equipped who would've cost way less money and you guys could have gotten an actual report that would have answered a lot of your questions that you have while you were sitting up there. The second thing I would like to say is it is voter registration day. We are having a voter registration drive at the pocket park 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 on the corner of Linden and Wyoming on Saturday from 1 to 4 p.m. It is sponsored by NAACP. And we'll have free food. It's from one to four. I also wanted to ask a question about the voucher s for the farmers market because I have been contact ing people for the last two years about getting them for disable d veteran s. I have been getting a runaround. I've called and talked to about seven different people about that specifically . There are a lot of disabled vets. We have a very high veteran population here. It's the second highest in the nation. I'm one of them. We are suffering . When everybody else is suffering through the economy and housing crisis and different things, food shortages, we're suffering even more. A lot of us are disable d. And we pay our rent out of our disability . Veterans still have to pay for daycare. We still have to pay for housing . We still have to pay for car insurance , car payment , all of those things. So when my landlord raised my rent by $300, that money is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 coming directly out of my veteran 's benefit s. So myself and a lot of people are trying to offset that. That's why I contacted the county and a bunch of different people for the vouchers for veterans to be able to use the -- what is it -- the farmer's market, there you go. I'm sorry, my mind went blank, the farmer's market. And that is all I have to say. Thank you. I yield. MR. MCANDREW : So what do they say then -- MS. VIOLA: Honestly , I wasn't ever getting a response . They would tell me to contact somebody else and then to contact somebody else and then contact somebody else. And by the time I would go through that whole process , it's the end of the season. And this is the second year I've been trying to get it for veterans in this area. MR. MCANDREW : I know in past two years they actually handed them out at the market. MS. VIOLA: Yes, but it wasn't for disabled veterans .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. MCANDREW : I understand , yeah. But I believe that at least occurred . MS. VIOLA: Yes, it did. They did give them out. MR. MCANDREW : Someone was concern ed about not having it all this year. MR. VIOLA: They did give them out by hand. I'm not sure, Miss Norma, did they mail them before -- MR. MCANDREW : Not everybody can make it there. So that's a -- MS. VIOLA: Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Miss Viola, did you get a copy of this report, like, a paper copy? MS. VIOLA: No, I did not get a paper copy. I have it online. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, there's an appendix in the back that does say some of the individuals and the agencies that were -- contacted . If you want this copy, you could have it because a lot of them are in that continuum of care. I'm also a mental health professional and I felt the same way about the study. MS. VIOLA: And I would just like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 add, I mean, we have a lot of resources here. And I know a lot of other areas are having social workers work with the police department . And I have a lot of contact s at Marywood and the social work department . And all of us have talked about this subject repeatedly because this is what my dissertation was on. And we are more than willing to step in and help if they are looking for social workers who could come in and help. So thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Another thing I just wanted to say about the study is, although it was Council approve d, it did come from the administration . Okay. MS. XANTHIS : Hello, Kristen Xanthis . I believe I spoke to Mr. Voldenberg many times about the new building on Dickson Avenue when it was being put up. You know, the (inaudible ) was being put up just before, you know, they hit ground for it. You know, everybody came down there for their pictures and stuff and I expected that. Well, the building 's up. The building 's been up for a little while now, not too long. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 About a month after the building is up, everything is falling apart. I mean, myself personally , you know, I don't live there. But I feel bad for the people that live there. The manager was fired. So there is no manager over there. There is no help. It used to be that the garbage was picked up super early which was out of control like four in the morning when it's right near my house. Now you get periods of time where the garbage is not picked up at all. There is some trouble with -- I can't say it here in front of everybody because I'm speaking on camera. There's some trouble with some people that are living there. I can't say -- I would never say anything , but I had somebody that was home -- I had somebody come look at a wall in my driveway and we're looking at the wall having it repaired slightly and I hear a noise behind me in my yard. And there's just, you know, a woman from the building trying to dig holes in my yard with a metal detector . So, I mean, you know, I think maybe, you know, somebody should come down there and check on things in that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 building since that building was suppose d to be like -- since it's called Scranton Square, I mean, I think somebody should get some help down there. I asked many times about a light down there which, you know, you can't get people to answer a door to go for a petition . So usually everybody is -- just stays in their house and nobody answers their door. And half the time -- I understand people are at work during the day. But, I mean, then you got the thing about safety down there. I mean, yesterday actually there was a cop down that way for about an hour. But other than that, there's nothing . I think either maybe somebody if, you know, I mean, I'm not going to call City Council again because I bothered them enough. But, I mean, somebody needs to get down there because I called them twice in charge of that place, the main place, my mother did. And they were going to have somebody speak to the resident s because they can't be, like, coming onto properties and digging holes in the ground, which I don't know why she was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 digging up holes to look in the dirt with a metal detector . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Well, we've had our nice conversation today. It's been kind of mixed up here. But the first thing I have is Pennsylvania American Water, having them come here and have a half-hearted conversation with them really offers no benefit to the residents because what really has to happen to Pennsylvania American Water is, the city has to regain control of the water system and the sewer system. If you remember two or three weeks ago I came in here with a plastic jar full of water. It was orange for the best way to describe it. And this is the sludge that residents are drinking . And then when you see what the City of Scranton did to the Sewer Authority and you combine that with the water bill, you're driving Scrantonians into poverty . And I don't know why the Scrantonians just can't use the process of condemnation and take the water system and the sewer system back because the money that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Scranton Sewer Authority sold -- the city sold the Sewer Authority for, it wasn't any benefit to the residents . It really diminished their quality of life and their standard of living. And we need to find some real solutions to our long-range problems . And, you know, there's a lot of politics here as Bob Bolus talked about the shirt that Les had on, I believe it's freedom of speech. I really think the Democrats have really caused a lot of problems in our country calling Trump a threat and that somebody has to deal with him or kill him. And it's been going on for quite a few years now. But, you know, what goes around, comes around. And you see we have a police officer standing here. So, I mean, if somebody went out of their mind and decided they were going to come in here with a handgun and shoot everybody in here, that police officer wouldn't even slow them down. Is that the kind of rhetoric we want to bring into politics ? Does it really belong there? The Democrats have done that. Maxine Waters said 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 hunt the Republicans down wherever you find them. So as we move down this road to the third world where we're heading , you know, we sit here. We watch these meeting s. Everybody is talking about the government , the government giving me money, the government doing a study. You know, Malcolm X said that the most dangerous thing to the black man is a white liberal , okay? And when you take a look at abortion , abortion was brought forward by a white female liberal . And the people being killed in general were black children . And when you look at the CDC statistics , one quarter of American women have an abortion . And when you take a look at the statistics that we're teaching sex in school, I think we need to take a look because I don't know why we'd ever teach young girls about sex -- not that boys should learn anything either. But even the studies like Anna Mackin and all the sociologists say that it's just terrible . And, you know, when you look at statistics for crime, rape, murder, you know, children with no father, boys and girls -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 girls need their father more than the son does. And the damage done to those children is off the scales. And all the psychologists aren't going make it right. But you know what we've done, we've allowed politics to enter into every drop of our lives. And it's really destroyed every inch of us just like Facebook market -- you know, not Marketplace but Facebook and all the platforms just spewing hatred and garbage . Okay, and then when you look at how society is collapsing and it is collapsing , okay, they are hunting police down in the streets and they are killing them. Okay, don't forget that Kamala Harris was bailing people out of jail that were burning cities down. Okay, I mean, this is her claim to fame. And when you listen to what Joe Brown says who is a judge in California , she got everywhere by sleeping with men. She had no ability at all of her own. She has no case law to support her practicing law or anything . And there's people that are going to go out there and vote for her. But yet the people that made the earrings she wore at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 debate where Trump said they're hers and there's microphones in them. And when you listen to her speak just like the black journalist who interview ed her today, she can't speak on her own and people are talking about electing her. It's a travesty . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. That's all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. LITTLE: Hi. I'm Rik Little currently hanging around Scranton . I'd like to talk about media and schooling . I got this brain worms -- I want to talk about this book here. I think everybody should read it. I think it's really relevant to Scranton . This song -- they're eating your dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there. That's the song. I got to get that out of my -- anyway this book Unmasked came out in 2021. It's by Andy Ngo. And he talks about Rose City Antifa. And I think it's sort of relevant because I remember when Antifa was and BLM were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 invited to the city and then I was seeing, you know, they spray painted all cops are bastards -- their thing -- ACAB right on the (inaudible ) statute and then I see this county guy cleaning it up. And I'm wondering -- I was wondering at the time why does nobody do anything because they the camera's aiming right at it, you know, they know who did it. They were invited in by the mayor who was from Portland . But let me talk about Rose City Antifa. That's the first Antifa in America . Now, Antifa goes back a real long time. And there's a lot of confusion about it, the same confusion that everybody has about communism , socialism , fascism , democracy . People don't know mainly because of the schools and the media. They don't let people know. But Antifa was first started in Europe by the -- in Germany they were the Brown Shirts RAW who was an ally of Hitler. It was the -- he was gay -- not that there's anything wrong with that. But, you know, they were going around murdering people. And then there was the Black Shirts 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 in Italy. This was the first antifascist thing. And it went into the Frankfurt school and it came in Germany , came to America and it's eroding on our democracy because they are using violence . And they are using racism. That's the whole BLM thing. And one thing -- I remember when I first heard about BLM I was very confused because to me BLM is the Bureau of Land Management . People forget about Hillary Clinton selling 20 percent of our uranium to, you know, through a shell company in Canada selling to Russia. We got communism all around us here and one of the biggest problems in Pennsylvania is the way they've shaped the Courts and shaped law enforcement and especially through the Attorney General when Josh Shapiro was Attorney General and certified the election s for Pennsylvania and now he's Governor . But all of through this time, Antifa was funded by George Soros. I have pictures of advertise ments come be a peaceful protest or. We all remember them burning down the cities, burning down Portland , burning down Seattle . But we have to start looking at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 government here. What bothers me a lot is democracy . I remember this week reading a quote from -- alleged quote from Bill Gaughan . I don't care how many signatures are gathered , we are not removing the Biden signs. What kind of democracy is that? I mean, I've tried everything I can. All they tell me is you need to get a lawyer. But there needs to be changes here. And I hope everybody reads this book. And I hope you zoomed in on it so people -- it's recommended by Tucker Carlson. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta . Is it fair to say we have a DPW and the Parks and Recreation Department ? Yes. Then why would there be elected official s, City Council man be doing work at city parks? You understand that he's taking work away from our union members and it isn't fair to them. I come from a pro-union family. A grievance should be filed against Mr. Smurl immediately . It's bad enough he has keys to the park property . The federal and state government has a key sign out system and that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 works. It works for them. Why not implement a key sign out system in the City of Scranton ? You remember April, 2023, when the keys to the City Hall were lost? Remember the damage that was done to City Hall? Do we remember the Lackawanna County Prison, remember the key scandal there? Do we remember the power washing issue because somebody had keys and was using city equipment ? Did we forget about that? If Mr. Smurl is volunteering at the parks, Conner Park and Nay Aug Park, which is fine as long as it's approve d by our union officials ; and if it is approved , would Mr. Smurl carry insurance in the event of injury or damage to any of vehicle s while he's cutting grass and the rocks and dirt are going all over the vehicle s as it was Sunday at Nay Aug Park. And does he check with anybody from the Park and Recreation Department of the city if the grass needs cutting or the weeds -- so-called weeds are there for a reason? Are they a buffer zone to anything ? Are your volunteers vetted and are background checks done as they work in city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 parks where children are? And if they are vetted and you have background checks, can you produce them? Mr. Smurl, without snidely comments and a little bit of respect because all I am is a concerned citizen asking questions , will you be willing to sign off your park key when you use it and when you bring it back? Have a good night, Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . I understand this podium is often place of criticism , sometimes hopeful constructive criticism . It's true that people do come here to complain . This is a place to address our grievances . That's how it's supposed to work. When people reach out to 311 and get blown off, call and ask and are told for years they're on the list, soon, just wait. It breeds a negative reaction at this podium. Some praise and cheer, others will be vocal and address that the emperor has no clothes . Sometimes the simple as a disingenuous comment on how things are getting better and reaching back to Freach and Keen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 murders 51 years ago to validate five deaths in the first five months of this year that they are no different as if nothing is new or unusual . Well, it's not equivalent . Sometimes the anger is from the unsheltered person who is not being helped by a task force who must get a certification to prove that he's homeless . Don't worry. Sit under a bridge hopefully elsewhere . We are working on it -- we are working on -- working on something in the future. Even Mr. Little's words if you listen closely , there is some validity . He asked is Scranton a sanctuary city. It's not. But I believe some of the question goes back to Sister Adrian Barrett and the Little Sisters of the Poor importing people from Mexico and South America to this region. Why would they do such a thing? The Catholic church was floundering . It watched more vacant masses than (inaudible ) and blood. It was outdated and becoming cash poor. The solution was to import highly religious people who would work, more importantly they tithe and they tithe well.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 Money was the base for the floundering church to the city who offered a de facto church sanctuary . I think it has a lot to do with nonprofit s with a vested financial interest and having operating a sanctuary importer for self gain in the city. Happy thought s, you have done remarkable things. This is the first year in a long while you've succeeded in resolving the issue of Scranton 's lack of lifeguards . And the pool at Nay Aug Park is due to be open September 20th of 2025. Never have I seen a September opening of an outdoor pool. So that should be a new one. Last session on LSA Grant for the U of S, this new workforce center, I understand we like passthrough grants for anything because Scranton as a middleman gets a 5 percent cut off the top. The LSA grant is not from the Scranton budget but it's off gambling fees tagged for public grant use. We're the gatekeepers of that. First, let's address the new workforce building . It's only a small part of that building .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 The University of Scranton has had a small business development center established in 1980. What has it done for 44 years? Can you tell us? So only a small amount if you look at the University -- that the University received for the same building 16.62 million from Cartwright's 2023 Community Project Funding request bringing our fair share of federal tax dollars back to a region is the main reason he ran for Congress . So the U of S gets the equivalent of 25 percent of Scranton 's entire rescue plan into 2023 alone and yet is still feeding at the trough. And I believe there was no pilot this year. Have you looked at the 65 pages of the proof requesting grants across the states for LSA, most are for sidewalks , equipment , waste facilities , bridges , paving, sewers, EMS, parks, animal shelter . Chestnut hill Township just got a 130,000 for a salt shed rehabilitation . We can only apply for non-profits as a passthrough for the most part. As a passthrough , know you can say no. Last, we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 have a splash pad and it seems no long-term insurance s in the contract for repairs, shocking . We have addressed this as a -- have we addressed this as a vendor providing substandard work and have we removed them from the vendor's list? For the bridge product and the walkway, there was a LSA under the Penn Avenue Corridor Project Grant for $472,317. So who was the designer and architect who made an entire plan, started construction without properly assuring ground stability ? Have they been removed from the approve d vendor's list? I understand right now we're in it for a penny for a pound. But we shouldn 't be there for a second time. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I returned to Scranton about seven years ago, a little over seven years now. And I've been coming to City Council at least six of those seven years to -- because I wanted to learn more about Scranton . I want to learn more about how it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 had changed from when I left to when I got married and left Scranton and when I returned. So I came to City Council and different meeting s so that I could find out about my city. One of the things that I learned over that time is that we do have a free speech. We do have the opportunity to make a difference . We have an opportunity by volunteering and helping with the city. The City of Scranton is not perfect . I'm not sure there's a city throughout the United States that's perfect . But there is room for change. And in order to do that change, we as volunteers need to get out there and make a difference . Does everything that we do result in being change, no. But we also have to try to make a change. As I sat here tonight and listened to the different renditions of who has free speech and who doesn't. We all have that free speech as we're citizens of the United States. But we do not have that right to insult or embarrass anyone. So for the things that I've heard tonight I kept thinking what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 happened to City Council ? What happened to the things that we used to just come and discuss those things that were of importance to making Scranton a better city. So I looked at the rules of our Council . They've changed . I don't know when they changed , but they changed . So I don't know what brought about this change that gives everyone a right to come to this podium and speak about anything that's on their heart. It used to be that you spoke about something that was a benefit for all of us in Scranton . One of the things that it says you're not to address a particular City Council member. That's right here. And yet we sit here and we let them do that. That's not right. We're to follow either -- if these are the latest rules, then we should follow these rules. If they changed, then we should have a revision date on them as to when they changed because they're not the same rules that I've read over the last six years. So I don't know what prompted this change to these rules for City Council . But I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 think that we as those that come to this podium deserve an explanation of exactly what is supposed to be discussed at this podium and not so many different -- my ideas and of what I think and how I want and to berate anyone else that may be speaking something that is different than what their thoughts are. I've been volunteering -- you could see my shirt. I've been volunteering my own time, not with any organization to get people to register to vote because that's the only way we could make a difference is to vote. First of all, you have to be registered . If you've moved and you don't have the same address as you had before, you do need to put an application in. And the office is down at Lackawanna -- Wyoming Avenue. I always want to call it the Globe Store. But it's the Lackawanna County building . And you could just either pick up your application there or take the application s back. But that's the only way we could make a difference , not berating anyone and talking about because they're wearing a particular shirt or what their particular 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 convictions are. So get out and vote. Go register . And that's how you could make a difference , okay? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Okay, I still have jotted down here on recycling . I don't know what you plan to do with Mr. DeNaples . But he's claiming that the recycling comes in too mixed with cans and bottles . And instead of paying a hundred dollars a ton to dispose of it, we wind up getting about $200 a ton. So I would suggest that either we decide whether we want to get glass bottles out of the equation or go with double barrels and have a week for cans and a week for bottles and glass, simply put. And, oh, some good news. DeNaples abandoned the idea of dumping his garbage tea water over the -- into the tributary that runs right through Nay Aug Park. So that was a wonderful thing that I heard. We don't need it. Pay for it. Get removed . Now, we are at 40 percent tax exempts . And if anybody is interested in an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 exclusive Scranton taxpayer 's association , talk to me sometime and maybe we could get something set up and we stick our to nitty. It's, no, oh, why do we have to have separation of church and state. You know, it's like because people will go to jail and you have to pay for them and all their lives they pay no taxes anyway because they are washed out by the time they get out. That's why. Okay, now, a lot of nasty things we're saying about some of the loveliest people I know, women. And in Georgia before I came here, two women have died waiting for hours over a failed pregnancy , 20 hours the one women waited. And she died on the operating table because the doctors were afraid that it was going to be by some zealous DA declared a convenience abortion . Another one, she waited hours because she had a healthy birth but she was unable to expel the afterbirth. So it just festered there for hours. And, oh, by the way, if that was your wife or you were the person involved -- the one involved , who's responsible 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 bills when you to the hospital ? Now, if you have insurance , fine. If you don't have nothing , that's too bad. That's just too bad. You wind up -- some states allow them they report you to the credit bureau and everything else. You know, it's just insane. And furthermore , the 2025 project names to eliminate birth control availability , eliminate it. They don't want to give you a choice. They just want to put you into a corner. Now the average middle class, if you have two kids in school, in Scranton that's $30,000 a year. So how much is the middle class the salt of the earth? How much? If your -- every year, that's 360,000 or something like that for two kids, year in and year out. I mean, you know, things really get construed here -- and by the way, everybody that took a potshot at poor Donald so far was a former Republican voter. Beat each other up, don't blame me. Beat each other up. Get a ring and go have a fight there. Up behind Nay Aug Park, I mean, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 people shoot up each other up there so why not, you know? This is ridiculous . You blame other people for all the problems . And you're too busy creating them. Oh, we rolled back the railroad regulation s and the train wrecks and lose a whole downtown . Well, you know, Joe was in office so how convenient . Joe was in office. That happened under him. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Have a good night. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . Tonight I'm going to start with a little story. About 10 years ago I was honored to manage a campaign for the late Chris Arnone. He ran for Register of Wills. He didn't really have too much hope because Mulligan was on the same slate against our former corrupt Mayor. So Chris and I went to 151 events and really got to know a good friend once again. The night of the election we had the party at Samario 's on Market Street. After the results came in we walked outside , shared a moment together . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 In that moment I saw that he was a little teared up. I said, Chris, what's wrong? You did everything the right way. And I'm very proud of you. He said, no, we're not done yet. He took his cane and he pointed across the street. Over at Stirna's was Fran Kovaleski 's party. That was Chris's opponent . Also there was Linda Munley. And so we went across the street. We're going to congratulate her in person. So we managed to go across the street. We go to open the door and he said we'll be in and out in a matter of five minutes . We made our way up the steps. She had a lot of people and rightfully so. She's a good woman. So as we walked in, we started to get everybody 's attention and I raised a hand and I said, ladies and gentlemen , let me have a moment of your time. Chris Arnone is here to congratulate Fran and thank Linda for her years of service . He immediately grabbed an astound ing response . Everybody started clapping and shaking his hand. We went over and congratulate d and said thank you. And 35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 minutes later he walked out the door. And he said, wow, that was a lot longer than I expected. First of all, you don't see that anymore. Secondly , I said to him, I said, I really admire the fact that you put yourself out there like that. Well, he said to me, he put his arm around me and he said, Mike, you'll know when the time is right. Well, the current climate of our city, the situation that we're in. And it's not all doom and gloom. There's many of us here that stand before Council that show up week after week bringing things to the city that we feel need a response . This isn't a one person show. This is a big city, 27.7 square miles, many intersection s, many kids going to our local schools . And, you know, we're trying to do our part. We're trying to help out. We don't want to see doom and gloom. All right. We want what's best for the city. Unfortunately , a few of us operate on a different level. You know, we get answers to questions and that's how you go about doing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 it. And when you care you stand before a body like this, no sheets of paper and you just talk from your heart. I heard a lot of that tonight . Many of us bring things before this Council because we care and we want to make a difference . I feel strongly though that our current situation in this administration isn't helpful to us. We have a Mayor that shows up at 10:30, leaves at the last photo op. Part-time Paige isn't the answer for us. You know, we could do better. We're experiencing a lot of calls. There was one the other evening at the football game. You know, families can't even enjoy a game without an incident anymore. And, you know, all of us care about the police department . We truly do. They're there for us every time when we need them. And we want to do our part. You know, we opened up a crime watch in West Scranton because we care. Now, I think the rest of this city needs the same. So take down my number, 570-980-0113 or you could reach me on Facebook . I want to do my part and try to help 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 out the best I can. If you want to start a crime watch, get in touch with me. There is several of us that would be more than happy to meet and help get you set up because together , I think we could make a difference . And I think this body has a heavy lift. That railway system is coming in in four years. And together we need to do our part. Thank you. Good evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: The DPW contract negotiation s, Frank, can you reach out and find out when they're schedule d to begin? I think that contract is up in December of this year. So I was just wondering about that. Also, the individual that was in here concerning Dickson Avenue, I know Mr. Schuster and I were talking . Is there any way we could put a request in to have them go down and evaluate whether we could get a streetlight down on that street? It sounds like it's -- they've been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 looking for one for a while. There's a new building down there. It seems like they would benefit from one. But if we could look into that, that would be greatly appreciated . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, Mr. King. MR. KING: Appreciate that. I already spoke about North Washington Avenue with the Pennsylvania American Water if you could look into that for us. I think that's all I have for right now. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, actually to follow up Mr. King, I wish Kristen stuck around because we could have got her one of those petitions to request that streetlight although she said she had some difficulty with some signature s. It could have been something we could have done on the spot for her. I have several different things to talk about tonight if everybody could follow with me because it's a broad range. Since we discussed bringing Mulfehan in to do this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 report, I've criticized the company . There was a lot of criticism coming out of that company to start. I felt after reading their first report -- well, the city was actually volunteered to be part of their first study. Federal money was used to do that study. And after reading that first report and what came out of that first report, I felt it was a waste of city funds to conduct the second one. Their collection methods and their findings are subjective . It's my opinion that a lot of assumption s are made which is a common criticism of their type of study, especially when it comes to using it to form policy and drive decisions . I'm going to be watching how this study drives some of those policy decision s and I'll have some reservation s with that. I wasn't sure how their indicators were moved. There's a lack empirical validation of their indicators which causes bias, speculation , and flawed assumption s which was one of the fears of mine. So I'm sure I'll bring this up in the future. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 I reached out to Eileen Cipriani about an audit update. And it looked like we got a response that 2023 audit is waiting for completion of the receipt of the Scranton Parking Authority which they've been informed will be completed in October . And we're being told that that's the last piece of the 2023 audit. I also requested of her about demolitions in the city and if there were funds still available for city demolitions and she stated that they do have a redevelopment and blight coordinator on staff and that they're going to have to circle back with me on whether there's still funding left over for those demolitions . Some other questions I had last week when it comes to a pilot, it does look like the University of Scranton donated $150,000 in pilots this year. It was on January 3rd of 2024. I know that we got some of those numbers towards the end of last year. I don't know if we were told -- can we just find out that there was a 2023 pilot from the University of Scranton and also this January of 2024 pilot? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. I'm not sure if we were told in December if there would be one in January , so just making sure there was one for each year. I asked about the homeless task force. I asked, you know, since the Supreme Court ruling came down and that other municipalities might be taking action have we seen an influx in the vagrant population in the City of Scranton . I was just given an answer of no. But my question from the week prior had several different -- there was several different questions . And I'm not sure no -- what the answer no was referring to. But one of the questions I did ask was who leads that committee . And we got the answer that Mayor Paige Cognetti leads the meeting s. There was a question about the inactive city accounts and whether we were charged for having those accounts open. And the city has not been charged for inactive city accounts of those ones that were closed for however long they were open.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 I asked some question s about the electric vehicle s. I asked if we leased 10 vehicle s in 2024 -- or 2023. We leased an additional two in 2024. I asked if they were the same make and model because within a month or two of us getting that lease they were -- that make and model was discontinued . And so I was told that the make and models were Chevy Equinoxes and not the make and model of the original lease. The two vehicles leased were Equinoxes . The new vehicle for 2025 will be leased through the same program . The make and model will be determined in 2025. They said please note that the Chevy Volt may come back into production . So although it was discontinued at that time it may be back into production . I had several questions about recycling . I asked for the average tonnage from years past for October and November , December . It seems to be about 100 ton per month. I asked if the BA's Office did a cost analysis to determine whether we should continue with our recycling program and how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 much they estimate that it was costing us. So based on the city administration preliminary analysis , the increase cost at $120 a ton and recycling is going to cost us $100,000 annually more. If we're looking at some of these numbers , it looks like it may be even more than that. But that was the number that we were given at this point in time. When looking at weather the program is -- we should continue with the program based on the new costs, they said that they were reviewing the recycling program . In 2020 there was several other responses to RFPs that were given that were above that $120 per ton. I asked how the city is currently verifying whether our recycling is clean and not contaminated and within the recycling company 's guidelines . The answer that we received was administration was request ing a meeting with the representation s of the Recycling Center to discuss those guidelines and any concerns that they may have. Also a question that was asked was, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 how many tons were not taken as recycling and charged that new $120 rate. And the answer was since the new rate started in August, the city was invoiced at 88.26 tons at the rate of $120 per ton. Next, we got an update on 614 North Sumner Avenue, two vehicles were also removed from that property . And code enforcement will advise on the trimming of that property and DPW. So thank you, Mr. Voldenberg , for that update on that property . I discussed 902 West Elm earlier in the meeting about that steel plate over the basin. There were two other properties that I had -- I have been e-mailing these for quite some time, one was 1623 Jackson Street. We have been getting complaint s since 2022. I know we definitely put them in in 2023. It doesn't seem that there is any improvement there. And then 925-927 Oxford. What I'm getting from the neighbors is there's a lot of construction going on, new roofs, material s on pallets out the front. And it seems like there's no permits on that property . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get a status 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 on both, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. That should be all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. First, one of the responses that I received I had asked about the cost of Purple Paper Eaters to be picking up our recycling from -- our shredding recycling from City Hall. And I was told that paper shedders are $260 per month. So that is not a bad price for us to be able to securely dispose of shredded material from the city. And that's a little over $3,000 per year. So I think the city can handle that. And I'm glad that we have those in place. And some of the properties I asked about last week still haven't gotten responses on. But for the rear of 621 Alder Street that neighbor s in South Side keep asking about. There's still an active warrant for the property owner of that and there's been no response from them. So that, you know, hopefully with the committee that's going to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 formed properties like that will be taken care of. But that's the status of it as of now and what we've receive d from the magistrate . And I'd asked about 801-803 Madison Avenue. There's a property that had a fire sometime ago and I wanted to see the status of that. And there was a condemnation at least request just placed a few weeks ago by the property owner. So it looks like they want to rehabilitate the property and rent it out again in the future. And lastly, I just wanted to bring up the Mulfehan report. I appreciated having them in tonight to explain the results but wasn't really impressed by the presentation and what we were provided with. I was hopeful that would provide the city with a sense of direction and better detailing in what we could do as a city to prevent crime and violence . And I think that -- I know we still have a lot of work to do. I want to know from the administration , I want to have discussions with them as to what next steps are going to be now that we have this report what we're going to -- what we're going to take away from it, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 any actions that the city is going to take out of their report. I also want to know if the SPD is going to be perform those ongoing data analysis that we spoke of tonight and how frequent of a basis that's going to -- that's going to be. If that's something that's going to be helpful for them, then I want to make sure that they're going to be doing that and that they have the capacity to do it. And that's -- those are my thought s on it for now. But that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I got a few. So I'm definitely going to start with Mulfehan . I wasn't happy with the report we never knew about a couple years that was presented to us that identified veterans as extremist and domestic terrorists . Are you kidding me? So, of course, I did not vote for the second one. The first one, the same people were used for data collection . Guess who? The administration . Second one, data collection , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 administration , didn't talk to the school district but said they're failures , didn't talk to the hole city and said they were failure s for the most part, very vague as last time. They were smart enough this time not to identify different sectors in the city as extreme terrorists or domestic terrorist s or extremist . I noticed that. That I noticed . But what jumped out at me too is we came here tonight and we were told we were getting a PowerPoint . We got a one-page PowerPoint . We got a one-page PowerPoint . All right, wasn't happy with that. If you're going to defend yourself and say that you did all of this data collection because they were under contract when five homicides occurred in the city, they were under contract in collecting data when lieutenant -- poor Lieutenant Gilmartin got shot in the head, not a peep from them until now. And what do they bring us? Well, I think we need to do more data collection . They're trying to get another contract . I asked. So I wasn't happy with them. I wasn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 with the first report. I wasn't happy with this report. I know some data collection I believe the Chief is happy with and that's fine. But guess what, Mulfehan should be done. And I don't want to see them come around again for another contract . All right. So moving on, so our friend Derek Raines has been coming here, the poor disabled gentleman who's been coming here for as long as I'm here. The poor guy can't get in and out of his driveway to go to therapy . He has a -- you know, because of the conditions of the road and the layers of blacktop. He was happy to report to me today or yesterday he said, Mark, you know what, they're finally here digging it up, multiple layers. They're finally doing the work. And, of course, he couldn't be here tonight . But he wanted me to relay to DPW that he's -- how happy he is and he wants to compliment them and, again, say, you know, very happy for the work they're doing. And I'm glad to hear that because he's waited multiple years for this to happen. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 So I'm glad to hear it too. Also, this is an issue that comes up all the time. It's the corner of railroad and Luzerne Street. There's a vacant service station used to be there, a gas station or whatever you want to call it. There's issues there where people park there. There's issues with, you know, blight and overgrown. But in addition to that as you go past that up Luzerne on the right, of course, you know that is the bridge that everybody gets stuck under. But this resident is complaining again that there's, you know, it's in rough shape again. There's litter. There's sleeping bags. And I know every once in while someone will clean it up. But it's usually a resident which is nice. But we need to find out for sure once and for all if you could please alert the railroad department and, of course, you know, our City Code Enforcement because I know DPW will clean it up because they're great guys. But we need to know who is actually responsible for that because when we don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 know, it's not consistently taken care of. Could you please look into that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. What else do I have here? So also, I agree with the two speakers tonight . We have a POW flag right behind me and why that's not hung when it should be is beyond me. And my understanding because people come here all the time and say can we fly this flag -- and they could speak to us. And I want to the public to know that hanging a flag out front of this building is at the total discretion of the Mayor. We have no power over that. But, you know, Friday is a big day for POWs. I think it's reasonable , you know, if we ask the Mayor if she would kindly hang that flag. And she doesn't have to go out and get one. There's one right here. If you could please do that, send that correspondence over to the Mayor. MR. VOLDENBERG : We will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 know if everyone is in agreement . I should have asked everybody up here if you're in agreement . If not, I still want it asked. That's fine. Also, on 3 -- 3100 hundred Grimes Avenue, I'm being told that there are branches that are growing out over Davis Street obstructing the view. Safety issue, so I think we need to take care of that, okay? I also posed recycling questions last week. And my answer was refer to Mr. Schuster 's question . But mine were a little different or the answer I got was they're in conversation or will be in conversation with our vendor. So I also agree that, you know, okay, initially recycling is suppose d to produce revenue . Initially recycling is suppose d to, you know, put less in the landfill . But we're not receiving any revenue . We're paying to have our recyclable s recycled . And I know a couple years ago the commingled recycling for most of this area in our country went to China. They took care of that for us. Guess what, they don't want to do it anymore. We knew that. I know that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 put it out to bid, tried to find someone else that would do it. And I guess, you know, it would cost more than our current vendor. But we have to think outside the box. I don't believe -- because I know -- I did a little research , not a lot. But I know that, you know, plastic bottles , 10 percent of them are -- maybe 10 percent are made into new plastic bottles with some virgin fill they call it or virgin plastic . But cans could be recycled into cans for an eternity . So maybe, okay, since we have to pay so much for this separat ing and the commingling , you know, maybe we just have another pickup. You know, I remember not picking up cardboard. That was recent. And I'm hearing we should definitely get money for that. But we're not. We're paying for cardboard which is absurd because it's separated . It's not dirty. It's not mixed with cans or bottles . So maybe, you know, we should look into it, what would it, you know, is there any cost benefit to separate it ourselves, you know, have one can for glass 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 or bottles , one can for aluminum , you know, maybe stagger it like we do for the cardboard a different week or every two weeks or every three weeks. But at least if that could be, you know, in the conversation as something maybe we can do to reduce the cost because we're not hearing that. All we're hearing is we got to pay more. We'll talk to them. We look for other vendors . But maybe we need to do it because we're paying -- we have to pay for recyclable s when they land there. But we have to pay people to pick them up, our people to pick them up. It's almost like it's not worth it. And, of course, you know, we care about the environment . Of course, there was an act -- a recycling act -- I don't know. I forget it. Last week I knew. I think it was 2000 or 1988, whatever . But we're being charged more, like, and I'm not saying not recycle and to put it in the garbage , but it would be cheaper for us. It shouldn 't be if we're going to recycle and do the right thing. So I think we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 need to think outside of the box. I think administration needs to maybe reach out to other municipalities see what they're doing. Maybe they figured it out and we haven't yet. But just to pay and pay every increase and accept it, we're not budgeted for that, that increase . I don't think so. I doubt we are. But I think we need to have a continued discussion with recycling and what we're going to do. I know administration says they're going to be talking , but we need to be included in that on conversation , all right, so the public will be aware. And thankfully , that's all I have. All right. So, you know, I brought forth an issue with the crossing guards and about, you know, they're grossly underpaid . They're first line of defense every morning with the kids. They put up with parents , students , people driving by. They put up with the elements . And, you know, they came and reached out to me and wanted, you know, some type of increase . They make $20 a day, folks. So we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 have been talking about it and our solicitor has been in conversation with the administration at the Scranton School District because we share the cost. And I know that we're finally getting there. We're getting somewhere . And hopefully soon we'll have an agreement and how it's going to be introduced because it wasn't clear how it was done in the past. There is no record of it here in the city. There should be something . If they don't have the legislation , recreate the past legislation . I guess the city used to -- the district use to have some type of MOU. But both entities are working on that just so the people out there who, you know, reached out to me, be aware that we're still working on this. And it's probably going to happen or should happen. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . 5-B. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
