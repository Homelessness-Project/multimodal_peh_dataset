MR.

Let us think about them. Let us think about their families , those who are suffering from the Coronavirus . Let us think now about the doctors , the nurses, the researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they find protection and peace.

Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? No comments ? Okay. If not, received and filed. Do any council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I have a couple. Okay, so when I think of teaching or teachers , I think of quote by Fredrick Douglas . And that quote is, "It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men." So with that said, I'd like to wish all of my colleagues , fellow teachers a happy National Teacher 's Day. And, President Gaughan , I'd like to wish you a happy National Teacher 's day as well. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Also Cinco de Mayo, which is today which is the anniversary of the Battle of Puebla which was a victory in 1862 over the French forces of Napoleon . To those that are celebrating , I would like to wish them a happy Cinco de Mayo. I actually prepared before the meeting a fajita bar for my family. So that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I -- Kyle, go ahead. MR. DONAHUE : No, go ahead. MR. SCHUSTER : Go ahead, Kyle. MR. DONAHUE : I just have one, the street cleaning program which was in our Third Order, the schedule was announced . And so it will be starting next week and it will be starting in the North Scranton area from Green Ridge Street to Market Street. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : I was just going to say that, you know, over the course of this whole event here, I've seen lots of people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 helping each other out. And one of the things that stuck in my mind this week was I saw that EJ The DJ did a fundraiser on the Friday to help the St. Francis of Assisi Food Kitchen and the United Neighborhood Centers , just to say good job and good job to everyone else out there that's also doing similar events. I know there's a lot of people doing good things for their neighbors . So everybody stick together and continue . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. Dr. Rothchild , any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : No announcements . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, thank you. I just have a few. The first, Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority will be sponsoring another free lunch at Nay Aug Park. It will take place on Saturday , May 16th, 2020 at 1 p.m. The Municipal Recreation Authority will serve until 300 lunches have been distributed . This a takeout event. Lunches will be distributed at the maintenance building across from the pool. The menu will be hamburgers , hot dogs, chips, cookies and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 drink. Representative Marty Flynn will also provide pizza voucher s for the event while supplies last. Everyone is welcome to attend this free event. As I mention every week now since we've been conducting our meetings through Zoom, if anyone would like to comment on agenda items or City business , please send those comment s in writing to our City Clerk, Lori Reed by e-mailing LReed@Scranton pa.gov. Council will accept public comment until the day of our meeting Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. Public comment is reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed on the official record and in the minutes of our meeting s. Council 's agenda is being posted for public view the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . Our agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. That's all I have. DR. ROTHCHILD : Bill, I actually -- I'm sorry. I had one thing to add that I had 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 forgotten. So the South Side Farmer's Market, they have opened back up but not in the same way and the same capacity . They are doing drive up and preorders. So if you would like to get something from the vendors that are at the farmer's market, you could find the South Side Farmer's Market on their Facebook and more information about it, they are doing it on Saturday s. So this Saturday , May 9th they'll be open for orders. And then you could just come up with your car and they'll bring your orders out to you. And it's a great way to support our local farmers who are undoubtedly also having a difficult time right now. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Mrs. Reed, Fourth Order, please. MR. DONAHUE : Bill, I think we lost Lori. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, we did. Is Kathy on the line still? MR. DONAHUE : She came back in. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. We can move ahead with -- Kevin, can we move ahead with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Fourth Order? I think Lori just said Fourth Order. MR. DONAHUE : Kathy. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, Kathy, do you just want to -- MS. CARRERA : FOURTH ORDER -- yeah, FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. At this time I'd ask if someone could please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals to be placed into the record and our official minutes of this meeting . They are Patricia Nestor, Marie Schumacher , and Fay Franus. Is there a motion? DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : Second. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , I'll be responding to some of Mrs. Schumacher 's previous questions during Fifth Order. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. As I mentioned in the caucus, all question s that were posed mainly most of the questions by Marie Schumacher were forwarded to the Mayor. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I think Patricia Nestor, hers were mostly comments that were made. So we did review those. And then I don't know -- Fay Franus had a few questions as well. And we will try to get those answered for her. Anybody else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (Public Comment ) (Patricia Nestor) I have a friend named Theresa Revilak . Her husband is part of the pastoral staff at Green Ridge Assembly of God Church at 825 Green Ridge Street. At the back of the church's parking lot is a shed for clothing donations . Theresa is in charge of that shed. She sorts the clothes out, cleans, and repairs . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 She then gives them out to people in need free of charge. A lot of people contact her through Facebook . She will post in local groups if she has clothes available . Other times people contact her with requests and she takes care of them as clothes become available . Most of the people she helps are children from newborns of expecting moms to children going through growth spurts to school uniforms . She has helped groups of immigrants from Nepal that came to Scranton as refugees . When the church has free dinners for people in need, she opens the clothing closet for anyone who needs help. Many of the people who contact Theresa from Facebook pick up the bags of clothes off of her front porch in North Scranton . There isn't any personal contact . Recently a kitten was found in her basement . She took care of it for two months and then last week found a home for it. So someone called the mayor's snitch line and reported Theresa for not obeying the city's Covid-19 orders. Several times during 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 the mayor's Facebook live town halls she said that churches should not be holding public services , but if they do, people can report them anonymously at the number she gives out. The church has been having services online, but Theresa has been giving away bags of clothing by putting them on her porch. There isn't any person to person contact . The Scranton Police as well as Animal Control showed up at her house and told her to shut down her operation . The woman gave away a kitten! She gave some clothes to people in need! Last time I checked clothing was life sustaining . The mayor needs to stop asking people to snitch on churches because this is turning into persecution and violating Theresa 's freedom of religion as this clothing ministry is part of the Green Ridge Assembly of God Church. Read Jesus's parable about the sheep and the goats if you don't understand . Matthew 25. Theresa is a quiet, timid person and has spent hours crying over this. She did nothing wrong! I'm totally disgusted .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 1. You need to reign in the mayor from badgering churches . The majority were social distancing even before her proclamation . 2. You need to have cops fighting real crime instead of harassing a woman who does nothing but good. She's not spreading disease . Thank you for your attention . Patricia Nestor. (Marie Schumacher ) 1 - Since the City and Pennsylvania Economy League (PEL) are in agreement on delaying exit from Act 47, my question is how long will this delay last? Are you willing to ask the Department of Economic and Community Development (DCED) to set a new date certain or are you satisfied to allow the date to linger in limbo? I would like to see a vote on this issue by each Council member. 2024. 2 - In his 30 April 2020 statement at the DCED Public Hearing on the City's exit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 from Act 47 Gerald Cross, speaking for PEL, compared the City's real property assessed values with the market values over a period of 19 years. The question I would like answered regards the market values, was the value 19 years ago adjusted to the current dollar value before the calculation was made and what is the source of these market values. 3 - Last week's Meeting revealed the City's Acting HR Director is receiving compensation of $89 per hour. Even allowing for fringe benefits at 50% of salary, the actual salary would be a tad out of line with typical earnings of City directors . Of course, I went to the City's HR web page and found no name for this acting Director . What I did find is there are two openings ; one for an HR Director and another for a City Treasurer . May I suggest job openings also be posted on the City's main website ? Also, I suspect payments to the Third Party supplier of the Acting HR may have exceeded the professional services limited after which Council must vote; am I correct ? Also, the revelation that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 current acting HR director is not an employee , rather he/she is a third-party contractor . This brought 2019 to mind when a former HR director still employed by the City was given the additional job of acting HR Director and compensated for the extra effort. City employee Don King has been acting Zoning Director since last year but I don't recall him receiving additional compensation for the wearing of two hats. Does the City has a policy for compensating employees who take on all or part of an additional position ? 4 - A while back someone on Council announced there might be a Grant available for a Keyser Valley Storm Water Study. Is such a Grant being written and, if so, when is submittal expected ? 5- In 2018 the State Department of Environmental Protection delivered a Refuse/Recycling Evaluation to the City. Would it be possible to include the request for this Evaluation which, to me seemed a bit skewed, in Third Order? 6 - Would you also have placed in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Third Order the CATV Revised Contract . 7 - What is the interest rate for the 2020 Tax Anticipation Note? 8 - What is the status of the ESCO lease? 9 - What is the status of the anticipated electronic component drop-off program (Many are using the China Virus downtime to clean house.) 10 - What is the termination date of the City's current contract with Keystone Sanitary Landfill ? (Fay Franus) Is Jessica Eskra still getting the $12,000 raise Mayor Evans gave her last year--Are the other people Mayor Evans gave raises to as well still getting those raises? If so why? What is preventing you as council from doing your work regarding getting answers to many questions , especially Marie Schumacher 's? This virus should NOT be preventing each of you from getting the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 information we are asking of you. You do NOT have to write request for every answer--you can pick up a phone and request it as well rather than have us wait forever to get back to us. Most questions are never answered . Example , Marie asked a question last week that Bill Gaughan said he had the answer to but forgot what it was --BUT never told Marie the answer when he originally got it. You are getting paid by us $12500 a year --to do what may I ask? Why were the people who used the gas cards illegally not fired? They had to know filling up their personal car is illegal . Did the city ever get the video tapes from the gas stations showing the employees filling up their cars-- and to find out if it was not a company car they were filling up? If I were to do that when I worked at the water company I would be fired immediately . This is why the people in this city do NOT trust council or the city government to do what is right because you never ever ever ever hold anyone accountable . Why is that? Heads should be rolling and they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 are not--ONLY IN SCRANTON ! I would appreciate answers to my questions . All of them--seeing as your meetings last only a half an hour I would think you could find some time to get replies to people. Fay Franus. (End of Public Comment ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed, Fifth Order? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : I do not. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. I have a couple. So last week I requested that Mrs. Reed send an e-mail to the Business 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Administrator seeking the amount of hours that were billable hours and how many hours the acting HR Director has done since she's had that position . You know, it's $89 dollars an hour. So this is a lot of money, taxpayers -- you know, expenditures and taxpayers ' taxes. So I have yet to hear. I'm still looking to hear that. Mrs. Reed, could you follow up on that for me, please? MS. REED: Certainly . ATTY. HAYES: Councilman McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: I spoke earlier today to the City Solicitor regarding that outstanding request . She indicated to me that they were compiling the information and will be responsive to your request . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I look forward to hearing that. Also, as Chairman of Public Safety, I brought this up in caucus. You know, last week after the fuel gas card audit was present ed to us, a few people came to me and posed question s. I'm posing the same that regarding the program years ago when there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 was a program in place where police officers purchased their own vehicles . And this is, you know, to bring vehicles home into neighborhoods . It's a great idea, provide presence of these vehicles in the neighborhoods . My question is -- and I'd like Mrs. Reed if she would please send this to Chief Graziano to try to get an answer for me. But my question is, was this incorporated into the audit that Mr. Moretti did last week or presented last week? And also, if this program still exists, how many cars -- do they have their own cars or separate cars that maybe weren't looked at. If this still continues , I'd like to know how many cars and if it was part of the audit. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few comments . First off, last week I received a complaint from a citizen about a traffic light I believe on Cedar Avenue in South Side that was out of position from a recent storm. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 it was difficult to see and to be able to tell the color of the light as a result. And DPW responded very quickly to it. I just wanted to thank them for their work in doing that. I'm sure, you know, it's something may be simple to do, but things like that and the speed of their response I think is really helpful and just, you know, making sure that we have safe working traffic lights is great. And then something else that I wanted to bring up, you know, last week. There were new announcement s and a new roll out from Governor Wolf about entering into the next phase in our state. And I think as the government begins to open the state back up and certain businesses , people shouldn 't let their guards down. It doesn't mean that any of this is over. There is still a lot of people who are going to get sick, a lot of people who are going to pass away as a result of complications from COVID-19. And we really need to be mindful of that that it's not over. This is going to be a long battle for us and especially 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 up here in the northeastern part of the states, we are I think a lot more heavily affected than some other parts of the country , so things just to be mindful of. And it is tempting to want to go outdoors a lot with the weather becoming nicer, see friends and family when it's been so long that we haven't seen each other. And I totally get that frustration . I think that people need to continue to wear their mask as a safety precaution . And to understand that the masks are to protect other people if you are asymptomatic . You know, we understand if you're not sick, you're not feeling sick you think everything is fine. But you could still have COVID-19 and be passing it onto other people without realizing it. And that's why the masks are so important . And so if you are touching your mask and then touching another surface or if you have your mask and you're wearing it down or, you know, above your mouth and not above your nose, that is still a way that you could pass COVID-19 onto another person. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 That's why it's very important to wear the mask properly , to avoid touching it, to avoid touching your face. If you actually do have to touch it -- I know I wear them all day long. And it gets very tempting when you have an itch. But afterwards you need to wash your hands immediately so that you don't pass it onto another surface . And I, you know, I did go on a hike over the weekend somewhere that is normally not busy, somewhere that we can, like, bring our dog. And we brought masks just in case. And we were driving up, we realize d that there was just this incredible line of cars. And it was later in the afternoon and there was still so many people there and not a single person was wearing a mask. And we put it on when we were in areas that there were people around that we could possibly get close enough to people to catch something or pass something on. So just a reminder even if you're outside if you know that you're going to have the potential to be around people to carry a mask with you. And one last comment , I think that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 because it's getting frustrating for people that there's a tendency to want to take it out especially on public officials . And those are the people that I think for the most part are trying to help us and to keep us safe and protected as much as possible . I don't think that they have, you know, other wishes than to do just that. And I have seen the ways that especially Dr. Rachel Levine has been treated . And she is our Pennsylvania Secretary of Health. She's extremely qualified for her position . She is actually a friend of mine and has been a past colleague . And I have been seeing a lot on social media even from -- locally , names passed around and just terrible things that are attacking her personally . And I just -- I feel like when other people are being attacked we need to stand up for them. I just want to remind people that despite your frustrations at this time you need to be kind to others. And I know there are a lot of people doing that and doing very positive things for the community . And I appreciate that so much. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 just a strong reminder to people that, you know, things that you pass around on social media and internet can be very hurtful to people. And I think Dr. Levine is really doing as best of a job as she can and very focused on getting us healthy again and back to normal. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . MR. MCANDREW : Councilman Gaughan , I apologize . I missed a couple comment s on my list and if I -- MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. You know what, we'll come back to you at the end. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments -- Councilman Donahue , I'm sorry. Do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just to answer some of Miss Schumacher 's question s that she posed over the last few weeks, one from a couple weeks ago about she asked when will Council be discussing or begin discussing operating budget expense 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 cuts and possible additional revenue sources . Those conversations have been ongoing and will continue to be ongoing moving forward . The fact that we got our April tax (inaudible ) distribution in will give us a little better idea of the impact we have moving forward . So those discussions are going to be ongoing throughout the year. She also -- last week she asked about delinquent refuse bill payment s and when will the sale of receivable s, when will our RFQ go out for that. My response to that is hopefully soon. It was budgeted . I know there is some concerns about whether , you know, this crisis will impact the overall dollar figure on that and whether we'll get enough of what we put in the budget. I think that is something we still need to put out just to see what's out there and see what's willing to be on there. The status of migrations from the Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax to a Payroll Preparation Tax, negotiations with the school district , I mean, those are still ongoing. That all depends on our Act 47 status. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 I know the school direct was hoping that Senator Blake could get some revenue to fill a gap -- a collection gap. You wouldn't be paying -- the Business Privilege and Mercantile is paid all in one lump sum. Whereas this would move to -- the payroll prep would move to a quarterly collection . So the school district would be missing at least one quarter . So Senator Blake was suppose d to be looking into that. I mean, that's all up in the air now just because of everything else that's going on. She also asked when will the list of streets be paved -- will a list of streets to be paved other than those funded by OECD be made public and when will the RFPQ be published ? I know that there was, you know -- and this was going back two months. There was a draft circulating and that the specs were being put together to be put out to bid. But I think this also goes back to one of our -- you know, one of the previous points about budget questions . So I think that has to be a part of the discussion moving forward . And then lastly, the last answer I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 have for her is she asked what is the City's current credit rating. And we are BBB plus, which is one realm below investment grade. So I think the goal is to get to investment grade. And that's all I have for today -- for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Council man Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Sorry. As we get, you know, answers to addition al questions obviously we'll pass them along. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I just have a few comments . I mentioned this in the caucus. But I think it bears repeating . Last week we received the gas card audit from Mr. Moretti . Al Lucas seemed to be the focus for the report. I want to make sure that it is in the record and that the public understands that we received documentation from Chief Lucas, detailed documentation and a full explanation from his gas charges . And I want to read one statement that he made and is going to be included in the report. We'll take 2018, for example . 2018, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 Chief Lucas travelled exactly 3,342 miles. 628 of these miles are backed up to be a Pennsylvania Municipal League meeting in Cranberry, Pennsylvania -- Cranberry Township I think it is. 104 miles were attributed in Nesquehoning to some sort of training . That leaves 2,610 miles of driving for the year if you remove those two trips. That equals 50 miles a week for City business . The total gas usage for the year 2018 including the two trips is 17.65 miles per gallon. And the average is consistent with the 2016 Ford Escape. Chief Lucas lives roughly 5.6 miles roundtrip from headquarters . Doing the math he would have driven 4.4 miles per day in town between business between the firehouses responding , the Comm Center calls and other things throughout the year. Again, I'm not sure how he became the focus of the whole report. But it is -- I want to make sure that people understand that it's unfounded . I went through the documentation as I know all of my colleagues did. I've had conversations with each one of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 them about this, I believe , in the past few days. The explanation and the documentation speaks for itself. As I mention ed in the caucus, he provided more documentation and explanation than almost everyone else. And Chief Graziano did as well provide documentation and explanation . Chief Lucas is someone who has integrity and who has a backbone . And I want to reiterate and I know my colleagues agree because they've stated this on the record when we were voting for his appointment that he is doing an absolutely phenomenal job as the Fire Chief in light of all of these different circumstances . So I hope that puts this issue to rest. The second thing that I want to mention as I did in the caucus today is that the State Department of Environmental Protection is moving into its final phase of reviews before it decides whether to approve Keystone Sanitary Landfill 's proposed 42 year expansion plan. The DEP did announce I believe last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Thursday that it began its technical review phase of the landfill 's propose d phase three expansion earlier this month. The review includes a 60-day window for public comment that will close June 30th at 4 p.m. I had requested and all of my colleagues agree that we are going to -- and Solicitor Hayes is going to draft comments , a letter for us that we're going to review prior to next week's meeting . And then we'll make a motion to send public comment . I just want to reiterate my concerns -- many concerns about Keystone Landfill 's expansion . And I want to reiterate my opposition . Over the past few years since this issue has come to light and since KSL has decided to ask for an expansion , the people of our region including the great job that the people of the Friends of Lackawanna have done, they've spoken loud and clear about this issue. They do not want the landfill to expand. They are concerned as am I about the impact that the landfill expansion will have on our health and environment . And we know now during the pandemic that we're going through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 that the public health is so important . I have to wonder when I think about this issue 50 years from now what the future generation will think of a mountain of garbage that towers over our region literally , towers over our region as high as the Empire State Building . Will this be a place where families want to buy a home and actually raise their families and raise their children ? We have to ask ourselves what kind of world we want to live in, what kind of community we want to live in. We can either accept the way things are or we can fight to change them. And I think that we should fight to change them. And I think that groups like Friends of Lackawanna , other people throughout our community , they've been speaking up. And it's time that the DEP take notice of this and do the right thing and deny this expansion . This is only going to hurt our region. And I cannot imagine again seeing a pile, a mountain of garbage as high as the Empire State Building . And I don't -- really honestly don't think that we should accept that, is that we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 just have to do it or the argument that, well, where's the garbage going to go? I really think that we can do better than that. So I look forward to standing together as a Council with the four of my colleagues here and sending this letter again stating our opposition to this expansion . The last thing I want to mention is to kind of piggyback on what Dr. Rothchild said. One hundred three people now in Lackawanna County have passed away from the coronavirus . And if one person that passed away from this virus, it would be a tragedy , but 103 is unimaginable . And it's absolutely heartbreaking . And I know that everyone is eager to get back to normal. But we're not there yet. We are not there yet. So I would ask as Dr. Rothchild did tonight to all those people who may be watching our meeting to -- just because the weather is nice, please stay home as much as you possibly can away from large crowds. Follow the CDC guidelines . And please, please -- I implore people, look at the news sources . People are getting their news 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 from different sources . And a lot of the information that I see travelling around social media is flat out false. So I would implore people to make sure you're researching the sources where you are getting your information from. I think we need to make sure they are reputable so that people aren't taking the words of, you know, people who have no medical background at all. This information 's being spread out like it's gospel. We need to pay attention to the medical profession als, the scientists , the researchers , the people who actually have degrees in this type of thing. Otherwise , I think we're really going to find ourselves in continuing trouble over the next few months. And that is all I have. Mrs. Reed? ATTY. HAYES: Councilman McAndrew -- MR. GAUGHAN : I know. We're going to get to Mark in Eighth Order right before we adjourn . Sorry -- yeah, I didn't forget you, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : That's okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MS. REED: 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. No business at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Councilman McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Sorry. I apologize . I missed a comment that was on my list here -- MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MR. MCANDREW : -- and I don't want to get in trouble at my house, so please let me read it. Also, this Sunday being Mother's Day, I would like to wish all mothers , soon to be mothers , grandmothers , single fathers that act as mothers in their capacity , a very happy Mother's Day. This will be a tough one for most because of the stay at home initiative we're all talking about that we have to observe . And it's going to be tough not seeing mothers and grandmothers . But, you know, hang in there guys. Father's Day is right around the corner. That's all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. GAUGHAN : You know, Councilman McAndrew , you just -- thank you for -- not that I forgot about Mother's Day because I didn't. But I too want -- it is. It is very difficult during this pandemic when, you know, haven't seen our families in a while. So I want to wish my mother a Happy Mother's Day as well and my wife who is as you guys know is nine months pregnant . And she's still in the room so she didn't have the baby yet but any day now. So thanks, Mark. Anybody else? Okay, if there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : This meeting is adjourned . Thank you. Stay safe everyone . Bye-bye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Goodnight guys.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
