DONAHUE : At this time will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals , Al Young, Fay Franus and Janet Wenzel. MR. SCHUSTER : I'll make a motion to accept public comment .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, please read the public comment s into the record. MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Albert and Elaine Young as follows : To the members of Scranton Administration and Scranton City Council , We would like a REAL explanation or reason as to WHY.--- no more excuses --- lies--- or the provable political football runaround , as to why the city has NOT allowed the contractor to finish the work here in our yards. This part is of the contract , it is not "LITIGATION " or the fact that " DEP" may be working on a project . Now there is a religious anthem with words that state and I QUOTE " IT IS WELL IN MY SOUL" unquote , This is Not well in our souls do to the fact that the city hired a contractor to perform a "TEMPORY "" repair to our properties . The contractor did in fact perform much of what the contract called for--- BUT the CITY-- has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 held back on allowing work to be finished . The contractor would like to finish this project so that we are pleased with his work and that he can get paid. The work that was performed has left a big mess, a MUDDY-- GRAVEL piece of land, which is Not acceptable . The contractor removed his equipment going on 28 months ago and we have had to put up with your excuses . The CITY administration advertises that they want to be "TRANSPARENT " but in the long run all they have done is put on "BLACK OUT GLASSES ", it is time to remove them and get the work completed . " THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LITIGATION and OBLIGATION " it is time to open your eyes and get with the project and finalize it. We know that DEP is working on a PERMANANT repair but their work has been in progress for 20 or more years and the latest stats that were quoted are, that it may be another ---3---5---or even 10 years before they reach some kind of working program . We think this is VERY UNFAIR to be held HOSTAGE for a want to be solution that some dreamer has put into play. I did speak with a former city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 official that did in fact walk our yard some 30 years ago and the statement was that it is " TOTALLY out of context to be held up this long." POTUS states that by the 4th of July of this year we ALL should be holding picnics in our back yards ,guess he was wrong because it looks like we will still be HOSTAGES . There has only been (1) one city official to tour the yards in the last 29 months, which really tells us that because it is NOT in our yards then WE DO NOT CARE about you. At this point in life someone had better step up and do something and finish what was started . It certainly has gone on much too long. The city has found time and money for other things, now we think it is time to find the time to finish what you started . We really do not care if and when a permanent repair is made, that all of this must be torn back up, we just want to see grass and pavement instead of MUD. MS. REED: The second submission is from Fay Franus as follows : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Counicl Would you consider seriously having a referendum put on the November ballot asking the citizens of Scranton if they want to get rid of the Home Rule Charter ? It has been decades since the Home Rule Charter has been put in place and I believe it is time to get rid of the Home Rule Charter . The citizens of Scranton have not benefited at all from having the Home Rule Charter . One of the benefits of doing away with the Home Rule Charter would be that the city could no longer keep taxing it's citizens as they have been for decades . There are plenty of other advantages as well. Right now I need to know from you how you feel about doing this. Why not let the citizens decide? After all you are suppose to be representing us. We should have a say in this important matter. Please reply to this with your reasoning . We need to know if you truly do represent us or your own agenda. MS. REED: And the third and final submission is from Mrs. Janet Wenzel. This is a major traffic problem in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Scranton . It keeps customers away from city businesses . The detours throughout the Hill Section today cause me to ask: 1. Birch Street closed many years. When will the project be finished ? 2. Elm Street cut last year makes this other South Scranton Street dangerous . Avoiding oncoming traffic , ambulances and LONG,LARGE cut potholes . 3. Main Avenue UGI work through to June. NO OTHER projects should be allowed . 4. Stop light replacement necessary at Cedar and Elm. 5. Street lights on Harrison Avenue Bridge out since February . A beautiful entrance to Scranton . 6. Repair stone work at the Lookout . Another beautiful spot to enter Scranton is a MESS! (Concludes public comment letters as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all, Council . MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the question , beginning with Mr. Young, didn't we request to see if they would go out and plant that grass and they said they were going to look into that in terms of so they didn't have to look at mud. I know it's a not a long-term fix to complete the issue. But I believe they did and they said they were going to look into -- the administration said they were going to look into ways to -- MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, that was something that was discussed a couple weeks ago. I think there is a little bit more than just planting grass. I do think there's a -- I'd say probably a couple truckloads of dirt and maybe a 6 by 40 piece of asphalt , something like that. But it doesn't seem like it would be too much. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I know they did say that. So we'll pass those along. In terms of Mrs. Franus's comment s, in my opinion I think it's more complicated than that. When you get into state tax enabling law, it really doesn't matter whether you're a Home Rule Charter or not. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 We're still dealing with tax enabling legislation that's -- hasn't been changed since the late 60s when Pennsylvania was more, you know, city, you know, wealth was more concentrated in the cities and there wasn't as much sprawl but that is completely another issue. So I really don't think that, you know, whether we're or home rule city -- Home Rule Charter City or not really solves our issue on that front. And in terms of Mrs. Wenzel's comments , the first one on Birch Street, I believe that that is open now for some traffic . Full restoration wouldn't be complete until the end of April. That was the last update we got. But we will check on that. We have been keeping an eye on that. And Elm Street is -- the reason that's in such bad shape is because of Birch Street because they have to close down Elm Street to finish the work because they have to bore a hole under the railroad tracks. So that will be closed for two weeks once Birch Street is fully reopened and then Elm Street will be fully 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 restored as well. And in terms of the other ones, we'll pass those along. I agree, you know, with the stoplight replacement at Cedar and Elm. I wasn't aware of the streetlights on Harrison Avenue. But we'll look into that and I believe we did send something on repairing the stone work at the lookout a couple months back. But we'll look into that too. Anybody else? MR. SCHUSTER : Just to add another thing, the stone work up at the lookout, is that a WPA project ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe it was. MR. SCHUSTER : Just to throw it out there, there may be, you know, funding available or some kind of funding available to preserve those projects . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I know we saw that somewhere in the last couple months. I just have to search back. And I didn't get a chance to after we got this today. But we'll get into that too. MR. SCHUSTER : I know looking back at, like, the Audubon School, the wall that was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 around the Audubon School was a Works Program from the WPA. And I felt like that should have been looked into a little bit before that they pulled that down. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? All those in favor of approving Citizens Participation , signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : The only comments I have, there was a couple properties I had a few complaints about. I spoke to Lori before the meeting . I'm going to send them over, one on Cherry Street, we did get an e-mail for 814-816, the apartment on Luzerne Street. And there was another e-mail that came to us about that property . It doesn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 seem like anybody went out possibly . And from what the e-mail stated, just more garbage being piled up at that address . So I will send an e-mail about those properties . Mr. McAndrew is going to speak about another property with St. Francis Cabrini . And does anybody know about what's going on at Keyser Avenue? I see that there is tree clearings there. I'd say probably like, 2 or 3 acres. I had a resident inquire about that. I'm planning on sending an e-mail to get a little bit more information on what's happening over there. All right. So just I'll send the e-mails over to Lori and have them forwarded . That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, so last week I received a phone call from a concerned resident . And it's about a property -- the property is 125-127 North St. Francis Cabrini Avenue. Recently there was a raid with the Street Crimes Unit. They do a fantastic job. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 This complaint isn't about them. It's about the occupants of this home and the absent landlord . The neighbor s are very concerned about their safety because there is constant -- there's a revolving door at this apartment building . You know, they raided. Some people got arrested . And then the same criminal element ends up being back in these apartment s. So -- and they reached out to me. And I don't have the answers . So that's why I'm going to ask the question . So I do know that after so many complaints on an apartment or a home where there is criminal activity something could be done. I don't know what that is. So my question , Mrs. Reed, if you could please send correspondence to the police department and find these answers for me and the concern ed residents on that street. So, like, what's the next step? So this is occurring all the time. What is the actual process that prevents this from happening again. And how many complaints in a year does it take for something to happen? Is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 it one? Is it five? Is it -- I don't know all of these. But these are residents that lived there their whole life. They love their neighborhood . But this one piece of it, this element is just -- continues to happen. I do know I remember the Broadway Bar. It was a horrible bar where a lot of criminal activity happened. And I know for a while, you know, the cops would know where they were so they kept it there so they could do their -- you now, focused on eliminating that bad element . But eventually that place was torn down. So there was a process for that. What's the process for this type of incident , behavior or ongoing threat to public safety? So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just want to mention real quick because you were talking about some of the streetlights that need to be fixed. One did contact me over the weekend about the traffic light at the intersection of Alder and Cedar Avenue. So I had Lori reach out to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Mr. Preambo from DPW and that's now repaired. So if anyone else had a concern about that streetlight that that's taken care of. So thanks to our DPW workers for getting on that quickly . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Yeah, the only thing I had too is I had also spoke to the same resident , Mark, and I'm sure Tom did. I know he was just, you know, concerned just about the situation with that. So if we could look into that. Lori, that should probably also go to LIPS too because I think they might be a part of, you know, putting a declaration of a nuisance property or whatever it is onto, you know, on that property . And that's all I have too. MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

And we made that adjustment so just to strengthen the legislation to make sure that it's effective and enforcea ble. And then I don't know if Solicitor Hayes has anything to add to that. ATTY. HAYES: No, Dr. Rothchild , I think you correctly summarize d what was the purpose of the amendments . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : And then guidance , where did the guidance come from? DR. ROTHCHILD : A solicitor through national organization , the Trevor Project which has been doing a lot of work on conversion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 therapy legislation in other states. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Great. All those in favor of the amendment signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. As temporary Chairperson for the Committee on Rules I recommend final passage of Item 7-B as amended . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAUHE : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I know that we've spoken to this piece of legislation before. But I just wanted to reiterate a few things quickly . I'm very proud to have brought this legislation forward to Council . I'm really thankful to have the support of my colleagues as well as the Mayor and her administration . We've had conversations about this piece over the past couple of months just to make sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 that, you know, that it was a strong piece of legislation to bring forth to you all. And, you know, I really think that any way that we can help out the LGBTQ youth that are in the Scranton community is going to be really beneficial to us. I think it's a great way to show that we support them and we won't stand for any of these practices . You know, it is something that is still in existence today. There are surveys and studies that show that LGBTQ youth across the nation have experienced conversion therapy . And it's not just in rural communities . And a lot of people are surprised that it's still allowable legally at least for minors to be subjected to this treatment . And, you know, so I think that it's, you know, doing our small part in helping to abolish such practice s and to show the LGBTQ community that they are accepted and loved as they are. And, yeah, so that was, you know, it's personal for me and just really proud of this Council tonight and that I had the opportunity to bring this forward . MR. DONAHUE : Great. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Thank you for all the work you put forward on this. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes.
