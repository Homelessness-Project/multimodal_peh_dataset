MINUTES OF THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION MEETING HELD APRIL 28th, 2022. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one announcement for the holiday lighting spectacular kickoff that it will be happening November 18th at 5 p.m., outside of Everhart Museum. So that's something that has been happening for a long time now. So you will be able to drive through the lights. It's going to be the first night that it's opened. There's going to be a few other things included at the event. There will be a special guest appearance by the Grinch so for any kids that's aren't fearful of the Grinch and want to be able to see him, holiday music, free coffee, free holiday hats and free holiday photo session . So don't miss that date. That's November 18th at 5 p.m. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 other Council members have any announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have an announcement . So the Mary Mother of God Parish will be having their annual roast beef dinner. It's going to be held on Sunday, November 13th from 12 to 4. It's going to be at Stirna's. It's going to be $11 in advance and $14 at the door. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have announcements ? Thank you. Do any other Council members have announcements ? I just have one. Just a reminder that for the rest of this week garbage collection will be a day late because of Election Day. And also next week, garbage will be a day late because of observance of Veterans Day. Since Election Day and Veterans Day fall in the same week in order to not, you know, disrupt too much our garbage collection , DPW will observe Veterans Day on November 14th. City Hall observes Veterans Day tomorrow but DPW will observe it on Monday as one of their days off so garbage collection will also be late next week. Mr. Voldenberg ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First of all, congratulations , Kyle. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. HODOWANITZ : Hate to see you go in many ways but you better represent us well when you get down to Harrisburg . We'll be looking for a payback. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . MS. HODOWANITZ : If you would in Fifth Order, please update us with the status of the police, fire, and City Tax Office contract s and the 2021 audit. And I tried to go on the City website last several days to see if the new DPW contract was on it instead of the old one. But when I went to City archives and then from there to financial reports , I reached the page which had no documents to open. Now either they moved financial documents to another part of the website or something was amiss. So would somebody let me know next week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 how I could find all the labor agreements and pension plans and all the stuff that was under the financial documents ? You know, I'm hoping to see that, especially with the other union contracts being negotiated . With regard to the budget briefing s during the caucus, I pulled up the PEL document from October , 2021 which was the recommendation to take us out of Act 47 and I want to read this quote. Quote, the coordinator recommends that the City increase its property tax millage rate by 5.1 percent , 14.8 percent and .7 percent in the years 2024 through 2026, unquote. Now, if you add the 3 percent for 2023, that would be a total of 23.6 percent property tax increase by 2026. Granted nobody can read the future precisely , but I do think the PEL assessment is far more realistic than what the Mayor said about keeping tax increases in the 2 to 3 percent region because this assessment was based on PEL's analysis that expenses were going to exceed revenues over those years. So we shall see what we shall see. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Also, I looked at the budget and the salary increases for DPW. And they seem to be very much in the ballpark for what came out in their approved union contract . Then I looked at police, fire, and the Single Tax Office and there was no change in salaries from 2022 to 2023. Now we all know that the meat of the operational budget is personnel compensation . So my question is, how long are we going to go wait on those union contract s because you're going to end up having to reopen the budget next year. I can't believe those unions are going to say, oh, we won't take any pay raises. We want to balance the budget. That's why I've been asking every week what's going on with the union contracts . And you only got what, you know, you want to pass this budget before the end of the month? Something 's not right here. This doesn't pass the stink test in my eyes. Also, I looked at the -- remember how we had to allot $110,000 for electricity ? So I looked at some of the utilities . Electricity is going to go up 100 percent , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 telephones 60 percent , gas, oil, and lubricant s, 58 percent . But for some reason water is not going up at all, nor salt. So that's the good news. And there are several very suspicious line items in this budget. I'm only going to give one example , DPW admin professional services is going from $88,500 to $3,495,000 with no footnote . Good luck. MR. DONAHUE : So just -- those are the grant matches for the four bridge project s. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. But see, that's why God invented footnotes . You think we're not looking at these items? We are. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I had an opportunity here for a moment to talk to the Mayor and asked her to agree to have a sit-down and discussion on the issues about the slide at Nay Aug Park. And I asked ECTV if they'd carry it. And I would also like to invite the Council to come -- the individual members and the City Controller and the Recreation Authority because I think it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 important for the residents to get a much better grasp on what's occurred there in my opinion . And for me to make statements here at the podium would be a little silly because I think that you should give every party the opportunity to sit at a table, not with a five minute time limit, not with a controlled conversation but with a dialogue , okay, and a look to the controlling factors of what took place so the residents of the City could determine whether the City Controller did his job, whether the Council did their job, whether the Rec Authority did their job because I think it's really important for everybody to get a complete understanding of what is taking place in my opinion . And, you know, something I could be wrong. But if I'm right, then terrible things have occurred . And I don't know why the Mayor wouldn't want to come and sit at a table with a resident , somebody that's gone to these Council meeting s for almost 40 years, okay? I've argued my points between judges in Commonwealth Court, Superior Court, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Court of Common Pleas. So I could express myself. And I think that we should give the Council members the opportunity to express themselves and the obligation and burden that they were under. You could bring your solicitor . I told the Mayor she could bring hers. The Rec Authority could bring theirs. Everybody could bring their attorneys with them. But I think the residents of this City are entitled to one thing for once, fact. And then from there maybe we should move on and start having discussions on a host of many other things because I think that we have a government that doesn't really tell us the things they should tell us. And me, I just looked at it at a glance and I think there is something wrong with it. And, you know, I want you to think of all the children in this city that might end up going and drowning somewhere because they don't have a pool at Nay Aug and think about the burden you're under. And then think of all the federal funds just to take your eye off of that for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 minute and think of the funds that were used to build those assets. You know, in my lifetime we've lost everything . And we've been lied to whether it was the county commissioners , the councils , the mayors, and our quality of life has suffered and the taxes we have paid have increase d and we have nothing to show for them except political propaganda and straight out lies. So I'm going to set this up with ECTV. I think you should come. I think we should have an open dialogue . I think we should look at what the law says and what the law says how things should be done. And then I think you should say why you did what you did and whether you thought you met your burden as a mayor, a councilman , a city controller or, you know, an authority . That's all I'm asking. And I think that the residents have a right to it. And my opinion doesn't matter at all. Let's just see what facts are. Thank you for your time. And I will call the individual bodies and see who is willing to sit down and have a discussion . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner . First off, I'd like to congratulate represent ative-elect Donahue on his big win on Tuesday , everybody else that won in this area in the State of Pennsylvania . It was a great day for the blue team. There was supposed to big red wave all the over the country . I think the blue wave washed the red wave back out into the ocean, especially Pennsylvania . Democrats had a great Tuesday . We even took over the house which was totally unexpected. So I know the new Governor will have -- I think he's going to get a lot done with the new Congress and hopefully it will be a great next four years for Pennsylvania . Next thing, I spoke to the Mayor and Business Administrator slash DPW Director about the intersection where I live, my corner. He said last time I was here he sent a crew up to the house. I said, well, nobody ever saw me. I was working . But he said the problem is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 there is a crown on that intersection . Every time they paved that area I guess maybe they didn't build it enough. I said whether there's a crown or not, the blacktop on my corner is washed away. If it wasn't washed away I wouldn't get the water on my sidewalk . It doesn't matter if there's a crown or not. I told them that tonight . I said -- oh, I'll send a crew up tomorrow . I said tomorrow 's going to rain. He goes that's the perfect opportunity to look at it. I told him it's not the crown. I need a good curb on my corner so I don't get the water right in front of my house, whatever . It won't get done this year because after the rain tomorrow the cold is coming. They're not going to be around. Moving on, I walked in in the middle of the budget talks. And the one thing I saw was that the raises and then it went off the screen. But the first one I saw was the Parks and Recreation Director , a $21,000 raise. Are you serious ? And there's people that work in the City that don't make $21,000 a year and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 this person is getting a $21,000 raise and I'm sure there was more down the list that are getting raises too. I only saw the first one. You can't pass something like this. That's ridiculous . You have people struggling to pay their bills. Twenty-one thousand dollars is ridiculous . That's all I have to say tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Susan Blum Connors. MS. CONNORS : Good evening . My name is Susan Blum Connors, Scranton homeowner and taxpayer . And before I begin my remarks I would also like to add my congratulations to Kyle on being elected a state representative . Best of luck as you begin the next chapter in your life. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MS. CONNORS : I would also like to acknowledge all of our veterans and thank them for their service . I last spoke to Council several years ago about pancreatic cancer awareness . And I'm here tonight to address the same issue so you won't hear any complaints from me about anything . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 November is pancreatic cancer awareness month. My sister-in-law former Mayor Jim Connors' sister Tina died of pancreatic cancer on January 25th, 1994 just 10 days after her 43rd birthday . This year more than 62,000 Americans will be diagnos ed with this devastating disease . And only 10 percent of those will survive for more than five years. The pancreatic cancer action network is leading large scale groundbreaking research initiative s that will be the catalyst for transforming the way pancreatic cancer is detected and treated . This, of course, takes money which is why I'm here this evening . Pizza by Pappas owned by Bill and Tom Sheakoski will be having its annual pancreatic cancer fundraiser on Sunday, November 20th from noon until 5:00. Fifty percent of all pizza sales which by the way is the only food that will be available for purchase that day will be donated to the pancreatic cancer action network . To date, over 132,000 has been raised for this very worthwhile cause. Besides freshly made pizza you could also purchase take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 and bakes which are shrink wrapped and could be frozen and baked at a later day. If you want the pizza at a specific time, I suggest you call ahead even a couple of days ahead to help ensure your preferred time. Their number is 570-346-2290. Indoor dining, takeout, curbside pickup and weather permitting outdoor dining will be available . Thank you for your time and support . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Susan. Next on the list, Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , homeowner . We really need to as I have stated a long -- many times in the past we have to get compensation from the state for institutional properties . We have grant tax exempt institutions , can't have it any other way. A homeless person winds up in the hospital after three years. This figure is pre Obama, on average will cost the hospital $155,000. That's pre Obama. And taxes are going up and along with it, institutions . It's state buildings , federal buildings , county buildings , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 hospitals , schools . It just keeps going on and on and on. And I don't resent them. I wouldn't even be alive if CMC wasn't up there. And that's been going on for years. But we really need to start getting some kind of compensation by the state. By the state constitution we can't refuse. We can't say please don't come here. We can't say anything . We can only give them the institutional land and they acquired it up on Prescott Avenue and that's it. It's not Prescott . It's Colfax. I get those two mixed up. But we really need to get some kind of -- I would love to rejuvenate the taxpayers association and oust the county greater Lackawanna title that never came together . Nobody seems to be interested . And I wanted to handle strictly Scranton . And probably with the school system too we have the same problem . And I would guess that if local authorities got involved with such talk, they might even get punished by somebody from upstairs in Harrisburg , who knows. But it just keeps growing and growing . And Joan Hodowanitz is right. We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 really have to try to settle with the police and fire. I have been coming since when we owed four, five years and six years and seven years and it really blew up. We almost went under as a town. And I don't know, they're saying we could split Scranton up. Who would want a bankrupt city? Who would want it, you know, who want to join, Moosic, Dickson City, I don't think so. And it just -- I mean, Pennsylvania came through with the election . I was not optimistic about that. I'm not optimistic about the way the election turned out. We really need a national voting law and national voting regulations , regulation machines . I'm sorry, six weeks, five or six weeks of four weeks or three weeks for California is just -- and then you have Nevada and you have Arizona . That's how all of the accusations start flying around. Well, seeing that you guys have already worked several hours I'll give a couple minutes back. You could thank me later. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Next on the list, Bob Bolus. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. BOLUS: Good evening , Council , Bob Bolus, Scranton . You know, I took a look at what was going on with the budget here. You know, if you stop and think what we have -- what was called Lake Lincoln, it was a natural lake so-to-speak that we had in the City. Doherty turned around and put a liner in rather than common sense repair the issues. And you see what we're paying today. How much of us here want to run under a splash park and go whoopee, whoopee with their wheelchairs. They can't walk with their canes. What about the senior citizens ? Absolutely zero concern . You filled it in with dirt which was the most incompetent thing I've seen done. You had all the wrong people involved . Now you have a dirt park. You ripped down the sliding board that cost us thousands of dollars . What have you proven? The only thing you've proven -- the park recreation people and I've challenged them in the past in a lawsuit over the parking up there that Geisinger was doing. You should be getting a million dollars a year for all those cars that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 are parked up there or 100,000 a year after that. But, no, Council wouldn't disband them. Council wouldn't get involved . And you let it run rampant up there. And they knock the hell out of the park. They knocked the hell out of our park. It's not their park. It's our park. And to sit back and watch all the money you want to dump on them 7, $800,000, eliminate the park and let Scranton Parks and Recreation do it. You're already paying the people to do the job. Why are you duplicating it with an authority that's incompetent as far as I'm concerned . You've ruined an asset of the people. You've taken away from the people a place to go to enjoy ourselves. You people probably don't remember , but you used to have Easter. Families used to come to Nay Aug Park. They used to enjoy themselves . And they swam in Lake Lincoln . Now what the hell do you have up there, a mud hole? And it's wrong. The other part that's really annoyed me and all and I've been here my whole life and I see just the way it's going and going because the voice 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 of the people don't mean a thing to Council or any other administrations past. I'm going to ask you tonight , Kyle, you're moving on. And I've asked you this before you went for your election . If you -- now that you're elected, do you intend to take our voice away while you're now representing us in the state as you did when you named the streets for Biden? We've asked you to remove the streets from Biden, put them on a referendum . MR. DONAHUE : You're one of 80,000 people. You don't represent the voice of the people. MR. BOLUS: Yeah, I do. MR. DONAHUE : No, you do not. MR. BOLUS: Yeah, I do. I put a uniform on -- MR. DONAHUE : No, you do not. MR. BOLUS: -- for this country and I did a hell of a lot more than you have done. You want to stand toe to toe about it we can go at it, my friend. MR. DONAHUE : You're one of 80,000 people.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. BOLUS: I've been all over -- I've travelled all over the world. It's unfortunate -- MR. DONAHUE : You couldn't make it to DC. You couldn't find DC. MR. BOLUS: Are you going to take the voice away? You're not going to defend me on it and you're not going to challenge me. You work for me. I don't work for you. All right, I asked you a straight question . Will you make a motion tonight to remove the signs -- the Biden signs? MR. DONAHUE : No. No. MR. BOLUS: Okay. I wish you had said that before, you probably wouldn't have gotten elected. But unfortunately we have to deal with what we have to deal with. And I'll be very frank, I didn't vote for you. So we can put that on the table. MR. DONAHUE : I didn't expect you to vote for me. MR. BOLUS: Well, you would have if you stood up for the people in the City. I would have backed you 100 percent because I don't believe party one way or the other. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 believe in the individual . Okay, and I've contributed a lot more to this City than anybody else has in a long, long time. I haven't seen you sponsor a dinner for the last 28 years and feed over 3,000 people. So if you want to challenge me on something be my guest, friend. I'll take you on any day. We have 20-some trailer loads of disinfectant wipes that I'm donating out. All they have to do is call my office, come up and pick them up. All right. I gave it to the Mayor. We just sent two trailer loads to Texas. I've got 10 of them going to Florida . I don't ask you for nothing . Okay, all I ask you to do is stand up and represent us the way we should be represented . And I'll say it. It's unfortunate you got elected . Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Bolus. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , I see we have a reappointment for the housing board. And I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 understand that we have at least two applicants . It would be nice if we were given the opportunity to vet all applicants in a public forum and make an informed choice and at least get the public input on boards. Thomas Scalese Senior I believe is 83 years old. The five year term would expire when he's 88 years old. This is concerning . Now, for the absurd waste of time, 7-D, for the use of two portable light stands November 8th, 2022 Election Day. If this is voted down has anyone figured out how to go back in time and resolve the conflict ? And if so, I'd like them to buy me a lottery ticket for the 2.1 billion dollar lottery drawing because I now have the numbers . The recovery funds, we were told any disbursement would come back to Council before approval . It seems they are being handed out without returning here as promised per the grant listing s. I see $25,000 to the Wright Center for community health, a community group who tried to steal from the people during COVID by exploitation and fraudulent billing having them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 removed and banned from the program . So we're awarding a group who tried to scam during the pandemic with pandemic recovery funds. Interesting . On finances as the budget is looming , last meeting I talked about paying for a company to monitor compliance of the other company who was hired for compliance of the recovery funds. When we audit, for example , personal use of gas card abuse was brought forth. The City hired an auditor to review and provide a report. He stated the City should be reimbursed for personal use. But the City decided not to pursue it. So we have someone who stole taxpayer money. Then we hired someone to figure out how much. Then we do nothing , wasting both the gas money and the auditor 's billed time. We hire a company that says you'll recover 1 million dollars in savings from optimizing the DPW routes. But already seven months into it you have savings of nothing . The equipment is the vendor's. If I remember the original contract details, they own the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 data. Recovery Act, we were told that distribution would come back to Council for approval . But as in Luzerne County, that seems to not happen. The City of Scranton was awarded financial aid to local iconic businesses and announce d plans to provide up to 3 million dollars to small business owners through the American Rescue Plan. Coopers got a Tiki bar. Our loan to grant program is helping business owners that forgives the loan in total. Funny when it's the individual homeowners getting funds, they affectively have a lien that in selling or transferring the improved property even after 10 years, the money has to be returned , no conversion . But businesses , nope. People matter less than a commercial bar. Scranton is to receive 4 million dollars in funding. Electric City is getting million s of dollars with some of the funding going to Nay Aug Park. Nay Aug Park will receive $500,000 to put in pickleball courts. The cost of a pickleball court can range from 6,000 to 9,100 dollars . I guess Nay Aug Park 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 is getting 55 pickleball courts. One thing that won't be coming back to the park is the swimming pool. Mayor Cognetti said the City doesn't have funding for a pool complex right now. In this it looks like the Mayor of Scranton is giving the population of Scranton the big pickle. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , after sitting on that side of the rail for two hours, I moved to number one item tonight acoustics . I believe we were promised improvements . Where are they? MR. DONAHUE : A bid is going out shortly . A bid is going out shortly . MS. SCHUMACHER : I think we heard that before, didn't we? MR. DONAHUE : I don't write the bids. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, you certainly have people who do that you could put some pressure on. But you're on this side, not on that side. Okay, number two, what is the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 status of -- skip that one. Salaries in the budget, I don't think -- I think that if you give these large increases in salary so that we are more competitive , I think they all should be put on the market. And we should ask for people who are interested in those jobs for the new amount. And then we should make sure that the City gets the best that is possible for us. The contracts , now it was Mayor Courtright who gave the police and firemen long contract s. So we've known for many years when the contracts expired . Are we going to go another year without contract s for the fire and police? Does anybody know what the status is? How often are they meeting ? Tell us something because this should have been done. MR. DONAHUE : CBA negotiation s are ongoing. MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry? MR. DONAHUE : CBA -- collective bargaining agreement negotiations are ongoing . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And do they have an estimated time how close they are? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. I mean, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 they're not going to negotiate publicly . I know that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I think it's terrible that we don't have contracts right now. And speaking of things, I finally figured out yesterday morning why you promised that we would have stormwater taken care of by the end of the year. It was because you didn't plan to be here. And that was pretty clever of you. MR. DONAHUE : I'm sorry I was off by three months. I'm sorry I was off by three months. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Are we going to get one? So you're saying now it's going to be in March? MR. DONAHUE : That was what we were told when we had our stormwater caucus about a month ago. MS. SCHUMACHER : And since we aren't going to have any pools at Nay Aug, can would please at least cover the signs that point to the pool complex ? MR. DONAHUE : I'll request that, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : That is just like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 pouring merthiolate on a cut. Oh, yes, the changing of the Spruce Street I will never forget because every Council man went with whoever 's brilliant idea it was to make that change, listened over three weeks for people who are going to be impacted by that. And did you listen to any of them those of you who were here -- not everybody was, of course. But, no, that was okay. And I think it was terrible . And I think it should have been put on the ballot to see if people in Scranton really wanted that done. And I think you would have lost. But we don't get what we even ask for ever hardly. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. GUZIEWICZ : Delmar Guziewicz , Scranton City taxpayer . First, I'd like to clarify an error that I made last week. Last week I asserted the average car payment in America was $700 a month. That is close to accurate for the average new car payment . The average used car payment in America is $515 a month. That was my error. I apologize . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Now I'm here, of course, to speak about the trains. As I've said many times before, we need the Laurel Line to connect Wilkes-Barre to Scranton and connect the surrounding communities . I discussed before how traffic safety is a big reason why we need to have the train last week. We saw very clearly how inadequate public transit throws people into poverty and can create unsafe environments . Just yesterday on I-81 in Plains, a woman was killed in a car crash, something that might have been able to be avoided if she had been able to take alternative transportation either a reliable bus or preferably the train system. But on everyone 's mind tonight and the past four weeks is mostly been about the pool structure in Nay Aug Park. And we've heard there haven't been enough funds for it. But I have a solution to that problem . And it is, in fact, building the train. What we need to do is get off our addiction to cars. City of Scranton and many other municipalities across the country has a serious problem with being designed for automotive in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 ways that don't work for the community . Take a walk around downtown Scranton . You'll pass many, many, many parking lots, parking garages that take up half a block that are mostly empty. Mr. Donahue , I saw you at the mural unveiling the other day. And it's right between I believe three large parking lots right across the street from a four or five story parking garage, all of which are predominantly empty. This is all land that is completely useless to the City. It's unutilized . And if the City -- if developers come in and repurpose that land to put in mixed use walkable environment s for the citizens , homes, businesses , on these lands that are currently wasted creating an urban heat sink increasing that the actual physical temperature of the City of Scranton . The City would be able to bring in so much revenue through taxes from businesses , from employment taxes, from property taxes. All of this is untapped potential right in the center of the City of Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 I don't know who initially agreed to have these properties razed to cover in blacktop, to rent out parking spaces that no one is buying, but we need to fix that as fast as possible . And having the train allows people to have an alternative to cars. They don't have to drive into the City. And they won't have to look for parking , parking that they are not buying anyway because these parking lots are privately owned and expensive . People's perception of the relationship with the automobile and the City does not match the reality . You walk around Scranton during peak hours, there are so many parking spots on the street that are not taken let alone in these numerous garages and parking lots, all of which is a huge waste of city resources and again, creates problems for the environment raising the temperature of the city encouraging automotive transit which pollute s and creates waste, discourages people from walking -- prevents people from walking because there is nowhere to walk to. We know that one of the biggest ways 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 to increase small business revenue is through walkability . That's why I imagine part of the reason why at least why the City has been pushing for it recently and that's fantastic . But we need to have somewhere for these people to walk to. And we need to have somewhere for these people to walk from and replacing these huge spots of parking lot with mixed use building s with properties that actually benefit the citizen s and the community is definitely the solution . Congratulations , Mr. Donahue , on your victory . You'll definitely be hearing from me. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. ELLMAN: Yes, Council , to rehash my problem real quick, last month my neighbor two houses up -- two doors up was evicted and everything he owned was in the yard well over 50 feet from my front yard. Everybody in the morning scattered it. It was everywhere. Mr. Sunday come by Wednesday and gives me a summons for rubbish . So I phoned down there to complain . And they said that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 they'd have him phone me, which nobody phones. I don't know why the City has telephones for the people because they don't answer a call. Friday I get another ticket on the door from rubbish . And I went down there. They told me this is nothing they could do. It's Mr. Sunday sees rubbish in my yard. And the lady had a computer and she's looking and everything . Monday I get a hundred dollar ticket right here for indoor furniture on my porch. There is a chair -- there's a metal chair. It's a lawn chair that's been there for 20 years. It didn't come from the house. I don't know what's wrong with these people down in the licensing bureau. Now, I went down and I complained about this and they gave me the form to fill out where you put $300 up to appeal it. But if you win, which I would, I don't get the money back. It's on this appeal twice saying you don't -- there's no refunds. In the meantime I just let that go. Yesterday I get a 200-and some dollar ticket for the rubbish again. He's back from the lawn chair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 back to the rubbish pile. And I could take care of that. I have an attorney that's interested -- one of the boys I went to school with in coaching me. You just don't know how frustrating this is over absolutely nothing . There shouldn 't have been anything issued to my house to start with. I feel that this a deliberate vindictive response for my first two complaint s that were unnecessary . This is totally unacceptable abuse of his city's power and position to do so. Both Oleski and Mr. Sunday, they're not the caliber employees the City needs to represent them, both of them. If it was up to me I'd fire both of them. You talk about rubbish , I've complained for years on City property this is the map of the City where Amelia and Parker Street bridge is, tractor -trailer 's been using it for a truck stop for the last three years. At times there was four of them parked there and I have a picture of it. This is still a residential neighborhood . It's on there. Residential tax -- because they tore 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 down all the houses and nothing was ever changed . And the City keeps allowing this. In front of the tractor -trailer which has been there for over eight weeks is his own motor which weighs $4,000 pounds, oil and barrels and rubbish but Mr. Sunday doesn't see that. He sees -- he got eyes like an eagle. He sees a lawn chair on my porch. I'm going to take all of these picture s I got plus those and send them to Fox News. I talked to the produce r on the phone. I'll put Biden bill on the map. I don't think the Mayor is going to like it. There is no reason for all of this to have gone anywhere like this. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I'd like to make a motion that we remove 5-F from the agenda.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second to remove 5-F from tonight 's agenda. On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , my reasoning is this has nothing to do Mr. Galella . He's served the City admirably for years. But we had not received the name from the Mayor. But we did just receive one I believe it was today or yesterday for a candidate . And I would like to have the ability to at least review that individual 's qualifications to potentially serve. And you know, at the end of the day it is a Mayor's appointment so at least I could have the opportunity to see the name that was submitted . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I'm voting no to table it. The Mayor had the opportunity to appoint . The timeframe ran out. And then when that happens , it's the responsibility or it's our job to appoint a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 position to that board. So we did that. And receiving another applicant yesterday when our legislation was already written up is just -- that's even more late. So I think we vote this through . I'll be voting no for tabling . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree with tabling it, but I think the appointments are up to the discretion of the Mayor and although we do have our vote on them if we think they are an appropriate appointment or person to fill a vacancy that I'm not sure where the confusion happened with this legislation and why we have one candidate if they are interested in another . But I'm fine with tabling it while we take the week to figure out why that is and to take a look at the candidates further before voting on this. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? I'll vote to remove this from the agenda tonight just to have a conversation next week regarding this situation . All those in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 favor of the motion to removing 5-F from tonight 's agenda signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. DONAHUE : Ayes have it and so moved. Anything else, Mr. King? MR. KING: Just one thing, a resident mention ed and I noticed Norma Jeffries isn't here tonight . But it's her issue that -- her pet issue for the last three to five years, street signs. An individual from West Scranton brought this up. The gentleman I've known for 40 years and was expressing concern s about the street signs. And he heard that they were going to be replaced and what happened to that initiative . So I just would like if maybe we could send something to the Mayor's office to find out -- or DPW whoever is handling that project where we are, is it stalled ? Is it actively happening ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 I just think that it's very important that we have street signs in the City so that, you know, people know where they are going, people know what street they're on. And we have people from outside the City that are coming here. They're trying to travel through neighborhood s and it makes it very difficult when there are not accurate street signs. So that's it. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I have some comments tonight . First thing I'd like to say is happy Veterans Day to all the veterans out there. Secondly , I'm sure as the budget process unrolls I'm going to have a lot to say about this budget. For the last two years I mentioned how, you know, I think it's -- I know it's been brought to us two years in a row a million dollar's worth of spending , salary increases . PEL has warned us of, you know, 3 percent expenditures in increases per year with 1 percent in revenue s. I know Payroll Prep Tax 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 has stalled . There's some money there that we're not going to see this year. It's very hard to swallow when we're taking a look at all of these increase s in salaries . You know, we're talking $35,000 increases , $21,000 increases on top of a tax increase . And I know that, you know, it's been a recommend ation to increase taxes but it's very hard to swallow when we're seeing the amount that we're going to bring in from that increase go directly towards salaries and positions . So like I said, I'll be mention ing more about this as we go on, but that's my comments for tonight . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a comment on something that I brought up a few weeks ago when we had NDC in caucus. And I know I had been in contact with a number of people and Mr. Voldenberg had as well and DPW was going to paint lines on the handicap spots by Penn Avenue in downtown and I'm wondering where that stands. And I also am interested in setting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 up a time to walk downtown perhaps with Mr. West and the resident who was particularly concerned about Penn Avenue to see what else we need to do for the parking to ensure that people are consistently parking legally where they should be, handicap spots are not being taken up. Even the other night when I was walking downtown I did see that an alleyway was blocked by the -- I think it was First Friday. I would definitely like to continue the conversations and figure out solutions for those issues. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll reach out to Mr. West about the parking and walkthrough . DR. ROTHCHILD : I appreciate that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Is that it, Dr. Rothchild ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, that's it for this evening . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I do. So as mentioned during the caucus I had the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 opportunity to look at the budget. I got it last week. And then I posed a question . My biggest concern was the 3 percent increase . So I posed a question yesterday and my question was how much revenue will be receive d from a 3 percent tax increase ? So after looking at the budget like I said and ran all the numbers and added them all up, the 10 new positions with benefit s and the huge increases is the same amount. So -- basically the same amount. So I cannot and will not vote for a budget with a 3 percent tax increase that pays for 10 new positions and huge raises. The narrative in the budget says, oh, we have to have a tax increase because of inflation , because of coming out of COVID. Well, guess what? This is a reason not to. I mean, inflation is one thing but asking the resident s of Scranton to pay 3 percent which is a million dollars for 12 new position s and huge raises like stated earlier , 20 grand, 22 grand, 11 grand. I just have no appetite for it. And speaking of appetite , people are struggling . Inflation , it hasn't been this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 high in 40 years. People are struggling to put food on the table. People are going to struggle to put food on the table for Thanksgiving and to ask them or tell them for the most part, send a message that, yeah, we're going to increase your taxes 3 percent to pay for 10 new position s and huge raises for a select few, I have huge issue with that. That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just two issues that were brought up during the citizens participation , Mr. Voldenberg , can you -- we never got an update when I asked last week regarding the audit, did we? Can we send another request asking for an update in regards to the audit? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And also, can we reach out to IT regarding the issues with the City website , specifically the contract section and I believe it was the financial documents section on there to make sure we could get that taken care of? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes, I will. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. A couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 weeks ago Council did receive a letter from a resident of the 2500 of Winfield Avenue, you know, requesting that their streets be paved, you know, certain blocks of Winfield Avenue be paved from O'Hara Street I believe to Campbell Street. Last year it was originally on our paving list to, I believe , pave from Kane Street all the way down to O'Hara because of the bid that came in and the cost of that. There were certain areas that were cut. The 25, 26, and 27 to be exact were cut from that. But moving forward next year I was told today that they are on the top of the list for next year's paving program . So that is good news there because I know those areas, you know, really do need to be paved. Lastly, I would just like to thank everybody that's reached out this week. The last few days have been quite the whirlwind . But I do want to say, you know, I'll have more to say in the coming weeks. But I do want to say that it has been an absolute honor to sit up here on this Council . And I just want to thank you all so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 much for all the support you've given me and for reaching out this week. If you e-mailed me this week and I haven't gotten back to you yet I apologize . I promise I will get to them tomorrow . That's all I have for this evening . Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING PERMIT PARKING ON THE 1500 BLOCK OF PINE STREET. MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR.

MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , I am still working through line by line of this budget. Like I told Jeff from the Times at the beginning of this week when it was posted this is a starting point. It's not the end product . In the coming weeks, you know, I have the utmost confidence that Council will work through it and come to an equitable solution , you know, whether it's on the raises front, the tax front, you know, I do think that I am in favor of small incremental tax increases because I think they are necessary because if you keep your tax rate steady when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 especially due to a lack of reassessment in Lackawanna County, we're continually getting less money by keeping them level because the total valuation decreases every year. So I am in favor of small incremental ones. But, you know, I'm not committed one way or anther to 3 percent at this point. But moving forward I think, you know, we are going to work through this line by line and see if we can come to, you know, agreement on what works for everybody . And that's all I have on the question . Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree I'm also going to continue to review the budget and this document and to discuss with my colleagues and figure out what would be most fair for the City for employees but also for the residents . That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR.
