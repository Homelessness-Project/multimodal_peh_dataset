ROGAN: Are there any comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I just want to explain for a second what this analysis is. So the city requested support from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection DEP Recycling Technical Assistance Program to explore the possibility , and I want to underline the possibility , of implementing an incentive based or pay-as-you-throw program to encourage increase d recycling . So this project , this analysis if you look at it, provides the city information on the different types of incentive -based programs that may be implemented by the city and it provides some guidance as to what program may make the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 most sense should the city decide to implement a pay as you throw program . I did speak to the business administrator regarding this analysis and he explained to me that this was one thing that they could be considering but this isn't a definite program that the city is going to implement . They are just going to use this as a guide should in the future they want to move in that direction . So I just want to make sure that everybody understands this isn't something that is going to happen even in the near future. If you look at the analysis , I think this company can good job at explaining the benefits of it and the challenges of it. There are a number of municipalities throughout Pennsylvania and throughout the country that implemented a pay as you throw type system. But, again, if you take a look at this, there are a lot of benefits , but I can foresee a lot of challenges with it as well, so it's something that will definitely be discussed in the next couple of weeks and months. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. ROGAN: I also have quite a bit to stay on that item, but I will wait until motions .

City residents can pick them up for no charge, however , you do need to show your ID to show that you are actually a city resident . A 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 separate announcement will be made in the near future when the date has been set for the citywide leaf pickup by the DPW so that just came today. Secondly , an executive session was held prior to tonight 's meeting to discuss a matter of the litigation . MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment : Joan Hodowanitz spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Fay Franus spoke on city business . Darrell Palmer spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Sean Walsh spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Les Spindler spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on city business and matters of general concern .

REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: I have a few, most of them we already hit on during the meeting . The Greenridge project , I just wanted to weigh in on that since we did the meet the developer and the zoning board had their initial meeting , but I discussed that. I'm confident that between the neighborhood association and the developer they will be able to work the next couple of weeks and hash out some of the ideas they have, whatever , the betterment of -- the develope r also take stock and the well-being of the neighborhood itself in effect because I do believe in the project , I just hope it works well in that neighborhood and we get an agreement , so I'm looking forward to updates on that. I was going to update everybody on the Pittston Avenue flooding issues, but we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 already got that with some speakers tonight . Mrs. Reed, before we went on break we sent correspondence to PennDOT about wrong way signage and upgrading that. As of now, it hasn't been upgraded where the 2600 meets the 2500 Pittston Avenue, it just happens to be that's a big block in today's meeting , no pun intended , but if we can just send a second response over to him and see what's the holdup on that. Again, just a shout out for the census because that is important . CountyScranton 2020@gmail.com to get involved . It's monumental . It's an endeavor to get a census done, but it's very important . Get counted , get help. I thought you brought up another good point about just all of the help that there is for children in need. The last thing you ever want to do is see a child go or start their education later than they need to because it's almost impossible to make that time back up, so let's get us counted and make sure we don't leave anyone in the dust or behind as the saying goes. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 I also have something else to read it, but I'll read that during 5-F. So that's all I have for today. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I have nothing at this time. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: I do. First of all, I'd like to think City Solicitor Jessica Eskra as well as Assistant City Solicitor Joe Price for responding to my request to appear at the October 10, 2018, assessment appeals hearing as representatives of the City of Scranton . In a letter to Attorney Eskra dated October 3 I stated the following : "As you know, there have been an extra overruled amount of assessment appeals in Lackawanna County over the years and this year is no exception . Driven primarily by a lack of a countywide reassessment in nearly 50 years, property owners are turning to the appeal process in growing numbers trying to achieve equity and fairness for themselves .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Of course, while this is the right of every property owner to appeal their assessed value, it is also the right of each municipal ity to be present at appeal hearings and challenge those appeals when it is deemed appropriate and necessary . While it may not be possible to have city represent ation at each and every hearing , occasionally the assessment office will have a hearing date that is exclusively scheduled for commercial properties . Such a hearing date has been scheduled for October 10, 2018, beginning at 10 a.m., and ending with the last scheduled hearing at 1:15 p.m. At this hearing , there will be properties in Scranton with assessed valuations ranging from 3,100 for land to 503,100 for a commercial parking garage. The potential for lost revenue from such a hearing can have a damaging effect on the city's bottom line. Therefore , I would like to request that someone from your office represent the City of Scranton at this assessment appeals hearing . Efforts to reach out to someone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 from the Scranton School District might also be appropriate since we represent the same taxpayers. Thank you for attention to this matter. I have attached the Tax Assessor 's report on this hearing for your review. If you have any questions or comments , please call me and do not hesitate to call me any time. Wayne Evans, Scranton City Council man." I would like to note that they did appear -- Attorney Price appeared at the hearing on October 10, and he or someone else representing the city are scheduled to appear at the October 30 hearing representing the city at the reschedule d Electric City Garage appeal. I would also like to note that I appreciate Mrs. Schumacher 's diligence in covering the original issue of the garage and their tax liability . I am encourage d that the city, through the law department , will continue to have assessment appeal hearings back on the radar screen. The property taxpayers in the City of Scranton deserve nothing less. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 And on another note, let me see where my notes are here on this one, Pro Champs is the company that we have contract ed with to register foreclosed properties within the city. Since 2016 they have registered over 1,000 properties in Scranton , which means that we have invested over $100,000 into the successful SHAP program , Scranton Homeowners Assistance Program and it's administered by Neighbor Works. So, if you recall, the city receives a share of the fee for each registered foreclose d property . Through a unique program the money is -- the city receives instead of being deposited into the general fund, is deferred and to be used a part of the SHAP program , a program that gives grants up to $5,000 to first time homebuyers to do repairs and improvements to the exterior of the new home they recently purchased . It not only encourages new home ownership in the city, but it has a positive impact, of course, on the purchase property , the block, and the neighborhood where those homes are located . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 To date, over $130,000 in grants to 27 different homeowners have been rewarded. There are currently 11 other properties , new property owners, by the way, with pending project s waiting for additional funding and a waiting list is also being developed . A little over two years ago this was just an idea developed by this city council was supported , of course, in concurrence with the administration . Neighbor Works, our partner in this endeavor , hs done a tremendous job with this program and has even increased the amount of funding by securing additional grants. Recently , Pro Champs has notified us that there are another approximately 160 foreclosed properties that have been identified but have refused to register . However , there currently is no legal method in place to force them to comply. Thankfully, Pro Camps does have a plan in place for compliance . With authorization through the city through an ordinance they would be allowed to contract out legal services to collect those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 delinquent fees and get those properties registered . Those additional dollars would be used to continue to enhance this already excellent program . It could mean as much as an additional $60,000 in grants to another 10 to 15 homeowners in the city each and every year. So hopefully we will see legislation from the administration authorizing these additional efforts soon. If our expectations are to continue to be a city with a majority of homeowners , and I can't stress how important that is, because a healthy and sustainable city is one where the majority of the residents are living in homes that they own. And programs like this are more vital to our city's long-term well-being than they were ever before. So that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, I'd like to make a motion that city council request that all boards, commissions and authorities within the City of Scranton send a copy of their minutes of any meetings 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 that they have to city council for inclusion in Third Order on our agenda. MR. ROGAN: Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I make this motion, you know, the last few years, especially in the last year with the Scranton Recreation Authority , we were not receiving copies of their minutes . I don't think we received copies of the minutes from the Scranton Sewer Authority and I know that we don't receive them from the Scranton Civil Service Commission . So I do think that any board, commission or authority within the city should send their minutes to us so we can put it on our agenda and that the public can view it, so that's why I'm making the motion. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor say aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The 200 block of Arthur Avenue, 700 block of Mahan Court between Gibson and Pine and Quincy and Myrtle Avenue, residents at a recent hill neighborhood meeting requested that storm drains located in these areas be cleaned and we did receive confirmation from Pennsylvania American Water that they were cleaned so I just want to let everybody know that. I'd also like to make a motion at this time as chairperson of the Department of Public Works, I'd like to make a motion to call a public caucus with Mayor Courtright and any appropriate members of his administration to discuss the recent flooding in the last few months, specifically , the city's response to this flooding, protocols that are current ly in place or a lack thereof , and what the plan is to deal with the dangerous sometimes catastrophic flooding spots throughout the city that effect our citizens . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . I make this motion for a number of different reasons . I just want to mention that be weeks ago I had asked very specific questions of the mayor and his administration regarding the flood in August of this year, and my questions had to deal with reimbursement issues with the state, whether or not we had submitted damages and whether we are going to get funding for the reimbursement process . I received a note from the city solicitor that they were putting something together but I still have not received anything which weeks later makes absolutely no sense. Another one of my concerns was after that major flooding event, I don't think that the city did enough to notify residents on how to submit for damages , submit for a reimbursement process and there was a process in place. I know the city put something on the website , I didn't see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 anything in the newspaper and I saw nothing on the news, I didn't see a press release or anything like that and from the mayor and his administration . The other reason I think we need this meeting is because people in the city are under the false impression I think that an Arcadis study is going to solve all of our storm water issues, and it's not. The Arcadis study is simply to show us how we are supposed to fund the authority and how we are supposed to set up the authority . We need a plan in place to deal with some of the issues that were mention ed tonight on Pittston Avenue, major issues in Keyser Valley, throughout West Scranton , North Scranton , so on and so forth. I don't think that we can wait for a study. We really need leadership from the mayor on this issue because , as I mention ed to the gentleman , Mr. Palmer, who spoke earlier , I get calls and Mrs. Reed knows this to be true because I forward a lot of them to her so we can get them to the appropriate department , I get calls weekly from people who are getting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 flooded . Pittston Avenue, Keyser Valley. I had specific questions about the pumping station on Merrifield Avenue. There is residents that get flooded every single time in rains, so there has got to be something that we can do. Mr. Jeffers mention ed, and I think everybody understands , that it won't be solved overnight , but I do think that we need to get everybody in a room and get a plan together to deal with it. I know that it costs money, but as I said, there has to be something even temporarily that we can do. I know residents down on Merrifield Avenue were talking about the possibility of the city buying them out because they get flooded every time it rains, so I don't know if that's a possibility . But I do think that we need to assess some of the most dangerous spots throughout the city and come up with a plan to rectify them. Come up with a dollar amount if that's what it needs to be. Go to the state, march on the state capital . We have problem in the city and I hear from some people, well, it's a 100-year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 storm. Well, it seems to me that we are getting these storms more frequently so we need to do something . MR. EVANS: On the question , I would also ask that a representative from Pennsylvania American Water come to the meeting if at all possible because they are responsible for the combined systems of storm and sewer, and one of the big problems is when we have an issue like tonight we don't even know where to begin to call, who is responsible . Is it storm water? Is it the combined system? And I think any of the technology that will determine that very quickly, and I think we need to come with a better protocol to what happened when it resident has a complaint and where do they go first. So I think if you are all -- that would be a friendly amendment to your motion if you don't mind. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, when I said any appropriate officials I meant there DPW, anybody that the mayor would deem important to be in this meeting , and I do think it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 important that the mayor is here because , again, people are looking for leadership . We are getting called -- I have been calls since the beginning of the summer from people throughout the city and they call Pennsylvania American Water and Pennsylvania American Water tells them to call DPW, DPW tells them to call someplace else, and again, there needs to be a protocol in place here, even a hotline, something , where when it rains and we get flooded in these spots throughout the city there has got to be a plan in place, and maybe there are protocols , but we need to know about it and so does the public, and especially , and again, I'll stress this, I would like to know what is going on with the reimbursement from the state for that flooding event in August. Are we getting money from the state? What were the damages that were compiled and how did they get that information out to residents because I know people in Keyser Valley, people in West Scranton , Al Young over on Wyoming Avenue, ten, fifteen , twenty-thousand dollars worth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 of damages . Replacing furnaces every time it rains. It's getting to the point where it's ridiculous . So I think, again, we all need to get into a room, invite the public and all of these people are affected by it and come up with a plan. Not the Arcadis study, because that's a totally different thing, how is the DPW and how are we as the City of Scranton going to deal with these issues and I think it's very important that we do that now and we do not wait. All in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Also, we sent a letter in regards to 361 North Sumner Avenue, 363 and 359 North Sumner, again, because of major flooding issues. People's front yards and basement s are getting flooded so we went the details of this to DPW, very concerning . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 There was a large hole, a sink hole that opened up at 359 North Sumner Avenue and 363 North Sumner Avenue so we would ask that that be looked at. The 1400 block of Cherry Street on East Mountain , there is a drainage ditch, Mrs. Reed, at 1425 that's blocked . The water is rushing through people's yards as well as onto the street and flooding neighbors cellars . These people continue to call the city and they are putting thousands of dollars worth of work into their house and it keeps happening to them so if we could send that to the DPW as well. Also, Mrs. Schumacher asked a few weeks ago about a list of equipment that the DPW uses specifically for storm water management . If we could send another request because I would like to see that myself. The Keyser Valley Community Center parking lot flooding issues, I have been receiving calls about this. It's come to my attention that the Keyser Valley neighborhood association apparently received 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 a grant through Senator Blake's Office and the work was put out to bid but apparently nobody bid on this project yet from what my understanding is, so if we could send a note or a letter to the city administration asking for an update on this whole thing and if there is anyway that we can help, the city can help with this project because , again, another major issue, the parking lot floods every time it rains. Also, I asked last week about a transfer from the Worker's Compensation Trust Fund to the IT Department in the amount of $349,000. I wanted to know specifically what necessitated this transfer . Mr. Bulzoni did get back to us with a list of items that are being funded from this transfer , but I am going to ask for clarification on that because I am a little concerned about this method of transferring money from the Worker's Comp Fund. What it paid for were some things in the Police Department and then the Serenti Center that the city recently acquired . Also, again, on the storm water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 issues, there is a manhole at Race and Brown Street in the plot that's overflowing with sewage every time it rains so we are going to send that along to DPW. We did find out from Pennsylvania American Water that that is a DPW issue, that line is the responsibility of the city. And that's all I have for this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just two items, first, I wanted to talk about what was brought up by one of our speakers and it was written about in the Scranton Times is just a little background on how firefighters are hired in the City of Scranton . The Scranton Times, of course, never missing an opportunity to take a cheap shot at somebody wrote a very unfair article about a recently hired firefighter . A little background on how the Civil Service Test works to become a firefighter in the City of Scranton . It has absolutely nothing to do with who are you, if you have a relative that works for the city, the only preference points that are given out is for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 veterans , which I believe should be given out. The test is in three parts. The first part is a written exam. It is not a written exam administered by the city or written by the city it's done by a third party. The city fire department , council , the mayor, we don't have access to any of the questions or anything that is given out. So the people will sign up, they take their written test. After the written test is complete , those individuals who pass move onto the next phase which is the physical test. I believe they have run a mile under a certain amount of time, climb up a ladder, carry weights , bench press, your typical physical strength test. There is certainly no way to get preferential treatment on a physical test. You could either run a mile in a certain amount of time or you can't. You could either lift the weight or you can't. The third part of the test is in oral examination and then a background check. That is conducted , again, after only those who pass the first two parts, and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 believe that the first and the second part are where the vast majority of people that don't make it to final cut get eliminated . After that part, there is a brief background check. Felonies , I believe , would disqualify anyone from serving but in this case the individual who was hired I believe was in the top five out of a large number of people that were hired. This is not any case of favoritism or nepotism . If the school board -- or if the newspaper wants to look into nepotism they should take a ride down to the school board and look at how many school directors have family members working for the city, working for the school district that were hired through political patronage processes . The Civil Service Test for police and fire is done strictly on a qualifications basis. There are other jobs that are given out at will. For instance , secretaries within certain departments , some other positions are hired strictly on an at-will basis where it's a friend or a family member and somebody wanted to hire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 them they could. So, unfortunately , that does happen in government , it's happened in the city through the years, but anyone who knows anything about how civil service hiring works knows that this entire story really should have never even been written . Again, it was just an attempt at a cheap headline . Moving on, Councilman Gaughan brought this up, and I know a couple of residents did as well, the pay as you throw analysis , a couple things I wanted to talk about on here, as anyone that watches these meetings knows I long have opposed the flat rate for a garbage fee. Currently residents pay without any discount $300 for the year and they could throw out as much garbage as they want. My objection to that system is that it rewards those who create more garbage and punishes those who create less. This system, which is a hybrid system, and I'm not endorsing that a hybrid system is the best way to go, I think a strictly per bag fee is the most fair way, but these hybrid fees, two of them that were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 mentioned , and some of the details weren't mention ed from the podium, but there were two scenarios that were laid out. Scenario one includes a base fee of $250 per year, so it's $50 less than the current , and that would allow anyone to throw out two bags of garbage per week. So if you throw out two bags of garbage per week or less you would certainly save money under this system. Any bags above that amount, would be $2 per sticker . So if you have three bags, it would be your flat fee and then $2 per week and so on. The second system which is set up is a base fee with no free waste. So it would $175 base fee and then you would pay $1 per sticker . So that same person that throws out two bags a week under that system would pay $275. If you threw out one bag a week you would pay approximately $127. So that's what a hybrid system would look like. Looking at a strictly per bag fee would be say if it was $2 per bag and then you would just pay only on the amount you throw out. The hybrid system is most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 similar to your sewer bill where you pay -- everyone pays a flat fee per unit depending on whether you use zero gallons of water or if you are filling a pool, and then the second component is based strictly on your utilization . I do think this analysis definitely should be looked into further and there are a lot of pros and cons to this type of system. One thing that was not mentioned in here that will somebody mention ed from the podium was privatization , I think that is a simple way to find out how much it costs is you just simply put it out for bid and see what proposals come in and what those proposals look like. I have long felt that it should be put out to bid just to see if we are truly getting the best deal by having garbage done in-house. But I was grateful to have this study and be able to look through it and, as I mentioned , it does lay out the pros and cons pretty fairly. I do believe this study was done pretty down the middle, but it will keep the conversation going. I think one of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the most hated items that we hear from residents in Scranton is the garbage fee and particularly those who do not throw out a lot of garbage . The other items I didn't mention that I really love about this type of system, a hybrid or a strictly per bag system is it would dramatically increase recycling . When you look through our neighbor hoods, there are people that do not recycle at all and if they were paying more based on how much they put out I guarantee every shed of cardboard and every last soda can would be put in one of our recycling bins, so that would save the city money and it would help the environment as well. That is all I have for tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Can I add one additional thing? I'm sorry. MR. ROGAN: Sure. MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed, I apologize , I forgot. I don't want to leave this off the list. 95 Lynwood Avenue on East Mountain , I met with a gentleman up there this past week and he is also having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 flooding issues. I'll get together with you after the meeting , he provided videos and I was up there to see if, so if we could send that to DPW and ask for them to take a look at it. And, also, I received an issue at 3 30 South Irving Avenue about an empty lot and the neighbor next door keeps getting flooded , the lots pitched towards his house so I don't know if anything could be done there, but I'll get together with you after the meeting on that. MR. ROGAN: And, actually , I am glad you mentioned that, if you could add to the Lynwood letter, the 200 block of South Sumner Avenue, I actually had some videos sent to me from that block, during heavy rains there is significant issues going on if we could direct that to the DPW as well.
