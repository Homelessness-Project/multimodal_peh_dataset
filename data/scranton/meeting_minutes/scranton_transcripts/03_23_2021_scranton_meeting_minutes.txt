MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I had three comments on Third Order items. So looking at 3-C, there seemed to be -- going through those minutes, it seems like there was confusion going over the date when to submit for retirement . I kind of heard that was some kind of an issue but I also saw it in those minutes. And I think also maybe Mr. Deeley could touch on this a little later on. I think he stated that there was -- I think he stated that it was hard to deal with with City Hall being closed. So if it's a possibility that Mr. Deeley could maybe touch on the timeline when City Hall plans on opening any time soon. And then with 3-I, the Open Government cost summary , there were several answers in the disclosure form where it says specific personnel names after execution of contract if he could just explain that somewhat . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have one. Friends of the Poor next Wednesday , March 31st at Scranton High will have an Easter food and basket giveaway which is pretty cool for the holiday coming up between 10 and 5 p.m. at Scranton High. And there will be onsite registration . That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just wanted to congratulate the Scranton Fringe Festival and their partners on this past weekend 's Porch Fest. It was really successful . A lot of people went throughout the City and utilize d the maps that they provided to check out the property owners and businesses that were participating in it. I know that it gave me and my family a great opportunity to get out of the house and go for a walk around the neighborhood and listen to some music. And it was just a very enjoyable weekend . And I hope to see more events like that. It was, you know, it was very safe in terms of COVID and, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 really nice way to -- that I get to see people. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? Okay. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from following individual s: Glenn Clark, Bev deBarros , and Thomas Coyne. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the comments into the record? MS. REED: The first submission is from Mr. Glenn Clark as follows : I reference exhibit B as it pertains to this correspondence . My name is Glenn R Clark and my spouse is Valerie M Clark. We jointly own the property at 801/803 N Main Ave. This property is a 4 unit apartment building licensed as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 required by the City of Scranton . Its been in the family since 1952 and my wife and I occupy one of the apartments . We have parking for 2 vehicles which my wife and I consume . We have always had a no parking zone on the westerly side of Main Ave. Our three tenants traditionally park on the northerly side of Oram St. Two of our three tenants are senior citizens and the other tenant is a single male in his late 50’s. Most of the time parking is available along the northerly side of Oram St. This parking restriction would require our tenants to find parking in the 1200 of Oram or somewhere along the 700 or 800 of Main or Hyde Park. This will also extend their walk to their residences at night. While they sometimes are required to do that now, this change would require them to source alternate parking all of the time. We feel we will lose these high quality tenants , two of whom have been with us for over twenty years and one ten. In addition to the issues this project is causing me, the project causes parking issues for two business operations recently opened at the corner of Hyde Park Ave 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 and Oram St. I would also like to point out that on the Northwesterly corner of Main and Oram an old steel utility pole exists that has no wires or lights on it of any kind. This pole provides the biggest impediment to traffic congestion as drivers are always afraid of hitting it. This dormant utility pole should be removed for smooth traffic flow. The expansion of this no parking zone will also entice off route tractor drivers , who ignore the low bridge sign, to use the street because of its openness . I’m thinking my concerns probably will not cause you to rethink the expansion of the no parking zone on the Northern side of Westbound Oram St. Ideally , for the sake of my neighbors , the new businesses , and myself please consider not expanding this no parking zone. If your final decision is to put the expansion of the no parking zone in place then I would like the city to consider providing me with a grant to create a parking area for my tenants by paving the grassy area between the curb along the northerly side of Oram St and my sidewalks or at least a no charge permit to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 this modification . Please keep me informed of the outcome of this commentary . MS. REED: The second submission is provided by Miss Bev deBarros . Dear Friends ~ about that sign with the curse word in Spanish , if that would have been the same word, in the same predominantly displayed location , written in English , would it also have been permitted ? Vulgar graffiti is not tolerated . Also, I didn't hear the response to Marie Shumacher 's question about the Capouse Pool I wish we had a t least four small pools through out the city.,so our kids could enjoy the benefits of summer swimming . Why wait for a very big pool at NayAug, which is not always accessible to our city kids, anyway ? When that whole slide installation was erected , who got to use it, but mostly the richer families from out of the city? The admission fee was prohibitive for our local neighbors .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Please consider using some of our empty lots for b-ball, a few swings and benches , etc. In addition to the exercise and fun of playing together outside , friendships can be developed , making us more of a real community . Thank you bev deBarros MS. REED: And the third and final submission is from Mr. Tom Coyne as follows : Scranton City Council It has been a while since I presented before you and it seems some of the same issues raised a year ago are still raised unresolved . First as a suggestion , I would invest in a few fire plug caps to use instead of the pool, to make temporary low cost splash areas. Add outdoor rubber mats that can be assembled and disassembled on spot and you have a splash pad that can be mobile once the pool project is complete to be used at other sites. If large inner cities can have them installed on fire plugs as splash areas, maybe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 something like that could be used as a splash zone, allowing some water play in Nay Aug Park this summer with minimal effort. It's not a giant pool, but with a few installed , it would offer something . After construction is complete , fire plug sprayers could be used in coordination with summer events if requested , alone or with mats. (Since assembled mats can be adjusted to the size needed). Second, Trash. Long ago, I suggested isolation of the Garbage Collection funds from the General funds. This was inspired by Baltimore when they raised new funds for schools from the casinos . Baltimore was allowed to collect funds, but they had to keep all collected funds in a separate sequestered fund. It was not mixed in with the general city funds and could ONLY be spent on the Schools . (In our case only on trash/sanitation ). This separation allows auditing , being responsible to the letter of the code and law, and provides a single point audit for both cost and revenue generation , it isolates the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 garbage fee from the general fund. Language also needs to be binding that no funds can be migrated out of that fund, to any other city operation or expenditure . (No line transfers ). Third, the Mayor has used the state of emergency as an excuse for a year now to avoid protocol . Ignoring hiring and required interviews , summarily ignoring city council mandated pay scale, eliminating workers budgeted for hire as a city employee to create an unbid HR position at will, handing out the position to a new fire chief by fiat, creating public safety rules for the pandemic , the role of City Council and not the mayor, per the home rule charter , as the mayor only enforces , it's councils job to legislate rules, including on health and safety. (None of the Covid orders obeyed the time requirements ). This police chief should not be allowed to rise to the spot as it is prohibited , and nothing in the law allowed the mayor to break the law or change the city code of rule and ethics. Unless you are ready to install a new code that Scranton laws and city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 codes are now optional . Retrospective laws are an abomination and retroactive hiring is just a way to abuse a legal structure . If the time is to short change it going forward , but as for now, the law is what it is. You can't have it both ways and expect to be respected . Fourth I understand the reason people want to speak at council and have a “Voice”. The inflection words produce is much more than the context of dry text. Public Speech can move people more than just words and that is missing . Fifth as I have more to submit but limited time, water main repairs were done at Oak ave and Nancy Drive in Minooka , the road was cut and though well done, a square patch was left in place. The cut curb section was replaced , but it was not a curb to curb pave as suggested . And last, why would the city outsource again with a maintenance and upkeep fee, a city portal that can be built, owned and internally operated . Questions asked are proper, if v provides we leave how will the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 information be provided , what format will it be in, are there conversion tools OpenGov provides to aid in that transition and what other government body has pulled its data from OpenGov ? Wisdom says to reach out to one of those cities for input for how an exit went before jumping into the deep end. Thank you for your time. (Concludes public comment as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: That is all, Councilman Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question ? On the question , just to respond -- well, first of all, I want to thank Mr. Clark, Miss deBarros and Mr. Coyne for submitting comments tonight . With Mr. Clark's concerns with regarding the parking changes on Oram Street, Mrs. Reed has been taking those comment s and has reached out to PennDOT . And PennDOT has responded really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 quick, which we appreciate . So I just want to read their response -- this is from Tom Pichiarella -- I think I'm saying his last name right, the assistant traffic engineer for signals at PennDOT . To Mr. Clark's concerns , he said that PennDOT has adjusted the lane striping to maintain at least one of the two parking spots on Oram Street for Mr. Clark's tenant at 801-803 Main Avenue. He also states that in order to maintain the second parking spot PennDOT has to modify the existing curb radius on curb of Oram and Main to help buses make the turn which may be possible with the redesign of the corner curb in regard to the iron pole that Mr. Clark mentioned at the corner of Oram and Main as Mr. Clark mentioned as an obstruction , PennDOT plans on removing that. In regards to the no parking on the southeastern side of Oram Street for the business at the corner of Oram and Hyde Park, the business has a small parking lot on Hyde Park Avenue. Also PennDOT does believe any customers have been parking on the southern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 side of Oram Street since there's not enough room for through traffic if Mr. Clark's tenants park on one side of Oram and business customer s park on the opposite side of Hyde Park Avenue. So this was just sent to us this afternoon . So I'll forward that to the rest of Council if it hasn't been already . And hopefully that takes care of some of the concerns that -- as for Miss deBarros , her comment s we appreciate those. And as for the Capouse pool, I believe that this was part of a larger conversation that's being had in regards to the overall kind of revitalization of Pine Brook. I know that the City in conjunction with one of the nonprofits now -- the name is escaping me, is going for grant money and looking to redesign that area. Whether it's -- I don't know if they were going to have it be a pool or some kind of play area. And Mr. Coyne's comments , we will definitely take into consideration . And I think one of his concerns had to do with Nancy Drive up in Minooka and the pave cut. So, Mrs. Reed, if we could get that information to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 pave cut inspector , that would be great. That's all I have. Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Just to add on the Capouse pool question too, I think, you know, we have to wait for the assessment from McLane and Associates . I believe that would be a part of it, you know, and then that gets some of that front end work done where, you know, we could go out and start applying for grants to, you know, help get that area, you know, cleaned up and useful again for the residents of that area. DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree. I believe that's what they're waiting on. But then there's also the Pine Brook revitalization . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. The Pine Brook revitalization is more -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Right, and I know that they're, you know, they're well aware and also want to see that not necessarily fixed but turned into something that's useable for the neighborhood . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I just want to touch 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 on the Oram Street piece. So my understanding -- I haven't seen the correspondence from PennDOT yet. So my understanding is they're going to provide or potentially the parking spots for the tenants that were mentioned . But I thought that that no parking piece goes up even farther halfway to the middle of the block. So I'd like to get more data or confirmation on that. I read the piece that came to us. But it's very confusing at this point. MR. GAUGHAN : I think what we could do -- oh, I'm sorry, Mark. You froze and then I thought you stopped talking . Go ahead. MR. MCANDREW : That's fine. That's fine. I'm just a little confused or the way it's written is confusing . So I just want more clarity . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I think it might make sense if we introduce it tonight and then we have next week for final passage if we maybe get on a call with Mr. Pichiarella from PennDOT . He seems to be really knowledgeable . Well, he is knowledgeable . He's the head 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 person in terms of signals for PennDOT . So maybe if we set up or scheduled a call with you or and Kyle or whoever else wants to get on it. That would probably be helpful to go through it point by point. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, with that being said, I mean, I wouldn't mind getting on that call either. I was going to ask some of my questions -- I was going to put them on the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. So, Lori, if you could reach out to Mr. Pichiarella , and if Mark and Tom want to get on the call with him that would be great before next week. MS. REED: Will do. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Very good. All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 ayes have it and so moved. Okay, we do have two guests here tonight , one Carl Deeley is a glutton for punishment . He keeps coming back always with a smile on his face. He's been very good to us in terms of, you know, giving us information and always coming to Council which we appreciate very much. And we also have Kelly Lindsey here from Kohanski Company who has been the lead with our 2019 audit which we received and put in Third Order back on March 9th agenda. So I will turn it over to you, Carl and Kelly, if you just want to run through some of the bigger points from the audit and anything else that you would like to present . Thank you. MR. DEELEY: Thank you, Chairman Gaughan . It is always a pleasure to speak to Council and also to receive the kind of feedback in terms of how we're doing and what we need to do better. I think this is a good introduction to where we are now. So the 2019 audit -- and I'll hand it over to Kelly in a moment just so she could give you the highlight s. And again, this is obviously the first time I'm going through this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 process . So I think in terms of the information that Council maybe would require in the future or maybe how you want these exit kind of meetings to go that would be very helpful so we can work on that. And we did come out of the audit with several improvements that were identified I think from Kelly and the team from Kohanski so that we've got those. And I would like to cover a couple of those at the end and also the schedule for the 2020 audit as well. So at this point, Kelly, if I could hand it over to you and also provide the key points and the takeaways for the 2019. MS. LINDSEY : Okay. Thank you for having me tonight . So regrettably this information is a little outdated. So I'll try to make it brief. If we could start with the independent auditors report, I'll just point out a few things that kind of are important to understand about the audit process and what we're doing. If you look at the first page of the independent auditors report, the first -- the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 second paragraph actually is management's responsibility for the financial statements . And if you read what it says, it says is that management is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements . So that includes everything from, you know, gathering the data and then, you know, controlling the data, making sure internal controls are in place and then, you know, ultimately preparing the financial statement . The next paragraph goes onto read that our responsibility as auditor s is only to give an opinion on these financial statements . So even though we prepared the financial statements and put the data in here, ultimately it's management 's responsibility for the content . The next thing I'd like to point out is the last paragraph on the first page talks about our process a little bit. And it talks about how in performing the audit, you know, we as auditors have to look at the risks and try to determine , you know, the best approach to the audit to minimize any misstatements .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 As part of that, we do spend time looking at the internal controls of the City to make sure that the controls are in place to prevent misstatements from happening . That was a little bit challenging this year given, you know, the restrict ions on being, you know, off site at the city. We were able to do some work that we normally would do. This year in particular we really took a look at the payroll cycle and were able to do some test of control s over the payroll process . Usually we just pick one area and kind of zero in on that and really look at it more closely then we would in some years. So fortunately at the beginning of the summer before things really started to get locked down we were able to come onsite and do some tests and control over payroll data. And we were happy to report that we didn't have any control finding s with that process or just in general with any of the internal controls that we were able to review. So that, you know, is part of the audit process . So we were able to do that fortunately with, you know, with the lockdowns. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 If you look -- turn to the next page, this is the summary of our opinions . Again, you will see that the only adverse opinion is on the aggregate discretely (inaudible ) component unit which is the Parking Authority . Again, we've talked about ways to address that. And I think ultimately , you know, the only way to make this go away is that there is some way that the Parking Authority could be audited . I think we're still trying to work through that. MR. GAUGHAN : Kelly, not to interrupt you, that's been an adverse opinion now for a number of years, correct ? I feel like that always comes up every time we have an audit. MS. LINDSEY : Yes, I believe so. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MS. LINDSEY : All of the other opinions on all of the individual funds and then the overall entity opinions are all unmodified . So what that means is that all of the information present in the financial statement is presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 there is nothing -- there's nothing outside of the way that should be. So that's good. Are there any other questions about the auditor 's report? MR. GAUGHAN : No, just and I think we went over this a little bit the last time that you had come in. But in terms of the Parking Authority , you know, what, like, they have to -- do they have to have their own audit or you have to access to their files or how does that work? MS. LINDSEY : Well, two things could happen. Someone else could come in and do an audit of that entity or, you know, we as the City's auditors could be engaged to do that as an extension of the City's audit. You know, I really don't -- you know, we haven't spent much time looking at it. I don't know, you know, we haven't spent much time looking at it. I don't know, you know, what that would look like in terms of the audit because I'm not sure, you know, what, you know, obviously the assets of the Parking Authority still exist. But beyond that, I'm not sure what an audit would entail. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Is there any other questions on that portion of it? MR. SCHUSTER : You know, with that being said, I mean, maybe, Mr. Hayes, what's the best way to get an audit of the Parking Authority done? ATTY. HAYES: I'm sorry, what was that again, Tom? MR. SCHUSTER : So this piece has come up adverse for several audits on what is the best way to get an audit of the Parking Authority done? ATTY. HAYES: I don't know. I think at this point in time we'd have to, you know, I don't know what the best option is at this point in time. I mean, we can go off the record and talk about some legal avenues that we would pursue. I don't know that I want to say them right here. But, you know, that's something I could research for you. MR. SCHUSTER : You know, with that being said, I didn't mean that put you on the spot with that. I was -- is that something Council just needs to request or does it have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 to go through a different route? ATTY. HAYES: I think Council can request it and see what the initial response would be. And if they don't, then, you know, we can look at other more formal ways to get it. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. ATTY. HAYES: I'll look into it for you, Tom. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other questions ? Okay. Did you have anything else, Kelly? MS. LINDSEY : It's up to you. I'm happy to go through some of the numbers of the financial statements , like I said, you know, we're looking at 2019. So some of this after the year we've had, it seems like a long time ago. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I just -- I'd be interested and, I mean, I was looking at this before if you could just highlight surplus fund balance , you know, some of the bigger numbers . MS. LINDSEY : All right. So if everyone could look at page eight, I think the statement of revenue expenditure and change of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the fund balances is probably where the most useful information is if we want to look at kind of recap the year end of 2019. If you look towards the middle of the page a couple of things that I think are important to highlight is that during that year in question the debt was reduced by 6.4 million . And if you go down a little bit further on that page you'll see that really the only new debt that was incurred during that year were some leases for some capital equipment . So you paid down 6.4 million and there was only about 400,000 of new debt that was undertaken that year. So I think that's important to know. You'll also see that there was a significant amount of capital outlay during the year. There was approximately 5 million in investment back into the City. Included in there was over a million dollars in the City's parks. There was about 700,000 in sidewalk renovations and almost 3 million dollars in new equipment purchase d for the City. So with those two things when you think about those two things and then in total, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 the general fund finished with, you know, a positive number. You know, most of the other funds did as well. I think that's important to note. I do want to point out too that if you look at it, there is a 22 million dollar decrease in fund balance in the general fund. And I think it's important to note what happened there was that the money related to the sale of the Sewer Authority was sitting in an investment account in the general fund. That money was just transferred to special cities more just as an accounting procedure . So you'll see that that money shifted from the general fund to special cities. So when you're looking at that negative 22 million dollar decrease in the general fund balance , that is why that happened . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Any other questions ? My question is more towards just the process . Obviously , you know, we know that the audit was very late this year compared to, you know, when by the code we should have it. Now, I know that you and Carl and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the administration provided updates every few weeks which we appreciated . And I know that the pandemic had, you know, something to do with the fact that it was late. But can you just talk about that maybe, Carl or Kelly, whoever wants to take that question on the reason for the lateness of the audit? MR. DEELEY: Absolutely . Kelly was in the weeds on this stuff. You know, when we first started looking at this we met in July was the first meeting with Kelly. And we put together an outline for the activities in terms of breakdown and what the requirements were to track the hand over of information to Kohanski . And, you know, we were tracking that. But we had several issues I think where the information when it's taken across was not either complete or we had questions about the information which then the back and forth, I think, between the different departments , you know, became and issue. And so, yeah, we were meeting on this regularly and, of course, Kohanski we're not the only entity (inaudible ) you know, so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 we've got a timeline . And when we got off that timeline it puts pressure on Kohanski to do this. So we do have kind of I think nine items of material things that we need to work on process -- process related in terms of the way that we're doing our accounting that we need to improve going into the 2020 audit. We did meet today actually to do that to start that process of revising that timeline so identifying in more detail what the requirements are from the City's side to provide to Kohanski . So what we're doing is we're both -- on the City's side and Kohanski , you know, after today's meeting is putting those details together . We're going to get back together the week after next to put a much more defined plan together that we can track and also make it more visible . The other reason for is not just the fact that it's delayed , right, it's badly delayed , you know, which is not acceptable is that what we do this year we do need to incorporate into the new operating system into OpenGov . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 So the information that we require for the audit, you know, we can make that more readily available . In terms of doing one thing that Kelly mentioned about was the, you know, the testing , the testing we could do that as well internally so we don't have to put that burden on the auditor . So there's a lot of benefit s that we could built into the schedule for the 2020 audit which could then be put into OpenGov so that will take out a lot of the manual work. And I think this year as you may know from previous ly is something that I learned now the hard way, there's a lot of manual transposition of data, a lot of kind of downloading information , cross referencing on Excel spreadsheet s which are prone to error (inaudible .) And I think as Kelly mentioned it didn't help. The pandemic didn't help obviously . We had people in the office and working from home which didn't help. But, yeah, overall we had a plan. But I think the execution of that plan wasn't good. And so it was the execution needs to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 improve and the level of detail of that plan needs to improve as well. So the plan was delinquent and basically the execution of that plan too. So that's what we're working on now, which again, I think the week after next we can share that I think with Council as well so we could see what the plan is for 2020. We like to see this side by side what the plan was for 2019 versus what we're now going to do. So, Kelly, you have some comments on this issue. You're obviously dealing with the detail, the back and forth, right, so you probably have more detail in terms maybe of what the issues were with getting the tests done on time. MS. LINDSEY : Okay. We did receive some of the information to do the audit earlier in the year. So like I said before, we were able to get in and do some of the internal control testing and some of the smaller funds. I think just with some of the issues with the pandemic I know the cyber incident I think in City Hall had something to do with it. But we didn't really get most of the information we needed to do the audit as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 result of many factors until October . You know, we were able to get the testing done. You know, most of it was remote. It was a little bit challenging this year for sure. But then ultimately there was -- the report that we needed from the actuary on the OPEB Plan that held it up, that information wasn't received until January . So once we had that we were able to complete the audit and all of the reporting within a couple weeks and we had the financial statements issued in February . So, you know, there was a lot of different things that went on this year, you know, hopefully those, you know, definitely won't be repeated for 2020. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, believe me they -- we hope that they're not repeated . This has been -- 2020 has -- hopefully no more pandemics or, you know, it's terrible . But we appreciate it very much. Any other question or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I was going to bring up pretty much the same thing you did, Billy. I hear from -- I still hear from people constantly about this years' audit, last years' audit, the year before so -- and the timeliness 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 of it. And, you know, we're trying to put a budget together it's very hard without the numbers . So I'm glad to hear there's a plan in place. I hope to hear good things next year around this time that -- actually before and maybe OpenGov is the answer. And I hope it is and it helps us streamline some of this process for everybody . MR. DEELEY: We've done some benchmarking as well across other cities and municipalities in terms of, you know, their audit perform ance and also their documentation and that's something else we want to bring into it. So we can learn, right, we can learn from other municipalities as well as to what they're doing and we can see what they're doing well and the timing that they do. So, you know, the intent is as we've discussed the last week is really a step change, right, in the way that we manage data. And it's certainly for recording , reporting the transparency of that, the access to that data. Ultimately we're going to get the tools in place to do it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 We have to make sure that we have the process es as well that help us live up to that so that we could match the capability of the system. MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks, Carl. Any other questions on the audit for Kelly or Carl? Okay. I think we're good. Thank you so much. We really appreciate it. And, you know, thanks for working with us on that. MS. LINDSEY : Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Gaughan , I just have a couple questions for -- if we're finished with the audit those couple questions for Mr. Deeley. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, sure. Carl, would you mind sticking around for a few minutes ? MR. DEELEY: Absolutely . My pleasure . MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks, Kelly. We appreciate it. MS. LINDSEY : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Yeah, so when looking at Third Order, Mr. Deeley, if you could hear me, I think it was -- let me get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 back to it, 3-C. It seemed like there was some confusion over the date to submit intent for retirement . Can you kind of explain what was going on there? MR. DEELEY: Yeah, during the -- I'm not sure what the confusion was. I don't know who was confuse d and when they were confused . I could probably answer the question easier. But in terms of the submit for the retirement , it relates to the start of the changes , right, for the benefits package . So people could retire under the old CBA, right, up to a certain point when the new conditions come into play. So from the benefits perspective , the first of April is when for the clerical union that comes into play. So the people retired I think it was based on the lead time for the processing of their request . So I'm not sure what the date was now. But we -- but as to the pension meeting that we had last month, we actually held it open so we could allow people time to prepare requesting for that retirement package. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I saw there was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 some -- I think the date was like, maybe February 28th. But then it might have went to the end of the year. And I saw in those meeting minutes there was a lot of discussion about that date. MR. DEELEY: Yeah, I could look at my notes and find out the exact timeline on that for the communications that we have. MR. SCHUSTER : And the other thing I felt in those minutes, I think you made a comment that with City Hall being closed it was hard to work out some of those details possibly . I don't remember what the exact phrase was, but does the administration have a timeline to open up City Hall and get all the services -- MR. DEELEY: No. It's a priority for any business , right, including City Hall. So we're partial ly open right now and we're open by appointment as required . But, yes, we are -- we were to do a readiness check on that right now. We started that last week going around all of the public building s getting ready. We do have some modification which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 we're making just, you know, from security as well as public health perspective . So we're planning to open as soon as we can. And that's something which I'm thinking it's going to be in line, obviously with guideline that we get from the states and maybe see what other, you know, other municipalities are doing. But we are getting ready to open. In terms of when we get the go-ahead and we get the approval then we could open the doors. So the timing of that, I think that's something that we can talk about and we should talk about it with Council as well in terms of what's appropriate . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, with the readiness check is there a timeline for the completion of that? MR. DEELEY: Yes, we've got that for the buildings so we know what we need to do. We've got some security things that we got to work on at City Hall. It's got a four week lead time so that what basically that does is ensures, you know, we've got proper access to the public. We've also got the necessary restrictions as well, right, for safety of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 employees as well in the building . MR. SCHUSTER : And then Item 3-I, it was the cost and financial disclosures that are on that Open Government piece. Some of the answers in those sheets, the term specific personnel names after execution of contract . Can you give just an explanation on that? MR. DEELEY: That I'll have to take a look at. I know our legal department went through this with OpenGov before we -- before we put the contract forward . So I'll have to take a look at that and kind of get a full explanation of it. MR. SCHUSTER : I'm trying to see where it is specifically about -- yeah, it lists the names of individual s that were registered federal or state lobbyists. And I think it just said, you know, provide specific personnel names after contract execution . MR. DEELEY: Yeah, I don't know. I'll have to take a look at that. What page is it on? MR. SCHUSTER : It's on page -- the pages aren't numbered . It's on page six of seven number -- six of seven number one and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 there was two subcategories under number one and then number two. MR. DEELEY: Okay. I'll take a look at that and I'll get an answer to you. MR. GAUGHAN : I think that I'm reading that now. The first part says not applicable . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I guess that's where my confusion is. It seems like it's not applicable . But then it kind of -- it seems to read, like, if there is someone doing that, the names will be given after the contract is executed . I mean, just that language is confusing. MR. DEELEY: Right. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other questions ? MR. SCHUSTER : That's all from me. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anybody else? All right. I think that's it, Carl. MR. DEELEY: My pleasure . I'll speak to you later in the week and hope to see you next week. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DEELEY: Appreciate it.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 ATTY. HAYES: Thanks, Carl. MR. DEELEY: Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Mrs. Reed. MS. REED: Thank you. FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? Oh, you're muted, Tom. MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I received this correspondence from a concerned resident over on Luzerne Street. This address at 1814 Luzerne Street, I mean, this is -- there's a ton of concerns here. I'm just going to bullet some of them so we can circle around or have the police and LIPS Department circle around. So it's an apartment building , three unit apartment . From my understand ing -- this is the letter I received -- from speaking with zoning and the basement is actually condemn ed. I've been told that it was, then it wasn't. Two upstairs units are occupied . But the real issue is there's trash 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 everywhere. They're finding hypodermic needles all around in the yard. And this is a neighbor . The chimney fell off last year. And now there's a large gutter hanging -- you know, this is where kids -- I know they're not in school yet but they're going back soon -- that walk through this area and that court -- that Christ Court is part of that. So this is a huge safety issue, first of all, especially with the hypodermic . That's beyond belief. There's a lot of drug activity being observed . They've made some comment s to the police department . Cars come out and cars are coming and going all hours of the night. There's a constant smell of marijuana . Tenants are fighting , all different types of license plates from different states. I guess they've, you know, they've tried to reach out to the Mayor with no response and the LIPS Department , no response . I guess there's a new code officer . There's rats running around there now. So I guess, you know, this was looked at. Maybe there was a little remedy. But now it looks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 like it's getting worse than it was maybe last year. There is more to it. I mean, you all seen this e-mail I guess or if you didn't have the opportunity yet. So, Mrs. Reed, you know, I think you forward ed it to us. So if you could maybe circle around, reach out to the LIPS Department . Let's get an update on this property . Maybe also send some correspond to the police department , you know, that they should probably take another look at this residence and, you know, have them report back to us. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mark. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have some on one of the pieces of legislation that I'm going to speak to later tonight I believe , 5-C. So I'll just -- on the question I'll discuss it at that point. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And, Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? Oh, you're muted, Kyle. MR. DONAHUE : Sorry, I was going to bring up the same thing as Mr. McAndrew . But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 as long as that's being forwarded along I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have a few comments . So I want to thank John Pocius, our City Engineer and our City Solicitor , Joe O'Brien who are drafting legislation who currently are working on not a fix but something I think will help the neighbor s on Third Avenue. So that should be coming down soon. We received recommendation s from Mr. Pocius. And I'm looking forward to voting on that. So there should be some relief for the residents on Third Avenue. Also, I want to thank the Chief of Police and Justin Butler who was in charge of the Traffic Division for quick action on an issue that I had brought up. Neighbors had reached out to me about speeding at Sanderson and Electric Street. So they are potentially going to put an electric speed sign in the area which we think will help. And also we reached out to DPW at the request of resident s there for crosswalks . And the director got back to us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 quickly that they're going to look into doing that, if possible . Also I want to thank Brian Fallon and the Parks and Rec employees . Travelling around the City -- and I also live across the street from a park, they have been out working very, very hard the last week, week and a half as the weather gets nicer to have our parks prepared for the spring and the summer. They're doing a really good job. So I've driven by a few parks. And they really -- they look good. And they're in the process of getting them ready. Also, Mrs. Reed, if we can reach out to Senator Blake's office. I think was -- they were the contact information or the contact for the wall at the Radison on Lackawanna Avenue. A few years ago there was a grant that was in play or that I think the county may have received through Senator Blake's office or something along those lines. I can't remember off the top of my head to rehab that wall there either leaving downtown Scranton past Lackawanna Avenue at the Radison . That wall is falling apart. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 really just -- it looks very, very bad. And I think it's dangerous . So there was some movement to fix that. And I'm not really sure what happened with it. So I'd like to just see if we can work together with them and try to get that up and running again. Also, I received a complaint from a gentleman in the North Scranton section right behind Holy Rosary Hall. They're having some problems with an apartment basically dumping garbage , couches , things. They're not putting them in the dumpster . They have a private hauler. And I did make my way over there several times. This issue goes back a few months on and off. And it's really bad. So if we can just remind the LIPS Department and see if they could try to do something about that. And also I want to again thank the DPW and DPW Director . There was a gentleman actually retired, Scranton Police Officer , a very nice gentleman reached out to me months ago about a drainage issue over on Paul Avenue in the Hill Section . And it took a little 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 while but the DPW took care of that. They installed a new storm drainage system. And that gentleman was very pleased and so were the neighbors over there. So that will take care of that problem . Also, I wanted to as the weather gets nicer I want, Mrs. Reed, if you could check in with the administration . I know last year I had made a suggestion about a park ambassador program , just a suggestion . I thought in looking at what other cities do with large park systems like ours and I know that the Mayor had said that they were looking into that. So if we can see if they made any progress there. And that's all I have. Thank you. MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING A “NO PARKING ” ZONE FOR ECMS 102866 SR 3013 SECTION 203, CITY OF SCRANTON MAIN AVENUE SIGNAL PROJECT , MAIN AVENUE (SR 3013) AND ORAM STREET – PERMIT #7905. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question -- MR. SCHUSTER : On the question . MR. MCANDREW : Go ahead, Tom. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry. Go ahead, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : Well, thank you. I'll vote to move this into -- for introduction . But I'm nowhere near a yes vote at this time. There's going to be resident s even beyond that one piece of property that lived there their whole life who can't park in front of their house. So the people at PennDOT , I mean, I'm sure when they go home -- the ones who wrote this and they're able to -- (audio interruption .) MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, we lost you. I think he froze. I hope he froze. MR. MCANDREW : -- but I'll have to hear something . I'm sorry, what? MR. GAUGHAN : Mark, we lost you for 20 seconds . MR. MCANDREW : I'll just summarize . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 I'll vote for introduction . I just don't like -- I just don't understand the rational e for this change. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : I would have to parallel what Mark is saying. You know, looking at this one, I lived on the corner of North Main Avenue and Putnum in North Scranton . And we had a similar incident when one of the four-unit apartments there opened up and started taking residents . You know, it caused -- the parking situation moving up and going onto Church Avenue. And it caused a lot of issues there. So, I mean, I have several questions about it. First of all, are there any negative affects of voting this down? Does it affect anything with PennDOT or any of the PennDOT 's monies for this project ? How many homes are affected? How many residents are affected because a lot of the homes in that specific intersection on both sides of Main are apartment buildings . And it also gets me to think of that chain reaction that happened in North Scranton as those cars 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 started moving up the street. And it's going to be a similar situation moving up Oram and then moving down Hyde Park Ave. Also in looking at it, how many intersection s are affected as we go down Main Avenue? It doesn't seem to be just this one intersection . It seems to be several as their moving. So I'm not really clear on that one. But there does seem to be a lot of negative consequence s here with the businesses with the amount of resident s affected. And also we spoke about the issue of the bridge and the tractor -trailer s. And those tractor -trailer s now getting into the Tripp Park area and getting over onto Clearview Street in North Scranton . And the resident does have a point there with maybe these tractor -trailers ending up up Oram Street which is a larger road. But once it gets into other sections -- the offshoots off of Oram are tighter squeezes . So several questions on that on that piece of legislation . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to add that, you know, I agree that I don't really, you know, knowing that area I really don't see the need. I appreciate PennDOT getting back to us so quickly . But I don't see the justification yet. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm with everyone else. I want to know what, you know, what it's needed for. I think it does mention that it's going to make it safer for the intersection . But I don't see how. So if we can get more specific s and information before next week that would be appreciated . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah. I think we should set up a meeting with Mr. Pichiarella from PennDOT and make sure that we get all of these questions answered . The one thing that I do know is that, you know, this whole -- this piece of legislation also deals with the traffic signal which is extremely old and does need to be replaced. And the good thing that PennDOT is doing is funding this entire project . The City is not paying for any of it. But I would agree I think we need, you know, all the questions 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 answered. And so we'll introduce it tonight . And then, Mrs. Reed, if you could reach out to Mr. Pichiarella and the other representatives at PennDOT and we'll try to schedule a meeting and get these questions answered . And even if they're opened to coming to a caucus next week if that would help because I'm sure, you know, there's people in that portion of West Scranton and Oram Street would be interested . That might even be better. Okay. And, Mrs. Reed, did you send that -- can you send that e-mail from Mr. Pichiarella out to everyone and also send that e-mail to Mr. Clark? MR. DONAHUE : I believe she did. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, did you? MR. DONAHUE : She sent it out to everybody . MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, okay. MS. REED: Yeah, and I'll forward it to Mr. Clark. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Okay. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING CHAPTER 426 OF THE HOME RULE CHARTER ENTITLED “SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR GENDER CONVERSION EFFORTS .” MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved -- second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I wanted to speak specifically to this piece of legislation . This is something that I brought forward to Council and to the administration that I felt was important for us to address . So I just wanted to explain a little bit more about it. I know that my fellow Council members have had time to review it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 But I'm open to additional questions about it. So this is being introduced tonight to help protect the LGBTQ community from the harmful practices of conversion therapy . We also reference it as conversion efforts in this legislation because we don't -- it's not really a form of therapy . But that's kind of how it's become known as. And conversion therapy specifically refers to any practices or treatment that seeks to convert one's sexual orientation or gender identity or expression including efforts to change behaviors or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feeling s towards individual s of the same sex. So this would specific ally apply to just to mental health professionals who are working with minors under the age of 18. And so conversion therapy is a practice that still occurs today unfortunately . And it's been proven not only to be ineffective , but it's also -- it could be very harmful and detrimental to a person's well-being, the opposite of really what therapy and mental health services are supposed to do for an 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 individual . And there's also surveys that have showed, like, an increased rate of attempted suicide among LGBTQ youth who've been victims of these conversions efforts . So it really does have significant consequences . And it's just been discredited by so many professional associations over the years, I mean, over decades . So there is a lot out there and as you could see in this legislation to, you know, point it out why this is something that should be banned within our city. And there's been a lack of action from the State of Pennsylvania on conversion therapy over the years. It's -- there has been legislation introduced several times. But it just hasn't been acted on. And so that's why many municipalities and counties in Pennsylvania have taken it into their own hands and passed similar pieces of legislation to help protect the LGBTQ community . And so there are other places that are specified in the legislation ; to name a few, Allentown , Erie, Bethlehem , Reading -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 and, of course, like the bigger cities like Philly and Pittsburgh . But there is also smaller boroughs too that have passed this. So really, I think Scranton is behind in this. I did talk last week to the human relations ordinance that was passed many years ago. This is separate and different from that. But, you know, still related to, like I said, protecting the LGBTQ community in Scranton . And it will establish a fines system for violators . And hopefully we won't have any violators of the ordinance and that it won't need to be address ed. But at least this is being done in a corrective way so we can have these protections in place. So I believe that was everything that I wanted to say with regards to this legislation . But if there is any other questions or comment s I welcome them. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, as actually the only mental health professional on the Council right now, I think I'd like to say a couple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 things. You know, some of the things that Jess said are correct . You know, it's tied up in the state. I think it's been tabled at the state level since 2010 at least; is that correct , Jess? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, probably around that time. I think Representative Brian Sims, one of our (inaudible ) gay legislators was one to introduce this type of legislation . MR. SCHUSTER : I do work with the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse or OMHSAS. And just to, you know, say I don't believe there is any facilities of this nature in the City of Scranton . I don't know if there is any operating under the state. And the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse and other licensing bodies also do not license therapy of this nature. So I think what Jess is saying this is a proactive measure that this type of thing doesn't happen within our city limits. Do we need know if there is any need for a ban on this type of therapy -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Like I said, there, you know, there are LGBTQ individuals who have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 experienced these conversion efforts . And from mental health professionals , you know, I can't speak to any, like, individuals or practices within our city limits that are including this, you know, this form of therapy in their practices . But it doesn't mean that it's not out there. And maybe, you know, people didn't have a place to come forward about it. And so now we're saying as a city, you know, if you are experiencing this, we want to know about it. And we want, you know, we want it to end. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I think as a proactive measure it's a good thing. And just so people could rest easy, I don't -- I'm not aware of anyone practicing this in the City of Scranton . I mean, I guess I can't speak for the state. No one would be licensed in the City of Scranton . I don't know of anyone practicing it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? ATTY. HAYES: Bill? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. ATTY. HAYES: It's Kevin. I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 wanted to point out so this legislation was crafted under the leadership of Dr. Rothchild . And we then submitted it to the City Law Department for formatting . And the title to it which indicates there was a change to the Home Rule Charter is incorrect . So there is not going to be a change to the Home Rule Charter . It will be a -- there's going to be a new section of the City Code. We made them aware -- we made the Law Department aware of that issue. And it will be corrected before final passage . So I just wanted to point that out. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you very much. DR. ROTHCHILD : And I also would be remiss if I didn't thank Solicitor Hayes and his assistance in crafting this legislation as well. He's been a great resource. ATTY. HAYES: You're welcome . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Yeah, I support what Dr. Rothchild is doing here. I think it is proactive . And my philosophy on life is live and let live. So, you know, I support what she's doing here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 and thank her for her work on this. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved.

I'm glad that the clerical union and the administration came to an agreement to ratify this bargaining agreement . One of the questions I did have just at first glance at this is article -- article eight, section three. It talks about a performance -- the establishment of a perform ance based bonus or incentive program for employee s in any department . And that would occur if the City emerges from the Recovery Plan or Act 47, which we are going to reemerge from that next year for several different reasons that we discussed in the past. So I don't -- obviously they haven't established it yet. But I would like to know if they have any idea on what that might like look, what they might model it after and what -- how much it might cost because they're talking about in the memo within the legislation , they are talking about the 2022 budget and having funding in there for it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 So I did have a question on that. I also would like to know so over this time period, what is the overall cost of this contract and what are the proposed or -- yeah, what are the proposed savings they're saying that they're saving from healthcare which I think it's clear that they will be. But if we could get hard numbers on that. And there's also under the pension and retirement benefits I do have a question on Section eight. I just want further explanation and clarification on the City putting in a new section here about offering termination incentive s. That's a new portion that's in the contract . So I did have a question and wanted clarification on that. And I'll have more comment when I review the contract . Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR.
