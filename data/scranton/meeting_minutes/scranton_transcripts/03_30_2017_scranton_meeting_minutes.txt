He does ask that you 4 don't call the pizza shop, but you do call 5 his phone number that I just read and I'll 6 read it again. 570-468-6782. Thank you. 7 MR. WECHSLER: The Scranton Half 8 Marathon will be held this Sunday, April 2nd 9 with a start time of 9 a.m. The course 10 winds through many parts of the city, North 11 Main Avenue, Green Ridge Street, the Plot 12 Section, parts of Greenridge and downtown, 13 Cedar Avenue between Elm Street to the 14 Heritage Trail. The finish line is at 15 Memorial Stadium on Providence Road. Please 16 be mindful of the participants as you're 17 travelling in these areas on Sunday morning 18 and plan for minor traffic delays. This is 19 a terrific event for our city and we want to 20 wish everyone a safe one, especially to all 21 of the runners. In other news, the Comcast 22 location has opened in the city at 342 South 23 Washington Avenue. Payments for bills can 24 be made there as well as service adjustments 25 6 to your account and equipment problems. 1 MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS 2 PARTICIPATION. 3 MR. WECHSLER: Joan Hodawanitz? 4 MS. HODAWANITZ: Joan Hodawanitz, 5 city resident and taxpayer. Thank God for 6 Granicus. Our residents can view the back 7 of documentation for council agendas. Last 8 week, I read a 99 page document which was 9 the RFP for Item 7B, the insurance policy 10 for the city. And apparently Knowles 11 Associates was the only bidder. And thank 12 God for Marie Schumacher whose institutional 13 knowledge of city affairs is nothing short 14 of amazing. She reviewed the Knowles 15 proposal and discovered that among the 16 properties to be insured were two buildings 17 belonging to the Scranton Public Library 18 Authority; that is the Albright Memorial 19 Library on Vine Street and the Nancy K. 20 Holmes Branch Library in Greenridge. 21 There's just one problem. The Scranton 22 Public Library Authority has owned those 23 properties since January 2010. So, does 24 this mean that the taxpayers have been 257 paying insurance premiums on these 1 properties for the past seven years even 2 though the Scranton Public Library Authority 3 has its own insurance policy? And if so, 4 how much money did we waste? And I'd like 5 to know, should this be classified as the 6 Schumachian whoopsie or a Hodawanitzian 7 BOHICA moment. I strongly suggest that you 8 table Item 7B until the Knowles list of 9 insured properties can be reviewed and 10 corrections made as appropriate. In my 11 opinion, the entire list is suspect. It's 12 not enough just to delete those two 13 properties from the list. For example, you 14 look at that list, should Nay Aug Park Zoo 15 be insured for $783,399? Even with Street 16 Cats leasing it, the zoo is not what I would 17 call an architectural gem. So, if you can't 18 table the item, please vote it down. But I 19 don't think we want to pass that resolution 20 and then go back and scrub the list. You 21 know, I mean this is just one of the many 22 examples of how we waste tax payer dollars. 23 And it doesn't have to be a lot of money, 24 but for seven years? It needs to be looked 25 8 at.1 MR. EVANS: I would like to say 2 thank you very much to you and Marie for the 3 hardwork. 4 MS. HODAWANITZ: Tell her. 5 MR. EVANS: Marie, thank you very 6 much for the hardwork you did on this. It's 7 very much appreciated. The only problem 8 with voting it down is the fact that we 9 wouldn't have insurance. So we'll have to 10 have it corrected, obviously. And we will 11 certainly see a rebate for those two 12 buildings at least. 13 MS. HODAWANITZ: I hope that once 14 the list is scrubbed, you can give us a copy 15 of the amended list. 16 MR. EVANS: Absolutely. 17 MS. HODAWANITZ: I would like to see 18 those changes. Clocks? You know, the clock 19 at 500 Lackawanna Avenue, $42,000. We don't 20 need a $42,000 clock in a distressed city. 21 And with regard to Mr. Durkin's appearance 22 tonight and this business of the third party 23 administrator, Marie and I are going to make 24 a cake and bring it in, should we bring in 253 of 20 sheets Page 9 to 12 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM9 one candle or two? Because it's been over a 1 year since the Mayor promised a third party 2 administrator. And to hear tonight that 3 they're still discussing the administrator's 4 role? That's nonsense. You know, either 5 poop or get off the pot. Thank you. 6 MR. WECHSLER: Matt Barrett? 7 MR. BARRETT: Good evening, council. 8 My name is Matt Barrett. I'm a city 9 resident. I also represent several people 10 that are involved with pensions. With 11 regard to the pension board, I wanted to 12 just address a couple comments before I get 13 to those different issues. But to be honest 14 with you, I think that you're straining too 15 much. I would say that Mr. Durkin--who I 16 respect--I have a different opinion than he 17 does. I think that next time he comes and 18 the next time you have a caucus on this 19 issue, you should ask for a specific 20 reference to the specific ordinance that 21 applies to anybody who retired after 1987 22 that allows a clawback. I don't see it in 23 the ordinances that were passed post 1987. 24 As I read the ordinances, there's ordinances 25 10 that applied to groups that retired pre-1987 1 and those who retired after 1987. And this 2 idea of a clawback, I think one of the 3 questions was asked; has it ever been 4 enforced? And the answer was no. And I 5 think the reason why it hasn't been enforced 6 is because it's not allowed. The ordinances 7 don't provide for a clawback for anybody who 8 retired post 1987. I'd also say that the 9 folks that I represented in front of the 10 pension board, realistically, you have fire 11 and police that are getting hurt on the job 12 and they're not easy jobs. And they're 13 going out on disability pensions. And they 14 require medical documentation, at least in 15 the past five or six years. So I just don't 16 know that there's much there, there on these 17 issues. I think the reality is you've got 18 to fund a lot of money to short the 19 pensions. And that leads me to my next 20 point. You know, Mr. Rogan had mentioned, 21 like you know, there's a credibility issue 22 and the promises were made. And I think 23 that's true. And if I talk about what some 24 people refer to as the double pension issue, 2511 I will at least call it the increase pension 1 issue. This council, maybe it was not you 2 folks, but this council repeatedly in 2003 3 awarded city employees an increase in 4 pension. And the pension board, the 94 5 pension board, last week or two weeks ago 6 voted to reduce pensions. So there is no 7 increase. So, I cannot reconcile how this 8 council could have passed ordinances 9 provided for increases. And now, those 10 retirees are getting no increase. And I 11 just think it serves as an example of what's 12 going on when there's no money, you start 13 looking. And you're cannibalizing your 14 retirees against the employees and the 15 current workers who are looking for pension 16 assurances that it's going to be there. 17 When in reality, these were promises that 18 were made. And with respect to council, you 19 know, you can distance yourself as much as 20 you like from the 2003 actions. But each 21 one of you has sat here for the last year 22 and a half or two years while this double 23 pension issue has been going on. If you 24 look at the ordinances that were passed in 25 12 2003, they provide for an increase. If, in 1 fact, there is a dispute as to what increase 2 means, you have the authority to amend those 3 ordinances to make it clear. And if those 4 promises were made, then it should be 5 codified, if that's the perspective of this 6 council. I'd also point out that, you know, 7 council does have a seat on the non-uniform 8 pension board. And so, when you go through 9 the history of the increased pensions or the 10 double pension cases as they've been 11 referred to, it's really amazing. Because 12 in 2003, the ordinances were passed. In 13 2005, there was litigation in front of Judge 14 Cottone where testimony was given by members 15 of the pension board and people that worked 16 for the pension board. And it was 17 acknowledged that the payments were going to 18 be--instead of $600, going to $1,200. 19 Instead of $650, it's going to be $1,300. 20 Instead of $700, it's going to be $1,400. 21 And there's transcripts. There was counsel 22 present for the pension board. So all those 23 were known facts in 2005 and earlier. Then, 24 in 2012-2013, everybody starts saying; well, 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 13 to 16 of 79 4 of 20 sheets13 wait a second, how could this be? These 1 were all known facts. If you sit as a 2 member of the composite board, you get a 3 report, I think it's quarterly, that lists 4 all the pension and the pensions and the 5 amounts being paid to every individual. 6 That's data that was all available. 7 Everybody knew what was going on. And so, 8 for everyone to act indignant; like, oh, 9 there's new information? It's just not the 10 case. And I think that the unfortunate 11 thing is that the word increase--if not 12 defined--and I submit that it is accurately 13 defined, there's supposed to be an increase. 14 You folks have the power to correct that. 15 And if you reach a conclusion that, in fact, 16 the amounts to be awarded to those 17 individuals were to be; instead of $600, 18 $1,200. Instead is $650, $1,300. And $700, 19 $1,400. Then, I would submit it's your 20 obligation to actually codify that so 21 there's no mistake. I understand, I'm 22 sympathetic. I understand the current 23 employees problems. And I understand the 24 city's problems. But the reality is, you're 25 14 straining too much to try to figure things 1 out. When, in fact, the laws exists. The 2 ordinances have been passed. The pre-1987 3 group or the post-1987 group, they exist. 4 It's just a matter of funding it. And those 5 are promises that are kept. And they're 6 hard promises to keep, but that's the 7 reality of the situation. So I ask you all, 8 you know, Mr. Durkin does come back on that 9 issue to address, where does it provide for 10 this clawback? Because I think that's going 11 to be an important issue going forward. And 12 with regards to the 2003 cases, I would ask 13 that each one of you take the time to look 14 at the 2003 ordinances for yourself, read 15 what they mean. And if, in fact, you reach 16 a conclusion that it was intended that those 17 employees get an increase, then you really 18 ought to codify that increase. Thank you. 19 MR. ROGAN: Just a brief comment to 20 the 2003 issue, council is still looking 21 into exactly who dropped the ball in that 22 situation. We have subpoenas that are in 23 for copies of the State Police 24 investigations to see who on the city's end 2515 dropped the ball. And that's really what 1 happened. It's not anyone who received the 2 benefits since it happened. It's not any of 3 the recipients fault what happened. 4 Somebody in the city government at that time 5 and I will stress that none of us on this 6 board were there at that time. In 2003, I 7 think I was just in high school. So, but it 8 is something that we're still working on. 9 And it's taking a lot longer than it should 10 for us to get all the information that we 11 need. But it's not forgotten about, that's 12 for sure. 13 MR. BARRETT: I would just say, as I 14 said earlier, I'm sympathetic, I understand. 15 It's easy to say, hey, and you're saying 16 somebody. I would say it's not somebody. 17 It was all phases of government. And 18 secondly, you do have the ability currently 19 to solve the problem. I mean, you can't 20 really just say, well, we'd like to figure 21 out what happened. You could look at it 22 currently and say, this is the problem, 23 we've identified it and you can correct it. 24 You all have the power to do that. So I 25 16 understand it'll take a lot of political 1 will and probably not well received, but I 2 think it is the right thing to do given the 3 facts that these pensions were paid at a 4 double rate. They were paid for 12 or 8 5 years. And if you think about the impact on 6 people if you talk about predictability and 7 credibility, people are retiring, making 8 life decisions based upon these 9 representations. And when you're finding 10 out 12--if you take the idea of a clawback, 11 it hasn't been enforced. Imagine being an 12 officer or policeman or fire person who has 13 left and retired only to find out, wait, now 14 they're going to start enforcing a clawback? 15 Again, I don't think it exists. But I think 16 that's just important information because 17 these people are making life decisions based 18 upon this information. 19 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. 20 MR. BARRETT: Thank you. 21 MR. WECHSLER: Bob Bolus? 22 MR. BOLUS: Evening council, Bob 23 Bolus, Scranton. Boy, from what I'm hearing 24 today, paying attention to what everybody's 255 of 20 sheets Page 17 to 20 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM17 talking about, either the people that are 1 involved are either totally confused or 2 they're completely incompetent to be doing 3 what we're doing to this city. Contracts 4 are generally black and white. It's like 5 saying how many monkeys does it take to peel 6 a banana. Well, they're black and white. 7 You should understand what you're reading, 8 what you're doing, before you go worry about 9 it after the fact. That's what we've been 10 doing in this city for years and years and 11 years. Because nobody really wants to pay 12 attention till it's too late. I hear people 13 raising issues about the recovery plan. 14 Jeez, we shouldn't have did this, we 15 shouldn't have did that. But you should 16 have did it before you sign the recovery 17 plan. You should have known what legal fees 18 would be for the Sewer Authority. What the 19 fees would be for the garage. Why you were 20 giving the mall millions of dollars. Over 21 what? Close to six plus million dollars? 22 Yet, St. Patrick's Day, you have a five 23 dollar parking sign out there. That's our 24 money. I want it back. So I'm going to ask 25 18 council to put a motion to go to Basalyga to 1 the mall and get the money back for those 2 parking spaces that we gave him six million 3 bucks for. That's responsibility. Also, as 4 far as the snowplowing of the city. And Mr. 5 Wechsler, I'd like you to take the helm on 6 this. I raised it time and time again. The 7 meters don't give us a dime income. They go 8 to the people who bought the garage. When 9 we plowed the city streets this past week or 10 the week before, we plowed to the curb. We 11 opened the parking areas for those meters to 12 generate revenue for those individuals. I 13 would like you to put a motion to go to 14 them, calculate exactly by records and I 15 hope to God somebody knew how they were 16 doing the record keeping with how many 17 pieces of equipment, how many pieces of 18 manpower and everything we had in this here, 19 so we could be accurate. And go to the 20 parking garage and say, okay, guys, you owe 21 us X number of dollars because we cleaned 22 your parking spaces. That's our money. Not 23 take three, four hundred, five, six hundred 24 thousand dollars to just blow because we got 2519 millions of a windfall. We've got millions 1 of a disaster. That's what we've got here. 2 We're not going to be pulling the city out 3 of any hole. We're going to keep burying it 4 because the way it's gone. Look at the 5 millions you spend on legal fees. It's 6 astronomical. Yet, not one bit went out for 7 a bid. It's just write checks. That's what 8 I'm talking about in the city. That's 9 what's killed this city. I go back to the 10 monkey explanation. How many solicitors do 11 we have in the City of Scranton on our 12 payroll? You mean they weren't capable or 13 competent? Or did Conaboy and the rest who 14 got a million five, two hundred thousand 15 here, they weren't paid enough to sit here 16 and read the contract? It's law school, 17 basic law school. Contracts are black and 18 white. You don't need to spend millions and 19 millions of dollars to add confusion. 20 Because that's all you basically did and you 21 still don't know what the heck is going on. 22 And I'll guarantee you every one of those 23 contracts, there's a dozen different flaws 24 in them that could re-neg, wipe them out to 25 20 challenge them on and on down the road. 1 Just like you did with the pension board. 2 That's the most confusing thing I heard here 3 tonight, listening to this, listening to 4 that. No direction, all confusion. And 5 quite frankly, a lot of incompetence. And 6 it's up to you guys sitting on this board 7 right now. You're in charge of millions of 8 dollars in the city. Gave Basalyga 9 millions. I'm asking again, Mr. Wechsler, 10 Council President, that you put a motion to 11 reevaluate with the mall, reassess it. That 12 it's in the fair marketplace that it pays 13 its fair tax base in the City of Scranton. 14 For the people watching and the people 15 sitting here tonight, that we get our fair 16 tax out of that mall now. Not even going to 17 be a mall. God knows what it's going to be. 18 Sure has changed into a lot of things where 19 you can--maybe you can buy fish food or God 20 knows what. But that's his business to do. 21 He bought it. You paid for it. And then, 22 you guys wrote him a check to pay for the 23 mall. So you bought the mall. The City of 24 Scranton bought the mall and he's making a 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 21 to 24 of 79 6 of 20 sheets21 fool out of everybody else in the city. I 1 want to see a reassessment. I want to see 2 our taxes go down. Not keep going up and up 3 and up because of the incompetence, the 4 confusion, we don't know what we're going to 5 do, we don't know where we're going. You 6 know, you've just got to turn around and 7 make a stop just like the prison board right 8 now wants to turn around and reconsider 9 giving the correctional care and extended 10 contract. One of the most incompetent 11 people running that. I know, I was there 12 and I know what it's about. Yet they're 13 sitting there doing it. The city's got 14 millions and millions of dollars to 15 squander. Make a donation to the prison and 16 give them pillows for the inmates. Give 17 them a pint of milk to drink. Do something 18 with our money that's got a benefit here. 19 After all, most of those people in there pay 20 taxes in this city. And they get nothing 21 for it. So you know, before we put the cart 22 before the horse again, I think you guys 23 better pay attention to what's going on. 24 Thank you. 25 22 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Bolus. 1 Andy Sbraglia? 2 MR. SBRAGLIA: Andy Sbraglia, City 3 of Scranton, fellow Scrantonian. I sat 4 through all them hearings with the double 5 pensions. And you skip over one of the most 6 important things in it. You were given 7 medical for life, okay. That means, 8 medical, dental, probably prescriptions, 9 everything. That's why that cost is real 10 high. The double pension is one thing, but 11 the free medical for life is different. And 12 it could be quite expensive. And that was 13 one of the reasons they really went out. It 14 wasn't so much the double pension because 15 they were talking about increases; this, 16 that and everything. But the double 17 pension--I mean, the medical was the main 18 reason. You should talk to Brian Reed. He 19 sat there during all these little things 20 that you want to go back to. And he was 21 very comprehensive on the subject. I 22 remember one of the things he wanted to do 23 was say, let's just give them medical for 24 life, I mean to 65, till they went on 2523 Medicare. But that didn't go over too big. 1 But council and them were sitting up there. 2 Now, you're going to go back over the same 3 ground, over and over and over again. I 4 hope I live long enough to see it resolved. 5 Now, another thing, at the last meeting, I 6 mentioned one thing that the water company 7 was thinking about charging us about two 8 months ago for the rain water falling from 9 the sky. And I asked the question, did they 10 buy a combined system? Or did they buy only 11 the sanitary system? Mr. Wechsler, you said 12 they bought the combined system. Did they 13 or didn't they? If they bought the combined 14 system, I don't see how they can charge for 15 the rain water falling unless we somehow 16 tapped into their system again. But like I 17 say, everything--nothing happens by 18 accident. I keep telling you over and over 19 and over again. If they got a justification 20 to charge us for the rain water falling from 21 the sky, then it was done by the legislature 22 and the mayor. No accident. Nothing 23 happens by an accident. It's all 24 manipulated. And if this were one of the 25 24 perks they gave them, the water company, I 1 do not know. But I do know one thing. If 2 we get nailed for it, there's going to be a 3 lot, a lot of people in this city ain't 4 going to be very happy with our politicians. 5 I just hope it was a rumor. But like I say, 6 two months ago, I heard about it. And then, 7 I think Mr. Gaughan mentioned it again. So, 8 apparently, he heard about it too. And the 9 people that told me it were sort of in the 10 know. And I'm sorry if we're going to end 11 up in that situation. It's bad enough we 12 sold off a lot of equipment that could have 13 been used for our new authority, whatever we 14 may have. Why we need another authority? I 15 don't know. I don't know why we can't 16 expand the DPW to handle some of that. 17 Another thing is, if I remember, we had a 18 contract out for street lights to maintain 19 them. Did we not have a contract not too 20 long ago on that? Knowing that the street 21 lights are good for twenty years, if we can 22 believe what was told to us, why would we 23 need a contract to maintain the street 24 lights if they're good for 20 years? 257 of 20 sheets Page 25 to 28 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM25 Surely, DPW can go around and fix a few of 1 them lights that go out. Or was this 2 another lie to us? They're not going to 3 last 20 years. We won't know. I won't be 4 around in 20 years. But, I hope the 5 information you got was true. Then, I don't 6 see why we need a contract to maintain them 7 when we have people in the DPW that can 8 change a light bulb. That's all. Thank 9 you. 10 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Ron 11 Ellman? 12 MR. ELLMAN: Hello, council, Ronnie 13 Ellman. I am not anti-downtown or 14 anti-mall. I'm anti-about spending anymore 15 money. It's a waste of money. Downtown is 16 a financial burden that we can't afford no 17 more. It's an extravagance. It's just 18 sucking us dry. You could have taken some 19 of this money that Bulzoni committed and we 20 wouldn't be sued right now for repairing 21 those houses. This city is so mismanaged, 22 it's unbelievable. You had to know this was 23 going to come to this. There's already a 24 suit before that. Today, I was listening 25 26 to, under the charter, you're involved in a 1 lawsuit about the charter. There's no 2 limits on the taxes. I asked you last week, 3 who gives Bulzoni all this authority? I 4 went to my son's computer. I looked up all, 5 everything about the business manager. I 6 don't see where he has any authority to do 7 half of what he's getting--doing, for crying 8 out loud. He doesn't have, what if he wants 9 to give ten million dollars somewhere? This 10 is ridiculous. This man isn't elected for 11 crying out loud. He doesn't live here. He 12 doesn't pay school or house taxes. And he 13 has a $100,000 salary. He lives like 14 royalty. I've talked to people that have 15 property and pay taxes, they won't make 16 $100,000 the next ten years. And we've got 17 a tax cheat like that in office. This whole 18 city, this administration is just got to be 19 replaced, people. I don't care how mad 20 somebody gets. Bulzoni and Amorosa are two 21 of the worst catastrophes to ever happen to 22 this city. There's nothing positive to say 23 about--put together, there's nothing 24 positive to say about these two. To get 2527 back, you've got a computer in front of you, 1 where do we stand right now on this money 2 that he committed to downtown? You talk 3 about a half million dollars and you don't 4 have no comments about it? You're talking 5 about his--he made a commitment to give 6 grants, loans and forgiveness loans and tax 7 incentives, how many people out there 8 watching have ever gotten a tax incentive? 9 All we've gotten is our taxes raised 81 10 percent since you guys have been in office. 11 People, this administration has got to give 12 Councilman Bill some help. We have just got 13 to get out and vote. Enough is enough of 14 what's going on around here. This is 15 pathetic, what's going on, the way you 16 people have stepped all over the taxpayers 17 of this city. You know, to get off the 18 subject a little bit, two and a half years 19 ago, I stood here talking about the 20 marketplace in Pottstown and Allentown that 21 I visit all the time. Well, occasionally. 22 And I got about half ridiculed for 23 suggesting it. It's a suggestion. That the 24 mall would be good for this. When they 25 28 finally come around to this theme, instead 1 of having the whole city sort of involved 2 and invited, having it informal and 3 comfortable for the whole city, it was 4 zeroed in right on this little circle around 5 the mall, these apartments. That's all they 6 wanted for their time and investment. I 7 talked to some people that were down there. 8 This is--thank you. 9 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 10 Ellman. Dave Dobryzn? 11 MR. ELLMAN: Again, please people, 12 get out and vote. The reason we have an 13 administration like this is because no one 14 gets out and votes anymore. Eight, ten 15 thousand people, it's shameful. Thank you. 16 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 17 Ellman. Dave Dobryzn? 18 MR. DOBRYZN: Good evening, council, 19 Dave Dobryzn, resident of Scranton. I see 20 we're authorizing paving. And I would 21 sympathize with people who don't get their 22 streets paved very often. But, please take 23 a ride up Crown Avenue on the 800 block, 24 Crown and Birch, and see what was left. 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 29 to 32 of 79 8 of 20 sheets29 Now, hopefully that will get fixed because 1 the 800 block of Crown was paved maybe a 2 year and a half ago. I don't recall. Might 3 have been last year, but I think it was a 4 year and a half ago. And, a good portion of 5 the block has been thoroughly destroyed by 6 some water company project or sewer 7 authority project that was preauthorized. 8 And it's a shame. So, I certainly hope it 9 gets restored with the better weather coming 10 real soon. On insurance, I found a little 11 thing here from around 2010 and that's 12 before Obamacare. And a size of family, 13 one, eligible for 100 percent discount at 14 the Emergency Room, $21,660. And it's only 15 gone up from there. Now, if you're making 16 that and living alone, then trying to 17 support a roof over your head, you probably 18 maybe need it. However, suppose I make that 19 and lived at home with my mother. And she 20 never charged me rent and she bought the 21 pork chops and cooked and cleaned and did my 22 laundry and God only knows what. And, you 23 know, like the point is, that this comes out 24 of the private payer insurance policies 25 30 along with CHIP insurance and so forth. So 1 pay a little attention. And by the way, 50 2 percent of the pregnancies are unintended in 3 this country. So currently, our Congress is 4 trying to withdraw support for Planned 5 Parenthood. Shame. On the pension, I'll 6 watch that a little better. I didn't have a 7 chance. I was in transit. But, one of my 8 concerns and I kind of heard something that 9 related to me was, I'm not blaming the 10 departments for--and the pension plan for 11 losing the money. But something has to be 12 done and there's already talk about the 13 withdrawal of and repeal of the Dodd-Frank 14 laws and regulations on Wall Street. I 15 think they're doing fair enough and they 16 don't need to keep the taxpayers money of 17 Scranton just because they have a little 18 hiccup in their markets. It's inexcusable. 19 And furthermore, with the double pensions, 20 Jack Laslow was denied his pension money and 21 he was disabled by a severe electrical 22 shock. He has organ damage and everything 23 else. And they took his pension off of him 24 because he got elected to public office. I 2531 don't think public office has anything to do 1 with a public job. That's all there is to 2 it. And furthermore, it's in the long term, 3 but I see a lot of lack of concern sometimes 4 between various entities. They have their 5 separate pension plan and the hell with 6 social security. The hell with Medicare. 7 And I think it's time that all ships float 8 on the same sea whether it be an angry sea 9 or smooth sailing. With our snow, the only 10 thing I have to say about it right now is; 11 certain people in my neighborhood have been 12 shovelling their sidewalks and blocking 13 courts extending a pile out to where you 14 have to make the turn. And you just go 15 cart-wheeling down the hill, a 30 degree, 40 16 degree hill on Alder Street there. And I 17 think that practice needs to stop throughout 18 the whole town. If you want to shovel your 19 sidewalks, great, you're supposed to. But 20 shame if you're thinking about 21 inconveniencing 10 neighbors. It's a rotten 22 shame to think that it's okay to 23 inconvenience 10 neighbors just to have an 24 easier time shovelling. Thank you and have 25 32 a good night. 1 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 2 Dobryzn.3 MR. DOBRYZN: Quick reminder-- 4 MR. WECHSLER: Sorry, Mr. Dobryzn. 5 MR. DOBRYZN: --pardons guy, please 6 try and get them--7 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 8 Dobryzn.9 MR. DOBRYZN: Okay. 10 MR. WECHSLER: Anyone else? 11 MS. SCHUMACHER: Good evening, Marie 12 Schumacher. First, I do concur with Joan on 13 the tabling of 7B because I am against your 14 authorizing that premium which should be 15 coming down. And I fear if this is done 16 outside of these council chambers, it will 17 not come down and we'll still be paying. 18 So, I--for peace of mind, I'd like to see 19 that. And I think we should thank Mr. 20 Gaughan for getting the back up on the 21 agendas or I never would have caught that 22 error. So, I thank you, Mr. Gaughan, for 23 that. Now, I distinctly remember Solicitor 24 Boyle saying the third party administrator 259 of 20 sheets Page 33 to 36 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM33 RFP would be issued within the week. 1 Tomorrow, that will be three weeks ago and 2 still no RFP, unless it hasn't been in the 3 Scranton Times Tribune. Sort of makes one 4 wonder if the correct person whose pockets 5 are to be lined has not yet been found. 6 Now, I know we're just being lied to. This 7 being not the agreement that we were told 8 was already in place. So, you know, 9 credibility is going down, down, down. By 10 now, if that had been done last year, we 11 would have had a year's worth of performance 12 so that our improve--the improvements that 13 were going to be made could be judged. Now, 14 I should think it should be scrapped from 15 what we learned tonight. Okay, back now to 16 the aforementioned meeting held to discuss 17 the spoils from the Sewer Authority asset 18 sale and agenda Item 7A. The strategy 19 presented was to have them submitted sooner 20 rather than later. But again, it's been 21 three weeks and it's still not on the 22 agenda. My major heartburn with the 23 recommended strategy is only $500,000 is set 24 aside for storm water. And at that, for 25 34 storm water management, we simply cannot 1 afford to wait for three years of studying 2 the problems before taking action. There 3 are too many residents being impacted by 4 storm water problems that need fixing now, 5 not later. Plus, there are other areas 6 where an investment today might make that a 7 low or moderate investment, but it will grow 8 to a high cost if we wait. This requires an 9 investment now. I mean, tonight it's 10 raining. It's going to rain. Mr. Serebro, 11 the Young's, I hope we all say a prayer for 12 them tonight. That should have been 13 included. They're probably going to get 14 flooded again. And everybody sits back and 15 does nothing. Now, on the plus side, the 16 proposed strategy developed by PEL FHJA 17 strategies and the administration provides a 18 cushion that could be used to address the 19 forecasted deficit of revenues to meet the 20 expenditures while restructuring the 21 delivery of activities--of services in a 22 manner that creates a substantial and 23 sustainable budget. Part of that strategy 24 provided two million dollars for capital 2535 programs. But, could this administration 1 wait for the approval of the strategy? Even 2 present it and bring it to council for 3 Pete's sake? Before spending the money? Of 4 course not. Instead of the recommended 5 using $710,780 of 2017 budget expenses freed 6 up by the sale of the Sewer Authority assets 7 for paving. Do we need paving? Yeah, we 8 need paving. But can we afford to pave the 9 entire city? Of course not. At roughly 10 $15,000 per city block, stealing from the 11 cushion that was--that will be provided or 12 is supposed to be provided in the strategy 13 would probably pay less than 50 city blocks. 14 Well, it might make the residents and 15 commuters using those few blocks happy, it 16 could infuriate those that could be left 17 wanting. Is there a way to make more 18 residents happy? I think so. Last month, 19 you may have noticed a picture of the 20 Pothole Killer working down in West 21 Pittston. I contacted West Pittston's 22 borough manager who supplied me with some 23 information, two pages of which I'm going to 24 share with Mr. Gaughan. Let me share some 25 36 of the attributes of that piece of 1 equipment. May I finish it? Thank you. 2 Okay, with Patch Management Exclusive 3 Services, you get these advantages; one man, 4 one truck efficiency and cost effectiveness. 5 All operations controlled from the cab 6 reducing safety risks, traffic hazards and 7 liability. All materials contained on the 8 truck enough for a full productive day of 9 patching. Average pothole repair takes 45 10 to 60 seconds and lasts for years. The 11 Pothole Killer can be operated day or night 12 and in any kind of weather. It's got an 13 on-board GPS technology. It's simple, 14 affordable rental or lease options are 15 available to suit a budget. They also, of 16 course, come in and do it for a cost. So 17 that, I think that should be looked at. And 18 I don't think we should be spending that 19 money that was not meant for additional 20 paving. And if I may approach, I will give 21 you the materials. 22 MR. WECHSLER: You could give them 23 to Kathy. 24 MS. SCHUMACHER: Pardon? 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 37 to 40 of 79 10 of 20 sheets37 MR. WECHSLER: You can just give 1 them to Kathy.2 MS. SCHUMACHER: Okay, well, may I 3 give--wait, I have one page for--Mr. Gaughan 4 has the--5 MR. WECHSLER: She'll give it to 6 him.7 MS. SCHUMACHER: --has the DPW 8 though, right?9 MR. WECHSLER: Yeah. 10 MS. SCHUMACHER: So I've got an 11 extra one here for him. 12 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. 13 MS. SCHUMACHER: Thank you. 14 MR. WECHSLER: Anyone else? 15 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5A. 16 MOTIONS. 17 MR. WECHSLER: Mr. Perry? 18 MR. PERRY: Thank you, Mr. Wechsler. 19 First, I want to thank Attorney Durkin, Mr. 20 John Judge and Mr. Ed Bohan for stopping in. 21 We had a public caucus, a quite lengthy 22 public caucus before our regularly scheduled 23 meeting about pension and pension reforms. 24 I consider that one of many meetings that 25 38 council and pension board's administration 1 are going to have in the very near future 2 about how to finally shore-up our pension 3 plans that we have. It's no secret that 4 they're distressed right now. And we do 5 have plans in place on both sides between 6 the Pension Board and the city to shore-up 7 the plans. It's going to take a lot of work 8 which anybody who is here and I think most 9 of the audience they were here for it. It 10 was lengthy and there are going to be many 11 hurdles; hurdles after hurdles to go 12 through. But I'm confident that council 13 administration and the pension boards are on 14 board with taking on those hurdles step by 15 step. I know no one on this board is going 16 to give up on that. We're just going to 17 keep plowing through it. A couple items on 18 the agenda, 5B, I'm excited about. We have 19 the West Scranton Revitalization Project. 20 That's going to be on the eleven and 1200 21 block of South Main Street. There's going 22 to be some new construction there. It's 23 going to be create 25 full-time jobs when 24 it's done. And the construction itself is 2539 going to create 50 onsite temporary 1 construction jobs. This is a great, great 2 community development and economic growth 3 force. That's going to turn what's already 4 a blighted situation into something that's 5 going to put viable jobs in the city and 6 buildings back on the tax rolls. 5C, which 7 is coming before us involves the Novembrino 8 Park. Novembrino Park, I'd like to see this 9 finally get going. I know last year, we 10 applied and received a grant for this. So 11 we are now in the planning stages now that 12 the weather is going to break. This is 13 going to be for planning and onsite surveys 14 for a long awaited and much needed park in 15 that part of the neighborhood. What else do 16 we have? The insurance issue on 7B, again, 17 Ms. Schumacher, thank you very much for 18 that. That was information found that was 19 much needed. I think Councilman Evans 20 alluded to this, unfortunately we have to 21 pass that. The insurance goes into effect 22 on April 1st. But what I would suggest, 23 Mrs. Reed, if we could have some kind of 24 communication sent back to council that the 25 40 appropriate amendments were made and that 1 way we can share them as soon as they were 2 made. Because, you know, like you, all of 3 us, once this passes the board, we move onto 4 the next thing and the next thing and the 5 next thing. And sometimes things kind of 6 get away from us. But this is something, 7 it's wasted money if we don't make sure it's 8 changed. Some public safety issues. I've 9 been informed by someone in the 200 block of 10 School Street. In the 200 block of School 11 Street, if anybody's not familiar with it, 12 it's a very tight situation and there's a 13 lot going on there. There's the Holy Rosary 14 Center which hosts basketball games and all 15 sorts and kinds of things that are going on 16 there. There's a school. There's a church. 17 It's a two way street and there's parking on 18 both sides of the street. So when it gets 19 hectic, it gets busy. This person had some 20 car damage from being sideswiped the other 21 day. And if we could just maybe--I don't 22 know if anyone's looked into School Street. 23 It's been around for as long as the city's 24 been around. But if we can have the 2511 of 20 sheets Page 41 to 44 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM41 Engineering Department to see if that 1 qualifies for some kind of only one-side 2 street parking or a one-way. But, you know, 3 when it comes to changing the streets from a 4 two way to a one way, it's very, very 5 difficult. Because that encompasses the 6 whole neighborhood and the whole flow of 7 traffic. So if we could at least get a 8 definitive answer on that, I would 9 appreciate it. And finally, I'll end this 10 on a little bit of good news. I spoke to 11 the Mayor tonight to follow up on Mr. 12 Serebro's issue. And I was informed that 13 Director Gallagher met with Mr. Serebro 14 today outside his house. They went over the 15 issues that he was having. Went over the 16 plan. And happy birthday, Mr. Serebro too, 17 it's also birthday today. That's probably 18 why he's not here. So a little bit of a 19 birthday present is that this project now 20 that the winter has broke, the emergency 21 storm is over with. He's been fast-tracked 22 and given all the DPW's force to make sure 23 that project gets taken care of. That's all 24 I have today. Thank you. 25 42 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you. Mr. 1 Rogan? 2 MR. ROGAN: Yes, a couple of 3 comments. We're all glad the snow is 4 finally melted. We did receive a very large 5 packet of the cost the city has incurred 6 from the cost of the snow storm. And I do 7 want to read an excerpt of what was included 8 in this packet. And this is regarding the 9 reimbursement possibility that Councilman 10 Wechsler spoke about last week. And 11 this--this is an inner city email. But it 12 says, "This is something I wanted to put on 13 your radar in anticipation of possibly 14 receiving reimbursement of our winter storm 15 clean up costs. As you can see, we incurred 16 about $365,000 in costs. And if granted, we 17 will be reimbursed 75 percent of that which 18 totals approximately $273,000. I will keep 19 you posted as we learn more about our 20 request." This email was just sent this 21 afternoon, today, March 30th at 12:09. And 22 this is an entire accounting of the expenses 23 incurred with that storm. And as you can 24 see, it's a very thick packet. And I could 2543 tell a lot of work went into the 1 documentation here. It goes down even to 2 equipment repair for equipment that broke 3 during the course of the storm. So I will 4 be reviewing this at length to get a grasp 5 on what money was spent where and what we 6 could do to be more efficient both cost wise 7 moving forward and provide a better service 8 for our residents when storms like this 9 happen again. Hopefully, we won't see 10 another storm of this magnitude in our 11 lifetime. But in case we do, we certainly 12 have to be prepared. Next, Councilman Perry 13 touched on the West Scranton Redevelopment 14 Project, Revitalization Project. I do want 15 to read an excerpt out of the RCAP Grant and 16 this is the community impact excerpt. And I 17 live in West Side, so this is very important 18 to me. It says, "The West Scranton 19 Revitalization Project improvements for 20 proposed location for the construction of a 21 new mixed use building. The project 22 involves the design and construction of a 23 nearly two story 16,000 square foot building 24 on the 1100 block of South Main Avenue in 25 44 Scranton featuring a mixed use concept. 1 Across the street from this new building, 2 the renovation of a neighborhood market cafe 3 gathering place plus the construction of an 4 additional 4,000 square feet of additional 5 space which will be marketed to other 6 neighborhood retail demands. Corporate 7 offices for existing gas wholesaler will 8 also be relocated and expanded. The site is 9 located within the shadow of downtown 10 Scranton, but far enough outside to avoid 11 the current land lock downtown. The unique 12 quality of the project is that the proposed 13 site involves the revitalization of three 14 currently blighted buildings. The West 15 Scranton Revitalization Project will not 16 only create a new construction and permanent 17 job opportunities, but will remove a public 18 eyesore in a blighted area immediately 19 rescuing the neighborhood from further 20 disrepair." So I'm very proud to cast an 21 affirmative vote on this legislation 22 tonight. And I do like to thank 23 Representative Marty Flynn's Office who was 24 very involved with this from day one as well 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 45 to 48 of 79 12 of 20 sheets45 as Governor Wolf who did come into town when 1 this was initially announced. Also, mention 2 is the Novembrino Project. This is 3 something that unfortunately is taking much 4 longer to happen than we would all like. 5 But that park needs to be--needs to be 6 restored and I know Mr. McLane has already 7 done some design work. And the initial 8 designs look very promising for the 9 revitalization of that park. It's very 10 special to me as a kid growing up I remember 11 walking down to the park to swim. And going 12 down and driving by there now is 13 heartbreaking seeing the condition that 14 those pools and that park is in. So our 15 children in that neighborhood need a clean, 16 safe place to play. And I'm hopeful that 17 this project will accomplish that. And 18 finally, this is unfortunately a long 19 standing request. We are voting on more 20 money for paving tonight, which I hope is 21 approved because we certainly need it. And 22 there is not a shortage of roads in the city 23 that needs to be paved. But a video was 24 sent to, I believe, most of us on council 25 46 this last week, of the 1400 and 1500 block 1 of South Irving on South Side. This has 2 been a street that I know many of us have 3 spoken about in the past. But it's probably 4 one of the worst streets in the city. So if 5 we could relate to our DPW Director about 6 the 1400 and 1500 block of South Irving, 7 have them place it on the pave list. And in 8 the mean time, if some repairs are made, I 9 hope the asphalt plants should be opening 10 soon with the warmer weather, but we have to 11 do something immediately. And that is all 12 for tonight. Thank you. 13 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Rogan. 14 Mr. Evans? 15 MR. EVANS: Thank you, just a brief 16 comment on a couple different things. I 17 appreciated our speakers tonight or our 18 guests tonight on the pension reform issue. 19 As you can see, it's a very layered 20 situation when we start talking about 21 pension reform. But I will say that I don't 22 think any of us are backing down from the 23 fact that we're not going to see any money 24 going into the pensions until we have 2547 pension reform, specifically the third party 1 administrator has to be hired and working. 2 And the mechanism needs to be in place for 3 the beginning to bring down the rate of 4 return. Those things are, as far as I'm 5 concerned, non-negotiable. Again, I'd like 6 to thank Marie, again, on catching that 7 issue with the premiums on the library 8 buildings. And also, to add to her comments 9 and Councilman Gaughan as far as Granicus is 10 concerned. Granicus began tonight paying 11 dividends. That's very important. And if 12 this happens again and again, I hope it 13 never does. But if it happens and it gets 14 caught, that's why we're doing it. It's all 15 about transparency, getting the information 16 out to the public, having another set of 17 eyes, ears and thoughts on things like that. 18 So, it paid off. So, I'm very proud of what 19 we've done with Granicus and getting that 20 information out. I read in here an article 21 today about something's happening in 22 Harrisburg. There was legislation that will 23 require school boards to approve property 24 tax increases by at least a 6 to 3 vote 25 48 instead of a simple 5, 4 majority. And that 1 legislation was passed and approved by the 2 Senate Education Committee yesterday. So it 3 would require two thirds of a 9 member panel 4 board to ensure that adequate vetting of any 5 tax increase will happen. So if that 6 legislation goes through at the state level, 7 that means that if the Scranton School Board 8 would like to have a tax increase, they 9 cannot just pass it by a 5, 4 vote. It will 10 have to be by a 6, 3 vote. Which is a lot 11 harder, believe me, one vote is always 12 thought of and always very important and it 13 just shows you how much difference that can 14 make. Councilman Rogan mentioned, this 15 report we got from the city on the storm, I 16 have to say it's impressive. What is not as 17 impressive is the information we've got on 18 the twelve million dollars on the Sewer 19 Authority that was missing in action at 20 closing. And if we had this kind of 21 information, we could actually find out 22 where that money went. The answer we got 23 was, preclosing legal fees and consulting 24 fees and manning the work that was being 2513 of 20 sheets Page 49 to 52 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM49 done during that timeframe from the time the 1 contract went into effect until it closed. 2 So I know Councilman Gaughan sent another 3 and I'm requesting it again. We want--I 4 want to see very detailed information on 5 where that money was spent. I think it's 6 time the residents deserve that. The 7 taxpayers deserve that. The rate payers 8 deserve that. We deserve that. So enough 9 is enough. If the city can do this for a 10 storm, the Sewer Authority can certainly do 11 what we're requesting. I don't think I have 12 anything more at this point. 13 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. Evans. 14 Mr. Gaughan? 15 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, thank you. First 16 of all, I want to thank the students from 17 the University of Scranton for coming 18 tonight. I want to thank my former 19 professor and give her a shout out. 20 University of Scranton was my alma mater. 21 So it's nice to see all of you here tonight. 22 I'd also like to, as Mr. Wechsler mentioned 23 in the beginning of the meeting, just send 24 my prayers out to Judge Kozik and his 25 50 family. He is a true pillar of our 1 community. My prayers are with him and his 2 family and I'm hoping that he is returned 3 safely very soon. I'd like to thank 4 Attorney Durkin, John Judge and Ed Bohnan 5 for coming tonight to our caucus. I 6 continue to be amazed by the third party 7 administrator. We've been talking about 8 this now for the last year. And the Mayor 9 has said on numerous occasions that we were 10 going to have game-changing pension reform. 11 The third party administrator, as Mrs. 12 Schumacher pointed out at the meeting about 13 three or four weeks ago, the city solicitor 14 said that it should be on its way within a 15 week or two. The information we got tonight 16 is totally different. So, there's some sort 17 of disconnect between the pension boards, 18 the unions and this administration. And 19 quite frankly, I'm more confused now after 20 that meeting than I was going into it. So 21 there definitely needs to be more answers 22 and more--I have more questions from that 23 meeting. Just a couple citizens' concerns. 24 First, North Hyde Park Avenue and Pettibone 2551 Street needs a street light fixed. So we'll 1 send that out to the DPW. Getting a couple 2 complaints about the 400 block of Corey 3 Street between Cedar and Birney Avenue in 4 Minooka, a definite accident waiting to 5 happen. The street is very narrow and the 6 residents would like to request that this be 7 made into a one-way. I know a few years 8 ago, there was talk about that happening. 9 So I'd like to have our city engineer 10 revisit that. I'm glad Mr. Perry reported 11 that Mr. Gallagher was sent out to Mr. 12 Serebro's house on Keyser Avenue for the 13 flooding issue. I sent a letter March 10th 14 asking for specific information on what the 15 administration was going to do. And as 16 Chairperson for the Committee on Public 17 Works, I would like that letter answered. 18 Because I appreciate that Mr. Gallagher went 19 out. And I appreciate that the 20 administration is finally taking a look at 21 this issue. But in my experience in almost 22 four years on council, what gets promised 23 and then what actually gets delivered are 24 two totally different things. Case in 25 52 point, our caucus tonight. So I would like 1 a response in writing. If you have been 2 following the newspaper and some of the 3 lawsuits that have been popping up about 4 storm water management, you know, I have to 5 be honest, I am just sick and tired of the 6 people of this city getting jerked around by 7 this administration. My fear--and I hope 8 this doesn't come true, but these residents 9 in Keyser Valley may end up just like Al 10 Young over on Wyoming Avenue. And the other 11 gentleman that just had to sue the city. 12 Nobody can get an answer from the Mayor and 13 his administration apparently unless there's 14 an article by Chris Kelly in the paper. 15 Then, all of a sudden, everybody floods down 16 to Keyser Avenue. So it just--to a point, 17 it annoys me. And I would hope that this 18 administration starts responding to serious 19 requests for information in writing. So I'd 20 like to see what the plan is, but put it on 21 a piece of paper. As for the Scranton Sewer 22 Authority, I'm going to sound like a broken 23 record here. Because for the past few 24 weeks, I've asked for copies of all invoices 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 53 to 56 of 79 14 of 20 sheets53 related to any legal or consulting work done 1 in relation to the sale of the authority. 2 And again, not to my surprise, this 3 information has not been provided. I've 4 also asked, as Mr. Evans had pointed out, 5 several questions related to the sale of the 6 Authority and they continue to go 7 unanswered. And I feel like I am being 8 stonewalled. How long does it take to 9 produce information that should be readily 10 available? You know, this has been going on 11 for months now. The sale occurred in 12 December of 2016. And the ratepayers of 13 this city have paid millions of dollars for 14 legal fees on this deal. And all I'm asking 15 for is an accounting of what work was done 16 for these exorbitant amounts of money. What 17 were the hourly rates? Where are the 18 invoices? On top of all the legal costs 19 that were paid out from this deal to 20 Ingersoll, Buchanan and Rooney and the 21 various lawyers that work for the Scranton 22 Sewer Authority, the ratepayers shelled out 23 half--almost half a million dollars for 24 special council to Scranton and Dunmore. 25 54 And again, the question is, for what? So, 1 produce the invoices, produce the 2 information that backs all of this up. This 3 isn't anything that should be difficult. 4 And I don't believe that any money from the 5 sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority should 6 be spent on pensions, on capital improvement 7 projects or anything else until all 8 questions are answered regarding this deal 9 and all documentation is provided. As Mr. 10 Evans also mentioned, I still have questions 11 regarding how the twelve million dollars was 12 spent through 2015 through 2016. Council 13 was provided with a spreadsheet which quite 14 frankly was difficult to read and difficult 15 to follow. And it requires further 16 explanation. I'd like to know what specific 17 capital projects were completed during this 18 time. And I think that we should request a 19 caucus with Attorney Shrive and members of 20 the Sewer Authority Board so that they can 21 explain these expenditures. On a related 22 matter, as I mentioned last week, I also 23 would like answers from the Pennsylvania 24 American Water Company on whether or not 2555 they're going to charge a storm water fee on 1 top of the one that the city is going to 2 eventually charge people, a real double 3 whammy for the ratepayers of the city. This 4 was mentioned at the last meeting between 5 the city and Arcadis Engineering who was in 6 charge of doing the storm water study. So I 7 would like a response from Pennsylvania 8 American Water. And that is all I have this 9 week. Thank you. 10 MR. WECHSLER: Thank you, Mr. 11 Gaughan. In regards to the issues that were 12 brought to light this week in the Scranton 13 Times concerning the Greenridge area, I did 14 contact City Engineer John Pocius. I also 15 contacted the state representative's chief 16 of staff Thom Welby. Going back on this 17 issue, this is something that's being worked 18 on for many, many years. In fact, it's a 19 three stage program. Stage one has been 20 completed. There's two other stages that 21 are currently listed on the state projects, 22 but they currently lack the funding. I'm 23 very familiar with this type of an 24 arrangement because East Mountain Road used 25 56 to be put on the capital improvement program 1 every year. And every year, it wasn't 2 funded. Eventually, the money finally went 3 to that project and we were able to get East 4 Mountain Road fixed. I understand the city 5 does have a responsibility to fix repairs as 6 best they can in that area. But speaking to 7 Mr. Pocius and to Mr. Welby, currently 8 Senator Blake has been working on this 9 project. He's trying to get funding to do 10 the complete repair of that area. And I 11 think fortunately they do--some repairs out 12 there, that those will be included in our 13 cost for matching funds. But the total 14 price tag as it stands right now to do that 15 project efficiently and correctly is 16 thirteen million dollars to fix that whole 17 area, that whole area. It's going to take a 18 huge effort, a combined effort between the 19 city, the state and maybe even federal 20 authorities as we did on East Mountain Road 21 to get that project completed. The dollar 22 value is so expensive. But as we saw, there 23 is money available. So working together, I 24 think it's something that we have to focus 2515 of 20 sheets Page 57 to 60 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM57 on and try to get that situation 1 straightened out there. In regards to the 2 snow storm, the city did do a good job on 3 getting that information together, 4 submitting it in a timely fashion. This is 5 an example where all the townships and all 6 municipalities in the county are working 7 together. We had to meet certain dollar 8 thresholds. And the county has taken the 9 lead on putting this information and getting 10 it out there and submitting it to the state. 11 I think it's an example for going forward 12 how we can look to share some services 13 within the county. We do have a lot of 14 duplications in services. And I think this, 15 as this goes together, I believe this will 16 be a good example on consolidating some of 17 the services within the county. This 18 evening, as we were wrapping up the caucus, 19 I did want to make sure that I asked Mr. 20 Judge if the third party administrator in 21 principle has been agreed to. And he 22 confirmed that the third party administrator 23 has been agreed to. Mr. Judge also made a 24 revealing comment this evening also is that 25 58 the specification or the bid package that's 1 being presented right now as required by the 2 contract, there's difficulty in finding 3 someone who will take that responsibility 4 on. And I really believe that in order to 5 do this job properly, we are going to need 6 more than one bidder to do this properly. I 7 think the delay has been in refining the 8 proposal. We all want to get it in place. 9 But to me, the fact that it's still been 10 agreed upon, still something that's going to 11 happen, I believe that's very important. 12 This week, I'd also like to congratulate 13 Senator Blake's Office and Representative 14 Flynn's Office. They did a great job 15 getting grant money into the area. There's 16 several projects, several worthwhile 17 projects. And I think that's something that 18 is going to be a benefit to all of us. And 19 just one last comment on the caucus this 20 evening, I believe tonight we've seen that 21 there is a willingness on both 22 the--especially council and also with our, 23 with the unions in coming as active 24 participants to the meeting, offering 2559 suggestions, offering input. I believe that 1 also is something that we are going to have 2 to focus on going forward and make sure that 3 everyone is on the same page as Councilman 4 Rogan suggested. When we make an agreement, 5 the city should have to stick to it. We've 6 seen so many cases of where we've agreed to 7 things. And in the end, we've had to give 8 money back and lost the case. My last 9 comments are on the West Scranton projects. 10 Scranton has always been a city of 11 neighborhoods. The West Scranton commercial 12 project is a huge investment in that area. 13 It means that that part of Scranton, there's 14 still life in that part of Scranton, a huge 15 improvement to come to that area and also 16 contribute more to the quality of life in 17 that area. And in regards to the Novembrino 18 pool project, that area is seriously lacking 19 in recreation for our youth. I'm familiar 20 with Mr. McLane's work. He does a great 21 job. And we'd like to see that project move 22 along as fast as possible because the kids 23 in West Side do deserve recreation. That's 24 all I have. 25 60 MS. REED: 5B, FOR INTRODUCTION – A 1 RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER 2 APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPLY FOR AND 3 EXECUTE A GRANT FROM THE REDEVELOPMENT 4 ASSISTANCE CAPITAL PROGRAM (RACP) THROUGH 5 THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA’S OFFICE OF 6 THE BUDGET IN THE AMOUNT OF TWO MILLION FIVE 7 HUNDRED THOUSAND ($2,500,000.00) DOLLARS; 8 ACCEPTING AND DISBURSING THE GRANT IF THE 9 APPLICATION IS SUCCESSFUL; AND COORDINATING 10 THE USE OF THE GRANT FUNDS WITH MAIN 11 SWETLAND, LLC AND SOUTHSIDE XPRESS MARTS, 12 INC. FOR THE PROJECT TO BE NAMED THE “WEST 13 SCRANTON REVITALIZATION PROJECT.” 14 MR. WECHSLER: At this time, I'll 15 entertain a motion that Item 5 be introduced 16 into its proper committee. 17 MR. ROGAN: So moved. 18 MR. EVANS: Second. 19 MR. WECHSLER: On the question? 20 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question. 21 I agree with my colleagues. I'm in full 22 support of this project. If this grant is 23 awarded, which I hope it is, it's going to 24 inject five and a half million dollars in 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 61 to 64 of 79 16 of 20 sheets61 West Scranton, clearing blight, getting rid 1 of public eyesores, increasing property 2 values and it's going to also tap into our 3 regional vital signs initiative. So I think 4 this project helps to grow our economy 5 through the bioscience industry. A 6 significant portion of the development 7 project space has actually being securing 8 the bioscience end. I think that this is an 9 exciting opportunity not only for West 10 Scranton, but for the city as a whole. And 11 I'm hopeful that if it's awarded, this will 12 spread to other neighborhoods throughout the 13 city. Thank you. 14 MR. ROGAN: Just to clear one item 15 of legislation, somebody mentioned this to 16 me earlier in the week: This is closer 17 to--this is near the Saint Ann's section of 18 Main Avenue in West Scranton. The name Main 19 Swetland LLC may be a little deceiving. 20 It's not near Swetland Avenue or Swetland 21 Street over by the Hyde Park area. It's 22 more towards the Saint Ann's section. 23 MR. WECHSLER: All those in favor of 24 introduction signify by saying aye? 25 62 MR. PERRY: Aye. 1 MR. ROGAN: Aye. 2 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 3 MR. EVANS: Aye. 4 MR. WECHSLER: Aye. Opposed?

EVANS: On the question, I'm 23 going to echo Councilman Wechsler's comments 24 about Mr. McLane. He is a dedicated 2563 professional that has done tremendous work 1 throughout the city many times at no charge. 2 So, I'm sure that he has far more hours 3 invested into this project than he's billing 4 us for, which is normal for Tom. But his 5 firm will do a great job and it's a smart 6 project, I think, for us to be taking on at 7 this time.8 MR. WECHSLER: All those in favor of 9 introduction signify by saying aye? 10 MR.

WECHSLER: What is the 24 recommendation of the Chairperson for the 25 68 Committee on Finance? 1 MR. EVANS: As Chairperson for the 2 Committee on Finance, I recommend final 3 passage of Item 7A. 4 MR. ROGAN: Second. 5 MR. WECHSLER: On the question? 6 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question. 7 I'm going to be voting for this legislation 8 tonight because I do think that we need 9 paving throughout the city. That's for 10 sure. I am disappointed, as I mentioned 11 last week, that there's not support to take 12 a portion of this funding and put it towards 13 storm water management. As someone 14 mentioned tonight, we're only allocating 15 from the sale of the--the proceeds from the 16 sale of the Sewer Authority $500,000. I'm 17 not an engineer, but I don't think that's 18 going to be enough. And I think that we 19 should put more of a focus on storm water 20 management and having money available for 21 that. Obviously, if anybody has been 22 following what's going on in the city, it is 23 a big issue and I think we're going to come 24 up short. Thank you. 2504/10/2017 10:09:54 AM Page 69 to 72 of 79 18 of 20 sheets69 MR. WECHSLER: Yes, on the question. 1 As Councilman Rogan stated, we were 2 contacted this week by several different 3 residents whose streets have not been 4 touched with paving in the course of 25 to 5 30 years. I think it's important that we 6 use money that we have available to put into 7 that. The $500,000 that's been set aside 8 for the storm water management is really 9 money that's been put aside to complete the 10 studies. The amount of, as we talked about 11 last week, if we do everything with the 12 proceeds as we planned, even if we put all 13 of the money that isn't going to pensions or 14 into bond payment, there's only three 15 million dollars available from the proceeds 16 to be put into that. I agree with Mr. 17 Gaughan, that there are going to be 18 significant investments required in storm 19 water management. But I really think it's 20 important at this time to make sure this 21 money goes into the paving. 22 MR. GAUGHAN: Just an additional 23 comment. Can we find out how many 24 additional studies have to take place? 25 70 Because I asked that question back in the 1 caucus three weeks ago when we had this 2 meeting about using the proceeds from the 3 sale of the sewer authority and nobody can 4 answer. Maybe one additional study, maybe 5 two, maybe three, maybe four? I have no 6 idea. But I would like to know if we can 7 send a letter to Arcadis or somebody and 8 find out how many more studies after this 9 one we're already doing is it going to take 10 to find out how much storm water management 11 is going to cost and what that encompasses. 12 MR. ROGAN: I would like to agree on 13 that point. Because $500,000 could fix a 14 lot of localized flooding issues. On the 15 paving vote, obviously paving and road 16 paving throughout the city is a problem in 17 almost every single neighborhood of the 18 city. Storm flooding is a problem, 19 fortunately in only a few. Rather than 20 spending millions of dollars on studies, 21 that $500,000 I would bet could probably fix 22 the problem in Keyser Valley coming from 23 West Mountain. Another allocation of money 24 could fix a problem in parts of Greenridge 2571 or Greenridge Street. I would much prefer 1 to see the money being used practically than 2 to continue to hire engineers and to hire 3 consultants to figure out what the problem 4 is, that the residents of Scranton have 5 always known. The same neighborhoods have 6 flooded for 30, 40 years when we get heavy 7 rains. We know where they are. We just 8 have to get them fixed.9 MR. EVANS: I think that you're 10 right. And the assumption being as of our 11 meeting several weeks ago was that the 12 $500,000 will goes towards more studies. 13 But we really don't know that for sure until 14 the Arcadia study is done. So hopefully, 15 they'll be comprehensive enough to give us a 16 good footing. And you're right, some of 17 this money can be used for the hard cost 18 related to storm water. 19 MR. WECHSLER: As was discussed at 20 the meeting, Mr. Cross from the Pennsylvania 21 Economy League said that--he's been working 22 for us for many years. And he admits at 23 least there's one more follow up study to be 24 done. And I think his comment was that they 25 72 put money aside to be over and above what 1 they needed because they didn't want to come 2 up short of needing money to complete the 3 studies. I mean, we've heard from 4 Administrator Bulzoni that there are monies 5 available--we even knew that from the Mr. 6 Young situation--monies available for that 7 repair. So I do think there's money in our 8 current budget to handle some of these 9 problems as well. I think we just have to 10 focus and I think make the best use of that 11 money. But we are going to have to complete 12 that storm water study to put the whole plan 13 in place. So, but like as Mr. Cross said, 14 the $500,000 is probably too much. But we 15 don't want to come up short on that. 16 MR. PERRY: Yeah, on the question. 17 And let's not forget, this $700,000 that we 18 get to use for paving, the reservation that 19 I had was getting the feedback from the city 20 on the storm. And were we going to have to 21 dip into some other account and transfer 22 money around or funds to pay for the storm 23 clean up? And after the comprehensive 24 report we got, we got the okay last week 2519 of 20 sheets Page 73 to 76 of 79 04/10/2017 10:09:54 AM73 that it was going to be okay. This week, we 1 got it all in writing. So I'm confident 2 that we're not going to have any money that 3 we're going to have to give out later to pay 4 for the storm. And not only that, but let 5 us not forget that our federal grant money 6 that we get, that goes to paving for low and 7 moderate income neighborhoods. This money, 8 we're going to get to pick and choose some 9 of the worst roads that haven't gotten paid 10 paved in quite a long time that was brought 11 up today. Such as, South Irving Street in 12 South Side which is an absolute mess. So 13 this money will go to some of those roads 14 where normally we weren't going to be able 15 to pave them. 16 MR.

GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question. 13 I'm going to be voting against this 14 legislation. I'm concerned, first of all, I 15 think we should be trying to save every 16 penny possible. Secondly, we're going to be 17 paying roughly $35,000 more for their 18 service and $5.75 more per medical bill. 19 So, I just think that we should look to try 20 to save as much money as we can. And I 21 don't agree with this decision. Thank you. 22 MR. WECHSLER: Roll call, please? 23 MS. CARERRA: Mr. Perry? 24 MR. PERRY: Yes. 25 78 MS. CARERRA: Mr. Rogan? 1 MR. ROGAN: Yes. 2 MS.
