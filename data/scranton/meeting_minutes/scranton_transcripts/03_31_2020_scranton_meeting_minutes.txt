MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially Father Joseph Sica. And I'd also like to take a special moment of silence tonight as well for people throughout the world who are fallen ill with the coronavirus , those who have tragically passed away in our community , in the State of Pennsylvania , in the United States of America and in the world. Let us think about them and their families at this time that they may find peace. Let us also take a moment of silence to think about the doctors , the nurses, the researchers and all medical professionals and first responders who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process . May they find protection and peace whether we are here at home or abroad surround ed by many people suffering from this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 illness or only a few.

CORRESPONDENCE SENT TO MAYOR PAIGE G. COGNETTI DATED MARCH 19, 2020 REGARDING CITY EMPLOYEES FURLOUGHS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items from any of the Council people present ? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have one. Just a reminder that tomorrow is Census Day. Everyone should have got their census forms in the mail. You could either fill out the form and return it via mail or you could go online and fill it out. So I encourage everyone to do that. There's a lot of money at stake with the results of the census. And just a quick thing, if you're responding online, you cannot save your progress . So once you start, you have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 finish. Otherwise you have to start all over, just a reminder there. So please everyone get their census forms filled out because tomorrow is Census Day. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a quick one. I would love to be able to announce that there's a church picnic coming up or a chicken dinner. But unfortunate ly at this time there isn't any because of this horrible global health crisis. But I just want to say everybody stay safe out there. And this shall pass and we'll be happy to announce these events in the future. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I have two announcements . First, as I mentioned at the top of the caucus, a public hearing will be held next Tuesday , April 7th at 5:45 p.m., for Item 5-B on tonight 's agenda. It is the Office of Economic and Community Development 's Five-Year Consolidated Plan and Annual Action Plan for 2020. Obviously this will not be like any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 other public hearing that we've have had in terms of coming to Council Chambers and speaking at the public hearing . So what we're going to ask people to do is it will be advertised in the newspaper . If you would like to comment specifically on Item 5-B, OECD's Five-Year Consolidated Plan and the Annual Action Plan for 2020, please send your comment s to Lori Reed our City Clerk at Lreed@scranton padotgov. And we will take those comments up and until next Tuesday , April 7th at 4:30 p.m. Usually when we have those type of public hearing s for the Five-Year Consolidated Plan, we receive many comments from the head of the Women's Resource Center, a lot of the recipients of our grant funding . So we would encourage those people who would usually come to our meetings to submit their comment s in writing to us and we will include those in the official record of the Council . The second announcement I have, if there are any groups or organizations offering any free services or assistance to someone in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 need during this national emergency and you would like to have that information available on ECTV you could e-mail ChrisECTV@gmail.com. The wording of your e-mail is exactly what they will publish . So if you have any groups or organization s that you're offering free services , make sure you get that to ChrisECTV@gmail.com. The last announcement I'd like to make is, our meeting right now is live-streaming on YouTube . I'm not sure how many people we have watching . But it's also because of the work -- and I want to personal ly thank Mark Migliore and Chris Bolton from ECTV. Because of their work, we're also streaming this live on ECTV Channel 19 as well. So we are making every effort to get this out to the public, to have the public involved even though obviously these are unprecedented times. And those are all the announcements that I have. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Lori. At this time I would like to make a motion that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 City Council officially accepts and places the comments received from the following individuals into our official record to be fully included in our minutes . And those people are Norma Jeffries , Gary Colvin, Thomas Coyne, Patricia Nestor, Mara Pugliese , Andrew Staerker , Sammy Narwicz , Maggie Perry, Jeannie Davidson and Daria Vogel -- Daria Vogel. There's been a motion. Is there a second? MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , so Mrs. Reed our City Clerk has been keeping a tally of all the public comment that we get. So we've been asking the public to send their comments into Lori Reed at Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. We did receive comments from those people that I just mentioned . We are reviewing these comments . We are taking anything anybody sends from the public, we are obviously taking very seriously . There are some people who just simply wanted to get their thought s to the Council , which is great. And they wanted to comment on the crisis going on or something 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 related to City business . There are also some people who have posed very specific questions to the Council . We have those e-mail addresses of the people who did pose specific questions . And we will over the next few days take the time to try as best we can to get answers to those question s. We will get in contact with those people and will make sure at our public meeting that we announce the fact that we did get answers to those questions or those concern s that people have, okay? Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (QUESTIONS /COMMENTS FROM PUBLIC) MS. NORMA JEFFRIES : Question : Since the Library is closed and the use of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 their computers is not available , hiring documents are so often sent via e-mail with the documents printed , signed, uploaded and e-mailed back to the prospective employer . Any idea as to any source that is available for those hoping to gain employment where they can use a computer ? I have let someone use my printer and scanner to complete the hiring process . Any sources available or should be available for job seekers . I tried checking the office supply stores to see if they were open, did not see anything on their website . I will be on the call but was not sure if the mics would be open for questions . Thanks Norma Jeffries MR. GARY COLVIN: I noted in today’s Times/Tribune the quasi conclusive , but not certified , results of the selection process to fill the open Council seat. It is obvious that selectee will not be me. I had hoped to bring three concerns I had to Council , not, I must admit, sure that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Council was the appropriate body, but looking for a way for further discussion . I decided to present them to you in hope you would pass them on perhaps encouraging Council members to see value in them leading to some discussion . (1.) Create a resolution on behalf of this Council to present to the current County Commissioners urging a county-wide reassessment . (2.) Create a rule that anyone presently sitting as an elected Scranton City or Lackawanna County or Scranton School Board official be prohibited from applying for appointment to fulfill an open elected seat for any of these three entities without first resigning from the position now held. (3.) Create a rule prohibiting cross filing for Council openings . I am not sure that items (2) and (3) are even something that Council can address . I am sure that Council can resolve item (1) should it choose to. Items (2) and (3) are a thorn in the electorates ' side. Positive strides have been made by that electorate to revitalize County 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 and City government . Removing items (2) and (3) from the election process furthers that revitalization . Sincerely , Gary Colvin, Scranton , PA. MR. THOMAS COYNE: Good Afternoon , I was prepared to present at the last Council session , but the interruption seems to have closed the session without input. I would like to officially submit the following on paper. Once we get another council meeting if we get to community input I will repeat it there. Attached is the information I am officially presenting and asking on record. Thanks again, Thomas Coyne. Attachment : Scranton City Council , Today I have one simple question and two separate points of urgency for City Council . 1. In reading the Act 47 exit documents , I noticed some concerning verbiage . Based on that, rather than just asking, IF the former Fire Chief was given a payout, on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 retirement , for the sick/vacation days accrued , review of the Act 47 documents reflects this: “The Coordinator recommends that the City not increase the amount of annual sick days or the amount of annual buyout of unused sick days beyond the amounts currently provided .” During the chief's tenure, specifically during the time of employment under review, where the Fire Chief was not recording time used, was there an annual buyout provided during the same period and for how many days? 2. An immediate concern , there has been a confirmed case of the Coronavirus at the University of Scranton . A Student who lives off Campus was noted that on 3/14 attended parties on 400 block of Clay Avenue, well within the two week infection period. What has the university done to coordinate this exposure with the city, to identify both the student , and everyone at the parties ? When and if, what date, the University of Scranton DIRECTLY notified the city of this incident , and how is the university currently coordinating with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 city, especially dealing with potential students who may not want to come forward and admit they attended because they are underage and drinking was occurring ? 3. Though also critical for the city, and being forward looking , the Mayor in a press conference noted her intent to move forward to keep Scranton in the Act 47 Distressed City Status. The mayor stated the budget was at risk. And we know it was already at risk by not cutting back or putting in escrow, the 10 million legally challenged , but still marked as collectable in the 2020 budget. Her extension was due to the Virus and its effect on the potential loss of revenue to the city due to the shutdown . Act 47 requires both a yearly and five year going forward budget and that is well known to be impossible with both the coronavirus impact and the pending Act 511 court case. (We hope to not lose is not a financial plan.) Scranton entered the Distressed City Status on January 10, 1992. We are now 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 years into a 5 year plan. The Act 47 exit plan had specific ways to reduce the city's cost. Unfortunately there seems to be a lack of ability or desire to get specific numbers that can be used in evaluating and reducing cost. People have suggested a 30% cut and been told it is unreasonable or we have nowhere to cut. I have three specific areas the city can harvest relief, but only if numbers can support the changes . We have a budget disclosure of monthly trash cost supplied to council in January . But it has been asked for clarity if this included employee , vehicle , gas, and building costs, but a breakdown or clarity was never provided . Does this include the employee , equipment , gas? Or is this provided number just collection and dump fees alone? I would like to request a breakdown of monthly average cost of trash route, both all costs and separated out, employee , vehicle , gas cost or gallons used, recycling route, both all costs and separated out - employee , vehicle , gas cost or gallons used. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I have asked and been promised a copy of the current contract with the landfill , last updated by Jimmy Conners ' administration . I also asked, if, in that contract the city is obligated to use the landfill exclusively for recycling ? Lastly, the city has at the end of this year, the expiration of collective bargaining for both the fire and police departments . Though I support both departments , I also must support the city's continued viability and the undue burden of taxes based on a 3%+ yearly increase . With the 12/30 expiration looming , it is unwise for the city to delay in both evaluation and negotiation to the last minute, because doing this removes bargaining power the city has by turning it into a critical must act now. It has been stated by council in interviewing to fill the open council position , two years goes by fast on a council seat. Eight months goes by even faster. Thank you for your time. Thomas Coyne1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 tcoyne@afg-media.us MS. PATRICIA NESTOR: Https://www.facebook .com/106415517582654 /posts/ 142867093937496 /. According to this video, Greyhound is still running buses between New York City and Scranton . Martz has suspended this service for two weeks but Greyhound continues . Like the one guy who speaks at council says, some people only understands lawsuits . Can we get a lawsuit , class action, or otherwise to get them to stop? New York City is a Covid 19 hotspot . And they are ignoring government warnings to stay in their homes. If coming from NYC, they aren't quarantining for 14 days if they continue to go back and forth on the bus. They are bringing this awful disease to Scranton . Thanks, Patricia People are using PPE, personal protective equipment , like rubber gloves and surgical masks in public, to the stores or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 wherever they go. After use they are not being properly disposed . Instead they are being carelessly littered on the ground, thrown out of cars, etc. I had to pick a dirty surgical mask off my front lawn on Green Ridge Street. Can we quadruple fines for littering during pandemics or anyone who litters items that are used as a barrier against germs? If someone is coughing into their mask, then throws it in my yard, they are putting me at risk. If they throw their dirty gloves into the supermarket parking lot, then someone else has to pick them up. They obviously don't care about the health and safety of others, so make them pay. So Martz put buses on hold. Greyhound still has one way buses from New York City to Scranton . Is the Navy going to send us a hospital ship? Are we going to get 30,000 ventilators ? How about the National Guard build a temporary quarantine center right there at the bus station . Make Greyhound pay for it. That seems reasonable . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Yours truly, Patricia I watched the Mayor’s Facebook live. Is she on Greyhound ’s payroll ? Yours truly, Patricia MR. ANDREW STAERKER : My concern is the travel of these residents to northeast pa. I view this as non essential travel and strongly believe our local government should enforce the people to self quarantine along with taking their names and home address for accountability purposes . MS. DARIA DILEO-VOGEL: Good afternoon , I sincerely hope that you and your loved ones are all healthy . I am one of the furloughed employees from the City of Scranton 's clerical unit. I have worked for the City for twenty years. I love my job and I understand that times are chaotic and uncertain . I was impressed and grateful for your words to the Mayor (letter of March 19). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 My biggest fear is the loss of our health care coverage . Since the City of Scranton is self insured , I am praying that the Mayor continue our policies until our great nation can come through this crisis. This is a public health crisis and our health is so important to all of us at this most trying time. Please do what you can to protect our health insurance coverage . I am grateful for any influence that you may have in this matter. God Bless you and yours. Sincerely , Daria Vogel MS. MARA PUGLIESE : I know you are probably getting inundated with calls and e-mails in regard to the City furloughing 24 individuals . I read your letter and I am grateful for the support . We are accepting at this point the status of furlough as long as we are going to be called back to work. The group that has been furloughed is very concerned regarding their healthcare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 insurance being cancelled at the end of April. Please don't allow this to happen. We are eager to return to work and continue our service to the City of Scranton . Sincerely , Mara Pugliese MR. SAMUAL NARWICZ : Hello, Mrs Reed and Honorable Council . Below are some questions per the article in the Tribune : 1) Does Council have any recourse to stop Mayor Cognetti from exploiting this crisis as an excuse to lay off workers in various city departments and keeping Scranton in "distressed " status? 2) Has politics played a role in who Mayor Cognetti chose to lay off? It seems like this is all politically motivated on the Mayor's part. 3) Why is Mayor Cognetti allowing part-time workers in some departments while laying off full-time workers in other departments ? 4) Does Council agree with Mayor Cognetti 's decision to close firehouses ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Sammy Narwicz Scranton MS. JEANNIE DAVIDSON : Dear Council , As you know from my last e-mail the concern the employees of the city of Scranton have, not only have we been furloughed without pay, which in itself could be questioned , but now we are facing losing our insurance . In the midst of a pandemic , our employer is taking our insurance away. I understand that many people are going through exactly what we are going through . The issue here is that other employers had absolutely no choice to close their business or furlough their employees . With our Administration , it was a choice. It was an unfair choice. We as the employees know that you as council are doing what you can to help us, or at least get our concerns made known. Thank you, Please stay Healthy Jeannie Davidson1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MS. PERRY: Good Morning , City Council . As we currently face this global health crisis it is understandable that the economic impacts will be broad and devastating . Many City clerical workers have been furloughed as a result of the possible economic fallout the City of Scranton may face due to COVID-19. As of right now the furloughs are indefinite and the clerical workers were informed their employee health insurance will only be valid until the end of April. Based on the fact that we are all dealing with a pandemic and are all at risk, this is very nerve-wracking for the furloughed employees , many of whom have worked for the City for decades . After April, those still furloughed will only be able to continue insurance through COBRA, an expensive option for workers who are already only receiving a portion of their pay. Is there any way that these dedicated employees can continue to receive their employee health insurance without the additional cost of COBRA while furloughed ? I understand that this is an exceptional request 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 but we are living through an exceptional time. Respectfully , Maggie Perry MR. JOSEPH HEALEY: Hello and thank you for still providing public meetings to the best of your abilities for everyone . Our question is concerning garbage collection . The issue of citizens feeling we pay an outrageous fee to a PRIVATE company for services pales in comparison to the egregious and unscrupulous business practices of said private company . As recently reported in the Times yet again, we are made well aware of their flagrant usage of slave labor (not to give prisoners "something punitive to do") but to exploit and profit handsomely from a partially slave labor workforce . Even if you do not empathize with the exploitation of our prison population , you should be outraged that these free labor services are utilized for the benefit of only ONE particular private company in our area.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Last time I checked , I don't remember free labor being farmed out to the restaurant , retail, construction , or any of the other public or private services provided throughout the city. We would like a full explanation of just exactly how this one particular privately owned business hit the jackpot with no accountability . In addition , the citizens would like a full explanation of the scientific reasoning that they are using which now allows them to dump all "blue recycling " directly into the landfill , while at the same time continuing to handle "red recycling " as per usual? If the city cannot directly run our own sanitation department , there are still plenty of other private companies who can and council in conjunction with the Mayor's office need to explore these options (contract or not) asap. Even amidst all that is going on now, this should still be a top priority for the city to aggressively address as they will be counting on hiding behind a national crisis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 to give cover to their outrageous exploitation of the entire city! Thank you for all you do, and thank you for your time in addressing our concerns , Citizens of West Scranton MS. FAY FRANUS: Council members , Fay Franus Scranton . I believe Mayor Cognetti is doing a superb job looking out for the citizens of the city -- saving the taxpayers money by furloughing employees of the city. These are tough times and Mayor Cognetti has taken steps that are very necessary . I'm sure it was not an easy decision but when you are a leader you must make these types of decisions . I want to know why city council members feel Mayor Cognetti should NOT furlough these employees ? I say this because you as council members are also suppose to be working for us -- we pay you to do so yet you want to add pressure to the mayor by writing her asking her NOT to do this, which is not right. You should be standing by her and giving the mayor all the support you can and remember that YOU REPRESENT US. WE should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 your first and only priority ! We have lost jobs ourselves by the thousands . My next comment is I do NOT feel Tom Schuster should be appointed to city council . Mr. Schuster JUST got ELECTED to the Scranton school board in November . I believe that is a slap in the face for every person who voted for him and wanted him to win that seat on the school board. I am tired of people using the school board as a stepping stone to get on city council . We need people who are not politically connected . I truly felt another applicant , Amber Viola has wonderful qualifications and would serve this city very well. She has an extensive background --she supervised many people under her while in the armed services . By appointing "school director " Schuster you are maintaining the same cronyism and old boys club that Scranton is sick and tired of. It is time to rethink this appointment if indeed you want to appoint Tom Schuster . When people are elected to a position whether it be school board or city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 council they should serve the term they GOT ELECTED for NOT jump ship to further their political career. It is no wonder many don't apply for council positions because they know full well the odds of them getting chosen are slim because they know your mind is already made up when you see your friends wanting this position . You have a chance NOW to change politics as usual in Scranton by not appointing Tom Schuster . Thank you. (END OF PUBLIC COMMENT ) MR. GAUGHAN : And we're going to go back to Mrs. Reed now. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. MR. DONAHUE : I'd like to make a motion to nominate a person to fill the position vacated by former Scranton City Council man Pat Rogan to serve for the remainder of this year and all of next year 2021 with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 said term schedule d to expire at 12 noon on January 3rd, 2022. MR. GAUGHAN : A motion has been made to fill the position vacated by former Scranton City Council man Pat Rogan. Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : This motion is simply to place a nomination on the table. All those in favor of introduction , signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to nominate Thomas Schuster to fill the unexpired term of former Scranton City Councilman Pat Rogan for the remainder of this year and all of next year 2021 with said term scheduled to expire at 12 noon on January 3rd, 2022. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 question . I just want to reiterate some of the concern s that I had for this appointment of Mr. Schuster . And I do know that he is certainly capable . Because of his position on school board, I'm opposed to his appointment . I feel that it will be detrimental to the school board. I think that we had other qualified candidates that would be well-suited for the position as well. So for those reasons , I think that I'm opposed . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? I would -- sorry. Did someone else want to on the question , Kyle or Mark? I just want to say on the question , so as I mentioned last week, my vote is going to be for Tom Schuster . As the other Council members sat in on the interviews a few weeks ago on Saturday , I thought everyone did a good job. And it was a difficult choice. It was not an easy decision by any means. I thought all six people did very well. But the City in my opinion faces some very unique challenges . And after listening to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 interviews and looking at everybody 's resume, it was my belief that Mr. Schuster is the best equipped at this time to help this City Council address them. One of the things that I look at is Mr. Schuster 's record on the school board. I don't think Mr. Schuster should be knocked for being in public service or being on the Scranton School Board. The Scranton School Board as we all know gets a bad rap because of all the things that have gone there over the last few years. But Mr. Schuster stuck out to me as one of the people who really exposed the mismanagement of the district . The other thing that stuck out to me was he had a great interview . I thought he answered the questions , had an understanding of the issues that face the City. And he also did a really great job as the chairperson for the Budget and Finance Committee over at the school board. So he demonstrated his independence as a public servant . He demonstrated the fact that he always pushes for transparency and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 openness which is something that this Council and myself personally has kind of hung our hat on. And I believe that he will be the best person for this position . And that's why he has my vote. Anyone else on the question ? Okay. All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Opposed . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. The ayes have it and so moved. Mr. Schuster will be our new -- MS. REED: Mr. Gaughan , excuse me. We need a roll call vote. MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Kathy, I'm sorry. Can you do a roll call? MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. Okay. So the motion passed three to one. Mr. Schuster will take his seat next Tuesday . He has been in contact with Mr. Hayes in terms of getting sworn in and how that whole process will work. I want to congratulate Mr. Schuster on his appointment . And I think he will work well with this Council . Okay, now, we'll move to comment from the Council members . Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. So I'm glad the Mayor came and explained some of the rational e, not that I agree with all of it but at least she explained some of the rationale regarding the furloughs . And hopefully we're going to establish more dialogue with the fire department . Also, a couple things were brought to my attention this week. So, of course, the U.S. Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which offers paid sick leave where they don't have to exhaust their sick time. So I hope we're following that within the City because it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 applies to the public sector. I'm sure they're aware. I'm just making a point of it. Also, you know, I forgot -- or I remembered that we're self-insured . So they brought up healthcare before. So like the school district , we're self-insured . So when your benefits lapse, you get an extra 30 days because they are paid 30 days ahead. That's how I remember it. I hope maybe we can look into that with the City. So if they say at the end of April they're over, that means they get another month. I'm almost positive that's how it works with self-insured bodies. Let's please look into that. Maybe Solicitor Hayes and/or Miss Reed can pose that question to administration . Something else was brought to my attention today. So I know, you know, we're under a shutdown and, you know, essential businesses can operate . We kind of have a handle on what they are. But a couple people came to me over the course of this week and said what about ChemLawn ? Suppose dly, you know, there's people out there fertilizing grass, these companies , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 is that allowed and who is policing that? I guess there's still some contractors out there maybe building a deck for somebody . I don't know if they are doing it on their own. I'm sure that would be okay. It's your house. It's your property . It's your deck. But I believe that some of this is occurring -- only because it's been brought to my attention . I'm just, you know, passing it forward . Where are we at? Who's suppose d to police that? Who enforce s that? I think we need to look into that. And is there a vehicle to report this? I know maybe we report, you know, certain issues with LIPS but -- or where do we report someone that's, you know, maybe violating the shutdown? You know what I'm talking about. So if someone could look into that for me too, please? MAYOR COGNETTI : Is it possible to answer that? I don't want to go out of turn. MR. GAUGHAN : I actually -- MR. MCANDREW : -- MR. GAUGHAN : No, that's okay, Mark. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Mark, do you have anything else? MR. MCANDREW : No, but please answer. I'm glad you're still here, Mayor. MR. GAUGHAN : No, that's okay. What I'd like to do -- what I should have done is in Fourth Order, Mayor, I was going to give you the opportunity to speak. So if you don't mind, we'll run through everyone 's comments . And at the end of the meeting when we ask for any further business if you wouldn't mind address ing that. That would be great if you can. I appreciate it. And now, Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I don't. I think I would just like to say people need to continue to stay at home and adhere to the orders that Lackawanna County was given by the Governor . It's, you know, it's really important that we try to flatten the curve where the coronavirus -- there are a lot of vulnerable people out there that we need to protect . But then there are lot of us, you know, it could be me. I could -- I could easily die from it too. There's plenty of young people without health issues that are really suffering 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 from this condition . So it is really important that you're just going out for the essential s and this might answer part of Councilman McAndrew 's concern too. I think the State Police are enforcing those rules. And just take extra precautions if you are going to the grocery story. I still see people going into stores with, you know, children or older parents with them. So try to go alone if you are going shopping or to use delivery services . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . And, Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I'd just like to acknowledge first and foremost our doctors , our nurses, our healthcare profess ionals, our police, fire, public works employees , grocery and pharmacy store employee and anyone else that continue s to show up to work every day and provide necessary life sustaining services under the current cloud of uncertainty , I think they deserve a huge debt of gratitude for the courage and heroism . And I really just want to say thank you for all you do. And that's all I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 have. And I just urge everyone to stay home, practice safe social distancing . To be quite honest, this is going to get worse before it gets better. But I think we'll get through it. And we'll get through it together . That's all I have for right now. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. I just have a few comments . First, I was going to do this last week before we were interrupted . But I want to thank our City Clerk, Lori Reed; Kathy Carrera who does a great job in our office; Kevin Hayes our Solicitor ; all of the Council members for trying the best that we can to work through these difficult circumstance s to ensure that we still have public meetings. As everyone knows, this is not an easy time for anyone. And being a government body trying to have meetings and trying to figure this all out has been quite the task. But I want to thank Lori and Kathy for all that they've done. And I also want to thank again Mark Migliore and Chris Bolton from ECTV who I've 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 been on the phone with back and forth just trying to figure all this out. And they have done a tremendous job. And they're a tremendous , tremendous asset to our community . The second thing I want to mention briefly is we received via e-mail today from the Mayor, which I appreciate , the Act 47 coordinator 's recommendation to the Secretary DCED for the City of Scranton in terms of their recommendation on whether we are going to exit or not exit Act 47. I have not -- this is I think about 21, 22 pages. I have not had the opportunity obviously because we just received it. I think everyone just receive d it late this afternoon . I have not had the opportunity to go through this fully. But I did go towards the end. I didn't read through the meat of the document but it looks to me and, Mayor, at the end of our meeting here we didn't have time in the caucus, but if you want to comment at all on this I would appreciate it. It looks like they are not making a definite determination that they are going to recommend our exit from Act 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 47 due to the coronavirus crisis. So without reading through the document I can't really comment on it fully. But this will be in Third Order next week so that the public could take a look at it and we'll go from there. My final comment tonight is just in terms of everything that's been going on in our community here in Scranton and really throughout the country and throughout the world. These are usual times to say the least. They're difficult times. And my heart goes out to every single person who is suffering from the coronavirus , all the people that have tragically passed away. I personally think of the nurses, the doctors , all of those front line medical professionals who are working long hours to take care of their patients . This is not a joke. It is not a hoax. It's not something that any of us should take lightly . And I think in our community at least we are not taking it lightly . We need to work together as a community . We need to work together and we are working together as a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Council with Mayor Cognetti . We need to make sure that our most vulnerable are taken care and they are not forgotten . Each one of us in the City needs to do our part by staying home as much as we possibly can, staying away from large crowds of people. And I know as I'm speaking to all of you tonight in this meeting , all of you who may be watching on YouTube or watching on Channel 19, there are those who are rightly anxious . And there are those who are afraid. And there are those who have not seen their loved ones in weeks. I haven't seen my parents since February -- although I talk to them and FaceTime them. But it's different not being able to see them in person. There are those people in our community and throughout the world and in the United States who have not seen their grandchildren , who have not seen their sisters , their brothers , their daughters . That part of it really, really is bothering me. And I'm sure it's bothering all of you. There are those out there who are out of a job, who have been furloughed , who now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 on top of the coronavirus crisis you have the added burden of worrying about money, worrying about health insurance , worrying about all of these different things. And all of us including myself wonder when is this going to end and will we get through it? And the message that I want to relay to all of you tonight is that we will get through this. We're going to get through it together as a City. We're going to get through it together as a state. We're going to get through it together as a country in the United States of America . Now, I was reminded a few days ago of the story of Jonas Salk. And I just want to relay the story to you because I think it gave me hope when I read this story. And I'm hoping that it will give some of you hope who may be listening and watching out there as well. So Jonas Salk was born in 1914 in New York City. And he was the eldest of three sons to Russian -Jewish immigrant s. And he was the first member of his family to attend college . And he earned his medical degree from the New York University School of Medicine in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 1939. And he became a scientist /physician at Mt. Sinai Hospital . In 1947, Salk was appointed the Director of the Virus Research Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine . And with funding from the National Foundation for infantile paralysis , now known as the March of Dimes Birth Defect Foundation , he began to develop the technique s that would lead to a vaccine to wipe out the most frighten ing scourge of that time, paralytic poliomyelitis , otherwise known as polio. Now, those of us who are my age and younger , we don't remember polio. We don't remember that scourge . But there is some like my parents and those who are older who do remember it and who were possibly affected by it. Now, contrary to the eras prevailing scientific opinion , Jonas Salk believed that he had a vaccine composed to kill the polio virus that could immunize without risk of infecting a patient . And he ended up administering this vaccine to volunteers who had not had polio 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 including himself , his lab scientist , his wife and all of their children . All of them developed antipolio antibodies . And they experienced no negative reactions to the vaccine . In 1954, national testing began on 1 million children ages six to nine who became known as the polio pioneers . And on April 12th, 1955, the results were announced . The vaccine was safe and it was effective . In the two years before the vaccine was widely available , the average number of cases of polio in the United States was more than 45,000 people. By 1962 that number had dropped to 910. Jonas Salk was held as a miracle -worker. He never patented the vaccine . He never earned any money on his discovery . He preferred it to be distribute d as widely as possible . His career was amazing . He went onto find other breakthroughs against diseases that affected so many millions of people throughout the world. And in 1995 he passed away at the age of 80. And his famous quote was, “Hope lies in dreams, in imagination and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality .” The reason that I wanted to tell that story tonight at this Council meeting is because I don't want people in the City to stop hoping. I know that everybody is anxious including myself. And everybody is scared and afraid and asking that question of when is this going to end? Will we get through it? Because early on it seemed like there was no light at the end of the tunnel. There is light at the end of the tunnel. We have some of the best scientist s and researchers in the world. We have every scientist and researcher in the world working on this day and night. So my message to you tonight is let's not stop fighting . Let's not stop hoping. Let's not stop believing . Let's continue to work together as community , as a country, and as a world. And we will beat this virus eventually . We will get back to our normal lives. We'll be able to visit with our parents and grandparents . And I think we'll be stronger and a better community for that. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 that is all I have for tonight . MR. MCANDREW : Great job, Bill. MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks. Now, I will usually say if there is no further business ; but I want to turn it over to Mayor Cognetti now. Mayor, if you want to address any of the issues that came up? MAYOR COGNETTI : Good evening /afternoon . I'm not quite sure what it is. But, Councilman McAndrew , to answer your question about if you see something that you think might be either a nonessential activity , nonessential business , please don't call 911. Things like that are not emergencies . But we do want to know about that. So specific to if you see a nonessential business opening -- that is open and you are curious about it, you can give us -- shoot us an e-mail at Scranton 311@scrantonpa .gov or call 570-348-4101. That would be for businesses or any other entity. However , when you're specific to contract work which is what Council person McAndrew raised, you could submit question s about that to -- or excuse me, call 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 570-348-4193. You're welcome to e-mail the Scranton 311@scrantonpa .gov. But for a phone number, 570-348-4193. That will take you to our inspections department and they could walk you through that. We have -- we've gotten some of those complaint s. I would say though and this is the -- message that will echo what all of you have said. Scranton is doing an incredible job. We know that we haven't seen the peak here by any measure . But people are really staying home. To the extent that we can be successful with this, I mean, we are not seeing the numbers that maybe we could have had we not all come together as a city and as a community to stay at home and heed those warnings . So please everyone out there, please do continue to stay home. It is saving lives. And it's weird out there. It looks strange to have those empty streets . But that's a sign that people are listening and doing it. And I also, you know, you guys have already thanked everyone . I want to reiterate that we're so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 grateful to all of our healthcare workers, to our first responders , to all of the City employees , all of the employees -- the families all across the City that are going through a difficult economic time. This is hard on every single family in a different way. We're trying to continue to get resources out to the public through the website, through Facebook , through the town halls that I'm hosting . Obviously , you, City Council , are doing your part as well. I have a new -- we're just developing it today. I have one PDF that I'll send to you guys this evening so that you could distribute it to your e-mail lists. We're trying to get a really comprehensive set of information whether it's looking for social services , looking to volunteer , looking for help with business , SBA loans, things of that nature. So we're trying to get all the resources in one place. So we'll send that to you guys tonight . And to the Act 47 point -- sorry, to circle back to the technical stuff, so it's Pennsylvania Economy League and DCED from the state. We've been in touch with DCED 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 leadership in the last couple of days. And they've been really helpful in their approach to this. And we are appreciative of them for that. So you guys will see that there's -- they're really taking both PEL and its response and DCED and our calls are really focused on the impact that this virus and this economic situation are going to have on not only on our City's finances but that of all of the other Act 47 cities across the state. So we appreciate them being helpful . And I think the letter that you see there is a real sign of hope that we've got a partner down in Harrisburg that will help us work through some of these issues. So thank you guys for having me again. Stay home and stay wise. That is -- it really is working . And I appreciate you guys -- your leadership at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mayor. Thank you for coming tonight and participat ing. We really appreciate it. If there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . Is there a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 motion to adjourn ? MR. MCANDREW : I'll make a motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. This meeting is adjourned . Stay safe everybody . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Take care. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
