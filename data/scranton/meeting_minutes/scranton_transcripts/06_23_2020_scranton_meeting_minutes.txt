LACKAWANNA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REGIONAL PLANNING COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT 2019 RECEIVED JUNE 19, 2020. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 3-D. RESUME OF CITY OF SCRANTON BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR MAYORAL APPOINTEE . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. I was asked to announce although the St. Joseph's picnic has been cancelled this year, there are still some events that will be taking place. The $10,000 cash raffle, returns need to be in by July 2nd. The Go Joe 23 Ride Along needs to register by July 10th. The WNEP Telethon which is Saturday , July 25th, which is 8 to 10 and also their chicken dinner which is in place of the picnic this year will be Sunday, July 26th at noon to five at Marywood University . Tickets are required in advance . For more information , please visit St. Joe's website. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman McAndrew . Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. SCHUSTER : You know what, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 wouldn't mind commenting on a Third Order item. The correspondence we got between Mr. Isett and Associates , I was disappointed to hear that we weren't going to take a deep dive into the LIPS Department . I think it would have helped us out with some of the policies and procedures there, some of the things that could have been problematic in the past from the last administration . I mean, maybe it's something that we look into with the situation and then understanding that they've had that we can maybe look into the scope of the worker or adjustment of price, something like that to get into that. Maybe if it can't be done this year, the administration gets into it next year. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Does anybody else have any announcements ? Any other announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a couple of announcements . First, I saw today that La Festa, the Italian Festival downtown is going to be cancelled this year unfortunately due to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 COVID-19. I don't think it was unexpected . That's one of my favorite events of the year, especially as an Italian myself. And a couple other things, over the weekend on Friday, Black Scranton held a Juneteenth celebration at Nay Aug Park, which I attended and I thought was a really wonderful event and a great way to celebrate the emancipation of slaves. So and then something else, over the weekend that I had attended we held a flag raising at City Hall to commemorate the year of suffrage movement and women gaining the right to vote. And I want to thank the Women's Whistle Stop for helping put on the flag raising . I know a lot of other events were planned for that day, which also had to be put on hold. But they did have a race car parade and they went around to some different places throughout Lackawanna County. So I was happy to a part of that. That's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Anyone else have any announcements ? I just have two. Once again, I'd just like to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 say that if anyone would like to comment on agenda items or City business , please send those comments in writing to our City Clerk Lori Reed by e-mailing Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. Council will accept public comment until the day of our meeting , Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. Public comment is reviewed by the Council prior to our meeting and is placed in the official record and in the minutes of our meetings . Council 's agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . Our agenda and minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. So if anyone is interested to read the public comment , the questions and the comment from members of the public, many of them are very good questions and some valid -- very valid points. Again, you can access that by going to www.scrantonpa .gov, clicking on the Council page and then just look in our minutes and they'll be in the official record. And the last announcement I have I just want to wish my Aunt Peggy a happy 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 birthday . Her birthday is tomorrow . She's a faithful viewer of the Council meeting . So I wish her a happy birthday . That's all I have. Mrs. Reed, Fourth Order. MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Will someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals , Thomas Coyne, Marie Schumacher , and Steven Sabia? MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. There's been a motion and -- MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a second. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Just on the question , I just want to come back with because one of the concerns we talked about a little bit in caucus was illegal fireworks . And I do have the number. So this needs to be -- this number needs to be called while it's happening so the police can get there. This is the police desk non emergency number, okay? It's 570-578 -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 I'm sorry, 570-558-8345. Thanks. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, so while Mr. McAndrew is bringing up that, I wanted to bring that up as well because I did get a couple calls about it. I was told that several people had called that number but it didn't seem like too much was done. Is there any -- do we know if there is any other number offhand to call or this is the number? MR. MCANDREW : That's all I got. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah. But just to let people know, I mean, according to our City ordinances , we can't be igniting fireworks on City property or within 150 feet of any occupied building . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Anyone else? Just in regards to the public comment that was submitted , Mr. Coyne had submitted a lengthy statement and some questions . So I'm still going through those. And I'll do my best to answer those that pertain to Council . And then the ones that pertain to the administration I will get to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Mayor and members of her staff. Miss Schumacher had asked a few questions so we'll try to answer those. The Mayor had just sent Mrs. Reed and I a -- I don't know if members of Council were copied on it. But if you weren't, we'll send that out to you. She did answer all of Miss Schumacher 's questions from the last few months. It's in a word document . So we'll get that out to Miss Schumacher . And Mr. Sabia also had several comment s which he had submitted which we appreciate . So there's been a motion, a second, been on the question . All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. (Public Comment , the following are e-mails submitted to Council .) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 (Thomas Coyne) Greetings members of City Council It has been a while since I've addressed you since the death of my father at the Jewish nursing home during the start of the COVID-19 outbreak at that facility . I've tried to catch up with most of the City Council meetings but I am still somewhat behind. Starting just after January I was reviewing the city trash fees recycling and had questions , after receiving documents and reviewing them I had the opportunity to understand more of the scope of the agreement between the Keystone /Sanitary landfill /Lackawanna County Recycling Center and the City of Scranton 's agreements signed both by Jimmy Connors and other administrations . In the last council session it was brought up that there are questions on whether or not the city could take a metal and other items that are not being recycled now and split them off to different facilities to process the recycled material . Another question was how 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 long the Lackawanna County recycling center would be shut down to receive co-mingled recyclables (plastic , metal and glass). It has it been recently reported , The Lackawanna County Recycling Center will most likely not be receiving any co-mingled products at least till the end of this year and probably into 2021. The reason given in the beginning was reportedly due to safety concerns as the plastic and metal material may have live COVID-19 on it for an extended period and for the safety of the Recycling Center workers , processing the co-mingled plastic and metal was on hold. The Truth is the Lackawanna Recycling Center lost its slave labor. Around 2003, the Lackawanna Recycling Center terminated almost all the sorting line employees , and replaced them with Lackawanna County Prison Workers . That labor force, unlike regular employees , gets paid $5.00 a day. I also believe as prison labor the Recycling Center does not have to pay Social Security , Workman 's Comp, city wage tax, and health insurance for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 any of those prison workers . There is a lawsuit pending due to the verbiage that Prison Labor can only be used in a prison facility . (This is why license plates and other Unicor products are produced inside upgraded prisons .) The Lackawanna Recycling Center is not a prison or prison property and is a private For Profit Corporation . As such the pay for the prison labor should have been at least minimum wage. Understand that a number of prisoners were in jail due to non payment of support , and if they had, as an example $1,000 Support outstanding , if they were paid minimum wage, they would pay off the back support and be free after working 140 hours. This money would pay the $1,000 to the mother and child needing the funds and reduce prison costs for non-violent issues. Instead a prisoner paying off $1,000 now has to work 200 days or 8,000 hours and the mother and children have to wait not only 2/3 a year for the back pay, but while other parent is still in prison they have no income, and support stops.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 So in the above, the Recycling Center gets a free 7860 hours of work, the Mother and child/children have to wait 2/3 a year for the back pay and they lose the potential for those 179 days a year for the parent to provide meaningful support . Going Beyond the topic of Slave Labor, The Company Store, or pending Legal challenges already in the courts... we shall look to the meat of the City Contract with the Lackawanna Recycling Center. In 1990 File of the Council No 22, an agreement was put forward between the City of Scranton and the Keystone Sanitary Landfill . In Section 2.10 was granted waste disposal for a 5 year period. The City had an automatic right to extend for 5 years. If the life of the Landfill exceeded 10 years the City had a right to air space at the landfill for the remainder of the life of the landfill . (It exercised this right to extend for life) Tipping fees were listed starting in 1995 at $52.25 a ton but have remained low Because of the clause, if the County negotiates a lower tipping fee, the City also gets the negotiated 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 fee. In 2002 this was updated in Resolution 60. And it is important as it states, “that in participation of the disposal of recyclable waste, Lackawanna County has agreed to pay for any losses involved in the recycling project , and also to distribute and profits generated by the project to the municipalities in proportion to the disposable waste provided .” This 10 year contract entered in on September 19th 2002, States the city will deliver (and underlined for emphasis ) ALL recyclables to the Lackawanna Solid waste Management authority : Specifically ; Newsprint , Corrugated Cardboard , Magazines and co-mingled glass, plastic beverage containers , ferrous and non-ferrous metals. The contracted tipping for recyclables was at no cost. The city is mandated to provide and the authority is mandated to accept all of the above per the contract . Regardless of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 profit/loss. Every year, 60 days after closing the Facility was to prepare a profit/loss statement and all profits were to be distributed to the municipalities in percentage to the gross quantity of materials . (Loss would be eaten by the county itself). Question :On this has Scranton ever received the operational year end report and profit loss statement and has it received any distribution of profit generated from the recyclables . Not the State funds but from the Recycling Center itself. The authority has the right to refuse, to accept, or to reject any and all materials not meeting the description and form above. Having it listed as free and clear of foreign materials and debris at the point of collection . Statement : Most municipal contracts have a certain percentage allowed as for contamination of up to 3-5%. Without this it is rife for abuse for them to say there is contamination and push the material to the landfill when it is more profitable .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Contract questions . The Recycling Center is mandated to accept all materials , so refusal may be considered a breach? The cost per ton tipping that the city is now paying for taking the co-mingled items to the landfill should not be the burden of the City. The loss is mandated as a County Responsibility , but to not shift the burden back to the taxpayer . Looking another way, since the landfill is mandated to accept the material at $0.00 a ton, then a credit should be issued to the city for each month the Recycling center is refusing co-mingled by taking the 2019 monthly tonnage figures for comingled recyclables , and backing out from the current landfill fees. The removal of the extra recyclable tonnage at landfill tipping would then be reversed , restoring the zero cost by crediting the weight back to the city. The Landfill contract is a good one as long as we do not have a separate trash contract available . I have a suggestion for a long term solution , but it would take decent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 funding and matching federal grants and it is worth exploring at a later time. Lastly on October 27th, 2000 Mr DeNaples made under agreement for the life of the landfill , to provide a donation of equipment equivalent in value to $100,000.00 a year commencing in 2000 and continuing for the life of the settlement agreement and expected life of the landfill as 30 years. Equipment was listed as Motorcycles , packmasters , police cars, section trucks, and any other equipment necessary for the health and safety of the City Residents . Question : From this agreement : Has the Keystone landfill provided $100,000/year in equipment and is it still doing so as provided up and until at least 2030? **** Now onto the second subject we are hitting budget constraints because of COVID-19. I understand that the mayor wants to push forward continuing the emergency status, because of the possibility of more state and federal funding offsets , and the ability to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 flex positions and freedom in emergency orders, hiring, freezing , and dealing with employees who may or may not be union, relating to termination and or laying off during this crisis. For as long as the crisis officially is going and it gives the mayor large latitude to keep employees furloughed and to pass along as little information as possible . There will come a time to evaluate the budget and not dodge it in its uncertain form. I have started that process prior and would suggest the immediate removal of the following budgeted items. 1. Scranton Tomorrow . Scranton Tomorrow in the past has at the end of the year posted a zero or slight negative operational funds. In 2016 and 2017 I believe . At the end of 2017 an ordinance was put in for $250,000 for Scranton tomorrow Also was a increase from 2017 $ 32,500 to $75,000 (2017 = $ 282,500). In 2018 The City of Scranton Budgeted $ 75,000.00 for Scranton Tomorrow .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 In 2019 the City of Scranton increased the Budget to $ 225,000.00 for Scranton Tomorrow . In 2020 the City of Scranton continued the same Budget to $ 225,000.00 for Scranton Tomorrow . In the past few years ending in 2019, Scranton tomorrow first has a single employee making increasing pay over the years and as of last reporting one of the board members was drawing pay. They now have a main employee is paid $75,000 a year and it seems one board member is getting $ 25,000 a year for 10 hours a week. The required non-profit disclosures show Scranton Tomorrow now has in excess of $ 500,000 in funds as of last years closing . With an operation cost of $100,000/year it has enough funds to run for 5 years. It also gains additional funds from City Government Fundraising . That being said the Scranton budget of $ 225,000... makes Scranton Tomorrow in all intents a fully subsidized arm of the taxpayer and Scranton Government .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 For the next 2-3 years at least the City of Scranton should remove the $225,000 from the budget as it does not have the funds and the organization who is to promote Scranton , is not in need of the extra funding for operations at this time. 2. Somehow in 2019 a line was added in the budget for recycling . The budget was $175,000. Needless to say, at a zero cost for recycling the funds were never used as it's a non fee item. Somehow in 2020 the line increased to $ 350,000?? Again for a zero cost. 3. The Shade Tree Commission . Whatever has not been used already from this years budget of $175,000 should be put on hold for this year and greatly reduced for the following year until we have a better idea of discretionary funds. Not that I disagree with the ideal, just the current timing. 4. Somehow Scranton paid for a Stamp Machine Refill at the Sewer authority . Since Scranton does not own the Authority and or billing , I am not sure why Stamps were purchased for a non 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 city machine . Just based on the above this would remove from the budget in false or discretionary spending close to $700,000 right out of the box. Third Subject . We have Al Lucas. Who was First-Assistant Chief = bargaining unit statusPut in by emergency order to Chief (Management position non union) and a higher rate or pay then posted (council bent over backwards for this to objections of some members ) Now he resigned and is immediately granted bargaining unit status again, is interim chief (a non union position at the same time so he is now union and management ... who continue his duties as Emergency Management Coordinator .. though he was assistant Chief who is supposed to replace the chief but not anymore because he is interim chief. I am not sure how any of this works.... Last the DPW At this time I am also confused with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 city operations the specifically the department of public works. For the past number of months the department of public works has been under a mandate that the blue recycling bins (the Co-mingled ) would not be collected for the recycling center that any of that product that was left out on the curb side would instead have to be delivered to the landfill instead of the recycling center. As we all know, during this same period of time on blue commingled days for the recycling , two trucks have continually gone out from the city of Scranton one for the regular trash collections and one for the recyclables . I find it absolutely insane that if recyclables are not going to go up to the recycling center and they must go to the landfill that the city would operate dual trucks running the same routes that would collect trash from the streets , and a second recycling truck passing by the same streets , using twice the amount of gas, to deliver the recycled product to the same landfill when one truck could collect it all. The extra truck costs in fuel, and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 maintenance , more wear and tear on the city streets , not even looking at truck staff. A single truck would reduce the cities expense for gas for every single un-needed recycle truck on the blue days, reducing the staff requirements for two weeks out of the month, putting that revenue back in towards the budget or more importantly since the recycling and the trash are part of the trash fee paid by the residents , being fiscally sound in reducing cost for the City of Scranton Thomas Coyne Oak Ave, Scranton P.A. (Marie Schumacher ) O I notice in this morning 's Paper the University of Scranton has bought four more properties . I trust someone from this body will finally attend the Assessment appeals meeting if they seek exemption from property taxes. Will someone please commit to stepping up to this opportunity ? O An unlimited ability to tax is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 really the power to confiscate so I was extremely disappointed when today's Paper report the Supreme Court denied fast tracking the appeal of Judge Gibbons Act 511 decision . Praying the Commonwealth Court will confirm Judge Gibbons decision expeditiously . O Today's paper was the bearer of more bad news with the Administration deciding to kick the LIPS Review down the road. This Department has been a source of contention for many decades ..Some things you just can't afford not to do. While on the subject of things the City can't afford to do I believe we are about 1/3 of the way through the Walkability study, does the Contract provide for any interim reports to the CIty or most we wait for the entire three years. O Speaking of late Contract Reports , when will you provide the date the CIty will receive the HRG Report? O I have recently observed many pave cuts in my neighborhood . In some cases the restoration goes from curb-to-curb; however , in too many places there are haphazard fills with blackktop that sink such that driving feels as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 though you are driving over a washboard . The 100 Block of Seymour Avenue is a prime example ot the latter. (Lots of paint but little action). O Does Council plan to take off the month of August this year? "Please ask the Administration to share what is going on with our Fire Department ." Thank you! (Steven Sabia) Hello, I would like to ask a question of the Scranton City Council . For years I have watched the Scranton City Council and Scranton as a whole allowing Bob Bolus to speak hate speech towards protected individuals , park his semi truck in front of religious sites, and show up at almost every downtown event to incite riots. Recently I saw Bob Bolus park his truck downtown during a BLM demonstration and incite violence and spew hate. I also watched as another business owner from the area (the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 owner of the steam town mall) and his wife tried to run someone over in the shoulder then get out of his car and assault the person. My question is this, why does the city continue to condone the actions of Bob Bolus, and now that Mr. Bolus is getting other business owners to join in this "war" (as he put it), what is the city of Scranton and the Scranton City Council going to do about individuals who continuously break laws and promote hate speech? Also, as nothing has been done about Mr. Bolus' actions yet, does this mean that I as a citizen am able to park my own semi truck on city streets and disrupt council meetings with hate speech and face no repercussions ? I would like to say the actions of SPD that day were swift and appreciated , but must SPD continuously respond to these situations as they continue to get worse with no support from the city? I do not believe that is fair to our Police. Thank you, Steven Sabia (End of Public Comment .) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd like to make a comment on one of the -- one of our public comment s that we got. And I think several people in the public comment posed a lot of good questions this week. But one was in regard to the tax assessment appeals . And I just wanted to say that prior to the City and the states were in the COVID pandemic , the School District and the City were in talks with shared services about, you know, fighting these -- the tax appeals. And I think that's something that's going to be continued once City Hall opens up. So I do think there's a potential for savings and a way for us to hold ground when it comes to tax appeals . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anything else, Councilman Schuster ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, that's all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? Sorry, Mark, you're muted. MR. MCANDREW : I've been approach ed by a few citizens regarding a Hometown Heros Banner Program for Scranton . I also attended the NeighborWorks virtual meeting on June 15th, which was the West Side Pride West Scranton Neighborhood Plan. At that meeting when asked for feedback I made mention of the Hometown Heros Banner Program . Although it's in the preliminary stages -- that plan, they thought it was a pretty good idea. I believe that with everything going on right now in our country and in our City, right now this would be a great time to foster and focus on our City's history and recognize our very own hometown heros, the brave men and women that have fought for our freedoms . I would like to see every part of the City participate along with our local veteran 's organizations . I know there's some, you know, there's some logistics involved for the most part. It wouldn't cost the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 anything because sponsors would pay for it. You know, if I wanted a banner for my father who was a Korean veteran , of course, I would do that. And maybe we would just need some help in bringing together , you know, DPW, fire department to hang these with the bucket trucks or whatever . So with that said, I would like to make a motion right now with the blessing of my colleagues on Council to start the Scranton Hometown Heros Banner Program process to include the formation of a committee . MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion. Is there a second? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll second that. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? On the question , Councilman McAndrew , I think that is a good idea and I would be in favor of that. I know that this is something that was discussed maybe two or three years ago. And at that time the previous administration had met with members of various veteran 's organizations . And at that time they were more focused on the monument down at Scranton High 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 School. But that was two or three years ago. So maybe there would be some interest this time. I think it's definitely something worth exploring . And I think it's a great idea and I appreciate you bringing it up. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion, signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. Anything else, Councilman McAndrew ? MR. MCANDREW : No. Thank you. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do have a few comments . I have been getting a lot of complaints in recently , a few things that I think need to be forwarded to the LIPS Department . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 One of them is actually right near where I live and it's on Harrison Avenue. A man who lives across the street from the problem , he contacted me to let me know that there's an overgrown empty lot. And it's in between Harrison House, which I think is 712 Harrison Avenue and the property of 706 Harrison Avenue. So it's -- there's actually -- so overgrown it's going onto the sidewalks and pedestrians are choosing to cross the street in the middle there rather than at the crosswalk because of the issues on that side of the road. So I think that is definitely a safety hazard and it needs to be taken care of pretty quickly so people can safely use that sidewalk . So Lori -- Miss Reed, if you don't mind sending that correspondence to LIPS. And then the other issue, over the weekend -- I was pretty busy over the weekend . It was the first weekend in a while that I felt more like a Council person getting to be out in the community and so I'm happy for that. I went over to the 900 block of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 Quincy Avenue where the neighbors there have requested me to come and take a look at the issues that they're experiencing . And so about seven or eight of them walked along with me up the street and also onto Costello Court. And there are just numerous issues, too many for me to go over right now. I will write out a list that could be sent over to LIPS. I know not all of them will be -- able to be address ed or at least addressed quickly ; but I think that they need to be aware that these are problems for the neighbors who live there. And someone had approached me today. This is correspond ence that I believe can be sent to DPW. They complained about the street lights were not working on Washington Avenue I think between Coopers where they are and all the way down towards the courthouse . They said it's pretty dark on that street. So if someone could take a look at those lights and then replace -- replace the lights that need to be taken care of. And lastly, I -- this was something that I went over in caucus that I just wanted 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 to go over briefly again. I was involved in a work session earlier today between members of the OECD Department , LIPS and our new BA, Business Administrator Mr. Carl Deeley. And the purpose of the work session was to discuss the issues more specific to the LIPS Department , quality of life tickets and demolition of properties and a lot of areas that there hasn't been a great process for. And they haven't really worked officially on and so we're trying to find -- come up with a good plan that could be initiated pretty quickly to help address those issues. That's something that has been very important to me and I think will help with a lot of these complaint s that we've been receiving from residents . So I'll be able to discuss more of that within the next few weeks. They plan on bringing a proposal to Council . I think their timeline was like between three to four weeks. They know that we're going to be going on a break. So it certainly will be before August. MR. GAUGHAN : Great. Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Just to -- to just follow up on Council Rothchild 's street light complaints . I believe , Miss Reed, do you have a direct line to get those looked at, right? MS. REED: Yes, I do. MR. GAUGHAN : So that was -- what was it, North Washington from Coopers to -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MR. DONAHUE : -- all the way down to Lackawanna . DR. ROTHCHILD : Um hum. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Also, we did talk, you know, in caucus that the recycling -- we still haven't gotten our hands on the recycling contract . So we're going to continue working on that to see what -- we want to first look at the contract to see what our options are moving forward in terms of how we would go about looking for different options for the commingled . In terms of the LIPS review, I would very much like for Mr. Deeley to just come in at some point to explain , you know, what the plan is. I was a little critical of, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 the firm that was selected in the beginning . And I had, you know, cost concerns as well. But at the same time, there was still a -- there was still a contract that was approve d by Council . So I just want to make sure that there is a plan going forward to address the issues in the LIPS Department because really if you fix everything else in the City but don't touch -- in City government and don't touch the LIPS Department , nothing else matters . There's a lot of -- everything that happens flows through there in one way or another . I was surprised to see the Fire Chief resignation . But I would like to wish him the best of luck. And also just to remind the administration while they're conducting their national search, that the Fire Chief's salary is budgeted at $84,900. We also -- late this afternoon we received a condescending response from the administration regarding our -- my questions for the reopening of City Hall, the administration 's plan. All we're simply trying to -- all I'm simply trying to find out is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 what's, you know, as Lackawanna County moves into green what -- how will City Hall be open, what will be accessible to the public, what will not be. And then in terms of the furloughed employees , the Mayor did cite union issues as to not to respond to those. And those were questions just to who was process ing refuse bills, who's conducting health inspections , housing inspections , who's responding to the quality of life complaints and who is overseeing the bidding purchasing process . So I'll be forwarding some more requests onto the administration , such as, how many occupancy permits have been issued since March 13th, how many health inspections have been conducted , how many construction permits have been issued, how many quality of life violations and/or warning s were issued. So I'll be forwarding those along to Mrs. Reed tomorrow to send along to the administration . And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I just have a few things I want to go 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 over. First, I also want to just mention the resignation of our Fire Chief Al Lucas. I just want to say a few things. First, in dealing with people over the last six years in City government , I don't think you could find a more dedicated individual serving the City both as a fireman and then as Fire Chief. Al Lucas in my opinion in the short time that he was Fire Chief did an absolute ly outstanding job. To take a position and then automatically walk into the middle of a pandemic , I thought he led the City's response in a very honorable -- very honorable way. One of the most honest people that I've ever met in City government , one of most hard working people; and always forthright with information and never and does never with me beat around the bush, just got right to the point and told it like it was. So I just want to say that I thought it was unfortunate that he resigned. But I understand based on the reasons that he gave in the newspaper . And I think it would be very hard to find a better 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Fire Chief and a more honest, more hard working Fire Chief than Al Lucas. The second thing I want to mention is just a request that we did send to the Licensing and Inspections Department . In the 500 block of Harrison Avenue, the gentleman that sent the request to me submitted pictures of overgrown grass on the sidewalk and complaints about snakes. One of the things I do want to mention , I think this goes without saying that even though the Licensing and Inspections Department is technically still open, there are I think one or two employees or however many people working there. I think there is only one inspector that's actually working right now. So I do know that once the nice weather hits in the spring and in the summer, Council gets inundated with request s and the Office of Licensing and Inspections gets inundated with requests -- so but I do want to, you know, remind people that if they're not moving as quickly as they usually would, that's because there is only a limited amount of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 employees because of the furloughs . So hopefully that changes when those employees get back in the building and get back to work. Also, I wanted to update everyone on the meeting that I had last week in regards to the issues that had taken place on Third Avenue with truck traffic . I had a meeting with the Mayor, her Chief of Staff, other members of her administration , the DPW Director , Police Chief Graziano and our City Engineer John Pocius. And although I think some people over there would be disappoint ed that we can't reroute truck traffic off of Third Avenue because of the weight restrictions on Elm Street and some other issues that we would have there, we are -- the City is going to research legislation which would ban or prohibit brake retarders so those trucks would have Jake Brakes which is a big issue. Also, Chief Graziano pledged to increase the enforcement of trucks that might be over weight. And there may be some additional things that we might be able to do. So I did speak to the Mayor later this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 afternoon before the Council meeting and she had told me that they are currently working on that and that should be coming down to us relatively soon which I think is a good thing. So the ultimate solution to the problem is the replacement of the Elm Street bridge, which is going to happen, may take two, three, four years. One of the things in speaking with John Pocius, the City Engineer that complicates the matter is it being over the Lackawanna River and just being in the area that it's in always complicates everything . And it takes a lot of work to replace those types of bridges . So that is the ultimate solution to the problem . But in the meantime , there are some fixes that we're going to look at and hopefully pass soon. And finally , I'd like to make a motion at this time that City Council send a letter to United States Mitch McConnell , Chuck Schumer , Bob Casey and Pat Toomey asking for an increase in funding to Scranton due to the COVID-19 pandemic and also to pledge our support for an increase in federal medical assistance percentages that would provide our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 state, Pennsylvania and Scranton much needed federal assistance . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second. On the question ? I just want to say on the question this is something that we had discussed last week when our Business Administrator , Pat Sheridan came in and unfortunately told us I think what we all might have assumed due to the pandemic that we may be in a very precarious position at the end of this year in terms of anywhere between 6 and 10 million dollar deficit . Now, as Mr. Sheridan had mentioned , that may change in July and August when we get -- keep getting updated figures . But it looks at this point like many other cities and boroughs and townships throughout Pennsylvania and throughout the country , we may be in some serious trouble financially because of the COVID-19 pandemic . So the National League of Cities and National Association of Counties , the U.S. Conference of Mayors and some other organization s have circulated a letter that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 they're sending to Mitch McConnell , Senators McConnell and Senator Schumer that I would like City Council to also sign onto. And I'm going to -- in a second I'll read that letter into the record. One of the things that they're calling for is for these Senator s to support an increase in the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages which will also include in that letter that we'll send out as well. The Federal Medical Assistance Percentages are used in determining the amount of federal matching funds for state expenditures for assistance payment s for certain social services and state medical and medical insurance expenditures . This Federal Medical Assistance Percentages support s healthcare program s for seniors , childre n, people with disabilities . And since these program s are not discretionary , the loss of these funds would drain resources to support other program and infrastructure priorities throughout the State of Pennsylvania . So for every dollar that is spent on Medicare in the State of Pennsylvania , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 federal Medical Assistance Percentages also matches that. So we're looking to ask them to support an increase that would really provide Pennsylvania with a few billion dollars and it would definitely have a positive effect on Scranton . I just want to take a second here and read into the record what I would like sent to Senators McConnell and Senator Schumer : We write today to advocate on behalf of states, territories , counties , cities and towns all of which are experiencing historic budget shortfalls as they continue to respond to the pandemic . In less than two weeks, the budget years for 45 states and thousands of local governments will begin. Unlike the federal government , these state and local government s must begin their fiscal years on time and with a balanced budget. If the Senate fails to act immediately to support state and local governments , our nation's recovery from the pandemic induced recession will suffer and millions of American s will needlessly be harmed. Previous federal bills responding to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 COVID-19 provided important support . Many, through well establish ed grant program s, yet none allow for the replacement of billions of lost revenue due to COVID-19. More robust and direct stimulus is needed for state and local governments to both rebuild the economy and maintain essential services in education , healthcare , emergency operations , public safety and more. As we move closer to the end of the budget year, furlough s and job cuts are on the table for many states and localities . These job losses not only affect the provision s of government services but also add to state unemployment . The damage will get far worse without federal assistan ce forcing drastic cuts that will further delay and cancel infrastructure project s as at least 26 states have announced construction delays for transportation projects . The loss of such project s will ripple through states construction industry delaying recovery further . State and local governments also purchase goods and services 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 which add to the nation's output. And in 2019, state and local government 's purchase s account ed for 11 percent of JDP. When these activities slow down, there is an effect of the nation's economy . There is an effect on the nation's economy . Alarmingly , CBO's June letter on its forecast of gross domestic product for 2020 and 2021, found that state and local government 's purchases of goods and services fell by 350 billion dollars making up 9 percent of the total decline in GDP. Nearly 15 million Americans are employed by state and local governments . Teachers , first respond ers and emergency medical service workers are on the front lines of this crisis doing the essential work of the country . Government employment continues to suffer substantial losses with over 1.6 million dollars in state and local government jobs lost since March. Leaders in Washington have expressed support for flexible fiscal aid to states and localities of all sizes. Yet months have gone by and our communities continue to suffer. Americans have a history of standing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 together in time of crisis and must do so now. And that would be the end of the letter. I just want to make one additional comment . As I mentioned last week, if we don't receive substantial funding from the federal government and we end up with a deficit between 6 and 10 million dollars , we don't really have that many choices . We're in the same position as nearly all municipalities , boroughs and townships throughout the State of Pennsylvania and throughout the country . But we really need the support of our leaders and our federal government because we can't now rely even so much on the state because of all the issues they're having. We certainly don't want to end up voting on a budget in November and December where we're -- have a 10 million dollar deficit and we're asked to go back to the taxpayer s and put the burden on them when they've already suffered and been through so much. So that's all I have to say on that. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of the motion signify by saying aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And that is all I have this week. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 38, 2020 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S OFFICE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND NEPA ALLIANCE TO ASSIST THE CITY OF SCRANTON IN PROVIDING CREDIT CHECKS ON APPLICATIONS FOR THE CITY’S SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF PROGRAM . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , I just want to say for both of these grant programs , so far our grant and loan program to my knowledge has been a real success . So I do want to thank Eileen Cipriani , the Director of the Office of Economic and Community Development for coming in rather quickly and putting this together and finding money that was I believe was in a pot since I think the 1990s at some point. Our small businesses throughout the City are obviously suffering . I think moving to the green phase on Friday is a welcome sigh of relief somewhat for these business es that can still remain up and running and will hopefully get back on their feet. This -- these programs , the small business loan program and the grant program , I think will be a great shot in the arm for them to help them get up and running again. And I wish them all the best and all the success . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I hereby declare Item 7-A legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-B. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON RULES - FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 39, 2020 – APPOINTMENT OF CARL DEELEY, 711 NORTH WEBSTER AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA 18510 TO THE POSITION OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATOR EFFECTIVE JUNE 1, 2020. MR. DEELEY WILL BE REPLACING PATRICK J. SHERIDAN . MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7 B. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, on the question , I'd just like to say after being able to review Mr. Deeley's resume and having a few conversations with him, we spoke at length I think about the -- our vision for the City and what we would like to see happen here within the next few years. And I'm really pleased with this appointment . I feel that he'll do a very good job in the position and I'm very impressed by his background and the skills that he has to bring to the position as Business Administrator . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . I too want to welcome Mr. Deeley to the City of Scranton and to the position of Business Administrator . I want to thank Mr. Sheridan for all the work he's done in the last six months. I think he's done a fine job. I think in terms of Mr. Deeley, it is -- in looking at his resume, it is sometimes good to have people who are -- who have a different background and who come from maybe a different perspective . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 Mr. Sheridan had a really interesting comment to me the one day maybe a week and a half ago when I was talking to him. He said in the City of Scranton , maybe the issue in City Hall has been we've been asking the wrong questions . We're looking at a problem the same way for decades and not, you know, stepping outside the box for a minute and looking at it in a different way. So I hope that, you know, this change and with what Mr. Sheridan has been able to do and now with the perspective that Mr. Deeley may bring, that we may be able to ask some different questions and look at things in a different way to try to solve some of the very difficult and complex problem s that face the City. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes.
