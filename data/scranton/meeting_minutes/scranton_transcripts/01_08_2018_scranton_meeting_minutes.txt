This will be the fifth annual polar plunge from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on January 27, at Montage Mountain in Scranton . This group is calling on caring businesses and individuals alike to support this community event. They are seeking gift cards, gift baskets which will be displayed and raffled at the event among a number of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 other things.

Next Monday, January 15, is Martin Luther King Junior Day. Council will not meet due to the holiday . City hall will be closed this day. DPW is also off on the 15th. Refuse and recycling will be one day behind next week. The DPW director notified us that crews will be collecting Christmas trees which are left on the curb until the end of the month. All trees will be recycled. City council will have their next regularly scheduled meeting on Monday, January 22, at 6 p.m. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment : JOAN HODOWANITZ . LAWRENCE SYKES. ALBERT YOUNG. JIM MCCRONE . LENNY SREBRO. RON ELLMAN. GLYNNIS JOHNS. JOHN FOLEY. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 LYNN LABROWSKI . DAVE DOBRZYN . MARIE SCHUMACHER .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, a few comments . The business administrator got in touch with our office and, Ms. Jeffries , you will be happy, he agrees with the idea of using cell towers lease funds to help infuse our much needed street sign project , so that's something that be will going forward in the near future. We don't have the nitty-gritty on it yet on how we are going to do it, but just spit balling it with fellow councilmen it feels like the best course of action being go to the areas of the city that actually need it the most and use the money as we get it from those funds to replace everything . So funding is always the most difficult thing so it seems like at least we do have some infusion of the funds to get that project off the ground and running and then we just have to keep it going. It 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 seems like it's now getting down to the manpower and how we are going to implement it. Very happy with that. Also, there will be -- I believe , Mr. Rogan, I forgot to bring this up in the caucus, you are going to be meeting with the business administrator on refuse. If you could include in your meeting about credit card payments . MR. ROGAN: Absolutely . MR. PERRY: I know that our former BA Bulzoni said that's something that the city felt necessary to move forward to just help increase revenue and he was going to bring that back. I guess it was such an antiquated system to we have to get funds that city hall on the credit card payment plan was just it was going to be difficult to do, but we are a year into it now and that would be something I think would be beneficial for the city. I want to thank on motions and Fifth Order it is, and I just want to thank Mr. and Mrs. Burns. They donated $1,000 to the Scranton Fire Department . For those of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 you not familiar , their son Collin went missing for several hours and was found by the Scranton Police Department after search up in Montage Mountain . It was a very grave situation and he was found, he is safe and just to give their thanks and gratitude , which is absolutely not necessary , the family did donate $1,000 to the Fire Department . We had a letter from Chief Pat Desarno and he intends to use that money for much needed equipment that the Fire Department needs. Finally , oh the census was brought up, there was a question on the census. The census I do believe there is a good and -- there is a good opportunity for a really properly accounted for census to really help the city, especially a city like Scranton and 2020 is going to be an important year. The Census Bureau plans, they are probably in the final stages of getting everything where they need. You can contact the Census Bureau at Census.gov. Our regional office for this area that takes care all of Pennsylvania and most of northeast is in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Philadelphia , and you can contact their office off of that Census.gov page and they are doing hiring, they are always looking for volunteers , and if there was a subcommittee formed by the city to help the Census Bureau I'm all for that because anything we can do to help move that along and get more accurately accounted for the biggest funds count me in. Finally , with that one question about the zoning, the zoning complaints , can we just make contact Mr. Sweeney just to give the council an update on the visit that he had there and see if there is any zoning infractions that are happening , what he found just so we can just get on the same page. If he gives us a call that can be his responsibility , put it in an e-mail or if it's a letter just make sure we are all copied on that and that way we are all on the loop and we can kind of get on the same page and see where we are at with it and we can from there. Do yo guys need these pictures back? AUDIENCE MEMBER: No, you can keep 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 them. MR. PERRY: Well, I'll keep them in our Clerk's Office that way if we need to refer to them again we'll keep them there. And that's all I have today, Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : The only comment I have at this time, Mrs. Reed, would you be able to get me a copy of the Reilly engineering report on the Young's property so I can review that, please? And that's all I have this evening . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Thank you. First of all, I am very sorry to see the Youngs here again. I'm embarrassed , I'm ashamed that it's taken this long, that we are almost back to where we started from. There is no reason in the world that we can't have that meeting that you're requesting and have that meeting soon. So all of us are in concurrence with that, we are going to do everything we can and make that happen. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 think if reasonable people get together we will come to a reasonable solution and we will move on with this project and get it done for you. Again, I'm sorry that you have to be here again after 18 months of all you have done to try to get this to a conclusion , but hopefully we are almost there so I promise I will do my best to get that meeting as soon as we can, and I'll let you know if I hear anything at all between now and next week. Earlier this evening , Council President Rogan signed a proxy that he appointed me as designee to the board that oversees NDC and ABM parking assets. Of course, that's something I have been very interested in since the agreement between the city and NDC was forged. I have appeared at the Scranton Parking Authority meetings to discuss this issue, my concerns and offer suggestions on parking . I met with principals of NDC and ABM on numerous occasions and I have strong opinions on the current rates within the parking garages as well as expanding and creating a better 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 system for on-street parking in the downtown and other areas under NDC's purview . The walkability , vitality and growth of our downtown are very much linked with the progressive parking program , one that works and allows for a positive experience parking on the street as well as in the garages . I'm not only a city councilman , I'm a downtown resident . In one of those apartments that are vacant, by the way, to my knowledge , there is waiting list in almost every single building downtown for apartments just to make that point. But, again, I'm a downtown residents and I'm also a parking garage customer so my perspective is not only unique but also relevant . After a slow start, I've seen progress made by NDC and ABM in the recent months, but the dialogue and conversation have to continue and it will. I would like to formally request , if my colleagues concur, that we ask ABM representatives and NDC representatives to come to a work session to discuss what they have done so far up-to-date and what's in store fro the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 future for the garages as well as on-street parking , so if that's okay we'll send a letter out. I know Councilman Wechsler was initiating that, but I will take another step further out and contact them. MR. ROGAN: If we can add Solicitor Johns as well from the Parking Authority . MS. EVANS: Sure. Absolutely . Not a problem . Another issue, some of you remember my numerous comments quite a few years ago about a NIZ, which is the neighborhood improvement zone, which has completely turned around the Allentown business district . To date because of the designation over $2 billion has been invested or will be invested in the designated areas of downtown Allentown and the Lehigh River corridor . Another version of that is known as a CRIZ, or city revitalization and improvement zone, and Bethlehem has that designation as well, so two cities in the Lehigh Valley have that same designation . Because of the CRIZ designation completion is nearing on a six-story building , a mixed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 use building in downtown Bethlehem called "A Gateway at Greenway Park." It's a $20 million project , 127,000 square feet and it would not have happened without that CRIZ designation . As a reminder , Allentown is one city -- the only city that has a NIZ. Bethlehem and Lancaster currently have the CRIZ designations . The CRIZ was established to spur new growth in cities that have struggled to attract development . Helping to revive downtowns and create jobs for the residents of the area. The CRIZ is an area of 130 acres comprised of parcels designated by an authority to capture state and local taxes for the purpose of improving and development within that zone. Similar to a tax incremental finance or TIF program , it is structured to protect the assisting state and local tax base while providing incremental funding for tax revenues based on the new growth generated over and above and established business baseline and new revenue generated in the zone by new businesses . The CRIZ allows certain state and local taxes generated by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 the business in the zone to be used to be paid debt service , thereby spurring economic development projects into that zone. So where do we stand on CRIZ? Well, I have been talking about this for about three years and as we exit Act 47 any success that will achieved post-Act 47 will be through growth, not maintaining the status quo, so it's important more than ever that we begin to put into place those initiatives that will bring and maintain our growth. So it's my understanding that much of the decision making on this issue lies squarely in the Governor 's Office, so I would like to send a letter to the governor asking him to consider support a CRIZ designation for the City of Scranton . If everyone concurs , or we are able to discuss it I'm glad to, but that's something I think is very, very important . The governor has -- I'm not sure if it's because of the economical climate in Pennsylvania right now he has been slow to expand the CRIZ, but again, we are the poster child for this as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 we exit Act 47. So I'm hoping that he takes a good hard look at this and we can have a dialogue and conversation because it's that important for the City of Scranton as we enter, again, that time that we are going to be exiting Act 47. So that's all I have for tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Councilman Gaughan , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First of all, I just want to say that I disagree with not having a meeting next week and cancelling because of Martin Luther King day and I brought this up in the caucus. You know, I think we should reschedule that meeting . There is lot of holidays that fall on Mondays , and as Mrs. Schumacher correctly pointed out, there is a lot of important issues to discuss even if there is nothing on the agenda. I mean, we are getting sued by everybody and their brother , so I don't think that we should take meetings off because of holidays. You know, we take a few weeks off in August and I think that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 enough. Second thing, I just want to remind everyone that the DPW will be picking Christmas trees up today through the end of the month and they would ask that you do not put the Christmas trees in bags. I also wanted to point out, just before Christmas in a December 16 article , I was kind of just astounded by it, the Scranton Sewer Authority is paying nearly $40,000 to the DeNaples trucking firm for a bulldozer the agency rented last year but failed to return. The Authority , which had no written contract for the rental, it was done by way of verbal agreement , did not transfer the bulldozer rental agreement with N & L Transportation of Dunmore to the buyer of the sewer system Pennsylvania American Water in the December 29 closing of the sewer sale, said authority executive director and Solicitor Jason Shrive. You know, there is a few issues with this. I requested from Mr. Shrive how many other verbal agreements are there currently and in the past? How many handshake 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 agreements , pat on the back agreements are there for $40,000, and if a bulldozer could slip through the cracks what else could slip through the cracks? You know, this is why months ago I sat up here and I was yelling at the top of my lungs in this room and in the room over there where they had the Sewer Authority meetings to bring the Auditor General in to audit the sale of the Sewer Authority . Lo and behold, a few months later a bulldozer , a big bulldozer , somehow falls through the cracks and guess what there is another verbal agreement . We saw a $200,000 -- actually a $400,000 verbal agreement with Ned Abrahamsen , now we see a $40,000 verbal agreement for a bulldozer with N & L Transportation . So I would like to know from Mr. Shrive what other verbal agreements are there and I would like to know that immediately . And I also ask, I have been asking for a number of items, I asked were RFPs issued for all of the mandated work performed by the Sewer Authority between 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 December 2015 and December 2016, and I have been asking for a list of the companies that perform the mandated work assigned by the Authority . I have asked for this November 1, September 15, and I have yet to receive any of that information so we did submit another request . In the caucus I brought up, I'd like to ask the Attorney General for an update on the review or investigation , whatever you want to call it, into the sale of the Sewer Authority . A number of months ago he had written Attorney General Josh Shapiro a letter to the editor in which he said that he was, you know, reviewing it, his office was taking a look at it and investigating it, it's been a few months now so I would like to know is there a timeline, what's going on with that. Also, it's been brought up here the past few months and in tonight 's meeting, but I am extremely concerned over the very real possibility that the city may lose one, if not more, of the lawsuits that have been brought against it and if that happens that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 will all be repeal the chances of the city exiting Act 47 and send us over a fiscal cliff. Act 511, where the Commonwealth Court just rejected the city's appeal, the trash lawsuit , which was just certified as a class action, the Scranton Sewer Authority where the legality of the whole entire deal has been called into question , and I'm not an attorney , but the state law seems to be very clear on the issue. The problem is we have already spent almost all of the proceeds , and rental registration . So apparently we are having an executive session next week with the city solicitor and I'm going to interested to see what the mayor and his administration 's Plan B is on this. My other concern is that we are going, or we already have or we are in process of depositing millions of dollars into the pension funds while we are still engaged in lawsuits by the police unions which could have devastating effects on the funds viability in we should lose these cases. Now, I want to remind everybody what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 these cases involved . The first one is a class action lawsuit brought in 2006 by retired police officers who are seeking recovery of longevity increases to which they contend they were entitled to in addition to their pension payment . If the plaintiff s are successful , there will be a material impact on the pension funds for police and fire firefighters . The city believes and is confident that it will prevail on the merits with respect to this litigation , however , given the size of the class involved and the number of years in question in the event the litigation has decided in a manner adverse to the city, the impact on the pension funds for police and firefighters would be material . So that's number one. Number two, the Fraternal Order of Police has filed a grievance regarding the retirement age required under the police pension fund. The FOP is taking the position that there is no age requirement as a result. If the FOP's position is sustained , the actuarial calculation will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 require a substantial increase in the city's annual pension contribution for the police fund. The grievance has been heard by an arbiter and the city and the FOP are awaiting the arbitration decision. If the matter is decided in a manner adverse to the city, the impact on the police pension fund could be material . So even on top of the other lawsuits that I just mentioned if we lose one of these, and we don't have the best success in court in arbitration , we are throwing all of this money into the pension fund and these two lawsuits could take us right back where we started . So the mayor has said to rely on the lawyers . I said this before, that's one of the scariest statements I have ever heard since I have been on council . We should be having serious conversations about this and what we are going to do in the very likely event we come out on the bottom of one of these suits. The answer cannot be to go back to the taxpayers again and ask them for a bail out. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Just one brief comment following up on what Councilman Evans mentioned , past council president Joe Wechsler did serve on the advisory board for the Parking Authority and Councilman Evans did reach out to me a few weeks ago expressing an interest to serve as my proxy for my position and as a resident of the downtown and a member -- and a patron of the garages , Councilman Evans does have a little more perspective on the condition of the garages than anyone sitting on this board, so I will forward to looking with him in that respect and, you know, I think will work very well on that. So I just wanted to just to follow up on that item. As was mentioned , we are having a meeting , a very large meeting on Friday regarding garbage fee billing and rental registration issues, so there is -- I mean, I'll have a lot more to say on that at next week's meeting and I do appreciate the suggestion Councilman Perry regarding the credit card billing . The city is behind the times when it comes to electronic payments . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 That's definitely something that we need to get caught up on. That is it tonight . Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – ACCEPTING A ONE THOUSAND ($1,000.00) DOLLAR DONATION FROM MR. AND MRS.

MS. EVANS: On the question , I would agree with that. I have known Brain forever , since he was born probably , and the entire Fallon family, they are great people, Joanne and Jack, his parents .

MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question , I agree with both councilmen on that, I spoke with Mr. Fallon this week and he is excited to get to work and this really will free up his time to dedicate it on all the needs that the parks have, which are plenty, including taking care of our tree house that is in need of repair, so he is up for the challenge and definitely the best person for the job.
