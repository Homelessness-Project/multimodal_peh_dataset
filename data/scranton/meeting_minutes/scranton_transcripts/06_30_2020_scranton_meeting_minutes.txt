CORRESPONDENCE SENT TO UNITED STATES SENATORS DATED JUNE 25, 2020 IN SUPPORT OF THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY OMNIBUS EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS ACT. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have one comment and one question . Just in terms of 3-A, the Meadow Brook Flood Protection Project Phase 3, so this is something that's obviously been on the minds of all of Council and certainly of all the people over that area. As of all of you know, we have dealt with and tried to help Mr. Young and other neighbors in that area for the last few years in the flooding problems that they've had. This letter that I received and Council received from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection basically tells us they have selected Riley Associates to design Phase 3 of the Meadow Brook Flood Protection Project . Riley Associates has completed preliminary design of the project and rights of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 way plans have been developed . Within this letter they attached our draft right of way plans as well as the draft sponsorship agreement that the City will be require d to sign for the project to move forward . It states in the letter that after the plans have been reviewed by the City, DEP and Riley would like to schedule a work meeting with City official s to discuss the proposed feature s of the project and any concerns with the alignment prior to finalizing the right of way plans and sponsorship agreement . The only question I had, Kevin, if you could look into this, on the sponsorship agreement on the third page it says, whereas the sponsor by resolution of City Council adopted and then it's blank. And it says, and attached hereto approve the rights of way acquisition drawings for project . I'm assuming that that means that we'll have to vote on legislation approving the agreement , the rights of way acquisition but I wasn't positive . Oh, sorry, you're muted, Kev. ATTY. HAYES: That's correct . You're assumption is correct . But I will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 obtain confirmation on that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And when -- if that is going to occur, Mrs. Reed, if we could ask the City officials if they could brief us on this project on the timeline , you know, how long it's going to take and any other -- anything -- any other things that would be of relevance . We know that this project is really important . And it's important to the people that are there. So that would be really helpful , okay? That's all I have on the Third Order items. Does anyone else have anything on the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. DONAHUE : I have -- I just have one quick, garbage will be picked up on regular schedule this week. DPW doesn't observe the 4th of July holiday until next week so -- until next Monday. So garbage will be a day behind next week but on regular schedule this week. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Kyle. Anyone else have any announcements ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have an announcement . So I just wanted to make sure that the public was aware -- apparently my dog also has an announcement . So for the Small Business Relief Program , applications are open for loans. And loans can come in an amount from $3,000 to $20,000. And this is a great money that we can help small business es in Scranton . So if any small business owners are interest ed in applying , they could go to Scranton Works dot org. And they will find the application there as well as the basic requirements in order to apply. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. Tomorrow , July 1st at Scranton High which is on 63 Munchak Way from 2:30 to 5:30 p.m., the Friends of the Poor, Family to Family and the Weinberger Food Bank, COVID emergency drive through giveaway . All attendees remain in their vehicles like in the past. Food bags will placed directly in their vehicle s. They still need a zip code and numbers of children , adults and elderly in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 their family. I also have another announcement . My beautiful daughter Moriah and her husband Nick will be having a baby boy in December . We're all very excited . You know, living with a bunch of women, it's going to be -- and outnumbered . It's going to be nice to have a little guy around maybe in my corner. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : And I'm sure you'll start the brainwashing for Notre Dame football , correct ? ATTY. HAYES: Young Knute -- Knute Rockne. MR. GAUGHAN : Congratulations , Mark. That's great news. Anyone else have any announcements ? Okay. I have quite a few. A public hearing will be held next Tuesday , July 7th at 5:45 p.m., for Item 5B, which is the transfer of a liquor license . We're also expecting legislation which would amend our Act 47 Exit Plan to extend our stay in Act 47 for 18 months. This legislation must be passed by July 27th for DCED. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 So we're tentative ly expecting that on our agenda for next week. And also along that vein, we would have representative s from PEL come in for a caucus in which we would have them present the legislation and then answer question s that Council may have. City Hall will be closed this Friday, July 3rd in observance of the 4th of July holiday . Councilman Donahue mentioned that next Monday, July 6th the DPW is off for the holiday and refuse pickup will be delayed by one day next week. And also, I mentioned in our caucus tonight that due to the coronavirus pandemic and out of an abundance of caution , July Council meetings will continue to be held via Zoom. Under Governor Wolf's orders, public meetings may continue to run remotely . And I thought it was in the best interest after speaking to all of my colleagues on Council , Lori, and Kevin that it would be in our best interest to continue to remain meeting remotely . I would not want to put any member 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 of the public in any sort of danger, any member of Council or any member of -- any person in our office. So we will be meeting virtually throughout July. The same rules apply as they have for the last few months. So if anyone would like to comment on agenda items or City business , you can always send those comments in writing to our City Clerk Lori Reed by e-mailing Lreed@scrantonpa .gov. You can also mail those to 340 North Washington Avenue to our City Clerk Lori Reed. We'll accept those public comments until the day of our meeting , which is Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. We review public comment prior to the Council meeting . That public comment is placed on the official record and in the minutes of our meetings . Council 's agenda is being posted for public review the Friday before our Tuesday meeting . And Our agenda and all of our minutes can be accessed by going to www.scrantonpa .gov and clicking on the City Council page. And that is all for announcements . Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER.

(Patti Fowler) I would like to know if the fireman , Kyle Armbruster is still off on administrative leave still getting paid and still getting his full compliment of benefits , when we have approximately 40 employees who were furloughed through no fault of their own, and still has no healthcare during a pandemic ? Sincerely awaiting the information , Patti Fowler (Marie Curmaci ) Hello Lori, I hope this e-mail finds you well. My name is Marie Curmaci . I reside at 1105 Saint Ann Street in Scranton , PA.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 I am contacting you regarding the increased , incessant use of illegal fireworks in our neighborhoods . The tragic death of a young man in the Minooka section of Scranton this past Saturday has compelled me to speak out. If our City laws were enforced , this young man may still be alive. I am fearful for my family, neighbors and pets. Thank you Lori. Very much appreciated . Just an update: The South Main Avenue home address is 1104, not 1114. Also the home on East Park address is 1002. They are the residents blowing off the explosives that I sent you a picture of. Again, I thank you, Marie (Joan Hodowanitz ) Please pass the following questions to city council : 1. When will City Council resume public meetings in lieu of virtual meetings ? We are now in the green phase.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 2. Does City Council intend to discontinue virtual and/or public meetings during the month of August? Thank you. Joan Hodowanitz (Fay Franus) Council members Please get me as much information a possible regarding the following situation . I have called on this but got the run a round. I called Don King--he never returned my phone call. The business at the corner of Railroad Avenue and Luzerne Street --the gas station which is no longer in use listed as 344 Railroad Avenue under the name of SMS Petroleum LLC based out of New Jersey. I believe they just walked away from this site-- I also knew prior to them leaving their gas tanks were leaking gas into the ground. Which I never got results as to whether it was contaminating the area all around there. The property now has cars parked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 there all the time--this is a residential neighborhood --it is an eye sore--at night there are much more cars than during the day and people are always hanging around playing loud music --working on cars-right now there is a car there up on blocks being worked on- whether they are working on cars or not--cars should NOT be in that gas station lot. Sometimes as many as 15 cars. I want to know the law on this-- Are cars allowed to be parked there in a residential neighborhood . Also someone needs to address those cars parked in front yards of homes across the street from the gas Station on the 500 block of Luzerne Street--That whole block has cops there multiple times about drugs- I thought if police had to come more than 2 times with drug related incidents the people must move. To say nothing of the blasting music you can hear all the way to my house--Housing inspectors absolutely need to check into every house in the 500 block of Luzerne street on the odd side of the street. It is a disgrace . People screaming all the time-- etc etc. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Ruining the value of our properties on Railroad Avenue. The gas station is on the corner of Luzerne and Railroad but has a Railroad Avenue address . Perhaps since the owners seemed to have just walked away from it--perhaps a bank owns it-- we need to get to the bottom of this. Every single solitary car in that lot must be made to get out. How would you like to live near this and have to deal with this every day. I don't think you would tolerate it--Please do something . They have to be made to get out. Where did they park before? Let them go back! Thank you for any help you can give me on this-- When I called licensing and inspections the girl said they are looking into it-- REALLY? How long does it take to find out if it is legal to have cars parked in that lot in a residential neighborhood ? They need to get on the ball here and start enforcing laws-- There is no reason they should be there-- It is as though they are taking over that whole area. What right do THEY have to do this-- to make this neighborhood 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 look like a slum--which is exactly as it is now -- we need your help here. (Marie Schumacher ) 3A - Does the third whereas plan have to be current ? This begs the question what is the status of the City's request for the MS-4 Permit? How much longer is addressing Stormwater issues going to be ignored ? - - Article 3 Will any changes that effect the City be discussed and agreed with by the owner of the residental property owner if their property is effected . - Article 4 Whaat precisely has the City and/or SAPA done to encourage upstream municipalities to adopt AND implement stormwater management ordinances . - Article 5 - Please provide the list of all required all interests required and disgnate which are completed and who on the City payroll or under contract is responsible for completing . - Article 6 speaks to walls among other items. As the City owns Ryerson Avenue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 is stabilization of this wall included in the Project . - Article 7 is scary to me as a taxpayer . Will insurance be obtained to cover the City should this occur and is this cost in an approved Budget. - Article 9 What amount of funding is included in an approved Budget to comply. - Article 11 Will insurance be obtained to cover the City? - Article 13 Estimate date the Project will be advertised for construction . - Article 15 Will this be a dedicated employee or already employed person. - Article 16 Is this $42,000 funding in the Capital or Operating Budget. -Article 18 Recently a Legal Notice advertising Dunmore Borough Proposed Floodplain Ordinance . Will Scranton do the same and when? (End of Public Comment ) MR. GAUGHAN : Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. SCHUSTER : The only comment I would like to make is to extend my condolences to the Buckley and McAuliffe families . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Councilman Schuster . Councilman McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments at this time? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I do. I would like to echo Mr. Schuster 's statement , my sincere condolence s as well to both Buckley and Mr. McAuliffe and his family. In caucus we -- actually for the past couple of weeks, there's been a ration of e-mails and calls regarding fireworks and ATV issues. So today, I'd like to report that I was on a conference call with the Mayor and Councilman Gaughan . And what's coming up next week in the form of a resolution will be a letter and a lot of cities are doing that I've actually seen today which is great that will repeal House Bill 542, which replaces the fireworks act. So, you know, which is the purchase 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 of "C" class fireworks . So and with that, I think there's going to be a little bit more teeth in it with regards to maybe increasing the fines, you know, at the city level. And with that said, also in between caucus and this meeting , I came upon an e-mail that the Mayor forwarded us from Senator Blake. And what it actually said was, I'm about to vote an amendment to legislation that would have the effect of giving certain cities and other communities the option to pass an ordinance to prohibit the use of consumer fireworks with municipal boundaries . So I hope, you know, at least we're getting some traction here. And also, in addition to that, please note I made mention of this last week but between now and the 4th of July, you know, if fireworks -- illegal fireworks are occurring in your neighborhood or close by, if you can actually identify where they're coming from because I hear them every night. And I'm not sure if they're a block away or two blocks away. But if you are able to witness this happening, you know, in real 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 time you are to call the nonpolice number which is 570-558-8345. Thank you, Councilman Gaughan . That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I'd just like to comment that I look forward to seeing legislation to help tighten up the ordinances around fireworks and ATVs. This is something that I brought up in our caucus last week. I know it's a concern throughout the City. It's a concern for me, my -- one of my dogs, he won't go outside at night because he's afraid of them. And not only is it affecting animals , but it is dangerous for people too as we can clearly see. And I offer my condolences as well to Mr. Buckley 's family. But I really would like to see us have some movement on this and I appreciate the administration taking it seriously . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , do you have any motions or comment s? MR. DONAHUE : The only thing I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 is just to echo the sentiments of my colleagues . My heart breaks for both the Buckley and McAuliffe families . And they will be in my prayers . That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you, Councilman Donahue . I also as I did at the top of the meeting just want to say how sorry I am to the Buckley and McAuliffe families , both tragedies . I knew Corey Buckley personally as I think many of us did growing up in Minooka . His family, really a wonderful , wonderful people and what an absolute tragedy that occurred . So my heart goes out to the family and, you know, I think the community is already coming together . There's a Go Fund Me page if you could look it up on Facebook . And the community is stepping up to help that family out during their time of need. Just a few things I wanted to mention briefly . We received a complaint for the 900 block of Ferdinand Street, quality of life issue. So Mrs. Reed did forward that over to the Licensing and Inspections Department . Councilman Donahue and I had met with Senator Casey's office earlier last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 in regard to the Heros Act and potential funding for cities like Scranton because of the coronavirus pandemic . We also have a call tomorrow -- I received an e-mail late today from Senator Toomey's office. So we will be in contact with them. And I know that we're trying to schedule calls also with the other Council members with Senator Casey and Senator Toomey's office as well. On our agenda tonight we have a resolution that Council and the Mayor had worked on together in terms of asking our legislators in the federal government to step up to the plate and not leave cities like Scranton behind in terms of revenue , in terms of funding for the coronavirus pandemic . And it is very important . It is now the end of June. We're coming into July. It's going to be budget season before you know it. And I really am worried that we're going to be looking at a potential deficit , a very large deficit . And we need to make sure that we don't put that on the backs of our elderly and our hardworking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 people of the City of Scranton . So hopefully our federal legislators will step up to the plate. And I think we'll continue to put pressure on them to do so. As I mentioned at the top of our meeting and I'll mention once again, our July Council meeting s will continue to be held via Zoom just so everyone is aware of that. This is out of an abundance of caution due to the coronavirus pandemic . Obviously it's not the ideal situation . We would all like to be back in Council Chambers . But because they're saying not to congregate with groups of people, sometimes we have a few people at a Council meeting , sometimes the chambers might be packed. I would be very hesitant -- and I spoke to each Council member individually , very hesitant to come back at this time with the way things are going, not only in our area but really around the country . So we want to take the utmost caution there. And we're going to do that. We'll reassess the situation at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 end of our August recess. In the caucus tonight I had asked Attorney Hayes to touch base which he did with the administration on a few things, the response to our question s about the agreement between the City and NRS, an update on Third Avenue and some issues that were going on there, also an update on the paving project. The bids came in. I would like to know when the award will be issued. Also, one of the things that I failed to bring up that I receive d a complaint from one of my neighbors is that Brick Avenue, Mrs. Reed, in North Scranton was just paved. And the neighbor reported to me that it looks like it's being marked to be cut up by one of the utilities . So can you just check with the DPW to see what the situation is there? I believe that was paved with OECD funds just recently . The other things I wanted to mention was, last night -- I think I mentioned a few weeks ago. But during the pandemic , really one of the only things that we've been doing -- my family has been doing is just driving around the City just to get out of the house every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 once in a while. And we happened to drive through Nay Aug Park last night. And I just want to give a shoutout to the members of the Recreation Board led by Bob Gattens who has done an absolutely phenomenal job on that park. I have not seen it look in this good of shape in a while. It looks outstanding . And credit has to be given to the Recreation Board, their leadership. They're doing this on their own time. They don't -- they're unpaid volunteers on this board. And they're really bringing this park alive. And I was so impressed with some of the things that are going on up there. And I also want to give a shoutout to our Parks and Recreation Department who is also helping up there along with all of the other city parks throughout Scranton . So I think even during, you know, this pandemic , they continue to step up and they keep our parks in good shape which is very important . Last thing I wanted to mention was obviously we're now in the green phase in Lackawanna County and most counties throughout 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 the State of Pennsylvania . And I don't want to get on my soapbox here. This is just my own opinion but I feel compelled to just once again say to people that with July 4th coming up, in our normal lives before the pandemic everybody would get together and have parties and all of that. But I would ask once again that you please take caution . We are not even close, not even close to being out of the woods with this pandemic . Someone -- Dr. Fauci was in a Congressional hearing I think the other day. And someone asked him about the second wave of the coronavirus . And he correctly stated that we're not even out of the first wave of the coronavirus . So even though the weather is nice, even though in the Lackawanna County our numbers are down and we're out of all the states in country , we are really doing better than most because of some of the precaution s that our Governor had put in place, that could change rather quickly as we've seen happen in other states in the south and out west.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 So I would ask people to continue to please wear masks. And when you can, continue to social distance . If you don't do that, two to three weeks after July 4th, we can almost guarantee that we're going to be right back where we started . And that's not good for anyone. So all you have to do is just look at what's happening in other states. The other thing I wanted to mention in terms of mental health, I think that this pandemic has obviously taken an unbelievable toll on mental health throughout our community and throughout the country . And I once again, just want to say that if you are struggling with mental health, if you're struggling with food, with really anything , go to www.scrantonpa .gov. There are a number of resources on there for you to help you out. And you could also dial 211 for help as well in terms of social services and all of that. And that is all I have this week. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. 5-B.

GAUGHAN : On the question ? Kevin, I just have one quick question about this that I had marked. In the letter from Tressler Law which is representing the business that's going to attain the license , it says in the first paragraph the minimart would like to sell beer and wine for on-premises consumption and to go as permitted under the PLCB regulation s. And they say I believe the minimart is in a general commercial zone. I don't know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 is that required to have a liquor license to be in a general commercial zone? I don't know -- ATTY. HAYES: I'd have to check our zoning code. But that, I mean, it clearly is located in an -- it's a commercial zone. MR. GAUGHAN : It's right on Wyoming and Mulberry Street. ATTY. HAYES: Correct . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. ATTY. HAYES: So it clearly is within -- I can check to see if that's the requirement under our zoning code. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And the only other comment I would have as I mentioned at the top of the meeting , we will have a public hearing on the liquor license next Tuesday , July 7 at 5:45 p.m. Anyone else on the question ?

On the question , Mrs. Reed, if you could just ask the administration for an update on the walkability study? I can't remember if we ever got anything back on that from the administration . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 So this -- OECD is going to administer this grant including overseeing the consulting services of two organization s. And it looks like they'll -- that want to use Speck and Associates which is current ly conducting the walkability study. They're expected to be -- according to the backup, a leading candidate in the RFP process that the City would use to select a consultant upon the grant award. So if you could just check and see the progress that they made on the walkability study, I'd appreciate it. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : President Gaughan , do you know offhand how much the walkability study costs? MR. GAUGHAN : I can't remember off the top of my head. But I'm sure Mrs. Reed has that available in our office someplace . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , I have that too I think somewhere . I'll find that and see if I could -- I'll get that over to you.

MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : So moved. MR. DONAHUE : So moved.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , just sorry, just, I mean, the meeting or the call myself and Councilman Gaughan had last week with Senator Casey's office, it seemed that Senator Casey was supportive of the Heros Act. So hopefully we'll get the same amount of support from Senator Toomey in our call tomorrow . MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks, Councilman Donahue . I would agree. I just want to reiterate , I would urge everyone to call Senator Toomey's office. I don't have the information right in front of me. But if you Google or go online and look his number up and his office e-mail, I'm sure it is on his website. I think we have to make the point that our federal government has no problem bailing out major corporations . They have no problem bailing out corporations that gross billions of dollars a year. They have no problem bailing out Wall Street. But when it comes time to help 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 municipalities out, when it comes times to help cities out, everyone hesitates . It's not fair to the 85-year-old woman that lives on my block who's paid taxes her entire life, who has worked in the City her entire life and now is going to be looking at a shortfall -- potentially devastating shortfall for the City. And we're going to have to consider putting that on the backs of taxpayer s, which nobody wants to do. So it really is incumbent upon Senator Toomey and our United States Senators to step up to help our resident s, to help our cities and not leave them behind. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MS. REED: SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. No business at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Prior to adjourn ment, one of the things that I forgot to mention that I just -- I know I talked about it in the caucus; but I think it's important I want to mention at the regular meeting is the recycling contract . So just to reiterate , Council did ask Solicitor Hayes to research the recycling contract . The only one that we could find now besides the one from 1989 is from 2002, Resolution NO. 60, between the City and the Lackawanna County Solid Waste Management Authority for the disposal of recyclable materials collected by the City of Scranton . And just my cursory review of this -- and I did talk to Solicitor Hayes about it today and he's going to look into is Article 4, which states: The Authority will accept all recyclable materials delivered by the municipality without change to the municipality regardless of any actual or anticipated financial loss incident to the recyclables by virtue of market condition . Solicitor Hayes, I know that you're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 still reviewing that. But to me it would seem on the face of it that it shouldn 't really matter whether the Recycling Center is taking any sort of loss with regards to market conditions or maybe even the prison labor that they use. Would I be correct in stating that? ATTY. HAYES: That's my interpretation of it as well is that this contract provided the stability even though the market conditions could change, the City wouldn't be affected by those market -- change in market conditions . So obviously we have to get, you know, the current contract . And we're having some challenges because the Law Department is not fully operational at this point in time. But I'll look into it and I'll report back next week. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And I know that I did ask Mrs. Reed today to look in our records where we keep the legislation . And we could not -- or she could not find any other agreement besides this one going back to 2002. And the issue I would be concerned about there would be that this was a 10-year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 agreement which really should have been up in June of 2012. The other thing, Mrs. Reed, that I would like to ask is in Article 5, it states that the City should have received a profit and loss statement . Any and all profit will be distributed to the participation municipalities in percentage shares equal to the municipality 's percentage contribution to the gross quantity of materials processed by the facility . And that was within 60 days after the close of each operational year. So would you be able to go back and look and see if we have anything in our files in Council 's office to see if we received any sort of profit and loss statement each year from the Recycling Center? MS. REED: I will, yes. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And I know we'll look forward to Solicitor Hayes' analysis of that contract . And I appreciate you looking into it, Solicitor Hayes. Anybody else before we adjourn the meeting ? MR. MCANDREW : I'd just like to wish 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 everybody a safe and Happy of 4th of July. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, as well. MR. SCHUSTER : To add onto the discussion about the recycling contract , can we also find out what the percentage of prison labor is over there or what the breakdown is of workers ? ATTY. HAYES: Right now I thought the program was suspended . MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, the program is suspended . MR. SCHUSTER : Because of the current circumstances . MR. GAUGHAN : Because of the pandemic . ATTY. HAYES: Are you talking about -- MR. SCHUSTER : I'm talking about usual operations . ATTY. HAYES: -- prior to the pandemic . Is that your question , Tom, prior to the pandemic what was the percentage of the workforce that was comprised of inmates ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : And, Mrs. Reed, can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 you get in contact with Brian Jeffers , the County's Chief of Staff and see if we can get a copy of the agreement between the county and the Recycling Center? MR. REED: Yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Okay, if there's no further business , I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : Motion to adjourn . MR. GAUGHAN : Meeting 's adjourned . Thanks, everyone . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
