MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yes, I have a couple of comments . Thank you very much. First of all, I want to thank Jack for coming in to talk about the Albright Library. I can't wait to get in there to see the renovations . It's been overstated , but I don't think it would be overstated enough how much of a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 treasure in the community the Albright is and, you know, some with the new age -- the new millenials coming up, the age, let's not forget about the beauty of a book and what it actually does mean to sit down and enjoy a book in a non-distracted way without seeing messages pop up and being distracted three other ways, it's just a very mind clearing thing to enjoy a book. I know Mrs. Hodowanitz you carry the water for the library an awful lot and we thank you, and like Mrs. Schumacher my card has also expired , long expired , probably a lot longer than yours, but I'll make that commitment that when I'm here next week I will have my new library card and be putting it to use for sure and I can't wait to go see it. 125 years, very nice and I hope there is 125 years more to come from the Albright . Mr. Spindler , nine out of ten times we fall on the same side of an issue. With the dangerous dog legislation , and I know I have said it before but you speak on it an awful lot and I owe you, you know, a direct 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 opinion to it and I'm just not on the side of a dangerous dog legislation . If there was a legislation for harsher penalties for unfit or abusive owners that would create a situation , I would be 100 percent for it. I would back it in a second, but just to segregate out one certain breed I just can't get behind on right now. You know, I hope you will let me off the hook on that, but you do make another point about the -- and it comes up from time to time about the nonprofits , so if you promise to let me off the hook on the dangerous dog legislation I promise that I'm going to start making some extra phone calls and I'll follow-up and I'll have some answers to you on what can be done through the state side on getting some more involvement from nonprofits in the city, all right? Promise deal? What else do we have to get into? Last week -- or actually two weeks ago we had a speaker from the Hill talk about some of the roads on Ash and Clay and they are being dug up and the water company so we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 have a commitment from the water and the gas company that they are going to do some temp fills, they may have already started the temp fills on that street. Not yet, Mrs. Jefferies ? We'll get that out soon and as soon as I get that I'll update it on when they start that and they are committing to do a full repave on that soon, a soon as the plants start opening and they get done, but they are well aware of the issue and I'll keep you guys abreast on that, and that's all I have right now. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Mr. Donahue , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I would just like to briefly comment on the meeting between county commissioners last week regarding reassessment . It's my opinion that the city was blind sided with what can best described as a circus. For one, city officials were not aware it was going to be a public meeting until 20 minutes before the meeting began. Personally , if I was informed of the meeting I would have made 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 sure I would have been there. The meeting really only produced an opportunity for the majority county commissioners to once again spew their false narrative that reassessment will force people from their homes. That is simply not true. Reassessment is necessary to modernize our current tax structure , to make it fair and equitable according to current property values. When people say that Scranton is 20 years behind the times this is the perfect example of that except we are 50 years behind the times. In order to build a foundation for a 21st century economy , we must be willing to change with the times. That requires leadership . The only reason reassessment is still an issue is lack of leadership . True leadership requires courage and intellect to make tough decisions that are in the best interest of all citizens . Unfortunately , we are severely lacking in true leadership at the moment. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, do you have any motions or comments . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. EVANS: Yes, I do. Thank you. First of all, I took a tour this morning of the restored and refurbished Scranton Public Library so I would like to thank Jack Finnerty , the library 's director , and Joan Hodowanitz for acting as my tour guides this morning , taking the time out of their schedules to give me a very comprehensive look at all the work that was done at the library . You know, to say our library is a jewel would be an understatement . I'd like to talk briefly about the meeting held with the county commissioners and their staff on the subject of reassessment last Tuesday . First of all, I'd like to thank the county commissioners for the invitation . The City of Scranton currently has a very good working relationship with the county, but with that said, this issue is not going away and we are going to have make some very difficult decisions in the very near future. I'd like to discuss first some takeaways that I have on the meeting . First of all, the inclusion of Mr. Ted Wompol, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 city administrator for the City of Wilkes-Barre was a last minute surprise to the entire sitting contingent . While Mr. Wompol was very cordial , and I'm sure very good at what he does for Wilkes-Barre I found his inclusion at the meeting a distraction as to what we were really trying to accomplish which was to have an honest, face-to-face discussion and conversation with three county commissioners on the subject of reassessment so I found the whole situation unnecessary , and in my opinion a bit of a misdirection played by the county so that's all say about that particular issue. When I asked the two county commissioners -- two of the county commissioners under what circumstances , if any, would they do a reassessment , I never received an answer. I was just looking for a framework to continue the conversation . I was just looking for an opening or some hope that we could find some common ground. So it was extremely disappointing that we got instead were more sound bites about hurting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 senior citizens and people losing their homes a narrative that has no basis in fact or reality but certainly can make for good political talking points. Of course, this is a long used narrative that has been part of the no reassessment playbook from the beginning of time. So also during the meeting we were reminded about the results of the ballot question . Again, a question ruled invalid by the Courts, written to fail and supported by a truncated effort to educate the public. It was even suggested at the meeting that we should wait for a state solution to the problem . I would also say this, we have been waiting nearly 50 years for the county to reassess and even longer for the state to fix the system so for me that is completely a nonstarter . Quite honestly, I'm not sure where we are right now with the process . I do know that I, as a councilman , certainly does not want to enter into a lawsuit with another governing body. That's the last thing any of us want, but we have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers and our property owners to ensure that there is fairness and tax equity in the system that determines their property assessment and ultimately their tax bill. That does not exist today in any shape or any form. The commissioners share that fiduciary responsibility , even more so since they are the ones that are charged with the ultimate task to maintain tax equity. I know once we get on the path of a lawsuit there is no turning back, that relationships built over the years will be strained and intergovernmental cooperation could become more difficult , but do we really have a choice? In many ways we have hit the wall with this issue and it's extremely frustrating . I would like to give a simple analogy of where I think we are right now. When you are trying to convince someone who truly believes the earth is flat you can provide all of the documentation , all of the proof, all of the data that you have access to and at the end of the day you will never, ever convince them that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 earth is round. That's where we are at right now in our conversation with the county on reassessment and it's a sad state of affairs . So, finally , I would ask the leaders of every school district , every Borough , every township and every city in Lackawanna County this simple question , if the City of Scranton decides to file a lawsuit against Lackawanna County to force a countywide reassessment will you join us? To those individuals you can reach me at Wayne.Evans19@Verizon .net if you would like to discuss this further . It's time to get off the sidelines and get in the game. That's all I have for now. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans, very well said. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. Just to answer Mrs. Hodowanitz 's question about the Arcadis study on storm water, Mrs. Reed met with the city solicitor who is the point person for this project . The Arcadis group was in city hall recently and met with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 city solicitor , the city planner , DPW director and the city engineer . After that meeting , the city solicitor followed up with labor costs and our city planner provided the company with mileage of MS-4 piping and inlets, which would be the storm grates throughout the city. Mr. King has worked with the county on their aerial photos which determine MS-4 and impervious surface s. According to the city solicitor , Arcadis should have everything they need at this point so the status is we are waiting on that draft report. In addition to that, the city has been approved for a Chesapeake Bay grant in the amount of $25,000 with a city match of $25,000. The city solicitor is going to follow-up with Arcadis in two weeks and she stressed that they have everything they need for a preliminary report, so the city at this point from what I understand does not need to give any more information , Arcadis has everything they need and now it's about issuing a report. The report, from what the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 solicitor has reported , should contain the information as to what to form, an authority , a private entity with city labor, another city department , so that's going to be the crux of the studies . What are we creating to deal with the storm water issue. So I hope that answers the question and then we'll look forward to the report. And to answer your other question , I hope that once the report is issued, we can ask Arcadis to come in and present that to the public and the city council . The second thing that I had in my notes, as Ms. Hodowanitz actually mentioned this in her comments , was regarding the controller 's report for February . As I was going through it, I had marked down the $377,00 to Needle, Goldenziel , Pasquale and Consagra , P.C., and $105,00 to Fabcore , Incorported . So, Mrs. Reed, if we could find out from the I don't know if it would be the Law Department or the business administrator a little bit of a clarification on that if we are talking about court awards or lawsuits . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 We did get an update from the city engineer , he is coming in I believe April 9 to give council an update on bridge projects throughout the city, specifically , the West Lackawanna Avenue bridge. I believe it was Mrs. Schumacher or Ms. Hodowanitz mention ed the credit rating. I, too, would like to know if the credit rating -- the city's credit rating has been effected at all by the lawsuits if we could find that out I'd appreciate it. And the last comment that I have, last week it was reported that Mr. Casciano , the former business administrator , took a position in the Office of Economic and Community Development so Tuesday of last week I had asked to send an e-mail to the mayor's office asking for the salary of that position , the job title and a job description . I received a reply last Friday that they were going to forward my request up to the Humane Resource s Department and then I got a response today from the Human Resource s Department that this issue was discussed at a PEL meeting and I still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 didn't get the answer. So I would like to know, again, and I'm not sure why this is some kind of big secret what is the salary for Mr. Casciano and his new position ? What is the job title? What is the job description ? We have heard from the mayor that he will be working on -- be the point person for Scranton Tomorrow and some other things to be more efficient , I just want to make sure that if we are combining positions and we are combining salaries that we are not circumventing the budgetary process and if that is the case I would like to know if that is, in fact, the right way to do it. And that is all I have this week. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Just to follow-up on a couple of items that my colleagues brought up and I will say on the reassessment issues my colleagues really hit the nail on the head. I was part of a meeting last week that was well-reported , and as was mentioned by Councilman Donahue , going into the meeting myself, Councilman 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Evans and the administration had no clue that this was an open meeting where more than two council members would have been able to attend the meeting . Furthermore , council was under the impression that there would be a slew of media at the meeting , which is fine, but some advance notice would have been appreciated . Furthermore , the presence of the Wilkes-Barre city administrator being at this meeting to really talk on why they did not favor reassessment in Wilkes-Barre really was a grand distraction from what we were trying to accomplish and what the commissioners were trying to do as far as pushing their agenda. One of the county commissioners didn't even know that this gentlemen was invited to the meeting . That was the first question asked at the meeting was who invited him? Not that I object to other people being at the meeting but the meeting , as we understood it, was supposed to be between city officials and county officials , not officials from Luzerne 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 County. Regarding the reassessment , like I said, my colleagues really did hit the nail on the head, but there is one real world example I just want to give. For those of who don't know I do work in real estate and I had a closing today of a home in Scranton that, fortunately , sold very, very quickly and the total tax bill between city, county and school for this property was $859.02 total, so if you look at your tax bill and see what you are paying now, again, it is a small home so i don't want to misrepresent , it is a two-bedroom home, smaller home, their city total on this property , total taxes $315.45. So I would ask do you think it's fair that there is somebody out there paying $315 in total taxes, city taxes? Look at your tax bill and see what you are paying. I would guarantee that 99 percent of you out there are paying more than that amount. This is the inequity that we talk about. And the cost for the city to provide police protection and fire protection to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 that home is practically the same as it is to every other home in the city, and our system is based on property values, it is a lower valued property so even after reassessment this person's taxes will remain lower than average , but that there are homes with taxes this low, three blocks -- and this home sold in three days, by the way. Two blocks down the street there is another home that's for sale, literally three blocks down the street, same neighborhood , the total tax bill for this home is over $3,400 a year so almost four times what the other property is paying. So you can see where there is an inequity . Now, again, the other home is a little bit larger, it's a little bit newer, but they are practically in the same neighbor hoods, very similar homes. So, obviously , the person paying $3,400 is paying too much in tax when a neighbor a couple of blocks away is paying less than $900 a year between all three taxing bodies. When we talk about fairness and the inequities in the tax system this is what we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 are talking about. Unfortunately , some of the county commissioners , one commissioner in particular keeps using scare tactics to get people to believe that people are going to lose their homes because of a reassessment and, you know, continue s to go on about that, but there is not fairness. Fifty years ago when this home was assessed , it was probably assessed properly , but through the last 50 years you could even look through our neighborhoods and see how much some neighborhoods have gotten dramatically better, some neighbor hoods have gotten worse and that is not reflected in our current tax system. I'd like to reiterate Councilman Evans call to other school districts in Lackawanna County and other municipalities in Lackawanna County to contract us and if push does come to shove and the commissioners refuse to consider reassessment and basically stonewall the city, legal action is the only recourse . So at that point in time if a follow-up meeting occurs and we determine a reassessment isn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 going to happen through these meetings , council and the mayor have one decision to make. It's whether to let the status quo remain and not have a reassessment or to bring legal action. Personally , I think we should bring legal action. Council -- the previous council took a vote and it was a 4-1 vote to proceed in that manner. That's something that it may come to, but if does I know for myself I would much prefer for it to be Scranton and a number of other municipalities filing that suit instead of Scranton on a stand alone basis. Because even at our meeting one of the county solicitors tried to, you know, say that the issues regarding reassessment are unique to Scranton because of higher taxes, but the lack of new construction is prevalent throughout Lackawanna County. Even in some of the areas where homes are selling very, very quickly because of the lack of reassessment new homes are not being built and that's a problem . We do need growth within our county and within our city to help grow our tax base. So, again, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 I'd like to urge all of those other officials to reach out to any number of us, call our office, call the mayor's office if you would like to be a part of a potential lawsuit . We hope it doesn't come to that, but if it does we are preparing to take those steps. And I know one of our speakers did ask about the reassessment so I think that pretty much answers the question , it is not being put on the back burner. It's something that is still very active in my mind and with all of our council members . That is all. MS. REED: 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AMENDING FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 12, 1996, (AS AMENDED ), ENTITLED “THE CITY OF SCRANTON SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE ” (SALDO), TO AMEND THE APPROVAL PROCESS FOR LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS , ANNEXATIONS AND MINOR REVISIONS OF APPROVED PLANS. MR. ROGAN: At this time, I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MS. PERRY: So moved. MR. EVANS: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I just want to read a portion of a letter that was sent as backup to this legislation from our city planner kind of explaining what this legislation is all about. According to Mr. King, our city planner , this amendment would allow for staff approval of certain minor subdivision plans instead of approval by the city planning commission . This amendment would only apply to lot line adjustment s as defined in the subdivision and land development ordinance . A lot line adjustment is the movement of property line without the creation of any new lots, for example , the transfer of a small portion of property to your neighbor . The planning commission has been tasked with handling a great deal of these in the last few years requiring applicants to wait for monthly commissioners some undue delays in these minor matters . In my experience , the commission has never received any comments , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 questions or concerning from the public regarding these types of subdivisions . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question . MR. EVANS: On the question , as a former planning commission member I totally agree with Mr. King's thought process in this because it is almost silly to have a full board of the planning commission meet if the only thing on the agenda sometimes would be minor lot line adjustments that could be taken care of administratively within his office. So this is a great idea. It makes for effective government and it streamlines the process and saves time for the applicant as well so I fully support this. MR.
