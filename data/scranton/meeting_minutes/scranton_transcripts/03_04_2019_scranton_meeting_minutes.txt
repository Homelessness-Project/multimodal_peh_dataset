Working with countryside conservancy on our next door watershed to Tunkhannock , and working with community groups and neighborhood associations up and down our watershed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 We still have a lot more work to do. I invite you all to continue working with us. We are going to be back talking storm water in a couple of weeks and we are really excited about the progress that Scranton is making in assessing what the best methods are going to be to manage our storm water situation going forward and we are looking and we are very hopeful that we can start to share that progress with some of the other municipal ities in the community , so there is a lot on the agenda. I'm getting courage to retire because I have kids and grand kids out in California that I don't get to see often enough, but we are going to stick around and continue to do as much work as we can and we recently -- LRCA has recently acquired by charitable gift the former First Christian Church up on North Main Avenue at 2043 North Main Avenue so I invite all to come and drop by and give us a visit. We are hopeful ly going to turn the church into a state of the art environmental and conservation learning center and start to have programs and activities there and our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 offices are located in the rectory at 2043 North Main.

It starts 7 a.m. on Monday, which we are in the midst of right now, and it's going to end 9 a.m. on Friday, March 8, so it's a quite lengthy one. A Code Blue alert is issued with forecasted temperatures in Lackawanna County expected to reach 20 degrees Farenheit or lower. The goal of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 this notification is to make people aware of the extremely cold conditions and provide information related to health and wellness in cold weather and publicize locations of the emergency homeless shelters .

The hours there are 7:30 p.m. to 8 a.m. And the Community Intervention Center, 445 North Sixth Avenue, Scranton . Hours 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. I also have one more announcement , this one comes from my old alma matter, Lackawanna College . Lackawanna College student run restaurant is opening to the public. Reservations are required . It's name the 409 on Adams. The restaurant is located on the first floor of the new culinary center on 409 Adams Avenue, aptly named. Students who work there will learn all aspects of the restaurant kitchen enabling them to be job market ready when they graduate . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 This student run restaurant is the first of a kind in our community .

PERRY: A couple of comments . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 A passionate meeting tonight , I liked hearing from everybody . This is really the true spirit of what a city council meeting should be, I believe . It's dual parts. It's one part public participation , which drives a lot of the meeting and then it's also our fifth, sixth and seventh motions . To get back to a couple of earlier things, it seemed like a meeting ago, Mrs. Jefferies , I believe you spoke about that little spot on our website where we can kind of put ongoing projects and up-to-date projects , I know even like the Novembrino project I get asked on a regular basis where are we on this, and a lot of times, and not just with governmental projects , but with business projects , private sector projects , things start, stop, when they weren't really supposed to, but in the private sector we seem to do a better job communicating that than we do in the governmental sector, so I think we can also do a better job in that. Sometimes I'm sending out e-mails and having Lori chase down some leads for me on why the construction stopped when we were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 giving out dates, and once we give out those dates, you know, those are our dates now. Now I own that date, so I feel the need to live up to that and I have to go back and find -- so I think that's a good idea and that's a lesson I learned probably a year into council , I have a big binder. I'd bring it to council but it got too big with different projects and different things that people would bring up. You know, remember six months ago when we started this? Where are with that? And a lot of times we move onto different projects and different things, it's not that things get put in the back burner, we just put more effort into what's currently on our agenda and if we don't get the follow up that we were supposed to sometimes it gets lost in the sauce then we have to go back on it, so I think that's a good idea that we can get it going and get that trying to hook it up on the website . The bigger issue -- one of the bigger issues tonight was Chief Graziano and D.A. Powell coming in. I was very happy to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 hear that they wanted to come in, that they wanted -- we got them out here, which I thought was a good idea. It's unfortunate that ECTV was having some technical problems so I honestly don't know what is going to be televised and what's not going to be televised . You know, I hope for our residents that it's all televised , but we'll have to wait and see. But I want to start the question of the decriminalization process because I am not the all knower. That's what -- I know that I don't know everything , so I like to get answers from a lot of different parts so that's why we had the judicial system in and we had the law enforcement sector in and, you know, this conversation just started , it didn't end. I know the state is doing their thing and it seems like the federal government is actually moving the slowest on this, but I like the fact that the state is now full steam ahead with their medical marijuana , which I'm 100 percent for, I have spoke on that many times. I have seen it work firsthand , and I've see when it wasn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 available and I've seen my father fall into a bad state because he had to depend on opioids instead of having that other option so I have lived both sides of the tale and I'm very happy to talk in favor of that. So, again, this is just a start, this isn't the end of that. We'll be sourcing out for mor information and keep the communication open and keep that dialogue moving and get us to where we think we need to be as a city, county, state. Now, let's talk a little bit about the Keystone Mission house. This is something that I believe Mr. Rogan brought to our attention the middle of December of last year. Obviously , for these residents it's been going on a heck of a lot longer. We have known about it since December and that day we sent correspondence out to two different sets of entities . We sent one out to Licensing , Inspections and Permits to see if everything was up-to-date on the Mission 's house and the other correspondence was sent out to the Scranton Police Department to make sure there is no illegal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 activity happening there and if there is please take it out, it should not be there. I've been kept up-to-date with Chief Graziano , I still have all the reports he sends me on a monthly basis on incidents that happen in an around that area, sometimes it's just a stop sign violation , but if it happens within that vicinity he updates us on what's going on. That has really tailed off. It's not the 120 incidences as it used to be, it's a lot less. Now, there's two sides to that. What does that mean? Does that mean that the criminal activity has really stopped or does that mean that, unfortunately , people in that area have come so complacent , so frustrated that maybe they are not reporting it as they used to or things become common ground. There's that guy again. Maybe he was caught and released on a misdemeanor and now he is back because , you know, what else does he have to lose? He doesn't have to lose. So if you are going to arrest somebody on a $30 fine, give him that fine, release him, he has to go back to that same 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 place if he has no place else to go. Is he going to pay that fine? Probably not. But is he going to continue that type of behavior ? Probably . So I think that's the cycle that they are stuck into right now. Now, the other question that we asked about the licensing department we never got an answer from. We have sent out numerous letters to the director , Pat Hinton, and we haven't gotten back to see what is the status of that mission house. Are they operating to the laws and regulations that they should be because , you know, on paper the mission house should serve the community . It should give benefits to the community . It gives people with nothing else, no other options , no place to go a place to go because they are part of our community and they do deserve the warmth that we have to offer them when we could, but they have to operate within the guidelines of the city and they have to be good for their community and they have to be a good neighbor . Right now just hearing all the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 testimony and all of the comments from the speakers today for almost 45 minutes , you know, it's hard for me to believe they are being a good neighbor . It's hard for me to believe that that mission house is putting more benefit into that community than it's actually taking out and that's kind of where I feel right now. So I can't wait to get down there and meet with those neighbors and meet with the management of the mission house to see what is actually going on there because it seems awful one-sided to me. Now, speaking to the chief there is the long-term solution , which is the relocation and the rezoning of that area. They'll move and it will be rezoned , it will not be able to be used for that type of property again. Short-term solution , and I know it's difficult , but it's to report any illegal activity to the police and it's to report any quality of life issue to the quality of life officers because it sounds like there is a lot going on, but right now knowing what I know from the police reports from the last year or so and hearing the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 testimony I think, and this is from my mind, I think the city should move to close down the Keystone Mission House. I think the steps need to start, I think that process needs to start, I don't think they are good for our community not the way they are operating right now. I wouldn't want that problem moved somewhere else, across the street, down the road. I think they are running this very poorly and it's affecting that neighborhood for sure and that's my stance on it. I don't want to speak for anybody else on this council , we all have our opinions on it, but I think the city should start the process of closing that down, it doesn't seem like it's a good fit where it is right now and the management team there definitely doesn't seem like it should be doing what it should be doing. So I'm going to leave it right there, Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just to touch on the Keystone Mission . Like Mr. Perry said, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 I don't believe it's something that, you know, necessarily the police chief I think they are doing what they need to do down there. I think it's a licensing and inspection problem and it comes from the fact that there is no proactive leadership out of that department because now we are getting into the time of year where we start getting calls everyday with the licensing -- with problems with the licensing and inspections department , so moving forward to sort of fix the problem myself and Mr. Evans set down the members of the administration last year and we are going to be putting out a -- he said he is going to be putting out an RFQ for someone to come in and do a full-blown analysis of the operations of that office. Meaning they will come in, they'll put somebody in the office every day to see what every person in that office does to make sure they are being as effective with their time as the possibly can. So until that happens , I mean, I don't know -- and we can't go up and just make them do their jobs up there, and I'm not saying that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 there is bad people that work in that office it's just a lack of leadership , and that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: Just a couple of brief comments . First of all, I'd like to thank D.A. Powell and Chief Graziano for coming in tonight to talk about three important topics, homelessness , decriminalization of marijuana and the opioid crises. The homeless problem is happening all over the country but that does not excuse us from allowing that situation to continue , but I will applaud the residents for showing the passion and caring they have for their neighborhood and that tells us a lot about the citizens of Scranton and how they feel about their homes and their neighborhoods and their blocks so hopefully we will do our very, very best to try to help them solve that problem . Again, as was mentioned earlier , the long-term solution is to move them, rezone the area so it doesn't happen again, but we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 really have to do right by them now as best we can. And as far as D.A. Powell and Chief Graziano , it's important -- I think those meetings that we had tonight are very, very important , not only for the public, but for us to have that dialogue with the law enforcement officials of the city and county. The decriminalization of marijuana is something I think that we all have shown interest in. Not necessary for or against , but trying to find out what the right course of action is. Clearly , our local law enforcement officials feel the answer is on the state level so we are going to take our cues from them and I think we should press, as was stated tonight , press our state officials to move this forward in whatever manner is appropriate but they have to take some sort of action and bring to a head. Too many people are being hurt on both sides of this issue so hopefully that can be resolved . The opioid we have all been impacted by it by either family members or somebody we know or a friend. I'm not sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 what the answer is, I don't think anybody does, but we have to do everything we can to bring awareness to help, to console , to litigate , to have people have arrested for these type of issues when they cause a death, it is just -- it's a national tragedy and epidemic and it's something we have absolutely have to get our hands on. On a brighter note, last Friday was March 1, St. David's Day honoring the patron saint of Wales to all my Welsh family and friends as well to everyone else viewing that has a Welsh dissent , cymru am byth, which means Wales Forever , and that's all I have for tonight . MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. I don't know how I missed this, but in early February we received and e-mail or was copied on an e-mail from Mr. Bulzoni about his recommendation to renew the contract with Joyce Hatala, the recycling consultant that we've had for the past few years, so he did attach a memorandum for that. I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 know for sure if we are going to vote on this because the cost of her services and her proposal is $10,000 for 18 months, but regardless of that, if we could ask Mrs. Hatala to come in and give us an update on the progress that's been made over the first few months of her contract , if everybody would be okay with that in the next few weeks I would appreciate that. Also, Mrs. Reed, if you could get in touch with Mr. Gallagher and just get an update on the sign project that was brought up tonight I would appreciate that. Also, as I mentioned last week, Mrs. Reed and I have a meeting with the University of Scranton with the internship program that we are trying to get off the ground so I'll report on that next week. I'd also like to thank the DPW, there was a family that -- actually the neighbors have been complaining about a light that's been out on the 1200 block of Blair Avenue and the DPW did fix that so I want to thank them. And just to touch on the Keystone 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 Mission on Olive Street, you know, I saw the video clip that the one gentleman provided , saw all of the police reports and all of the pictures , to say that it's unacceptable is an understatement and after listening to everybody , I have been down there, I run on the trail, I have been to Mr. O'Boyle's house quite a few times for different issues there is only one -- I think there is only one solution and that's to either condemn the place, shut it down or have them move out. I don't think the city should be worried about helping them move out of the area and the reason I don't think that is because it's obvious that the people that are associated with this place have no respect for the city and they have no respect for the residents who have lived there for generations . After sitting here for 45 minutes to an hour and listening to all the neighbors , it's clear that this is a recurring problem year in and year out and, you know, we condemn houses in the city for far less than people defecating in the neighborhood , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 urinating the neighborhood , doing drugs in the neighborhood , so on and so forth. So I think that the Keystone Mission has lost the opportunity to have the respect of city officials in the city and so I think there is only one solution , condemn the place, find a way to condemn it and get them out of that neighborhood because they are quite literally ruining people's lives, especially the elderly that have lived there for their whole entire lives. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Very briefly regarding the Keystone Mission , I guess we'll start there, I know Councilman Perry suggested shutting it down. It seems that Councilman Gaughan agrees as well. I'm not so sure if I would go quite that far yet, but I understand where my colleagues are coming from. As I mentioned during the caucus, which unfortunately some people may not have heard, there is a need for social services . I'm more a proponent of helping people help themselves . You know, you give them a hand up and not a hand out, but I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 think that, you know, something has to be done as far as relocation goes. I want to thank the District Attorney and our police chief for coming in to speak about those issues. And, again, there is much more that is going to come from this. I know we are sending out some correspondence as well to look into zoning, to look into some other items, but I want to thank them, thank my colleagues for all their hard work. I know Councilman Perry has been in touch with the police chief a lot about this issue and it's -- what we saw tonight was what we have been getting for awhile from all of the residents . You know, I know we have all talked to them, it just seems tonight everything kind of came to a head, so it is something we have been working on as a council , but tonight it certainly got a lot more attention than it has in weeks past. Again, we had the District Attorney and the chief in also about decriminalization of marijuana . One thing I do want to and I don't know because the audio system wasn't working , the comment was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 made regarding selective enforcement or something of that nature. The chief's comment was if we do decriminalize at that point the officers it would e at their discretion to choose whether the are going to follow state law, which has not decriminalized or city law which has, so that's the conflict that he was speaking about was if we do go in that direction . Currently the city law and state law are in sync regarding that issue. I agree with the position of our police chief and our district attorney . I am a staunch support of medical marijuana . I think there is a lot of value, it could help a lot of people. Recreational marijuana I do not support , but if the state or federal government were to change that, obviously , we would have to comply with the state or the federal laws, so I do want to thank -- really thank our district attorney and our police chief again for coming in and I did mention this during the meeting , but I want to mention it publically , I also want to thank District Attorney Powell for his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 action regarding Rocky's bar. I know this has been reported quite a bit in the media but this was a nuisance bar where there was multiple shootings it seems, shootings , stabbings , all kinds of issues so I think his action to shut it down was the right action, and hopefully if and when it does reopen it will be under new management or the current owners will get things straightened out at that property . And that is all, thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

Back in August of last year, 2018, we had a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 major storm, flooding all over the city and our Meadowbrook flood protection project was seriously damaged . So what this legislation is doing is having the city enter into an agreement , a cooperation agreement with the federal government and they are going to provide most of the cost for rehabilitation . The city is on the hook for $75,386. The federal government is estimating rehabilitation efforts at $376,929 so the city is picking up 20 percent of the cost there. I would like to ask, I've already asked Mrs. Reed this, if we could request before final passage of this legislation the report that is mentioned in this legislation entitled , "Rehabilitation of Damage Flood Damage Reduction Work Scranton -Stafford Meadowbrook Non-Federal Flood Protection Project " which was prepared by the district engineer , U.S. Army Engineer , District Baltimore , approved by the division engineer on January 2, 2019.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT - FOR ADOPTION – RESOLUTION NO. 104, 2019 – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A BEAUTIFUL BLOCKS PROGRAM PROPOSAL BY AND 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND NEIGHBORWORKS NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TO ENCOURAGE GROUPS OF NEIGHBORS TO IMPROVE THEIR HOMES BY PROVIDING MATCHING GRANTS FOR EXTERIOR IMPROVEMENTS . MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Community Development ? MR. DONAHUE : As Chair for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend final passage of Item 7-C. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. EVANS: On the question . First of all, I'd like to thank Councilman Gaughan for his comments last week on this legislation . For me, this is another game changer for our residents and for our neighborhoods . I'd like to add to those comments from last week. In Oswego, New York, where a similar program has been very successful , they have seen first-hand the benefits of their entire cities, where residents enjoin with the Oswego residents Association begin to transform Oswego. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Grants totalling approximately $575,000 have been invested through the program and the $2.5 million in private investment has been leverage into the neighbor hoods of Oswego. While the city has provided the seed money this year as well as a donation from the University of Scranton , we view this as an opportunity for foundation s, for nonprofits , for banks using community reinvestment dollars and almost anyone else that would like to invest in our city and our neighborhoods to be our partners along with our program partner Neighbor Works who is a vital role in this great program . So we want to strengthen one of our greatest assets, our neighbor hoods, by helping another of our greatest assets, our residents and our homeowners who stuck by this city when others have chosen to walk away. We want to make our strong neighbor hoods stronger as well as improving our stable neighborhoods and also by helping our at risk blocks where we can. I think this program is going to make an amazing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 difference in the City of Scranton and I just can't wait to get started . That's all I have on that. MR. ROGAN: I wasn't here last week, I want to thank Councilman Evans for his work on this, I know you mentioned this to us about a year or so ago and this is, again, another great incentive for residents in our city to get together and make their blocks and their neighbor hoods much better to live in so I want to thank Councilman Evans and Neighbor Works, they have been a great partner of the cities and this is certainly we are certainly looking forward to. Anyone else? Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Evans. MR. EVANS: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Rogan. MR. ROGAN: Yes. I hereby declare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Item 7-C legally and lawfully adopted . MS. REED: 7-D - PREVIOUSLY TABLED - FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORKS - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 52, 2019 – AN ORDINANCE – ESTABLISHING A “NO PARKING ” ZONE ALONG THE SOUTHERLY SIDE OF LACKAWANNA AND JEFFERSON AVENUE (S.R.3018) FROM SEGMENT 0010 OFFSET 0300 (KRESSLER COURT INTERSECTION ) EXTENDING NORTH TO A DRIVEWAY , AT SEGMENT 0010 OFFSET 0630. MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Public Works? MR. GAUGHAN : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-D. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, on the question , I'm going to be voting against this resolution for two reasons : One, we never got a response back from PennDOT ; and, two, I don't believe that the zoning board should ever have gave a variance for this project . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 It's just another example of us just doing something just to do it instead of being part of a long-term plan. MR. EVANS: On the question . I, too, am extremely disappointed that several weeks since we had our meeting to table PennDOT did not respond to our request . The fact that PennDOT can invoke their myriad of rules and regulations on state roads in our city without the input of elected officials or without giving us the opportunity to have a conversation with them and possibly improving our downtown and our city for pedestrians as well as motor vehicles , motor vehicle traffic , is just plain wrong. I voted to bring this off the table and for a vote tonight because a developer should not be penalized because they are subject to the archaic rules and regulations of the DOT, through no fault of their own, so I will be asking our colleagues hopefully during the week that we can schedule a meeting with PennDOT and have a real conversation on how this process works and in many cases does not work. We have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 find some common ground rooted in common sense and not just based on more rules and more regulations that do not solve the problem . MR. ROGAN: I, too, am upset about the lack of reply back from PennDOT , but I think the Councilman Evans hit the nail on the head we certainly don't want to penalize the developer who is looking to spend millions of dollars in our city because another branch of government did not reply. I do think we need to continue this conversation when there are parking issues and I do not like the fact that we are going to lose some spots in the downtown , but I think the benefit of having new development on a vacant piece of land far outweighs the couple of parking spots. MR. GAUGHAN : I'm voting for this just for the pure fact that, you know, this legislation does not say anything about the project that's going up near Kildaire 's. We are voting on requirements that are mandated by PennDOT . I mean, whether you agree with this project or disagree with it that's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 what we are voting on. So, I mean, you know, you could certainly debate the zoning board's decision but it passed and it passed the planning commission as well, so my concern is if, you know, we start voting pieces of legislation like this down because we don't like the projects , we in essence , you know, almost become a second zoning board, which is not -- I don't believe is our role and I also believe that it may open us up to legal challenges . That just is my opinion , so I'm voting yes because we are simply voting on requirements that are mandated by PennDOT and because this is the process that you go through . So thank you. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: On the question , I want to just touch on it a little bit. I'm already on the record of how I felt about that zoning board decision that approved this project . They were wrong then and they are wrong today. However , I totally understand what Councilman Gaughan is saying and my vote is based on the DOT action and the lack thereof by coming to us and having 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 a conversation . I do not want to penalize the developers , that's why I brought it off the table to allow for a vote tonight . MR. PERRY: Yes, finally , on the question , I think Mr. Gaughan hit the nail on the head, really all we can do is vote on the black and white in front of us and that's what I'm doing. This reminds me a lot about the past year Sheetz project where we had before us PennDOT lanes that needed to be adjusted and fixed for traffic flow and, you know, it had nothing to do with that actual Sheetz project , it was just something that had to come across our desk to approve our planning on the streets . This is very similar to that. So to go any deeper than that I don't feel it's right, but I do agree with the fact that, you know, PennDOT should have gave us the time of day to give us a response back to our question . We did table it and we did hold up this developer for a couple of weeks because of this because want to do our due diligence but I don't think we should do this any longer, but I am in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 agreeance of meeting with the Department of Transportation so we can have a better communication going forward and getting to this crossroad before we get to a point of no return like kind of where we are now. So, you know, on in legislation here I'll be for this as it speaks. MR. ROGAN: Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No. MS.
