If you go to the City of Scranton 's website you could find that recycling list there. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Anyone else? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just want to say thank you to the UNC for hosting the Pine Brook Family Arts Festival that took place over the weekend . That was at John Adams Elementary School. My family and I were able to enjoy and partake in the activities that they had there. That was a great event for kids, great way to get the community and the neighborhood together . And I'm glad that the weather held out for that too. That's all I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Also, just a reminder there's a cleanup in South Side this weekend . They're going to be meeting at 9 a.m. at Connors park. I think it's between nine and one. And they're going to meet there. And then people will kind of spread out throughout South Side to do cleanup of the South Side area. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . Oh, excuse me, Joan, can I stop you just for a second? I forgot Dr. Rothchild has a proclamation that was sent down from the city. I'm sorry. Then we'll call you up again. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'm going to read a proclamation honoring Jewish American Heritage Month. Whereas , Jewish immigrants to America , ever since their first arrival to our shores in the 16th Century , have played a central role in the creation , growth, freedom , prosperity , and strength of the United States of America ; and1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Whereas , the biblical and contemporary history of the Jewish people and the enduring values of the Jewish faith were vital sources of inspiration for the founding of the United States, the Civil Rights movement , America 's global leadership in the cause of freedom , Americans ' commitment to social justice , and many of our Country 's most central tenets; and Whereas , through core Jewish beliefs such as the creations of man in the image of God, the infinite value of every human life, the need for a weekly Sabbath , and the importance of education in the lives of children , the Jewish community has helped to define America 's character and values; and Whereas , Jewish citizens of Scranton , having first settled here in the 1840s, played a central role in developing Scranton 's small business community and workforce , including serving in the Armed Forces of the United States and the Pennsylvania National Guard; and Whereas , following the rebirth of Zionism and the miraculous return of the Jewish 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 people to the Jewish homeland , the United States was the first country in the world to recognize the State of Israel in 1948, and over the years has developed a deep friendship and unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel based upon shared values and mutual interests ; and Whereas , the State of Israel is now celebrating the 75th anniversary of its modern founding and its emergence over the last few decades as a beacon of freedom and prosperity and a world leader in technology , agriculture , water conservation , medicine , and all manner of innovation ; and Whereas , for 42 years, every President of the United States has declared a period of time for celebrating the contributions to the United States of the Jewish community 's history , heritage , and culture , and since 2006, the month of May has been Presidentially declared to be Jewish American Heritage Month, pursuant to a bipartisan resolution of Congress . Therefore , I, Mayor Paige G. Cognetti , along with Scranton City Council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Members , do hereby proclaim May, 2023 to be Jewish American Heritage Month for the City of Scranton , and call upon all our citizens to commemorate this occasion by appropriately celebrating the Jewish community 's history , heritage , culture and contributions to our city. I further call upon schools , colleges , and universities in Scranton to commemorate this occasion through appropriate programming for students ; and call upon Scranton museums , organizations and historical societies to host programs relevant to this occasion . MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Any caucus date for the 2021 audit? MR. KING: Not at this time. MS. HODOWANITZ : And has the Mayor made a decision on the 10 percent penalty clause? MR. KING: Not -- she's not to this date. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. You know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 I've been complain ing and commenting on audits for several years now. And people may think, you know, it's just a bugaboo with me. But there's a reason. If you have a well done audit -- and by that I mean, the auditor is thorough and professional and objective and the city is forthcoming and all the information required for the audit, you will most likely prevent or detect 99.9 percent of all instance s of fraud, waste, and abuse. And you cannot tell me that the city does not have an occasional problem with fraud, waste, and abuse. You know, I mean, it can be based on a conscious effort to defraud the taxpayers or it can be human error. But that's the purpose of an audit. And I have been checking these audits for the 20-year period in which they're online. And I will tell you we've never had an audit done on time according to the Home Rule Charter . It's been getting worse over time. And we obviously have a systemic problem with conducting audits, not just our own independent audit every year, but even at the state level. You may recall that neither the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 state nor the city's independent auditor caught the double pension s. That was caught by a report from the Times-Tribune after it had gone on for over a decade. So I'm going to keep asking. If the city has problems in preparing for an audit and, you know, not everybody is trained to do it, we need to identify those issues and get a training program set up. And I don't think Rainey and Rainey is cutting the mustard here. They were hired in 2017 -- or 2015 for a two-year contract for the expressed purpose of preparing for the audit so it would not be late again. Now they've been continued upstairs and they're still up there. And we're still having late audits. My recommendation , go to the University of Scranton . The professors up there teach government accounting and have them come down. They could teach our people. Our people would get a free education . University gets a pat on the back, and maybe we'll get a timely and well done audit, which brings me to the next point that we still don't have legislation for the new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 auditor which was suppose d to have been this week. We still don't have the DPW contract on the website . And I got big concern s about that. That thing was signed on September 14th and all I keep hearing is, well, the lawyers are discuss ing it. Do we or do we not have a finalized contract ? What are the problems ? Do they need a typist? I volunteer my services . I won't even charge you for the ink and the paper. What is the problem ? Or does the administration have some reason that they don't want to share that contract with the public, the taxpayer ? Is it legal, you know, to be executing portions of that contract in terms of wages and salaries and withholding and contributions and everything else when -- you cannot show me the contract ? I'm not sure one exists. Do we have a replacement for Larry West yet? MR. KING: We do. MS. HODOWANITZ : Is it Matt? MR. KING: No, it's Eileen Cipriani . We just found out this afternoon via e-mail. MS. HODOWANITZ : Who, Eileen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Cipriani ? MR. KING: Eileen Cipriani , yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. And the statements of financial interest I sat in the clerk's office this morning of 190 statements that we tried to get. I think as of tonight , correct me if I'm wrong, we have about 90, Frank? Shame, shame, shame, you know, but -- and he's got them scanned so hopefully they'll be on the City's website in the very near future. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Fay Franus. MS. FRANUS: Fay Franus, Scranton . Mr. King, on your desk right there I present ed you with a letter from the -- an article from the Scranton Times from December where the PUC ruled that Scranton and Dunmore were the only ones that had to pay the rate increase , nobody else in the state. And did you happen -- and I also sent a letter to the editor that was in today, Joe Barbuti I think wrote it saying how outrageous the price was. Did you happen to write a letter to the PUC like I asked last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 week as a whole body? MR. KING: Excuse me? MS. FRANUS: Did you write a letter to the PUC? MR. KING: Yes, I did. MS. FRANUS: Can you read that in motions , please? MR. KING: Can I read it as a motion tonight ? MS. FRANUS: No, can you read it in motions tonight , the letter that you wrote. MR. KING: Sure. I'll read it in Fifth Order. MS. FRANUS: Yes. MR. KING: Sure. Ms. FRANUS: Can I ask you, would Council please and even have the Mayor join in appealing this PUC decision because you could appeal this. You should appeal it for the resident s that you represent . MR. KING: We can talk to the Mayor and we'll also talk to our City Solicitor and City Council Solicitor to see if that is a possibility . MS. FRANUS: It is. You could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 definitely appeal it. There's no (inaudible ) that is -- I mean, possibility if you want to or not but you can. Now, another thing, I want to say something here, Mr. King. You've been setting a pattern here for the last couple weeks. A couple weeks ago you went after Lee Morgan for saying there was pay to play politics in Scranton . MR. KING: No, excuse me. He made the comment and I just respond ed to it afterward . MS. FRANUS: Yes, I know. But what you respond ed you had no right to say because Council rules do not supersede the Constitution of the United States. Mr. Morgan had every right to say what he wanted because if it's true in his opinion just like what I say -- MR. KING: I never mentioned anyone's name. MS. FRANUS: You didn't have to. Everybody knew who you were talking about because he said it right before you spoke, same thing with Mr. Ellman. He said he didn't like immigrants . You said you're going to call 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 everybody out that says that anymore . You don't have that right. You really don't. And I think you should brush up on the Constitu tion. MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. MS. FRANUS: So another thing, a member of the Council staff last week approached an audience member to take off a Brian Reap sticker for Commissioner . They may feel they have the right to do that. But again, Council rules do not supersede the Constitution of the United States. And I think you should inform your staff they should never have approach ed an audience member and tell them to take off any campaign stickers , clothing , anything . That right -- you can't take that right away from an American citizen . Now, another thing, last week I spoke about Jessica Rothchild and Mr. Smurl you shouldn 't vote for her. I still believe that. But the only problem is, there's not many people running for election . We're almost stuck with who's on here which is a shame. We have to get good candidate s out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 there. I'm also going to say this tonight for Mark McAndrew , why, because I've been coming to this podium for months talking about the union and the overtime . And Mr. McAndrew has done nothing , has said nothing . But in previous years he's gone out of his way to go after the Director of the DPW almost every week. You don't hear a word out of his mouth about Scott Pietreface , the Director , nothing . He's the one who made the most overtime , 29,800 last year. But now he's the Director he doesn't get overtime . But what I'm saying, Mr. McAndrew , you went out of your way last year also. There was a DPW supervisor I believe who you said did something with a power washer. You, what you did was you poisoned the water of the public's opinion . You did this by going after him week after week. You've ruined his reputation and that's on you. That's speaks for your character because this person was never in the paper that he did anything wrong. So this person -- and did I ever -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 did I ever in my life hear of a person got suspend ed from a job and wasn't allowed to go back to that same job. Maybe he got demoted. So what's this all about? You had a big part in that because you went after this person week after week unjustly . So you destroyed a person's career single handedly . And you have to start working for the people and speaking out about this overtime . I brought a thing -- I'll get into this next week when I have more time. But there's no reasons when there's nine snow events from January to March, $191,000 worth of overtime for three months, nine snow events. We don't live in Denver. I'll get into this next week, part by part, day by day. Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Dave Rinaldi . MR. RINALDI : Good evening, Council , a couple things I wanted to say tonight . Number one, I want to thank Council for the two amendments to the zoning ordinance . I think you sent a clear message that the citizens of Scranton will be heard when it comes to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 development . Number two, I wanted to say that -- well, I wanted to apologize for that random notes rant that I went on last week. As a Democrat , I can't understand -- I understand why young people do not want to identify as Democrats . And it has do with the establishment money Democrats in the party. Third thing I wanted to talk to you about was, of course, we saw the news that Geisinger is being bought and it's out of California . So, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty here. But I wanted to give Council some ideas to start to think about in the development of that area up there. Number one, I don't see any reason why if you're going to have two parking garages you don't have them in the 200 block of Colfax, open up the 400 block of Colfax and redevelop that with a program to relocate and this has happened with hospital expansions before. I read about this. The hospital can help with relocating and perhaps reclaiming that area in the 400 block for the neighborhood . Now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 that -- you can -- that will increase the park itself. If you get a swimming pool there we can -- you can reestablish that area. And so I'd like you to think about that as one of many scenario s as you think about for develop ing that property . But it has a lot of good aspects to it. I don't know what you do for the people on Roselynn between Wheeler and Arthur. But I think there's a lot of possibilities if you keep your mind open and you're thinking ahead now. And hopefully you'll, you know, all of you will be there making those decisions . And finally , I just want to say to everybody who's on the ballot. Good luck to you Tuesday . I wish you every success and the people will speak. Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you, Attorney Rinaldi . Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , it's Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I have a lot of thank yous tonight . So I think the first thank you I'm going to give is to ECTV. I've stood here at this podium and complain ed that we couldn't hear 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 what was going on and everything . I don't know how long I think it's been over a year that we complained about it. Well, I think it was about a couple weeks ago they did install the speaker in the back and kudos to them because you could hear every word that's being said. So along with the complaining that I've done and I know others have done, I want to say thank you for that. On Friday we had an Arbor Day ceremony for the first respond ers in the city. And us like anybody that was planning an activity outside , we were concerned about the weather . But the weather held off. And we had a great time. And there was speakers there that I can't begin to name all the speaker s that were there. But I do want to mention the Scranton School District . You know, some times you hear so much negative things about our schools. But there's a lot of good things going on in our schools. And I was just so proud of the kids that were there. I don't have any kids in the school. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I don't have any grandkids in the school. My kids don't live here in Scranton . So what I hear is what -- coming from other people. But the Scranton School District has to stand proud. Those kids that interacted with me on Friday, you know, I was just more than pleased . The kids from the culinary school, I didn't know where it was. So that was my first time going up there. And I'm hoping that Mr. McAndrew through his leadership , those kids were awesome . What they did for us for that ceremony and they were just so gracious and the platter , they started working the day before to prepare for us and everything was just above and overboard. As I walked into it I kept thinking this place is gorgeous . So I'm thinking -- I'm hoping that Mr. McAndrew that one day I could get back there for a tour because it was the outside of it was beautiful because the trees are just starting to bloom with spring and the inside of it was just as nice and the kids were just wonderful . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 So then we get down to the ceremony and the West Scranton choir chorus sang for us. And they did an awesome job of singing , young people. It was cold I thought that day. They were out there in their short sleeves . That's what it is when you're young. They performed for us just absolutely beautiful . And what was so thrilling for me is that three of them had written poems to go along with the music that they were going to sing. So before they sang the song, the student would come up and talk about this -- why they were singing it. It all dealt with COVID-19. And they tied in all of their speeches with COVID-19. So to those teacher s that helped them with their speeches , kudos to them, to the principal , to their choir director . I forget what his name was right now and I do apologize for that. But he did a fantastic job with the kids. And I just wanted to make sure that I express ed as a member of the Shade Tree Commission that we express our sincere delight in how those kids from the Scranton School 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 District performed for us on Friday. Also, there were speakers there and DPW did a great job. I know there's a lot of things that they could do better for us. But they did a great job in helping us get ready for that day and making sure that, you know, the different buildings were open. So I thank them as well. And then it's that time of the year again. The Electric City Flower Show. That's my next activity that I'm beginning to work with, the team with that. And that will take place on Saturday , June 10th. And as the time goes on I will be talking more and more about it. But right now I just wanted to give you the save the date that you put that on your calendars . And we pushed it up this year because we had it in August last year. It was so hot. And we had some people, you know, just passing out. So we pushed it up to June so we're hoping that we still have the great attendance and the cooperation from the residents of Scranton as well as the City of Scranton . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here today is, you know, I've been reaching out to the Mayor now for two weeks trying to get a sit-down appointment with her and have a discussion about ECTV. But it seems to be very difficult at this point. But I haven't given up hope. Either way it goes it's going to all work out fine. The other thing I have is, you know, I've secured Holy Cross hall because before I file my petition with the Court I'm going to try to launch a series of neighborhood associations because I think the city has a real problem and a lack of drive by neighborhood associations . I think they maybe in some instances they could be better. And I've just been paying a lot of attention what's happened over the years with Mr. Pisano starting the Hill Neighborhood Association and securing that building and the way the neighborhood associations have operated over an extended period of time.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 For the life of me I can't figure out how they lost the LA Lewis building in West Scranton . And I think it's time to see just how tied they are to local politic s and political candidate s and whether they absolutely represent the residents in their communities or not. And that's really a big question . The other thing I have here is that at inception for ECTV it was run out of the Scranton Public Library by Mr. Finnerty, I believe . And I don't know exactly how it grew from that point to where it is now. But, you know, I'm looking to get some answers but not for me. I think the community should have these answers , not me personally because if it really becomes a detriment to getting those answers , then you could get them in discovery and your lawyer could explain that to you. I want to know is ECTV a private contractor ? When does the contract with ECTV expire? Is there a process to replacing ECTV as the operator of ECTV? You know, they operate the channel . Is there a process to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 remove ECTV and replace them with a different operator ? I'd like to know how the board was chosen and the process to remove the board. And is there a contract between the city government and ECTV? These are all really crucial issues that I think the public should have an answer to because they're going to highlight an awful lot of things on how the channel was operate d and why they're afraid of free speech and why they can't allow anyone to question city government or the Council because don't forget a long time ago -- well, not -- a considerable period of time, the Lackawanna Taxpayers and Citizens Association sat at these tables. Bill Courtright was a Councilman . Janet Evans was on Council at that time. There were a multitude of different Council members on Council at the time. And they were questioned and the things they did in public office were questioned . And I think that -- and on the county level too. And I think what happened is when Mr. Courtright became Mayor, he couldn't handle the criticism that the resident s had for -- for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 the Council 's leadership and how the Council couldn't answer questions . Like today, Council has a terrible time answering questions . And you know the most amazing thing is that this is even taking place in this country considering when the revolution was fought what the principals of this country were and where we've taken ourselves to as a people and the facts should come to light on exactly where our community is and what's taking place. And the government , I don't know what there is to hide from. I think they should be transparent and maybe you'll answer these question s. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Okay, Council , I was going to have a story about Medicare , Social Security , if I may. My brother , I'm 21 years older than him lives in Memphis . All of his life he's had jobs cutting the grass and caddying in his adult life he's had the same job for about 30 years, I suppose . A couple months ago his wife got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 sick. They put her in the hospital . She got MS. She was falling out of chairs and falling down and everything . Evidently it got real bad. Three days later they put my brother in the hospital . His kidneys failed. And he had a blood clot in his leg. And he's on Medicare because of his age. Well, last Monday they threw him out of the hospital . His Medicare ended. I don't know how Medicare could end. But it was in the paper a couple weeks ago our esteemed president is taking Medicare away from millions of people. And he's one of them. How could this be? This is America for crying out loud. They sent him home and a visiting nurse is suppose d to come three times a week. She didn't show up for about a week and a half. They told him he could come back to the hospital in three weeks in the meantime , you know, if he was still living after all of that. I didn't know any of this until a couple weeks ago. He phoned me. By then he was five or six weeks behind on his car payment s and his trailer payments and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 everything . I had to sort of help him out so he wouldn't lose everything he worked for all of his life. But it's seems to me that the prisoners in Cuba are receive d better than this. How can this happen in America ? All of these people coming across the border, there's not going -- it's just impossible to keep Social Security and Medicare alive. There's too many people sucking it dry. When my son was sick in the hospital I waited over at Geisinger in the waiting room a few hours here and there. It's terrible what goes on in that waiting room. It's not America anymore, people walking around barefooted . They bring you all of their old habits from the old world to this country and we're suppose d to change and be like where they came from. Yesterday , Roseann went to the doctor. She's on Geisinger 's -- a hand doctor in Eynon. Her co-pay was $225. I don't know if any of you sit in a waiting room like I did. How many of those people you think have a $225 co-pay? That's why there's not going to be any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 Social Security for your children and your grandchildren . It's an impossibility . Well, I got that off my chest. I got one other thing. There's a picture of a woman downstairs by the elevator . I just wondered what she did. It said phone the police if anybody sees her here. You didn't see it? No, I just -- I thought maybe she insulted Council or something , you know, as a lesson to me. Well, thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka , first of all, for the comment on the speaker system in here, I think it's fabulous that we're going to have the permanent placement of the speaker back there. And I talked to one of the ECTV people who are testing that in the first place. We discussed that it might be wise since we're going to put in a speaker back here and another one to be run off that if a small speaker might be considered for up in the balcony . Since we're running wires back in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 there, it might be reasonable to put even just a tiny speaker up in the balcony section since it could be run off that at almost absolutely no cost. And in case there is an overage, it then puts a small speaker up in the balcony section . One of my pet peeves since we're talking about pet peeves is for three years now I've brought before this Council that when document s are scanned in, why aren't we using OCR. PDFs can be done with OCR which means they can be searchable for things in them. That's not new technology . That's been out there for 15 or 20 years. I don't understand why the City of Scranton cannot properly scan PDFs with OCR which is include d in it which makes it's a searchable document . Obviously when it's not searchable you have to go through on some of the contracts up to 60 pages of documentation . When if it was scanned and searchable , you could put the key words in and go specifically to sections you're going to. It's been three years that I've talked to Council about this. And they said, yeah, we'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 look into it. We'll think about that. We're not sure we have the technology . If you don't have the technology , maybe you should figure out how to go back and do maybe mining in the city because technology has advanced past the 1940s. It's there. It's available . We need to use it. For the first paper that I put forward which is the ordinance for the environmental commission , the new commission has written Council has the ability to only approve the alternate s. It specifical ly says in there the Mayor may appoint with the advice of and consent of City Council up to two alternate members . It does not discuss the primary members at all. Since it directly relates to alternate members , it would be reasonable for this body to have in there that Council should approve all of them. Now for the initial commission , all members should be voted for by the Mayor and the Council for the establishment of the body. And I understand this body wants to take a look forward at the Mayor appoint ing a certain number and City Council appointing a certain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 number. And that's reasonable . But for the initial installation of it, I think everyone on that should be vetted by both parties just for the original creation of the committee itself. The second document I brought forward shows some of the recovery plan payments so far. We have in the study improvement and action plans $416,000 done to make studies to look at things that actually hasn't produced anything , basically just short of a half a million dollars to study things. I think money is better concerned elsewhere . We were told that we could not -- that the revenue loss had no money that this body could be used in it. But looking at the City's website in the unallocated section , not in the distributed or obliged section , there is 9,982,315 or 67.5 percent which is still not allocated . This body can use some of that. But obviously you've been told that we don't want to let you. And the last comment is hotels. We have a taxing fee for hotels -- for rentals in this property . Rental fees are charged for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 every rental facility . The University of Scranton should be charged for these fees as well for all of their student housing . They have rental housing . It is a fee, not a tax. So across every single rental that they have for student housing , they should be paying rental fees to the City of Scranton just like everyone else. In the past year we've seen -- two years we've seen a $50,000 drop in the pilots from the university . This would serve to fill that coffer. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , East Mountain . I guess tonight is complain night because I've been looking at a lot of the things that have been promised and not come to fruition . And one them was -- goes back to 2015 I believe when our police officer Mr. Wilding lost his life because he jumped over a wall and found out it was a staircase and went down and got killed. And we have not -- that I could see done a thing. Now it took the state 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 (inaudible ) and I think until last year or maybe the year before to also do a Wilding ordinance just for people running and being chased. So I don't know if you'd at least tell us if you don't intend to do that, I think that would be nice. But again, if you go through a yard and you jump over a wall and it's a stairway , good luck. And then my favorite , stormwater . We have spent more money studying stormwater and when are we going to really address it? Are we going have an authority ? Are we not going to have an authority ? Are we going to be on our own or are we going to have a regional ? MR. KING: I believe we just got an e-mail today from Eileen Cipriani concerning a stormwater authority . MR. VOLDENBERG : We did. MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry, what? MR. KING: We got an e-mail from Eileen Cipriani today. I think she's trying to set a date for a meeting for putting together -- finalizing the stormwater . MR. VOLDENBERG : That's right, a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 substantial meeting on June 20th. MR. KING: June 20th meeting . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Is that an open meeting or is that just you and the administration ? MR. KING: I don't know that. MR. VOLDENBERG : That will be an open caucus. MR. KING: And also HRG has completed the East Mountain stormwater study. It's done. We just got it I think today. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Now, the Ice Box. Do we -- are we owed $600,000 or are we not? MR. KING: That I inquired with the administration and apparent ly it's in legal and I believe they're in the process of trying to get that all figured out at this stage of the game. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . MS. SCHUMACHER : Really? When -- do we have -- do they have a date set? MR. KING: I don't have a date. It's my understanding that I think the $600,000 actually didn't have to do with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Ice Box itself. I think it involved the land to the front of the Ice Box. But I can't say that for sure. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, I have a pretty fat file if you'd like to go through it. What about pilots? There was something stated that the administration was going to do a HUP. MR. KING: I believe that Andrew Cutillo was working -- can we check -- get an update on that, Frank, about the HUP test? They were suppose d to put out an RFP. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I did have another one. And what about LERTAs? When does the LERTA Program run out for the city and could we have again the marketeer who is from the Chamber of Commerce come in here and tell us whether it was a success or a failure and again is it -- is it really still in order to even go -- request a LERTA? MR. KING: We'll look into that, Mrs. Schumacher . Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. KOLOSKI : Doris Koloski , Hill 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 Section . First of all, I want to thank everybody on Council who voted for the amendment last week. And I just want to make a reminder announcement that Saturday , May 6th and 7th this coming week there is going to be at Nay Aug Park at the old concession stand which is now called the Community Room, a collection for St. Joseph's Diaper Pantry Baby and Children 's Pantry Wish List. And they are looking for diapers size four, five and six, pull-ups three -- toddler three, toddler four, toddler five, baby bath towels and washcloths , baby bottles , baby wash, baby lotion, diaper bags, bibs, pacifiers , baby formula , Similac advance d and sensitive and baby food, fruits and vegetables . No clothing being accepted at this time. So I was hoping people will hear this and show up and help them out because diapers if you've been in the store and if you have babies, man, are they expensive . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Koloski . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn resident . I don't know how many people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 will even have the time to read the paper nowadays. But there was an editorial in the Sunday paper and about two days after we resolved or hopefully resolved the parking garage issue, Geisinger is being swallowed up by a massive corporation from the west coast, a nonprofit . But there's some issues here with insurance . Kaiser from the west coast only accepts people with their insurance . And why something like that is even legal is beyond me. That's absolutely awful. I hope things work out the way we hope they'll work out. But, I mean, I went up last Wednesday up to the park just to visit -- I throw the kitty cats a couple of coins up there for street cats and visit sometimes . And when I went past the parking lots up there, the amount of cars are massive . So I hope we're not sitting in court worrying about it being overturned, our representation . I also would like to point out that certain entities brought in Henry Amoroso several years ago. We had a fresh Mayor who wasn't really heavily educated or anything . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 And he didn't work out, of course. But, you know, not one of his ideas has worked, pilots, they're a joke. They're pathetic . So my wish for the new Council is that we go after the state and start getting this money replaced for loss of property taxes and not at 3 or 4 percent , how about 50 percent or 60 percent ? We can't keep going on and having these tax exempts draining our tax base and then dumping it on the other people -- that's our swimming pools. That's our this, whatever . But there is literally millions of dollars going out the door on tax exempts . It could be a hospital . It could be an ammunition plant or it could be a church that preaches to hit your kids with a baseball bat because there are such churches . There's a preacher affiliated with Michael Flynn of national prominence . And he's preaching revolution . And his intake -- it's a circus tent church, 90 -- in excess of 90,000 a week, tax exempt, tax free. Now, what in the hell do I want to have somebody advising people to engage in criminal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 behavior , just criminal behavior ? I mean, we have a lot of revolution aries. And they're on trial now as we speak. And personal ly I think if that's your attitude , you could feel free to pay taxes like the rest of us. And these exemptions are just crazy. And they are all piled in. Two-thirds of the tax exempt properties in Lackawanna County are piled on one-third of the population . I was disappoint ed in the school district when it didn't take on that lawsuit . It's probably only a moral victory anyway because the politicians are going to thumb their nose at them even though they won in court. It's really a shame the way things are getting . And like I said, I hope they work out. Sometimes my concern is moot because I only have a little time left. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. MATYJEVICH : Good evening , Council , Joe Matyjevich , Tripp Park resident , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Vice President of the Tripp Civic Association , Executive Board member of the Bulls Head Weston Field Neighborhood Association . I come here tonight with a couple topics for Council to consider . I know that the number of us have asked Council for the Environmental Study Commission Council to look to have Council have at least two appointments there on their own and let the Mayor have three with the advice and consent of Council and then maybe one and one on the alternates . So I hope that will be in Seventh Order tonight . MR. KING: -- tonight . MR. MATYJEVICH : If you make those amendments and that was great for your hearing us and, you know, it's going to be a benefit . Another topic I know Dr. Rothchild brought up about the permit parking in the Hill Section around Gibson Street and the hospital where those houses used to be. I think in the Home Rule Charter we have a strong Mayor form of government that the City Council is the legislative body of the City of Scranton . In order for that to have permit parking , ordinances had to come through 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 City Council for approval moving forward and then a final vote. Instead of asking questions if we can do something after having another study done and delay it and kick the can down the road, maybe it might be a prudent idea to have one of the Council members or the entire body ask the Solicitor to draft legislation to rescind that ordinance and then move it forward and vote on it which you could get things done a lot faster versus waiting to ask a question and coming back and going back and forth, just a suggestion with the legislative branch here and the ability to bring legislation , you know, forward . And the final thing is, you know, I want to thank Council for hearing the people of Scranton , the people of the Hill and passing those amendments , you know, to that zoning law. My only concern is that is why? You know, why did it take so long? These people were sitting here for two-plus months. All of the amendments that were passed were brought up, you know, months ago by Mr. Schuster , not only for the lowering of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 garage but for the solar fields on the other side of town in the West Mountain area to not have that infringe on front and backyard s. So I don't think it had to take that long. You know, Geisinger did not tell us anything that we really didn't know because they didn't have a plan. We could have had that on there, voted. These people would have had, you know, two months that they could rest and sleep and not have to worry, you know, about that. I know there was comment s of why people did what they did and changed the way that we thought they were going and where they went on the amendments . It's just a question to ask ourselves, you know, why. And lastly, I know that we put that back on the -- we took that off the table, you know, to allow 10 days and, you know, additional comment s on that. I think we had comment s on that and thank yous on that tonight . I'm not sure that we need to leave that off the table. I'm not sure why we can't bring that back to the table now and vote on it so that we could at least look to get the same votes that we've had last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 week and not have any changes out there because I think in the past legislation that was amended in Seventh Order was in turn voted on that same night. I think that happens in the budget season where we go through , we talk about the budget in Fifth Order and Sixth Order and then seventh order we come with a laundry list of amendment s to reduce the taxes, raise the taxes, cut a job here, cut a job there. And we vote on it that same night. So I'm just asking, you know, we've got resident s here who voiced their concern . I voiced my concern of why it took so long. Why make them wait another week. You know, let's bring it off the table. Let's vote on it and hope that we get what we got last week and these people could go home and the rest of the citizens go home and have a good week's sleep, you know, not worrying about having to come back again, are we going to get 3-2, 4-1, 5-0. You know, I don't know where it's going to go. But I just ask you to do that and give them a peace of mind because everybody deserve s a little bit of rest. There's a lot 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 of stress that was out there, you know, for this. And anything that you could do to make that possible , make everyone 's life possible -- make everyone's life a little bit more stressful . And, you know, put that to bed and let's just move on with the rest of the things for the city. Let's focus on, you know, stormwater . Let's take a look at all of those things that we have out there for PEMA. You know, there's probably a lot of those projects out there if we don't move, are we going to lose money. You know, we had some big rain storms and knock on wood, you know, some people got a little water. Other people, you know, were saved. But if we could do that, I'd greatly appreciate it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Matyjevich . Anyone else like to be heard? MR. WASKO: Good evening , Council , first I want to say that I appreciate your vote last week. The people spoke -- MR. KING: Excuse me, can you state your full name?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. WASKO: Oh, I'm sorry, Charles Wasko, resident of West Scranton . MR. KING: Thank you. MR. WASKO: I'm going to be running for City Council as an Independent . So I want to, you know, say to you guys good luck on Tuesday . Again, I appreciate what -- the vote last week. It was important . It showed you guys care about people. I'm running as an Independent because I feel that the two party system right now doesn't work, especially in the climate of the United States now. You're either a Democrat or you're a Republican and nothing gets done because there's no compromise . So I'm going to run as an Independent . Hopefully one day maybe join yous on Council . But what I'm really here for is a couple reasons . I know last week I spoke about blight. I have a neighbor that's with me today. He's dealing with the same issue where his neighbor 's house was condemned . I just want to know what is the procedure after the house is condemned . I know that it goes to demolition . But how long 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 should he expect to wait for something to be done on the property that's it condemned ? MR. KING: It can vary depending on challenges or court challenge and dealing with the attorneys . They try to expediate it as quick as possible . I'll try to get a more concrete answer for you next week. We'll talk to Mr. Voldenberg if you could check with City Solicitor and I guess it could be the LIPS Department . MR. WASKO: Because I think there's a lot of condemnation s being done now because we have city inspect ors that are going around doing that. But you see a lot of these properties that just sit and it just depreciates the value. I would ask that if maybe Council could do maybe a ride around or maybe this Mayor can actually take a little ride around with an inspector to see what's going on in this city because the people that I talk to are really just tired of the blight, the lack of activities for the youth. And they just want something for their taxes. Was there ever any talk about maybe doing a ride along or anything 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 like that? DR. ROTHCHILD : I've done that multiple times. MR. KING: Would you be interest ed in doing it again? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. MR. WASKO: Do you see what I see too? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I completely see the benefit from those ride-alongs. It's good to see it firsthand and streets that I don't necessarily go down every day and just -- MR. WASKO: So what can we -- can we do? Is it the Mayor that's got to, like, maybe attack this issue or because it seems like everybody that's on Council is on board. But it seems like we're not getting anywhere . MR. KING: Concerning the blight? MR. WASKO: Yeah. MR. KING: Well, I think -- Council , I think that we did take action. We voted for a budget that hired an additional I think four to five new code enforcement officer s on top of that. We were fortunate to use ARPA money to be able to purchase up to eight to ten new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 electric vehicle s that are clearly identified as code enforcement . And I think we're starting to see more code enforcement than we've ever seen in quite a long time in the city. So it's a work in progress . And I think we're headed in the right direction . MR. WASKO: I agree with that. But now we have more officers out there, we're going to see more condemnations . We're going to see more properties that just sit. So, I guess, maybe what was the step after that I guess more or less. DR. ROTHCHILD : Last week I request ed for that process to be posted on the website when a property gets condemned so that it's very transparent . MR. WASKO: Lastly, I would like to mention I'm a drug and alcohol counsellor . I have been doing it for a couple years now. I was wondering if there is any way I could work with the administration , Council , and the -- maybe the Mayor too to talk about how we could handle this influx of the fentanyl that's in the area, drugs, you name it plus, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 when you add the situation where we don't have a pool, we have a lot of kids that can't afford to play sports. We can't afford to do a lot of things that maybe we could create some type of an environment to handle this influx of drugs and alcohol . Would Council be willing to sit down and talk to me or maybe the Mayor? MR. KING: I'm sure members of Council would be glad to sit down and hear your thought s. Even if you wanted to submit anything that you have or suggestions also would be helpful . MR. WASKO: Yeah, I have some ideas. I would love to sit down with you guys and talk about them, you know? And lastly, I guess, good luck on Tuesday . And I appreciate everything you guys do because honestly it's not easy. It really isn't because a lot of people vent and it's not anybody 's fault. It's just the way it is. But I wanted to just say I'm running as an Independent because I just don't think that government moves when there's a two-party system. But I wanted to say thank you again 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 for last week's vote. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Wasko. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council , I'm Rick Little. And I'd like to talk about Social Security . Social Security is a word. It's also the name of programs . And I think it gets mixed up of what Social Security is, especially when it comes to taxes and the law and state's rights versus federal rights. I think a lot of people are very confused , especially now about what state's rights and federal rights are especially with the, you know, like, reproductive rights and gun rights. And, you know, I see a lot of people really freaked out on Roe versus Wade and it goes back to the state. And all of a sudden, they're interested in civics. And they want to protest . And I think it all comes from television . People are programmed to learn this way. All my life I've always enjoyed people under three years old and people over 70 years old. Three year old -- under three years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 old because they're just there. They're just there to learn and over 70 is like they're remembering . They're remembering and they find themselves in this world if Social Security and trying to deal with it. And there's a lot of law fair going on, you known, people are cheering . They're watching these kangaroo courts in certain states, California , New York, you know, they're going to get this guy that I hate. And but they really don't even have basic civics understanding of what are federal rights and state's rights. And basically the problem everywhere is, is that the people that are in charge of city, county, and state governments are stealing Social Security on every level, the regular Social Security because it's tied with medical . It's tied with housing , especially . And it goes away. I talked to people on the street who get the same basic Lackawanna County needs that I do to live on because I was in family court. I ended up losing everything . They garnished , you know, all of my 501 3C. My family turns against me because of children . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 I have a daughter . I haven't seen her since she was eight. But ever since then I've been fighting to stay prominent . And that's why I'm here to be on as much television as possible so one of these days -- she's parentally alienated now. She's 22. She'll figure out, you know, yeah, it really starts with the family, fatherhood because she was denied that. As far as the law, the law fair going on, there's a big problem in this county because there's no defense the way they have it set up, you know, no tolerance policy for lease violation s at Scranton Housing Authority . It's like shooting fish in a barrel. I sat in and watched the Courts. There's nothing there from Lackawanna Pro Bono, another 501 3C. Or there's nothing there from Northeast Penn Legal. I mean, they -- they can't handle it. And they're just cogs in a system that is designed to steal your Social Security to get the federal money at every level coming down the state, the county. Agency on Ageing, I'm talking to the guy. He's now the state guy, you know, I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 talking to him because they make discrimination which everybody seems to be, you know, on race, on color, on, you know, age they say. And they make fine lines of whose being discriminated . Let's see, yeah, I'm running out of time. I'm running out of time. I just like to make an objection because in all of these battles , the county comes in the middle of the thing hawking their county housing , which is almost all of what the county gives you to live on. So if you lose it, they're selling you something that won't give keep you alive. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, Mr. King, during announcements I forgot to mention there will be a group at Nay Aug Park Sunday at 9 a.m., by the pond. They're going to install the pumps and the fountain s and do a general cleanup in that area.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 And also they're going to -- later in the day erect the amphitheater to prepare for the summer concerts and also do a cleanup in that area. And that's it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. KING: Thank you. Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I receive d a complaint about an empty vacant lot at 736-738 Prescott Avenue. There was a property there that was condemn ed and torn down. And with the storm that happened over the weekend there was -- there were a number of large branches that fell onto that property and the neighboring property . And I thank DPW for coming by to help clean that up. But there were still a couple issues with that property . And I think a part of the trees is hanging over onto one of the resident 's roofs. There's also a missing retaining wall which is causing flooding into the cellar of a neighbor . I wanted to find out who own owes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 the property if it's through the Land Bank or if there is an owner so that -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : To get those issues address ed. Thank you, appreciate it. That's all that I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple things. As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, a couple people came to me with questions , residents . So it's no surprise that we were looking at a new fire truck for Engine 4, Ladder 4. We kind of threw it around and knew about it. But someone present ed to me a Facebook post that there's a contract already in motion to pay for this million dollar-plus truck. You know, our understanding that, you know, anything that goes out to bid over 10 grand needs to be bid. So with that said -- also, my understanding is that there is a new apparatus acquisition committee that's suppose d to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 involved in that process , okay, so meaning that, you know, there's a master mechanic , deputy chief, a fire officer to the apparatus slated for replacement and a chauffeur assigned to that apparatus slated for replacement , a private assigned to apparatus slated for replacement , and a union official appoint ed by the president . So I hope that they were at the table for this and had great input with regards to the purchase and the selection because it doesn't look like there was more than one bid because they have to operate this machine , I mean, this new truck. They have to drive it. They have to work on it. So I hope that this decision was made with everybody included as I mentioned . But in addition to that, I also received something that was a little disturbing . And this has nothing to do with the firefighters themselves . So we passed legislation in 2021, all right? For the most part it pretty much says that the City of Scranton Bureau of Fire will reimburse a fee in the event of a motor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 vehicle accident shall be for vehicle s fee or per pedestrian or per bicyclist when a fire department vehicle responds . And there's a list of costs. And that's okay, you know, if there is fuel spillage. So, you know, the firefighters , that's above and beyond pretty much their scope when in regards to the city. I look at it that way and I could see the car insurance paying for that. But someone sent me a bill. This wasn't for a vehicle accident . It was for someone 's house, a structural fire where he had a list of charges $3,400. So this disturbs me because we pay taxes. And, you know, included in our taxes is fire and police services and we have great professional police department and a professional fire department . This is nothing against them. But my understanding is, you know, when they go to a fire anymore they have to present costs to administration and then it's billed. I see no -- in this piece of legislation of 2021 with regards to structural . Okay, I get the automobile , you know, accident 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 thing where, you know, we have to go and we should do that. But we should charge and I understand that. And the car insurance will pay for that. So, Mr. Voldenberg , so these concerns I'm bringing to you to reach out to Chief Judge. And I would love it to have them come in for a caucus and explain to us, okay, it's great we're getting a new truck. We need it. And I'm always for providing the resources and equipment for public safety because that's one of our, you know, health, safety, and welfare of our community is priority one. But I would like to see, you know, procedural issue that might be present itself here. Did we put it out to bid, was the committee who contractual ly was supposed to be involved in that process was, are they happy with the selection because this is a major purchase . MR. VOLDENBERG : May is open. May is open. I'll send the invite. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. And also, confirm to us -- I don't think we should wait until May for this confirmation piece are we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 charging resident s for structural fires in addition to the taxes we already pay. I actually have a copy of the bill. And I also heard there was another one that was even double this amount. All right? And then next, Mr. Coyne made a great point that, you know, we're going through the HUP process , right, and that's to take a look, a deeper dive or a deeper look at nonprofit s to see, you know, if it's still -- if it still applies to them. But I think, you know, the rental fee you brought up, it's good idea. We have to look under every rock for revenue or savings . So I think it's a rock maybe we never looked under. And the rental fee if it's an ordinance and it's a law in the city and a dorm room is consider ed a rental unit, it's, you know, revenue processing . So I think it's a great idea. Will you have -- because I know the HUP is starting. Can you send that down to administration , you know, maybe -- let's explore this. Let's explore everything during that process take a, you know, have legal take a look at our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 ordinance , does it apply or not or could it after the HUP test? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And that's all I have. Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Earlier this evening an individual commented on my ability as the Council President to not allow certain things, certain comments made during Council meeting s. I think I've been pretty open and liberal in terms of allowing people to speak their mind and come up and express their opinions . But, you know, under Council rules, name calling, profanity , racial and ethnic slurs and any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall not be permitted. The Council President shall have sole discretion in determining if and when any person violates these rules. So very simply, those are Council rules. And I typically don't call anybody out of order. So if somebody is going to come up here and make racist comment s, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 I'm going to call them out on it. If somebody is going to come up and accuse us unsubstantiated accusation s that any of us are on the take up here, I'm going to call them out of the order. So it's as simple as that. Like it or not like it, that's what's going to happen. Okay, moving along, the zoning ordinance was mentioned earlier that we should pass that tonight . Well, based on the advice of City Solicitor we're advertising after ten days. We've gone this far. We're going to do the right thing and we're going to make sure that we don't make a mistake by not advertising it for ten days because we made amendment s last week and the public did not have an opportunity to comment on those amendments tonight . They did -- you know, a couple did comment that they were happy with those amendments . I think that's appropriate . Next week they'll have another opportunity to do that. It was advertised on Friday, April 28th in the newspaper . We're going to follow the proper procedure because the last thing I want to do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 is try to pass a zoning ordinance that's taken a year and a half to two years, not just in Scranton but that's gone all throughout the communities and make a mistake . So we're going to do it the right way. I'm going to follow the advice of our -- the City Solicitor . And next week that will come up for a final vote. And the public will have an opportunity to speak on that again. Also, just some followup from some speakers last week, 1525 Blucher Avenue, notified DPW. And they confirmed they will visit a property to review sandbag barriers to affect water flow onto the property on East Mountain . HRG regarding East Mountain stormwater study in addition to all of the city, reached out to the city OECD Director and advised HRG tentative ly schedule d for a visit June 20th. Will work with OECD and HRG to move the caucus to May, if possible . Les Spindler , 1449 and 1451 North Rebecca Avenue and Bulwer Street, DPW advised the street is on the 2023 paving list and repairs to the street curbing and drainage to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 the corner will take place at that time. Also, our Council office asked DPW Director to possibly locate replacement cans for ash cans taken in error by DPW workers. DPW advised there are none available -- no available cans to replace at this time. Perhaps we can look and see when we're going to have some -- at least some of those blue cans for recycling available . Maybe we could give those to Mr. Spindler . MR. MCANDREW : (Inaudible .) MR. KING: Help him out. MR. MCANDREW : All right. MR. KING: Evann and Krysten Xanthis , Scranton Police will increase patrols on the block and ask resident s to call Scranton Police dispatch at 570-348-4134 as issues occur so that a car may be directly dispatched to the block. I understand there is an ordinance that was past several years ago about trucks -- idling trucks. There could be no idling trucks between the hours of 7 p.m., I think, and 7 a.m., in that area. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 sir. MR. KING: Thank you. Kathleen McDonald , 1119 Jackson Street, zoning and LIPS management is reviewing the matter and to advise, specifically regarding the condemnation and the subsequent place back of the electric meter -- subsequent placing back of the electric meter that was removed . A speaker asked if we would send a letter to Public Utility Commission concerning recent tax -- recent rate hikes. So I will read this into the record. I prepared this today and all the Council members were willing to sign this afternoon on arrival. To Whom It May Concern : I'm writing this letter on behalf of both the entire Scranton City Council and the tax-paying citizens of the City of Scranton . We want to express our concerns about the constantly increasing cost of utilities to the citizens of this great city. As I'm sure you are aware, a large portion of our citizenry lives at or below the poverty level and many of our residents are senior citizens living on fixed incomes . These 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 constant price hikes have put a tremendous burden on our citizenry , and we are looking for some relief. In a recent Scranton Times-Tribune newspaper article written by Jim Lockwood on December 14, 2022, it was stated that Scranton and Dunmore homeowners will pay $576 more per year on average , a 41 percent increase in water and sewer bills under a rate-hike settlement approved by state regulators . The article further goes on to say, that for a typical Scranton /Dunmore customer using 3,212 gallons per month, the water rate increase will be $8.76 a month. But the sewer rate will soar from $55.75 to $95.01 per month, which is an increase of $39.26, or a 70.4% rise according to Pennsylvania American Water Company . Combined , the $8.76 water rate increase and $39.26 wastewater rate hike add up to $48.02 more per month for the average Scranton /Dunmore residential customer or $576.24 per year. Residents from Dunmore and Scranton who each keep tabs on their respective municipality 's finances said the increases will 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 hit the elderly and poor hard. We are, therefore , requesting a moratorium on future utility rate hikes for the remainder of 2023 year. These astronomical rate hikes are simply not sustainable for most of our citizens and will likely cause some elderly citizens to have to leave their homes. While we agree that the costs of upkeep and repairs in maintaining the public utility systems are costly, placing rate hikes as high as 41% and 70.4% is exorbitant and simply unacceptable . Please consider this plea on behalf of the good citizens of the City of Scranton . Sincerely , William F. King, Mark McAndrew , Tom Schuster , Dr. Jessica Rothchild , Gerald Smurl. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , so we've had a contract with this company from March of 2022 to March of 2023. The original contract was six months and the funds to pay for that contract came out of OECD the CDBG admin funds. There was a six month extension . So, Mr. Voldenberg , I had a couple questions if you could send over to the administration . What funds did the additional six months come from? And who decided to extend the contract ? And will -- I know in the backup document s we have that CDBG funds will cover this contract . It is a two year contract with a one year extension . So will those funds cover all three years of that contract ? Also, in last year's contract there was reporting and tracking included in the contract . They track social media and website analytics , perform metrics and measure s benchmarking Scranton 's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 progress and monthly status reports . Have these been done by the company ? Have they been submitted to the city? And there was also an annual status report to be complete as part of that contract . Can you find out if that annual status report was complete d and submitted to the city? I could send this all in an e-mail to you after the meeting . MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : You're welcome . That's all for now. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I believe those reports were completed . I had similar question s about this legislation that I had asked Eileen Cipriani about. And she had sent a recap from Press Record Communications about what their work has been over their one year contract . So -- and I believe she said it also lessened from $40,000 for the one year and they put it out to bid for a lesser amount, $25,000 and that they by far had -- MR. SCHUSTER : Were these questions sent to us, all of Council ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 MR. MCANDREW : No. DR. ROTHCHILD : No. But I could forward what I have. And I'm sure you'll get the answers to your questions . MR. VOLDENBERG : I did forward that this afternoon . MR. MCANDREW : All right. On the question , I want a copy of that report card too. I think I mentioned that in caucus. And I also want to know how it's going to be funded for the next three years, is it partial ly, OECD for a year or two and then we pick up the cost? So I'll vote yes to move it until we get our questions answered . MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR.
