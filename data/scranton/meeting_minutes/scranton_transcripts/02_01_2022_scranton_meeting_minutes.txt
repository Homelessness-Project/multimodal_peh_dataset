MR. DONAHUE : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially Thomas Coyle, Attorney Christopher Osborne , and Judy Teserovitch , all of the Coyle, Osborne , and Teserovitch families are in our thought s tonight . Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Here. There will be a motion this evening to move Item 5-E to Seventh Order for a final vote. This is a resolution which amends the Rules of Council to authorize Council members to attend a Council meeting 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 electronically . Anyone who would like to speak on this piece of legislation may do so in Fourth Order during Citizens Participation . Please dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. OVERTIME REVIEW FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER DATED JANUARY 26, 2022 FOR JANUARY 2022. 3-B. AGENDA FOR THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING TO BE HELD FEBRUARY 2, 2022. 3-C. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON LACKAWANNA HEALTH & WELFARE AUTHORITY MEETING HELD DECEMBER 16, 2021. MR. DONAHUE : Are there any comment s on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do. I have two announcements this evening . The first, I just wanted to remind people that had brought this up last week but the City's Economic Development Survey is still posted to the website and available at the public library and in the lobby of City Hall.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 So anyone is welcome to complete that survey. We're looking for -- to have as many responses as we can. And that will be available through February 14th. The other thing that I wanted to announce that is happening this weekend in Scranton is the Ice Festival . And it's the second year that we'll have one in our City. I actually went to the Clarks Summit one this past weekend . And I'm going to our city's ice festival sometime this weekend . It's happening from Friday through Sunday. And there will be ice sculptures around a lot of businesses downtown . If you go to their Facebook page at Scranton Ice Fest 2022, they even have a map of where the ice sculptures are. So it's pretty neat. And then it also gives you the opportunity to stop into those businesses and contribute towards our economy here in Scranton . So that's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else have any announcements ? MR. KING: I'm just going to say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 briefly , in our City especially in the winter, many of you know I have a bit of a running background , not a recent running background -- several years ago. But I'm involved in the Steamtown Marathon . In the winter it's very difficult for the runners to try to -- they're still trying to get out an exercise . A lot of them are getting prepared for the Scranton Half Marathon . And they do a pretty good job of wearing reflective vests and lights. And I just would ask that our drivers please be careful and look out for our runners that are out there trying to exercise in the winter. It's very difficult because , as I said, there's a lot of sidewalks are still slippery . The roads because of the snow and ice, it makes a little bit more difficult to get around. So I just -- I don't want to see somebody get hit by a car that's out there trying to keep themselves healthy . So that's all, just a public service announcement on that. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? I just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 have one. An executive session was held this evening prior to caucus with the Mayor, Business Administrator , and City Solicitor to discuss personnel issues. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First speaker on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , City resident . Do we have an audit yet? MR. DONAHUE : We do not. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey dokey. And are we still negotiating union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : We are. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. With regard to 5-B, appoint Reilly and Associates to do consulting engineering services , I'm unclear on one concept . Do we have a City engineer or not? MR. DONAHUE : So we usually outsource that. The City engineer is contracted out -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. So will this be to appoint a new City engineer basically ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. All right. I didn't see that spelled out in the backup. And with regard to Item 5-E, the Rules of Council , I read that document . And one point particularly bothered me and that was section 19. Any person who requests information from Council during Citizens Participation shall do so in writing . Well, when you opened up City Council meetings last June to the public, people like me because I don't have Zoom -- I -- every meeting I prepare d written statements , written questions . And I didn't always get responses to my written questions . And I would like to know why. I think that this sentence is misleading because you obviously allow people to come up to the podium to ask you simple questions like when is the next caucus. You need to specify which types of question should be put in writing . And there are times they should be when somebody wants information that's not readily available during the Council meeting and put it in writing . But the flip side of that coin is you need to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 answer that citizen . Even if the answer is information is not available , I don't know, we have a limited response and here's what we were able to get. But you don't need to leave the citizen hanging . So if you're going to say we have to present all of our question s in writing , I think that you have to then respond , not necessarily in writing but you got to respond . And I just think this is too vague of a statement that, you know, if you have a question you have to put it in writing . You need to relook that one sentence . I saw in yesterday 's paper the article about repairs at Nay Aug gorge. The deck overlooking the gorge is up first. I'm kind of curious , do we have a warranty on how long those repairs are going to last so we don't have to do it again because they're replacing the wooden deck with wood. I would suspect that's not going to last forever because this is the kind of thing that used to be encapsulated in long term capital budgets, you know, maintenance issues like Nay Aug because they're expensive , the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 firehouses , this building , the Serrenti Center. But I'd be very curious , you know, they are going to do these repairs to the railing s and the decks, how long is that suppose d to last? Let's see, I was very happy to see that the garage at 1709 Wyoming Avenue finally bit the dust. I expected to see Al Young here tonight but apparently he didn't want to come. But I was not happy to see the overtime statistics as of January 26th. It looks like we're starting to exceed our overtime budget again; LIPS, 20.75 percent for 26 days. You know, I mean, I'm sure for the entire month it is much higher than that. I would expect DPW would incur costs because of the weather . But it looks like, you know, our total overtime 11.5 percent for less than a month we're going -- again going to get into some kind of trouble . And I saw that the county has extended its declaration of emergency for the pandemic through the end of February . Does that cause a problem for City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Hall and, you know, because I understand City Hall is opening to the public next week. MR. DONAHUE : I believe they declared their emergency just to access certain resources that are only available under a declared -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, I think they -- yeah, I saw also they may have an issue with the Sunshine Act but that's their headache , not yours. Thank you. You all have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. You too. Next on the list is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Good evening Council . First I want to address the Mayor's survey. I was not encouraged by my neighborhood being listed as other. It doesn't give me a lot of confidence that proper attention will be given to my other neighborhood of Minooka . It was released on January 19th on YouTube . It was the guidance for the American Rescue Plan funding. The Mayor's video stated we have received valuable input from community members through one-on-one interview s in small 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 group sessions held with more than 45 stakeholders and through a series of working sessions attended by more than 60 community stakeholders . It refers to data analysis . The survey open to the public online for 12 days which obviously is extended now and in City Hall for eight working days. The response time was far too short that with ECTV info saying it was as available at City Hall for the time City Hall was also publically advertised as closed by the Mayor seems to dissuade public input. For clarity , who were the stakeholder s, industry leaders , business owners, and community activists asked to plan under cover of darkness ? Why are they not disclosed ? The Sunshine Act defines a meeting as any prearrange d gathering of an agency which is attended or participated by a quorum of with the members of an agency held for the purpose of deliberating an agency business or taking official action. Deliberation is defined as discussion of agency business held for the purpose of making a decision . All of these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 meeting s were held for the purpose of making a decision . These stakeholder meeting s should have been public, minutes produced , attendees; listed. What we have is not a survey for public input but a preapprove d multiple choice devoid the residents and taxpayer 's input. They did not want to know what the public wanted. It wanted to tell them what the leaders thought they should have. Wilkes-Barre in its own action first up from the top was $300 funds to low income in this community . Scrantonians have asked for water runoff repairs, sidewalks , none reflect ed in the survey. Stepping off from this and touching on sidewalks , I'm asking for the community 's help. Returning home on Monday the 24th from getting coffee at a convenience store from Birney Avenue in Moosic was a 36-year-old woman. She was forced to walk on the street due to ice and frozen snowbanks created by plows, piled up snow, and ice on sidewalks not cleared . At 1:30 a.m., she walked south just past Gerrity 's market's first entrance in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Moosic. She was struck by a dark SUV who continued north leaving her broken body unconscious on the opposite lane in 15 degree weather . This southbound car swerved and just missed her calling it in, a second stop and blocked the body. The woman lie dying with one of her newly purchased boots knocked a distance right off of her foot. The EMTs had time to -- had to take time to stabilize her so she could even be transported and then she died yesterday . She had a large white vinyl purse and that should have been visible even at 1 a.m. Whoever hit her continued in the direction of Scranton . Somewhere out there is a SUV that has front end damage on Monday morning . The person left her in the southbound traffic lane and left her to a high chance that she would just be run over again. This was Sunday night into Monday morning . So it's most likely not bar and alcohol related . If anyone in the community has any information , please reach out and contact the Moosic Police. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. Marie Schumacher . I would like to comment first I guess on that survey, the same. I saw it in the paper. I pulled it up online. And I got to question two and after that I sent it in saying this is not asking me what I would like. If I had an other in the right place, stormwater and our roads. And even though it did say something about economic development , who wants to come to a city that wrecks your car? I mean, the City streets -- and who wants to have problems like hopefully are getting solved over on Wyoming Avenue now. And some day I would like somebody to give us an update on what is happening over in West Side with Mr. Srebro and the people over on Merrifield . Has anything happened? I mean, I know they got a -- they got money to do something over there. But we don't -- then we get a project person, I guess. I can't even find out what lists -- what the lists of project s are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 but -- and that leads into another thing because instead of on this 5-E, I had not read it. But if you don't want to be bothered with our questions , we can go -- the Mayor does have Chris. And he takes them. But I think that is sort of bad in a lot of ways because people can hear it or see it on their TV what is being brought up. But if you just go directly to somebody and get some statistic s or whatever , the rest of the people that are out there don't get to share in that information . So I think that does need some work. Back to last week. I thought I was in some kind of other world. People were asking who is the Chief of Police. All of those things were in the paper. But that was putting the cart before the horse. And then I saw a couple days ago, I saw a picture in the paper where we have nine new firefighters. I would like to know how many -- have nine firefighters retired or are we over the head count that's been authorized ? MR. DONAHUE : We're definitely not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 over the head count. There was at least 9 or 10 that retired at the end of the year. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. So and when is Scranton Tomorrow going to come and tell us what's going on too? You know, you've told us -- or not you -- the five of you but Council has told us in the past they come on a regular basis and tell us what's going on. And I -- MR. DONAHUE : We're trying to schedule them for March. We did offer them next week. But then we have a schedule of guests in between the 15th of February and March 8th. So we're trying to schedule them as soon as possible . MS. SCHUMACHER : And that's another thing, when I brought up stormwater a while back you said -- and I brought up SAPA, you said SAPA was going to be down here. I thought it was the next week or at least two weeks out. What happened to that? MR. DONAHUE : So on SAPA, it came back from the 45-day period with the County Planning Commission . On our agenda tonight is our Planning Commission 's agenda for this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Thursday . We're anticipating that our Planning Commission will recommend the zoning changes that are incorporated in SAPA. And then it will come down in legislation once the Planning Commission approves it on Thursday -- assuming the Planning Commission approves it on Thursday . MS. SCHUMACHER : And when do we expect to have a stormwater or authority or whatever you people are going to decide on? Is there any goal? I mean -- MR. DONAHUE : I'm hoping it's put in place by the beginning of next year. MS. SCHUMACHER : What? Another year? MR. DONAHUE : I mean, there's -- we've begun discussion s with other municipal ities. And those agreements need to be worked out and a schedule needs to be worked out about how it is actually created . MS. SCHUMACHER : I cannot believe -- I just cannot believe that it's dragging on this long. Unbelievable . Okay. I did have some other things. Is there any way that survey can be amended to look -- to really ask 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 what people care -- who cares. And what bothers me, I think it was referenced in there someplace about the rescue money. And I'm afraid this rescue money thing is going to be done behind our backs and I don't like that. MR. DONAHUE : So, thank you. You're out of time. I'll look into the survey thing. And then the rescue money, we will have a public caucus at the beginning of March regarding how we're planning on spending the first batch of rescue money. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : I could find out if there's any additional surveys that they're looking to put out. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I'd like to remind everybody that we vacated distressed okay, but the people at PEL recommended 14 percent tax increase for next year. And every year this has piled up. And it's not always the way it looks. Some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 people look at it as a couple of dollars . Well, when you put the trash tax on my mortgage escrow, the bank wants over $700 because they have to pay a $300 trash tax. I mean, it's -- I always pay my trash fees. And that's all there was to it. I had a lot of trouble when I first bought the house, it took me about four or five years just to get on the rolls. I had to come down here and argue with them to take my money. So not all the problems are people that just don't want to pay. And on recycle , I hope that you would take my advice and get the DPW on board with leaving clean cardboard behind because there's a lot of it. And we switched to a lot of mail order and stuff comes in huge boxes for the item that you're getting a couple of pet flea meds or something like that. And you have a box half the size of this podium. And I'm going to get into COVID now. Last week or the week before last, we had protest ers in Washington led by some that served in the Congress on vaccines and antivaxers. Well, over in Germany, there's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 counter protest ers now. So I think it's about time we start leading the counter protest against the dufaces that think that a little pinch of a needled and Saturday night sitting on your ditty box is not acceptable . There is no reason for it. I pointed out -- and by the way, I misspoke last week. Even if your phone is turned off, the battery has to be disconnected compliments of Tommy there. So the point is, that you could be anywhere -- and it could bail you out of something -- maybe somebody that looks like me will go in and rob a gas station up in West Side. I'd say, here. Here's my phone. I was at City Council , you know, or sort of looks like me on some grainy photo. On voting, the lower courts in Pennsylvania compliments of Jake Corman and his crew have ruled mail-in voting in its current state as unconstitutional . Now, that's expected to be overturned . But we have a massive assault on freedom in this country to vote. And in other states I know I've been told before, that a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 thousand people requested a mail-in ballot in Georgia . They went to the polls and voted because they never got it. Now they're being prosecuted . They could actually spend time in jail. And by the way, hiring an attorney is punitive in itself. You know, you spend tens of thousands of dollars proving you're innocent or fighting the charges and wind up in the slam anyway. You shouldn 't wind up in the slam. I don't care who you are. You should have a right to vote and convict -- exconvict , I don't care. You're paying taxes. And that's all there is to it. And these court decisions , I don't know where they're coming from. But it's amazing how somebody could go to a law school and come out and pass those kinds of decisions down. By the way, I also share a concern with the relief funds. It seems like everybody is lined up. And a lot of the times they're not the people without a fork and a spoon. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: With respect to -- well, I guess I could wait until 5-E comes up. I'm good right now. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : The only comment I would like to make is I was happy to hear that this week on Monday, January 31st, the garage that we've been talking about for quite some time now has been demolished . I know there's some -- still work to be done there in that area. But I was happy to hear that the garage did come down. That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : One thing that I was remiss in mentioning during announcements , I can't believe it's February already . But today's the first of February. It's the beginning of Black History Month. There are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 several events, many that -- the Black Scranton Project will be hosting . So I encourage the public to take a look into those and what's happening this month to celebrate . This weekend there will be the Pan-African flag raising taking place at City Hall. That will be Saturday at noon. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. So it's been no secret for the past couple weeks we've been asking for resumes , job descriptions , personnel reports for upcoming appointments . For the appointments for the past year we've been asking for personnel reports and job descriptions . So today we receive d a memo from Solicitor Eskra. And it states regarding appointments . And I'm going to read this into the record. And here's the memo: In response to recent remarks that Council is awaiting legislation regarding the appointment of certain administrative members of the City staff, I write to clarify when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 advice and consent from City Council is require d for appointment s. 6-6 of the Administrative Code for City outlines the list of departments which includes one, Administrative ; two, Community Development ; three, Public Works; four, Law; five, Parks and Recreation ; six, Police; seven, Fire; and then 6-6 also City of Scranton Administrative Code regarding these department director s and code further provides : Each department shall be headed by a director appointed by the Mayor with the advice of Council -- I'm sorry, with -- and consent of Council solely on the basis of executive and administrative qualifications appropriate to the duties of each department . 6-6(B), City of Scranton Administrative Code, furthermore , Department Director shall appoint subordinate officer s and employees within the respect ive departments and may with the approval of the Mayor remove any such officers or employees . City of Scranton Administrative Code, based upon the foregoing, it is not a requirement of the code that the appointment of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 bureau directors examples being Information Technology Director , Director of Human Resources and etc., whichever -- them positions that she's referring to -- be subject to City Council approval . Only those department heads enumerated are subject to approval by Council . While we appreciate Council 's input to promote efficient operations at City Hall and enable to us to manage our teams and operation s effectively , it is critical that we staff these key leadership positions as expeditiously as possible . So now we're being told that the department director s and bureau directors are not one in the same. For the past I don't know how many administration s they were all voted on by Council -- their cabinet members . So I disagree with Solicitor Eskra. We sit in these seats in front of you by the will of the people. Our role is oversight and scrutiny on behalf of the citizens . Now the legal department has come up with a different determination or an opinion out of nowhere . All right, so like I said earlier , department 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 directors and bureau directors are one in the same. They've always been. Now, it's been determined they're not. I don't know. We need to provide oversight on positions more now than ever as City Hall has become a revolving door of appointments . We discuss ed this in caucus. And Solicitor Gallagher is going to send a response to this memo. And then we'll probably have more discussions on this. I just wanted to report this out to the citizens . That is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I'm not going to reiterate , you know, anything Mr. McAndrew just said. But I also disagree with this assessment . You know, when we went through budget time we were brought a proposal that tried to get more parity within department directors. And that included Information Technology , Director of Human Services , etc. So I believe we, you know, we're not trying to put a wrench in the gears of city government here. We're just trying to perform our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 oversight capabilities . And I believe that is all director positions . In terms of one of Miss Hodowanitz 's questions regarding the warranty on the products for the Davis trail, so those -- those supplies are actually being donated to us from the Aztek Corporation . And they make the trex -- the trex boards. So it wouldn't be wood treated . It will be using those trex boards. They seem to last a lot longer and require less annual maintenance than, you know, treated wood. And that's all I have for tonight . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND REILLY ASSOCIATES TO PROVIDE CONSULTING ENGINEERING SERVICES . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , I will be voting tonight for introduction of this. However , I think since January 7th I asked Mr. Voldenberg to submit some questions concerning this appointment , pretty basic questions I think, how many firms responded to the RFQ, who were the other firms that responded , what criteria was used to select the recommended firm, who served on the committee that selected this successful firm, how will they be compensated , hourly rate, monthly retainer, and so on. As I said, that was January 7th. And each -- every week Mr. Voldenberg continues to submit those questions . And we don't get an answer. So I will vote to introduce this tonight . But if I don't have answers to those questions , ultimately I will be voting no. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , I'd also like to echo Councilman King when he did ask these questions . I reiterate that I would also like the answers to those question s that he has stated here tonight . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 It did seem like basic information for Council to make a decision . And we have verified that the administration has received those questions . There should be no reason that we don't receive this before final passage . So I would be in agreement with him that I would not vote for final passage unless the questions have been answered . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I will also vote yes to introduce but with reservation . In addition to the question s that Councilman King and Councilman Schuster posed, I asked a simple one that we have to beg for every time we receive an RFQ or an RFP that comes down through legislation . I ask for the financial disclosure or in relation to possible donations . It seems it's suppose d to be provided . You always seem to have to beg for it. If I don't receive that document by final passage , I will also be a no. MR. KING: On the question also, I think it was mentioned earlier . Why is this presented as an ordinance ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, that's -- so that was something I was going to bring up that Solicitor Gallagher is going to check with the Law Department on. Usually when we get contract s they come down as resolution s and not ordinances . So Solicitor Gallagher is going to check on that. MR. KING: And once again, we talk about the expedience of government . Well, here's an example where Reilly and Associates is already doing work and they haven't been approved yet. So it's already is being expedited . I mean, that's another prime example of how -- typically , you know, I'm not trying to put a cog in the wheel here or to be an obstruction ist by any means. But we were all elected officials to ask these types of question s. I think it's important that we get the answers before we move forward . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . And something we also discuss ed in caucus too was to have Mr. Voldenberg reach out to the administration with -- again with Mr. King's questions and put a deadline at the end of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 week -- at the end of week, close of business on Friday for us to consider next week because we can't get into a situation where, you know, we get response s to our questions on Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 and then, you know, be expected to make a decision that night on the information we just received . So we are going to put an end -- a close of business on Friday to continue this for next week. Anyone else? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AMENDING RESOLUTION NO. 175, 2021, ENTITLED “AMENDING NO. 47, 2011 ‘AUTHORIZING , EMPOWERING AND DIRECTING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO APPOINT LIAISONS BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND BERKHEIMER , THE DULY APPOINTED COLLECTOR OF EARNED INCOME TAX FOR THE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 LACKAWANNA COUNTY ‘TAX COLLECTION DISTRICT ’, FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF SHARING CONFIDENTIAL TAX INFORMATION WITH THE DISTRICT FOR OFFICIAL PURPOSES ’ TO UPDATE CITY OF SCRANTON REPRESENTATIVES AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE CONFIDENTIAL TAX INFORMATION ” TO REMOVE MARY JO SHERIDAN AND ALLOW FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TREASURER , MEGHAN RADE, TO BE AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE CONFIDENTIAL TAX INFORMATION . MR. DONAHUE : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , this is something I brought up in caucus tonight . You know, the issue that Mr. McAndrew spoke about earlier when it comes to appointments and whether City Council has approval power over these appointments , I think it's something that comes into play here. The person that they're looking to appoint to receive this information has not actually been appoint ed to the position in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 City as of yet. They are doing the work there, but they haven't been appointed as of yet. I think possibly maybe we got that memo today because I did ask for resumes of some of the new appointment s that will be coming up. And we have not received those as of yet. This one here is something I'm going to be thinking a lot about because I don't know if I would be voting yes for this prior to this person's appointment . So I would like to see the resumes . And Council does have the advice and consent based upon qualifications as stated in there -- in the code. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, this is another example . So we're approving the role of this person who has yet -- who is actively working as Treasurer but hasn't come down for a vote yet. I mean, at this -- we're working a little backwards here. So it's confusing. But our job is to scrutinize . So that's what we're doing. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else? All 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR.
