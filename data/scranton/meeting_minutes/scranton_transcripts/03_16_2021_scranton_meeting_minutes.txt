MR. GAUGHAN : Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and also for those who have passed away in our community , especially former State Representative of the 113th legislation district , Gaynor Cawley. Gaynor Cawley served 25 years from 1980 to 2006. Representative Cawley was a friend to all of those who knew him. He was a representative who fought for all of the people in his district including the majority of Scranton that he had in his district and a real true public servant . And he is going to be missed. Also, keep in our prayers the Scott -- Reverend Scott Pilarz, University of Scranton President who passed away recently from complications from ALS -- his fight with ALS. He dedicated his life to the service of others. And he was a really great person who had a tremendous impact on our city and on our region. And he will be greatly missed. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 And also, if we could take a moment of silence for all of the people in our community , in our country and our world who have passed away from the coronavirus and who have been affected by the coronavirus . As we all know, the pandemic has turned our world completely upside down. But we must remain hopeful and strong. We continue to pray for the doctors , the nurses, the researchers and all medical professionals who seek to heal and help those affected and who put themselves at risk in the process , may they have protection and peace.

ROTHCHILD : Yeah, I know that that you had already mentioned about the passing of Reverend Scott Pilarz. But I just wanted to bring it up as well as a former student from the University of Scranton . He was President during my undergraduate years there and then he had come back for the last few years. And, you know, I have been really saddened to hear of his ALS diagnosis and now of his passing . And I know the university community as well as the City of Scranton is really mourning his loss. He'll definitely be missed. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other announcements ? I'd also like to wish everyone a happy St. Patrick 's Day. Every year I mention the impact that the Irish have had on Scranton as we all know. You can't go far in Scranton without running into someone who has roots in Ireland , whether it's County Mayo in Ballina which is our sister City which we've made really strong connections with over the years going back to Mayor Jim Connors from Minooka . And, you know, I just wanted to wish everyone a happy St. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Patrick 's Day and to remember the contributions of all of our immigrant groups in the City in building Scranton up going back to the 1800s, but also particularly on tomorrow 's date the Irish who again no matter where you go in the City you could see the impact that they've had. Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : At this time would someone please make a motion to accept public comment from the following individuals : Marie Schumacher . MR. DONAHUE : I make a motion to accept public comment . MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : There's been a motion and a second to accept public comment . Mrs. Reed, would you please read the public comment into the record? MS. REED: Thank you. The first submission is from Marie Schumacher as follows : O "MAKE SCRANTON YOUR HOME OFFICE. PAY ZERO TAXES FOR A DECADE." "COME TO SCRANTON FOR TAX FREE 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 REWARD 10 YEAR 100% TAX FREE." These are the content of two billboards that are and/or have been posted around town. To me they belong in a "Bait and Switch" Category . If they are promoting LERTA.. Is the City paying for them or receiving them free? If I owned a business and found the 10 Year/100% Tax Free applied only to improvements I made to my property I would not only be angry I would also never trust Scranton and pass the word around. O The Novembrino Pools closed in 2011 and it took the CIty five years to decide what to do. Now, ten years after the pools closed a drive-by indicates the Park may open again this Summer as a Splash Pad.park.PIne Brook residents have been asking for a reopening of the Capouse Pool for well over a decade.and they have received nothing . Please explain why you are urging going into debt for re-opening a Nay Aug Pool 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 while others must wait.and wait? O Would it be possible when you are asking for grants to provide the cut-off date if there is one? Running out of time. More to come in days ahead. (Concludes public comment as submitted to Council .) MS. REED: And that is all the public participation . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mrs. Reed. On the question ? MR. DONAHUE : On the question , if those billboards were referring to the LERTA, thinking back to when we passed the LERTA I believe it was the Chamber of Commerce who said that they were going to take up the promotion of that. So that would be the Chamber of Commerce that paid for it to answer that part of the question . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? I want to thank Mrs. Schumacher for her comments and we'll take 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 them into consideration and try to get some of these questions answered. The one comment I have related to what Miss Schumacher had sent into us regarding the Nay Aug Pool, I don't think anyone last week urged -- was urging the City to go into debt. What I think Council was saying is that the Nay Aug Pool and Nay Aug Park as a whole is very important to the City. It's one of our biggest assets. So we're, you know, going to work together with the Mayor and her administration to make sure that that pool does get open. The company that came in last week is coming at the end of March with another update. So that's an ongoing situation . But I think we should look at any avenue to make sure that we do the right thing up there. And, you know, so it lasts for the next 40 to 50 years. You know, we need to make the investment and do it the right way. I think last week as well might have been Mr. McLane that mentioned Novembrino park -- the Novembrino Pool rather and the ongoing improvements there. It's my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 understanding that that is going to be wrapping up soon hopefully by this summer. We can double-check on that. Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. And now we are going to turn our attention to some of our guests who we have here tonight . So we have our City Solicitor , Joe O'Brien and we have our City Planner , Don King who is here to talk to us and give us an update on agenda Item 7C which is the sponsorship agreement that the City is going to enter into with the Department of Environmental Protection regarding the Meadow Brook Creek project . So I'll turn it over to Solicitor O'Brien and our City Planner , Don King to speak to this project . ATTY. O'BRIEN: Don, do you want me to go first or do you want to take it? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 MR. KING: You could go first, Joe. ATTY. O'BRIEN: Okay. The -- as you know, the Meadow Brook is a creek that extends from up around Moosic Lake somewhere down to the Lackawanna River right behind the cement block plant, just a bit up from the old lace company . If you look at today, you know, a lot of law offices , ours being one they have these old maps in the City, beautiful old hand-drawn maps of the City that -- of the entire City that shows the Meadow Brook, you know, creek a hundred years ago. But over the years it was covered up and encapsulated in a concrete culvert -- arch -- with a concrete arch -- concrete sides, concrete top with just a surface bottom. And from the point where it entered Scranton at the Pennsylvania State School For the Deaf at the corner of North Washington and Electric Street, there's only one remaining part that is above ground and that is behind the Green Ridge Club. It extends down -- all the way down to the river. Now, the portion of the creek to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 river to about Green Ridge Street was previously reconstructed pursuant to state funding and everything a number of years ago. Half of the project was done. Now the remainder of the half of Green Ridge Street to the Scranton State School for the Deaf -- I grew up in the neighborhood right around the corner so I still call it that. But it's now Marywood , whatever . But now so the state has now come forward and they are going to pay for the complete reconstruction of the culvert . What they're going to do is they're going to -- they're not going to reconstruct the concrete arch. That would cost million s. But what they're going to do is they're going to put a 50 diameter inch pipe, 50-inch diameter pipe extending from the opening at Green Ridge and Electric . You may be familiar with that opening there all the way down to the area where it was reconstructed on Green Ridge Street. And it's fully anticipate d that that will solve all the problems going forward . The complete construction cost 7 or 8 million 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 dollars are going to be paid by the state. So the City is not going to pay any of that. However , under the terms of the state of the sponsor ship agreement , the City is responsible for two parts of the cost. We have to pay the soft cost. The soft costs are legal easements , appraisals , surveys reconstruction of the yards and sidewalks and things like that. Over 40 properties involved from the point of Green Ridge and Electric out to Green Ridge Street. An estimate that's going to cost a million dollars . The City also has to pay for the other costs. The soft cost are legal. The other costs are reconstruction of the yards. The total cost is going to be 2 million , 1 million soft, legal surveying ; one million other which is putting the yards and everything back to their shape. We're going to have to -- I think we're going to have to move a swimming pool. That's one of the things that we're going to have to do in the 50 properties . So there's a 2 million dollar cost to the City. And the idea of the sponsorship agreement is that the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Council has to approve it. And once it's approved the state will come into the full reconstruction cost of the culvert which I think are between 7 and 8 million . We have an application in with Pennvest to cover our share. John Pocius does not think that Pennvest can cover the -- that share against the state grant Pennvest won't cover the municipality share. But we have the application in. We're talking to Rebecca Kennedy of Pennvest . We're hoping she could help us in some way. If not, I think it would be the plan, obviously , the City and City Council (inaudible ) money in the bank. It would be the plan this would be part of the borrowing . In the budget there there's a provision for the City's going to have to do some capital borrowing this year. I think one of the things at the top of the list would be the borrowing to cover the soft cost and the other costs of this project . It's going to take a long time because just the idea -- just imagine how much it's -- long it's going to take to get 40 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 surveys , 40 easements , 40 appraisals , 40 legal documents worked out. So as soon as the -- soon as the sponsorship agreement final approval , if it does, that's where we're going to begin. We're going to begin with the soft cost and get that going and then prepare a bid for what we call the other and for the construction cost. It's a bid project . It has to be bid. Reilly Engineering did the drawing . I dropped a copy off for you in Lori's office. But I understand she had a little trouble uploading it because it's a big -- it's a 10-page plan of large paper that shows the full length of the construction project . It's very good, very informative , very easy to understand . And if you can't -- if anybody is unable to access it on your system, just let me know and I'll make arrangements to get you a copy. So that's what the project is. That's why we needed this sponsorship agreement . Now, a question has been raised I think by Councilman Schuster about a temporary fix. And I think the point he's making is it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 going to take a while. This isn't going to happen tomorrow . This is years this project to complete to get everything done. Hope to start soon but it's going to be a long time. Here's the problem with the temporary fix, number one, that's what got us in this trouble in the first place. In 2007, none of us, but a prior administration now of concern for the residents of Wyoming Avenue where the culvert had broken, it cracked and collapsed . And they were getting flooding in their backyard . And the City went out put that area where the culvert had collapsed put what they thought was the right thing, a 30-inch diameter pipe to carry the water through the collapsed area. And now we had a couple of major 100 year rainstorms since then. And as it turned out, the 30 inches isn't enough. It should be 50. So that's what's caused these major floods. At least that's what the engineers think. There's litigation over it. But the engineers say what caused these major floods is that putting in that 30-inch pipe in that area 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 on the 1700 of Wyoming . That's part of the problem with the temporary fix it gets us -- makes us libel if things don't go well. The second thing is the, you know, we have this extensive plan that's been done by Reilly that we have go out to bid upon. And we don't want to jeopardize that by doing something that the contractors that we hire and the engineers that are working on it is inconsistent with what they want to do. So that's the problem with that. So I think they're -- and, of course, the cost of a temporary fix you're talking a big cost. So that's -- they're there the problem s we see. I asked DPW to look into and see if there something they could do. But the idea of a temporary fix does involve multiple problems . MR. DONAHUE : Could I just -- because I believe there was a temporary fix that was done in '18 -- summer of '18, summer of '19. And I think it was the Young and Kennedy's property and it was a pipe. It was just a temporary pipe that sort of alleviated their problems for a minute but then once the garage collapsed a couple houses down, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 know, that created new issues. ATTY. O'BRIEN: Possibly . Possibly . MR. DONAHUE : There was something done there because I know in the Young's backyard there is a manhole that, you know, that wasn't there. So there was some pipe work done there I believe within the last -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: You're talking about the 2007 pipe work. That was -- MR. DONAHUE : No, I'm talking about, you know, since at least -- you know, as far back -- it was after the -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: Was that done by DPW? MR. DONAHUE : No, I think it was done by Valvano . I think we paid Valvano to do it. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so, Kyle, let me jump in here. I think Mr. O'Brien he first mention ed that 30-inch pipe. So I think that 30-inch pipe was first put in there. And what happened was when we got a storm it caused pressure . And that's what caused the flooding in the homes. So after that, we're talking about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the Valvano piece that Kyle is mention ing here. And there is 50-foot pipe in there. And that goes from that Young property to the Kennedy property to -- is it the McCrown {sic} property ? MR. KING: Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Those three properties there. And if I'm just going to estimate , I would say maybe there's 40 foot properties three of them in a row. So you got about a 150 feet with that manhole cover. Is the work that's done there behind those three properties , is the work in the ground complete right now is or that going to be reripped up and redone? ATTY. O'BRIEN: That's all redone. It going to all be redone. Reilly's proposal , they're going to install this new piping system -- 50-inch pipe the full length. Now so that there's no -- nothing in their plan about not doing it. The whole thing is going to need to be redone. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, then so number one -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: You could bring a contract or in there putting a -- this is going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 to be a major contract job, big job. You bring one of these big contractors in to do a mile of piping, they are not going to say, okay, let's leave the 50-foot pipe in for three houses. They don't want to be liable for that. They're not going to be liable for somebody else's work. So I'm sure it's going to be redone. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so that's my -- we're sure it's going to be redone or we think it's going to redone. ATTY. O'BRIEN: Well, I could tell you I'm sure of it and I'll confirm it with you. There's nothing in the plans that indicate that the whole project isn't going to be redone. But I will get back to you. MR. SCHUSTER : So that mile of piping goes from the ravine at the school of the deaf -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: Exactly . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. So it starts there, goes behind those houses and it's about a mile of piping that goes up -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: Is that a mile or -- MR. KING: I'd say about a half of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 mile. ATTY. O'BRIEN: It could be a half a mile. It might have been a whole mile all the way down to the river and half of it was done. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And the first thing I wanted to say is that that file that we got, I was unable to open it. I spoke to somebody from DEP that tried to open that as well. If you could get a copy of that to me that would be great. And is that public information ? MR. KING: Yes. ATTY. HAYES: Yes. ATTY. O'BRIEN: Yeah, it's a -- let me just hold it up. You could see how big it is. And it's 10 pages. You know, there are 10 different segments . And it is every property drawn in. It has all the streeting , all the work that has to be done in each individual property , all the other work. It's a very, very comprehensive plan. It covers everything , the easements needed. It's a very well done job. Again, all properties owners identified . There's a legend in there that has all the information you need. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 This will be what they -- this will be document one in the bid package when we put those out to bid. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And that was the document that we received that came from -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: Yes, it was uploaded. Now, I dropped a copy off at City Council Chambers . But Lori did tell me there was problem that some Council men had a problem with the uploading of it. It is a large document . It's a -- I don't know, what are these? MR. KING: Yes, I think I packaged -- the package that was e-mailed has about 10 different documents addressed in there. The right of way drawing s are part of that package . ATTY. O'BRIEN: You probably need a bigger size one then. So I'll drop -- I'll drop this off at Lori's and ask her to make large copies for the Council . MR. SCHUSTER : Do you want me to continue with some questions or do you want -- MR. DONAHUE : I just have one other real quick. In terms of the funding , I know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 going back to -- this was the fall of 2019. We were talking about, you know, extending that temporary fix down past the Dowling {sic} property where the garage collapsed and then was then condemned . So we were talking about -- and I don't know exactly what it is. But there was a million dollars in an account that was suppose d to be used as a match for, you know, as a start of a match for the final project . And in the fall of 2019, Dave Bulzoni was going to reach out to DEP to see if we could use some of that money to do a little bit of a temporary fix down a little bit and then replenish the money before there was -- before the final project , you know, or match was due or whatever we owed was due. So just so you're aware. I don't know, you know, what the status of that is. ATTY. O'BRIEN: My understanding there's no money in any account for this job. I'll look into that. But I was told -- I looked into this and I was told that there was no money. We don't have any cash money for this job. I talked to Tom Preambo and Rebecca about the money. As you request I'll look into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 it again. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So one more thing and this might be a question for Mr. King. In the schematic s there that Mr. O'Brien's talking about, are they going to redirect the creek down Washington Avenue or are they going to use the old creek bed? ATTY. O'BRIEN: The old creek bed. MR. KING: Yeah, for the most part they're staying within the existing channel where the existing pipe is. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Is there any section there that's going to veer off of that existing creek bed or that existing stone culvert , whatever you want to refer to that as? ATTY. O'BRIEN: I don't think so. In fact, it's going to still stay above ground behind the Scranton -- I think they're using the -- as Don said I think they're using the existing system. MR. SCHUSTER : And then last one for this moment is going to be that wall on Ryerson Avenue, is that wall included in this project as well? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 ATTY. O'BRIEN: Let me check. Certainly the creek bed goes very, very close to that wall. And my guess is that that's part of the reconstruction that's going to have to be done. MR. SCHUSTER : Also thinking about it, Mr. King, the piece that was done behind those three properties was done by -- it was done -- it was the Reilly blueprint s that was used for that, correct ? MR. KING: I believe Reilly because they had done preliminary engineer ing on this project before. So that's -- that could be true. I'm not 100 percent sure. MR. SCHUSTER : Even though that Reilly did that original plan behind those three properties , it's still going to all be replaced even though it's the same company doing this full plan. MR. KING: Yes. In that area I believe -- well, the whole project entails 1780 feet of 7 foot diameter pipe. 150 feet of a 7 by 7 concrete channel , that will be the open area behind the Green Ridge Club. And 430 feet of precast boxed culvert , I believe that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 where it goes underneath the streets . So for the most part, it's going to be a 7-foot diameter concrete pipe that's going in. I'm not sure what was put in there when they did that work in Mr. Young's property . But I don't think it was a 7 foot pipe. MR. SCHUSTER : No, I think was the 50 inch. MR. DONAHUE : It might not even have been that big. ATTY. O'BRIEN: 2007 one was 30. And that's all -- that was part of the litigation that we just fought with. MR. SCHUSTER : I'm talking about the '18 piece. It might have been May, June of '18. ATTY. O'BRIEN: Well, in the 2000 -- the reports indicated that the 30 was too small and it should have be 50. So you may be right. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, it was definitely too small when they replaced. ATTY. O'BRIEN: Okay. The retaining wall, Councilman , on page five dealing with Ryerson Avenue sponsor adjustments . Sponsor adjustment number seven, replace the retaining 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 wall on Ryerson Avenue behind Wyoming . It's so close to where the culvert is. Even if the retaining wall is fine, they're going to have to knock it down to get in there. MR. DONAHUE : That retaining wall holds up a city street too, you know, creates another -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: Well, it certainly does. It holds up Ryerson Avenue. Ryerson Avenue is 25 feet above or maybe 20 feet above those backyards . And drawing number five in the sponsor adjustments , replace retaining wall. So number six too, replace retaining walls. It's going to be -- the answer is yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. MR. GAUGHAN : Is there any other questions ? Okay. I just have two quick ones. Solicitor O'Brien, I thought I heard you say 50 properties . Is that a final number give or that might be give or take? ATTY. O'BRIEN: Yes, 40 to 50 -- yeah, 50 is a good number. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. ATTY. O'BRIEN: Somewhere in there.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MR. DONAHUE : And that counts Wyoming Avenue and Delaware and Ryerson too, right? It goes under houses on Delaware . ATTY. O'BRIEN: It goes under houses on Delaware . It goes down along Ryerson under homes -- under houses on Delaware behind the Green Ridge Club. It turns. It goes down to Penn Avenue and then crosses there and then goes out to Green Ridge Street. Now, I don't know if you remember -- any of you remember where Red Coleman, he was a county official years ago. He lived down in the 1500 block of Penn Avenue. In his backyard it was above ground. But it's been covered up now. I don't know when they did that. But I remember when I was a kid going to church down there, the creek was above ground behind the Green Ridge Club and behind a couple of homes on the 15 of Penn. Now, it's not. The 15 of Penn, now it's underground . MR. GAUGHAN : And ultimately , what we're voting on tonight if I'm assuming I hope that it passes, I think it will. That allows the City to move forward with this project , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 correct ? So without the agreement -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: Exactly . MR. GAUGHAN : -- can't do anything . ATTY. O'BRIEN: Exactly . Without the agreement , the state's not going to commit the money. The state wants the City commitment too. The sponsorship agreement articulate s the City's commitment . MR. GAUGHAN : And you probably can't -- are you able to give a timeline ? I know you said a few years until the completion of this project . I know there's so many variables . ATTY. O'BRIEN: There's so many variables . I think -- Don, do you remember -- Don probably is better at that than me. Don, do you remember what John Pocius said about the time he thought it would take? MR. KING: I'm going to guess this is probably a two construction season project . And at best I believe it could start next -- not this coming summer but next summer. After this sponsorship agreement is signed off on, DEP will authorize Reilly Associates to commence with the final design. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 They have a preliminary design now. So they'll do a final design. And in the meantime then we can start acquiring the right of ways on the private properties that we need to complete the project . Almost every bit of this project goes through private property . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Very good. Okay. I don't have any further questions . Does anyone else have any questions for Solicitor O'Brien or Mr. King? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'm going to ask Mr. King. So it's looking about three years from now. MR. KING: That would be my guess, yes. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And then again, we said in that area that has been fixed at least temporarily between that -- it's a storm grate that was done by Reilly down past the Young residence . That in there is a 50-inch pipe that's in there, and it's going to be replaced by a 7 foot? MR. KING: That's my understanding . But I'll reach out to Reilly and get an answer to that what was done there previously , why 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 can't that be reused and is it going to be replaced with the 7 foot pipe. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I know my line of questioning -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: I never heard that 7 foot. I never heard that. But you could be right. But I didn't hear that in our meeting s. MR. SCHUSTER : Somebody just mentioned that in the last couple minutes . Didn't somebody mention that in the last couple minutes ? MR. KING: Yeah, I did. That's what they -- that's what they specified in their letter. I don't know if you have the letter that was addressed to Mr. Gaughan January 12th where they transmitted all of these documents . So right in the first -- the second paragraph they go right into what the -- a brief description of the project . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And so -- ATTY. O'BRIEN: I just counted the properties involved , 55 properties involved . Not all of them will have the pipe in. A number of them are for construction easements, neighboring properties they need a temporary 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 easement to do the work, some of the properties on Electric Street there right where it turns and goes down Ryerson . We'll have to get 55 easements, some temporary for construction , the others permanent . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I think I -- and, I mean, I know the questions that I had I know I'm excited to see this thing get started . And the questions I had I think are basically I think out of all of those 50 properties right now there is only three people possibly four to five properties that are affected by it. But the three properties that are affected by it have their backyards dug up. And when I was looking for a temporary fix -- I mean, when I took a look it might be, you know, 120 foot long of a property . Maybe we only need to bring in a couple truckload s of dirt and some grass and maybe repave a section of, you know, 6 by 60 asphalt . So, I mean, to have that done so these people could have their backyard s for the next three years was something that I was looking the City to possibly look into. ATTY. O'BRIEN: I will. We'll talk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 to DPW about it. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else have any questions ? Okay. Solicitor O'Brien, thank you. Mr. King, thank you very much. We appreciate it. And we look forward to the completion of this project . And as we know this legislation -- the approval tonight is the first step. So thank you very much. ATTY. O'BRIEN: President Gaughan , I did get a letter this week from the state. Doug Hill is spearheading it for the state. And he was questioning when it was going to go to Council . So he'll be happy to hear that you had your first reading tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. ATTY. O'BRIEN: He understands the 30-day process . It's not a problem . He understand s it. He'll be very happy to hear that it was going through the first reading. MR. GAUGHAN : Great. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you guys. Have a good night. ATTY. HAYES: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Bye-bye. Okay. We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 also have tonight -- we have quite a few people here tonight . And I don't know who many of them are. So we'll have to do some introduction s. We have our Business Administrator , Carl Deeley and I know we have Becky McMullin who is a member of the business administration office as well as our finance manager. And they're here to talk about OpenGov which is the legislation 7-F and 7-G. And that is to -- not 7-F and 7-G -- I'm sorry -- 5-H and 5-I. And that is to enter into a contract with OpenGov for the implementation of City management operating system and a financial management system. So I'll turn it over to our Business Administrator , Mr. Deeley and Becky McMullin now to talk about that. MR. DEELEY: Thank you. It's always good to see everybody . And also my congratulations to Council Rothchild , first of all. I haven't seen you for a while but congratulations on the new arrival . It's good to see you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thanks so much, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 Carl. MR. DEELEY: And thank you for the opportunity this evening . Yeah, this is something we talked about in the capital budget last year. It's probably the biggest item for us for 2021. The introduction of the new platform is a tremendous opportunity in many ways in the sense of immediate and long-term benefits , right, both from the service levels that obviously we can offer to the public and secondly the actual cost of doing business . So we do tonight -- we have some of the team on the call tonight . So I'm going to offhand to -- so first of all, I'll hand it off to Amanda Hallock . So Amanda is leading our digitization efforts for the city. I'm going to ask Amanda to just give a brief overview if you could give a control screen. And then also we have OpenGov with us tonight too that we'll also give you a brief overview of the actual platform itself. And I think that will give everybody a good context in terms of what we're asking Council to approve . So if you're comfort able with that, Chairman , we can hand it over. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Certainly . Sounds good. MR. DEELEY: Okay, Amanda. MS. HALLOCK : Hi everyone . Good to see you. So thanks, Carl. So I will be kind of walking you through our process , our decision and then I'll be passing it off to OpenGov to talk more about their timeline , their implementation and give you a short demo of the product . So not only are there a lot of benefit s to switching to this new platform , we also have to. There are current -- our current platform Finance Plus and Community Plus it will be ceasing -- you'll be have -- you'll have support ceased by the end of 2021. So around October , November there will no longer be support for it. So we actually do have to switch. And then it's just an added benefit that there are several ways many in which that will make the City a better work environment , a better place to live. We're pretty excited about the outcomes that could come from this. So one of the benefits of switching to this new platform 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 is that we'll be moving from on premises servers to the Cloud. So by doing this we'll be able to access the software through any user device through the internet. And this will allow individuals who work for the City to work from anywhere . It will increase our cyber security by outsourcing -- by getting others to take care of the servers. It will decrease IT burden inside the City. And it's incredibly more scalable . And it will bring us more resources in terms of servers . So the other things that this platform will do will central ize our data. It will help different departments collaborate to serve citizens better, central izing, for example , address data, letting DPW and LIPS know what the other is doing with the same address . It will have financial and service level tracking so that we can monitor how both of those areas are doing. And overall there will just be more accurate information because of the double-checking that will go on because of the consistency several ways in which the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 information will just be overall more accurate . So the way that we went about this selecting this new system, we had a selection committee with representatives from all across the City, several of which are on the call tonight . We did independent reviews and scores. We compared the costs, compared the responses to the technical specification s. We contacted -- well, I contacted all of the references listed for every proposal and we did Q and A with platform demos with certain finalists . So this process took from December , 2020 up until today. And everything that we looked at we could make available to you. I mean, the proposals are -- the proposal can be made available to Council . So the response s that we got, we got four responses for the financial management RFP and five responses for the City management RFP. As you could see here, a look inside you could see the committee members if you'd like to go back to the slide. But the key takeaway from the slide OpenGov 's got the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 highest for score from the committee members for both proposals . And this is based on the criteria in RFPs. This slide is also a reference slide. It has the comparative costs over a one-year timeline , five years and then just divide total cost to operate by five so that you could really get a sense of the cost over the next several years. So we took OpenGov for many reasons . You saw the scores. We had really fantastic conversations with the references for OpenGov . And you could read the rest of that. But essentially they're -- everything they have to offer really -- it well-aligned with our goals and what we're thinking for this project especially their transparency . They'll show you that they have a fantastic system portal, transparent budget information and they satisfy the need for really secure server. And I guess the last thing I'll mention before I pass it off to OpenGov is the user-friendly nature of OpenGov . Several people we talked to said that they had no IT background . And it was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 still fairly easy to use. And that was a huge focus of our search team knowing that the City needs something that will really be useful for the workforce and for the citizens . So I'll pass it over to OpenGov to show you a bit more about the platform . MR. FAHRENKOPF : Thanks, Amanda. I'm just going to share my screen here briefly . Yes. Can you all see the slide that says introducing the open -- or the Government -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, we can see it. MR. FAHRENKOPF : Thank you. Perfect . So good evening members of Scranton City Council , Carl, Amanda, Rebecca , Don, the rest of the evaluation committee that's on the line this evening . Thank you again for the opportunity likewise with, President Gaughan , thank you as well. My name is Eric Fahrenkopf . And I'm a local account executive with OpenGov working with a number of communities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania . I'm also joined by four team members from OpenGov here this evening that I'd like to introduce as well. First is Claudia Arriaga . She's our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 Vice President of Global Customer Success and Partnerships . Second is Eric DiProspero . He's actually a Pennsylvania native and our Senior Director of North America . Monica Cook who is our Senior Manager of Solutions and Engineering who will be walking us through the overall implementation and timeline for the project and Scott Williams who's been a lead solution engineer working with the City's evaluation committee through this RFP process as well. And he'll be walking us through a brief demonstration . What we prepared for you all this evening really is an introduction to OpenGov . What we're going to be bringing to not only the employees of the City of Scranton but also the Scranton community and then an overview of the project including our methodology in terms of how we can successfully implement , go through change management and then deploy the software and then the timeline as well. So for anyone that may not be familiar with who OpenGov is, we were founded actually about 10 years ago after our founders , one of which is our CEO, Zach Bookman and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 executive sponsor for this project . With us -- the City is allowed to spend roughly 10 million dollars on a new ERP system that believe it or not was actually implement ed on 20 discs and still had green screens . At that time right about 10 years ago, this was also at the rise of computing and our founders were really figuring out that a lot of governments across the country were facing similar challenges with outdated technology hamstrung by the lack of purpose filled technology for governments . And so what we realize d was with the rise of cloud computing , the consumers experience , right, all of us, our consumer experiences and private sector organizations have really been able to accelerate and leverage modern workful l automation . And now all of us in our consume r life are starting to demand that same service levels that we're accustom to when we interact with government , right? And so in OpenGov , we're helping government s really close this gap. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 And our and mission -- and we're a mission -driven organization is how do we power and we want to power more effective and account able government . And we do this by delivering no code software that's purposeful for government that's always up-to-date and easy to use and enjoyable to use. And when I look at where the City of Scranton is currently and having to move to a new software solution because the current support is no longer going to be, you know, valid through the end of this year, that's exactly what OpenGov was designed for, right, we're cloud based. You're always going to be up-to-date. You're always going to be on the latest and greatest version . And you'll never have to worry about moving to a new platform because your support is going to end. Looking at OpenGov how do we go to market is with the OpenGov ERP Cloud. And so that include s everything from core financials to manage your account s payable, account s receivable , your HR and payroll , utility , billing . Amanda touched on it earlier with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 collaborative budgeting and planning . And then one of the most exciting portions of the platform is the citizens services , right? And that is where we start to really improve the overall customer experience whether it's with permits and licenses , code enforce ment, asset management , making it so that you all have 24/7 online citizen services available so not everyone has to come into City Hall. And then one of the more important things as well is the reporting and transparency platform . And what's interesting is, I was actually having a conversation with the CEO in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania who is a customer of OpenGov earlier today. And we were talking about the American Rescue Plan and how OpenGov could help the county be more transparent with how they're going to be leveraging that funding and where that funding is going to be applied to. And we could do the same thing with the City of Scranton and our transparency portal, not only can we help you be able to share exactly what that funding is going towards; but we could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 also help you screen those project s and make sure that, you know, there's an overall kind of ranking and approval process to make sure that the funding really is being put to project s that are going to make an impact on the community . So why OpenGov ? There's kind of five key reasons , three which I'll touch on here. First is this is purpose -built for government . So everything we do at OpenGov is how do we power more effective and accountable government . And we spend a considerable amount of our overall revenue on R and D to future proof your investment in your technology purchase . The second is modern, intuitive interfaces. I think you'll see this as soon as we walk through the demonstration . But we want this software to be very consumer -like. We want this to be enjoyable to use. If employee s are liking the software they're working with on a day-to-day basis, they're going to be more inclined to lead in and enjoy the work they're doing. On the same side, if you're a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 customer trying -- your community is enjoying the software that they're having to apply for a permit with, we're going to see more permits being applied for. Also, this software is very configurable . We want this to be configurable so that they could adapt to the workflows and process for the City of Scranton . And then lastly, being that it's multi-tenant software is a service platform, it's always up-to-date. We're releasing new enhancements every two weeks. So as I mentioned earlier , you're not going to be in the position five years from now where you're forced to upgrade to a new platform because you don't have the support . This is going to continuously be updated, be upgraded and all enhancements are delivered seamlessly over time. Additionally when we look at OpenGov , not only do we, you know, only service the public sector -- and about 95 percent of that is local governments . But we look to bring in former government leaders like a Monica Cook who is going to be speaking with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 you all shortly to make sure that not only from an executive level and where we're going from an organization al standpoint is tied into how we can better serve our customer s, but also from our inhouse professional services organization . We want -- we want to bring in former individuals that, you know, are familiar with how to do government accounting and account s payable and actually have them deploy our solutions with our customers as well. And then lastly is the overall OpenGov ecosystem , right, so if there is an area of government technology that OpenGov doesn't provide today, we look to partner with the best of great partners out there that are similar minded to OpenGov . And we're doing that for the City of Scranton as well with NEOGOV which has extensive experience in the Commonwealth from an HR benefits platform and Cartegraph who also has similar experience from an asset management standpoint . The key difference here is this is an integrated solution . So even though we may 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 be different partners , we're still bringing together an overall ecosystem that is integrated so that the data can move seamlessly between all three platforms as well. And then lastly before I turn it over to Scott to walk through the overall platform and give you a better understanding of what the City of Scranton can expect from the partnership , I just wanted to touch on a few other customers we work with in the Commonwealth today like the City of York, Abington Township , the city of -- I'm sorry, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania I mentioned earlier ; City of Lancaster , City of Pittsburgh and many others as well. So with that, I'm going to stop and turn it over to Scott and we'll be happy to answer questions here as well just in a few minutes . Scott, over to you. MR. WILLIAMS : Fantastic . Thank you. I'm going to share my screen here. So thanks everybody for giving a little bit of time to talk about this. I'm just going to take a really quick walkthrough . A full demo of this software is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 going to take about five hours. We're going to condense that down in 10 minutes and give you the very brief version of this. In general at a high level there's kind of two areas of OpenGov that we're dealing with. We want to talk about the customer facing -- or the public facing portion of it where your citizens are going to come in and interact with it. And that's what you're seeing on the screen right now. And I'll explain a little bit more of that. And then, of course, there's the internal part of it where your folks, your public works department , your utilities folks, your finance folks, all of those people are going to be dealing with it as well, your budget people. And these two things are going to interact . We're not going to export and import information . We're going to make this one seamless system that everything acts together . So what you see on the screen here is just a mockup of what this could look like. This will be links on your website from the Scranton web page or it could be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 separate web page if you want to. And there's a lot of different things that you could do on this -- what we call the citizens services portal. Up here on the top the first things here you see we have a project . And what's great about this is when somebody has -- I like this reference here. If I need to open a new restaurant , I want to do a new business . I want to create something . I don't really know what I need to do. So we could have a project up here. All of this is customizable by you guys. And like Eric said, this is no code. Everything that you're going look at is drag and drop with virtually no training . So I come in here and say, hey, I want to start a restaurant . What do I need to do? Come in here, click on the next. And it says -- you're going to ask some questions . What are things that you need to do for this? Am I serving food? Am I serving alcohol ? Will I require to sign in? And then I go next. And it's going to tell me what different permits that I need to do. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 And the system is already configured . As you answer those questions , the next page is going to pop up for you automatically. And you're going to be in complete charge of how this is going to be designed and how this all is going to work. So that's just one aspect of this. The citizens services portal has a lot more to offer than just permits . So if I scroll down here, you could see we have virtual City Council meeting which is something that we really embrace d in 2020 obviously we are doing that here today so we have a way that we can help you facilitate that as well. As well as our online budget book -- and I'm going to talk a little bit more about this on the back end as I talk a little bit more about it. When I come into here, one thing that we found that people really like is the idea of having that 800-page document that people have to go through that's really not very useful. And it's out of date as soon as it's published . We want to have an interactive budget book that has data that's in it that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 going to be live and it's going to come to you. Eric talked about our partner that we're working with York -- the City of York in Pennsylvania . This is their budget book that they published out here. You could go to their web page and look at it. This is generated using OpenGov . So as you go through here, you see all the different components of this. As things go through and if I click on one of these I'm going to look at the City Council section . This verbiage in here, this was written in OpenGov and published out to the website . You have your accomplishments . You have your goals. But then as we go further , we actually have some data here. We have some charts and graphs. And these are actually interactive , not just -- they're not just static pieces of information . As you click on these, these are going to be interactive that you could deal with. And this data was created and is coming from the OpenGov reporting platform . So as you see it here, you're actually going to be able to update here -- or sorry, update it in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 OpenGov and then update will come out here as you go through that. So that budget book isn't something that just -- it can be a static document if you want to. But it also could be a live and interact ive document if you want it to as well. Another idea of this -- come back to here -- is your reporting . So we're talking about that transparency . We're talking about getting that information out to the public in a way that's easily consumable . So here's an idea that could be for Scranton putting out your first quarter report here, same kind of idea where we're using a concept that we call stories where you actually are able to put in not just the data. The data is great. And again, this is an interactive report here. That's tied into OpenGov . But you also have the narrative that's really explaining what you're going to be looking at so you could really get people the answer that they want. And then they have the opportunity to really drill down and answer the questions that they might have using the data here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 So just a couple things that you could do. There's a lot of different ways that the public can interact with your system and be able to grab that information . I'm going to switch over and talk about the -- some of the internal mechanisms of OpenGov . And I want to pause. Is there any question s or comments yet? MR. GAUGHAN : I have a quick question . Council uses -- first of all, thanks for the presentation . This is great so far. Council uses Granicus to -- we entered into a contract with them a few years ago just to cut down on the amount of paper that we have in the office and to make Council more transparent so that people could interact with our agendas . How -- would this fit in with Granicus or interact with Granicus and how Council operates in terms of our agenda in any way or -- MR. WILLIAMS : Yeah, it would. Monica, do you want to elaborate on that just a little bit? MS. COOK: Sure. Hi, folks. My name is Monica Cook. I lead our Solutions Engineering team. Absolutely . So Granicus is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 a great product . It's really flexible here. So that's one of themes about OpenGov . It's very configurable . So we can absolutely put a section in here for Granicus . And they could just link right out to your existing system. And it will be a nice way to bring it together to kind of like a one-stop shop. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Great. Thank you. MR. WILLIAMS : No problem . So when I go past this really quickly just touch on this briefly , this is our OpenGov home page where you could see we have our permitting and licensing here, the open town hall, utility billing, general ledger, everything that you need to work on your ERP is in one system. And we're going to branch out from here to go to all of the other places. One of the things I wanted to touch upon real quickly is just our dashboard area. We have several dashboards . I was actually messing around and came into a dashboard . So you could come in here and see all of these dashboard s. These are all going to be created 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 for you by you. And these could be internal . They could be external . They might be public facing or they might be internal facing. So this is a great way for you to gather the information that you need to be able to talk to your own folks in here. So if you look on this, we have all these different dashboard s for maybe -- for you all. You might have your own City Council dashboard that you might want to go into and get information that's relevant to you. You could have a dashboard specifically for a department . You might have a dashboard that's specifically for accounts payable or maybe housing and preservations . So all of these dashboard s could be very tuned in to what you need to do. Within a dashboard you're going to have several report tiles. These report tiles can pull in information from OpenGov . They could also pull in information that could be imported from external systems . So this is a really great way to get a comprehensive look at how your City is doing. So right here I could see my budget actual, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 revenue trends, my economic growth, building permits , police response time. So there's both financial and non financial data that you could put in here to be able to get the information that you want. In here we have a little more inner activity that we could do than we saw in the budget book. So this is more of an internal facing type of document . So now when you come in here, currently what I'm seeing is -- this is an annual report. I'm seeing a revenue trend over multiple years broken down by revenue type. Just by changing one option here -- maybe I don't want to see revenues . Maybe I want to look at expenses . I just change that. Now my chart is going to change. Well, instead of seeing it broken down by expense type, maybe I want to see it broken down by department . I could make that change. And I could see the data broken down there. You could drill into this, filter it down a little bit more. Maybe I just want to see my public safety. And below this as I do all of that, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 that's being driven by data. So I have this chart down here below that has all of this data that I could also drill into and get into more information all the way down to the transaction piece of information . So you have just with a few mouse clicks you're going from a very macro level graphical information all the way down to the details nuts and bolts of what makes that number. This data can be downloaded if you want -- if you're a pivot table kind of person, you could download it, put it into Excel. You could share this out to other folks if you need to have this out to maybe a third party or an auditor or something like that. You could have that information be available there as well. Like I said before, there's a lot of information that could be covered on here. We have, you know, several hours worth of product that we would show you. I just want to give you a really high level of some of the end result data that you could get and what you're going to be able to consume once we have OpenGov implement ed and up and running . MR. FAHRENKOPF : Fantastic . Thanks, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Scott. Monica, would you like to go through the overall timeline and implementation that we have proposed for the City? MS. COOK: Absolutely . Awesome . Can you see my screen? It should say implementation on it. MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. MS. COOK: Okay, great. So this is the snapshot of our implementation methodology . We come to the City with extensive experience , folks who have spent time in the public sector who are former finance directors , who are former analysts. They really contribute and define your implementation plan. So along with initiation , there will also be a best practices review. And that's where we share what we've kind of diagnosed so far at the City. And we share kind of recommendation s for you based on our experience with similar sized cities, your goals, timeline , things like that. While that's happening, we're also doing configuration . And that is kind of the -- one of the really big themes I mention ed previously . But because we are a true modern 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 cloud software , we're able to build a very flexible ERP cloud that has sweets in it that could be really configured for your needs. And that is the work -- a lot of the work that are our implementation team does while you're learning and training how the systems work. Then there's validation , deployment with the goal in project completion for you to be able to own and enable others at the City. So everything in OpenGov is point and click on the screen. There is no technical coding experience required . We want everyone to be able to be involved , get their work done, enjoy using OpenGov . And that's kind of why we do what we do. Along with the methodology , our implementation , we have very well thought out project plan. This is a big project and it has moving pieces involved in it. So we had defined roles and responsibilities on both sides so that we could work in the different work streams of the project efficient ly. So you'll see here some sample roles and responsibilities on the OpenGov side and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 then what we recommend on the City side as well. We also know that communication is one of or not the most important part of a successful project . So we have regular cadences set up so that we know how the project s are going, what support is needed and to keep all the stakeholders appraised of where we are in the project timelines and how we're meeting them. And that brings me to the timeline . So this is for the financial management system which includes the items you see here on the screen. It's about a 12 month full deployment with all of those pieces. It is phased intentionally so that we can get quick value for the City while also setting up all of the ground work that we need to do to have a successful project . So phased approaches is really successful so we're not biting off more than we can chew all at once. And this is for the operational management system, a little bit of a shorter timeline here. But you could kind of see the different phases on this side as well. Any questions ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 MR. GAUGHAN : I have a few questions . I'll start with a comment . So the -- I'm very impressed by the presentation . I think that this completely changes the way that we do business here in the City. And being on Council now for eight years, this has been kind of the missing link. I've been a big proponent over the years of trying to make the City more business friendly whether it's from licensing and permits or any other office in the City and to bring us into the 21st century . I'm sure that anyone who now works for the City understand s that there's a lot of programs and process es that we have that are outdated. And we just need to upgrade it. So I think this -- looking at your presentation here and reviewing all the documentation , to me this a no-brainer . You know, it's going to make things easier. And as we stated in the beginning , the technology we have now is outdated anyway. So we have to do something . The one question I did have when I was going through the backup, I don't -- unless I missed it. I see within the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 legislative cover sheet that you have here a cost that is listed. I don't see that kind of broken down in the actual agreement anywhere . Did I miss that or was that not included ? Within the legislation , I see the breakdown of how it's going to be paid out. But I don't see the actual -- the actual cost listed anywhere in the proposal . MR. DEELEY: Was the statement of work attached to that? MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I saw a statement of work. But I don't see the -- I went through it twice. I don't see, like, where they actually list their fees and stuff. MR. DEELEY: Okay. Well, obviously I could forward that to Council so you've got that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. MR. DEELEY: I thought that was included . My apologizes . MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. Also, I didn't see the disclosure s -- the signed disclosure s that usually are filled out. That was just one thing I noticed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. DEELEY: Yeah, disclosures are definitely -- they are completed . Again, my apologies . I'll send -- MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. One question I have was the current financial management system in the operating system -- when -- just for historical purposes , when did we purchase those and how long have we had those in the City? MR. DEELEY: Frank, you're on. So maybe you got the history of this because I think the name, the ownership , the various arrangements of that system I think have changed over the decades. So, Frank, could you just maybe give a comment on that? MR. SWIETNICKI : The original -- the original for both of those I believe it was 2003, 2004 when it went out for sort of like the phase we're in right now with OpenGov , right? And then implementation was the back end of 2004 and in 2005. And then for both for the community -- so sort of the government operations platform and then also in the financial side, they -- it was the same until we did the upgrade . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 It would have happened in 2014 and '15 which got us to the absolute latest that was offered for both of those platforms at that time. And, you know, just a lot has changed since 2015, right? They're literally becoming obsolete . So that is kind of where we are with those. But original -- original out to projects 2003, 2004, original implementation 2004, 2005. MR. GAUGHAN : All right. Thank you. In terms of how we're going to be paying for this, Carl, I can't remember off the top of my head how much is budgeted in the IT. But we have enough in there to cover this. MR. DEELEY: Yes, we do. So we have -- we actually increased the budget for 2021 based on this. So the capital we had the 350,000 plus in the professional services which takes care of the implementation , the consulting work and the training . That was also increased as well. That's at 220,000. And we've also got some additional funding in in the BA professional services as well for that and the IT -- sorry, in HR for training . What I'll do, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 I'll send you a breakdown for like in terms of what we budgeted for. And then this definitely comes within the budget. So we'll give you a breakdown of the costs and, you know, associated payments for that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. And how many years is this contract for? I don't know if I saw that in here. MR. DEELEY: Yeah, so this is probably something for discussion in the sense that of when it's implemented . The intention is to have a contract for three years. However , it's going to be ongoing, you know, in the sense I think as Eric described . This is continuous update. As it's cloud-based in terms of its durations -- you know, the intent is this will be, you know, a very longstanding application for us. But what we'll do is put in there is automatic renewal . And I see that's some thing we have in other contract s that we have that could be renewed. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, yeah, that's one of the things I do want to take a look at. I did notice the automatic renewal . But I think 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 we probably should spell out, you know, when that will kick in. And then the last question I have is, when you were determining the overall cost of this, I noticed under the software services agreement there is a 5 percent increase potentially yearly for inflation . Is that included in this or is that in addition to the total bill? MR. DEELEY: In the five year number that's included , correct , Eric? MR. FAHRENKOPF : Yeah, the five year -- and I think Carl is going to share the overall (inaudible ) here after the fact. But that number is inclusive of everything for the five years. And then the City would -- obviously we're going to be in close contact throughout not only employment but ongoing with how we go to market with your customer s (inaudible ) we have a dedicated team before you even once the profession al services team completes the project and signs off on that. You will have the option, right, ahead of that fifth year if you would like to renew. And then if you wanted to either renew 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 the current terms or renegotiate also. So, no, you're automatically locked in. You would have the option to work through that contracting phase after that. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. MR. FAHRENKOPF : You're welcome . MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else have any questions ? MR. MCANDREW : I do. MR. DONAHUE : Just on the cost, just on the cost real quick. I just want to make sure that -- so it's 447,000 the first year and then it's 350 each year after that? MR. DEELEY: Yeah, so what I did there -- MR. DONAHUE : The two of them, right, the City and the financial . MR. DEELEY: Exactly . It's for both. So it's, yeah, let's -- I rounded it to 448 for the first year and the implementation cost as well. And then I also spread out that five year cost. I just did annual budget for 350,000. It's actually less than that. But I just rounded that up. But what I'll do, I'll do a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 breakdown on those so you have a full breakdown of those costs. MR. DONAHUE : And then the only other question I had is -- and forgive me if I'm wording this wrong. But I know we get, you know, a lot of our property data from the county. So if they were using a different system is that, you know, does that transfer over easily, you know, from the county using a different system to then us using OpenGov ? MR. DEELEY: Eric, maybe you could take a stab at that because you've done this many times. MR. FAHRENKOPF : Yeah, we'd be happy to Carl. To answer your question , Councilman Donahue , it will. So the system is agnostic as long as we could have a CSD file brought in. We work with over 300 communities on that, the permitting side bring in multiple different county databases including in the Commonwealth into OpenGov . And then we'll actually be able to work with you to have that updated as well. So however often you want that frequency updated , obviously property ownership information is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 going to change. We can actually bring that information into the platform as well on a recurring basis so that you'll work with up-to-date information . MR. DONAHUE : Okay. Great. Thank you. MR. FAHRENKOPF : You're welcome . MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick question . So this Cloud ERM platform is hosted and managed by OpenGov , correct , I mean -- so the platform you own. And then you said you never have to worry about an upgrade . You always have to worry about an upgrade . So just because -- you know, of course, you said, you know, the support never ends so the upgrades are going to be done yearly? Every three years? As needed? And then at the end, say we sever ties in five years. So the platform that we don't own, we're renting , what do we have when this terminates , just whatever is in the cloud? Do we have any systems we no longer can use? MR. FAHRENKOPF : Yeah, so I could answer that, Councilman McAndrew . So in terms of the updates , those will actually be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 delivered seamlessly over the cloud. So when we look at cloud based software versus traditional kind of legacy on premise software, the main difference is that OpenGov is taking on responsibility for actually hosting that, right, so all the server cost, all the energy costs associated with maintaining those servers , all the maintenance , right, of maintaining the software program s, doing any upgrades we do all of that. We actually do that on a biweekly release . So the software is getting updated every two weeks. And all of those enhancements are delivered over the cloud, right, so the City doesn't have to worry about upgrading to a new version . In terms of support , U.S. based customer support available eight to nine eastern standard time that your teams is available to work with whether it's, you know, over the phone or via message chat. In terms of, you know, if the City and OpenGov decide to sever ties at any point, right, in the future, your data is your data. All, you know, things in terms of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 the City of Scranton would be returned to the City. In terms of the ongoing, you know, software itself because it is a software that is service , right, that would be returned to OpenGov but all data would still remain with the City. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, Mark. Are you finished ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I just have one more question . We're looking at financial management and City management . So the financial piece I get. So would that be similar to like a local CSI system or CSIU system where there's multiple levels of approval say for a PO that's coming out of a department . Before, you know, before it's even approved it has to go through Mr. Deeley, you, or maybe the department head, then Mr. Deeley and then final approval by the Mayor. And then does that department or that employee that submits that has the opportunity to see where it's that through that level, where it's at through the stage of this. And then it's all kept and documented . And so that piece 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 financial . And then for the City piece, we're looking -- I saw there's going to be portals. Will there be employee portals? So, like, say I work for the City and I want to go in and see how many sick days I have or, you know, or I could print out my W2 from that portal. I mean, is all of this being consider ed or part of this? MR. FAHRENKOPF : All of that is included in the -- MR. DEELEY: And what I'd suggest is because you're absolutely right, Councilman . And that was a real short synopsis of the capability and it took us several weeks to come to this conclusion . And I really would encourage Council to maybe to participate in a demonstration . And then you'll see the full capabilities and have that time to deep dive. But you're quite right, Council man, in terms of the workflows, the transparency of it, the tracking of it, in terms of reducing the lead time to do these things, the accuracy , the checks and balance s, it's huge. This is huge 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 for the City internally in sense of controls , efficiencies . But most importantly again, service , right, to the public. It's going to be a lot of -- as much as I love talking to Council , a lot of the question s I think that come through to us are probably question s that you hold back on because you gave to us to answer, will be at your fingertips as it should be and to the public. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , did you have a question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, so I guess mister -- Eric described that data transmission . So if we were to end ties, how does that transmission occur? MR. FAHRENKOPF : In terms of the City being able to have the data to move onto another platform ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, you said that the software would return to OpenGov . But the data that's the City's would return to the City. So how does that -- how do we do that data transition here at that point in time? MR. FAHRENKOPF : That's a great 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 question . So everywhere you're at with any OpenGov platform , whether it's reviewing a permit, reviewing a small business grant program , right, that can be managed by OpenGov , it could be a rental relief program that you're managing . It could be for employee information on payroll and so on and so forth. At every point in the platform you will have the ability to export that data down to Excel at every point in time. So whether it's done at the end, whether it's done, you know, to do enhance d reporting if you want to look at it at a pivot table as to Scott's point earlier , built into the system, right, it's kind of core to OpenGov is the fact that, you know, this is your data. We're hosting your data so that you could leverage our services to, you know, help provide effective service s for your community . Your data is your data. You'll always be able to export your data. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. And with that being said, the system that we're currently in and the transition from that system to this new 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 OpenGov system, how does that information being -- is everything that we have currently being brought over? I know I had some questions about, you know, President Gaughan mentioned Granicus . And Granicus has a lot of our -- well, it has our agendas in it. It has the backup documentation for those agendas and resolutions and things like that. Is there -- do we still have the database of past resolution s? Can we get onto the system and look up any of the old documents prior to this year? MR. FAHRENKOPF : So -- MS. HALLOCK : I could answer that a little bit. Just for the fact that we will be for the time being at least sticking with Granicus . The OpenGov platform does not -- or I don't know if it does. But the thing that we're purchasing will not have the agenda software with it. So all of that agenda backlog , all of the current agendas , all the minutes will stay on Granicus platform . When it comes to the central square information , we will be undergoing a process to extract that and load 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 it into the OpenGov platform , which OpenGov could speak to a lot better than I can. And then finally our share drive where we host a lot of our address based data will work on taking that back as many years as we need to and keeping that share drive available for future reference . But uploading as much of that recent information as possible so that, you know, so we keep referring what happened two years ago, how many permits were given out last year, that kind of a thing. MR. SCHUSTER : And, Miss Hallock , currently , are any of the old backlogs of minutes, of resolutions , things like that, are they currently available to the public or has that site been shut down as of now? MS. HALLOCK : So the past minutes are all available on -- not all available but, you know, back a certain amount of years on the website . So that's where they live at the moment and are available to the public. They aren't -- Lori actually could answer that much better than I could. MR. SCHUSTER : Coming back to OpenGov , I saw -- what is the post deployment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 support look like? MR. FAHRENKOPF : Monica, do you want to take that or do you want me to? MS. ARRIAGA : I could take it too, Eric, if you'd like. MR. FAHRENKOPF : That'd be great. MS. COOK: Go for it, Claudia . MR. SCHUSTER : We're talking about -- so for me to clarify a little bit more, we're talking , you know, there's not going to be a time when we need to update. It's going to be something that continues to update. So it doesn't seem like a life span -- it seems like possibly the only life span is when we are no longer satisfied with the service possibly . So -- go ahead and I'll go from there. MS. ARRIAGA : Okay. Can you hear me? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. MS. ARRIAGA : Wonderful . So from our perspective , OpenGov , the journey with OpenGov really truly after you're out of deployment is when it truly begins, right, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 you're done implementing and now it's your day to day. We have our original support system where you just call into. You get your service level agreement . If there happens to be a product -- question product issue you could call a number. You could also login through the chat. But at the same time, I run our customer success organization . We have over 1,000 customers . And I personally assign a customer success manager to the account . So you will have a customer success manager that will work with you throughout the life of your partnership with OpenGov . It's your single point of contact . And, you know, you could call him or her. They're very knowledgeable on platform. But they also reach out to teams like Monica's team which are solutions and engineering as well as subject matter experts . So with your platform you have a dedicated resource, a customer manager that you have that, you know, checks in with you monthly , quarterly depending on the cadence as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 well as your regular support and your regular service level agreements . And on top of that, I handle all of our account s across the country . So we have customer advisory boards. We have conferences . We have training modules and all of that that you'll be getting as a City constant communication from us letting you know, hey, we have training available . Oh, this is coming. It's both input and output in terms of support . MS. COOK: And I would just add one of the big benefits of having somebody from Claudia 's team working with you is they will also be working with our other customer s in the Commonwealth . So as things change in the Commonwealth or the City of York, for example , comes up with a new process that they are doing in OpenGov we like to share with our other customer s so that they can continue to get benefit s and value from OpenGov throughout the entire time that you're with us. MS. ARRIAGA : That's a wonderful point, Monica. The power of the network too is great. So lessons learned across all of your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 peers, not only within the State of Pennsylvania but across all 50 United States is just a great experience . MR. SCHUSTER : So we're going to have these teams constantly working our IT department , with other departments in the City. MS. ARRIAGA : Yeah, mostly, yeah, mostly with your budgeting, your finance -- I mean, like Eric said, yes, they are more than welcome to work with IT. But we work a lot with endusers , the city manager s because it's an easy to use software . MR. SCHUSTER : And then the course of that three year contract per se it will be working along side of them the whole time, okay. MS. ARRIAGA : Absolutely . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, any other questions ? All right. Well, this was a very impressive presentation . It's clear looking at the proposal and documentation that there's been a lot of thought put into this. It's not like, you know, we took a dart and threw it at the wall and picked a company . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 There was a process that was put into place. And I appreciate that. So thank you for doing that. We'll vote on this and introduce it tonight and work out some of the details, Mr. Deeley, and some other information that needs to be provided . And then we'll take a final vote on it either next week or the week after. Okay. Thanks everyone very much. MR. DEELEY: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you very much. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. And finally we have Mr. Deeley is going to stick around and have our Police Chief Namiotka and Fire Chief John Judge here with us tonight to talk about the agenda items related to the Serrenti Center and the simulator that's going to be put in there. And there's going to be work done on the Serrenti Center too, I guess, prepare it for the simulator s. So I'll turn it over again to you, Carl, and both Chiefs if they want to touch on this and walk us through . MR. DEELEY: Thank you. Yeah, so we talked about this in -- when we looked at the capital budget again last year, we believe that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 this, you know, this is a very underutilized building . I think it's been maybe a bit of a blight sitting for a long time. So finally , you know, starting to use this, right, getting into a place where it's having some value. So this first phase we do have the Milo simulator has already been purchase d. It's ready to install . What we're requesting here from Council is the approval to "A", prepare the actual room itself so it could be installed . And also there's an adjacent room that we also use for the control of that by the trainer and to -- well, it's the trainee s actually sits and they discuss the results , you know, of their efforts in the simulator . So the -- in terms of the bid itself, we went for the bids. We had some good participation . I'm not sure if Bob Mitchell {sic} is still on. He may be, may be not. But, you know, kind of project manager consulting engineer up there. We did talk to each of the companies that put the bids in, you know, to ensure that "A" they could hold the pricing . Again, this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 is one of the conditions again that we talked about last year every project that we do now will have, you know, timelines , milestones . It will be reviewed every week. And it will be reported every month in terms of status. So we did talk to the bidders . We're happy with the proposal that we put in front of you. Now, in terms of the use of the building , this is phase one. We set this as phase one. We do have on the funding side this is from an LSA grant that has been reappropriate d. The LSA was for $225,000 which is obviously more than we need in this particular grant. But what it allows us to do is we can take expenses that have been applied to the Serrenti Center previously to that grant. And then those monies can go back into the general fund just so you're aware of that. Maybe, Chief Namiotka , if you wanted just to add any color to, you know, how we're going to use the building and the importance of it. CHIEF NAMIOTKA : Sure, Carl. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 you. Good evening , Council . How are you tonight ? Serrenti Center, not only is it going to be our training division that we'll have a training room up there for everyone to utilize , but our Bomb Unit is going to be stationed to there, our Special Operation s Group is going to be stationed there, Street Crimes Unit will be stationed there also. We'll also store our emergency vehicles , the larger ones that we need like a bomb unit. Fire has some vehicles up there as well that we keep inside to keep them safe. We also have some conference rooms that will be utilize d up there along with if need be we could utilize that facility as an emergency medical facility in case for, you know, a disaster or anything like that. It's a very large building . We could utilize that. But mainly what we're talking about tonight is the Milo system where it's a -- Milo Range Theater , 180 degree multiscreen simulator . This is going to provide realistic training for our officers . It will put them in an environment where it actually -- they could feed off the simulation .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 There's hundreds of scenarios that we can choose from to address the training goals of our department . The instructor s are going to consult with the CI team which is the Crisis Intervention Team, use of force, less lethal options and active threat. We're going to ensure that there's a consistent philosophy throughout the department on training . As we've seen most encounter s with police are -- never rise to the use force now. So we're going to use some verbal deescalation techniques in a simulation . We're going to have the best chance for avoiding injuries , not only to our officers , bystanders and on the subjects that we're encountering . The training itself it uses real life the chaos that the officers are dealing with out in the public. We want to see them make the correct judgment s out in the field. We're going to be able to utilize this for patrol officers , new officers , special operation s group, outside agencies . We're going to welcome other agencies to come in to use this facility . Remediation , if we have someone, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 some officer or someone going through some issues that they have, firearms qualifications or dealing with public, whatever the case might be we can put them through the scenario s and do that remediation . Public education , we could bridge the gap between the police and the community . We could put the public in our shoes that -- what we face on the daily basis, you know, that chaos that I referred to before that we're exposed to and have the citizen s react and, you know, see what it's like there. We're also looking at to doing an add on component where it's a shoot back system. This would engage a student with gun fire if appropriate . So if that encounter -- that use of force encounter we have some shots fired, how is the officer going to react, are they going to use the proper techniques? If not, then we could do the remediation again and provide that feedback to the officer so we could make them more professional in how we deal with the public. So you could see how the cost, you know, benefits are great to the department . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 We could use this system not only for our officers but the public in general , like I said, bridge that gap. It's a community integration project here just to further that relationship that we have with the public. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. So I'll make one comment and then I have one question . I think the one point that you all made that I think is really important is that none of this is coming out of the general fund, correct , Carl it's all being funded by the LSA grant? MR. DEELEY: That is correct , yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Right. So I think it's a -- this is going to be a great program for our police department , can be utilize d by the police. I know the Fire Department utilizes it -- is going to utilize that building as well and the fact that it could be a revenue generator as well. Do we have a timeline yet on, you know, once this construction happens when this might be able to be used by the police department ? MR. DEELEY: Yeah, so the timeline for the work is 45 days is the estimate . We're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 putting together the detail kind of step-by-step plan. But from the point we get the approval we're being told by contractors is 45 days when we can actually -- from start to when we can actually open -- open the unit and start using it. So that's the first thing. And then I think the ongoing piece there is we can start using the classroom areas probably before that. The center is already being used, you know, by the public safety department and also from outside as well. You know, we have people coming in to use that. But the idea of this is to really kind of have a multiuse center and ultimately , you know, we could use it for public use as well. And as mentioned , I'm looking for -- as we do the 2022 budget, is to look at the revenue stream for this center. And this is really a start of that. I know both of Chief Judge and Chief Namiotka have got some good ideas I think where we could use that center going forward that will both save on training costs internally for Scranton but also revenue generation s for the training other departments . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 MR. GAUGHAN : Is there anything like this like the Milo Ranger Theater in our area? I'm assuming not. MR. DEELEY: Not that I'm aware of. Chief, are you aware? CHIEF NAMIOTKA : No. We would be the only agency that has something like this in the area. MR. GAUGHAN : Pretty cool. I don't have any other questions . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I just don't -- I don't have a question s. I have a couple remarks . I think this is a fantastic program providing extensive training for both the police and the firefighters . I love the revenue producing piece down the road to help offset some of the costs. And I also more than anything I like that there is going to be an education and awareness piece for our community , you know, where they get to see firsthand the both sides. So I'm thrilled with this. And I can't wait to see it. MR. DEELEY: That's great to hear. I'd encourage Council to visit the center. As 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 we get this complete , I think it would be good if everybody would come up there and see it in action. But I would encourage you to visit the center and see how it's used today as well. And again, any ideas that you have for co-use for the community . You know, it's a big area. It's a true asset for the City. And I think as you point out, Councilman McAndrew , this could be a big differentiator for Scranton , right, in public safety. And it's -- I know the public building that we could put to good use. DR. ROTHCHILD : I would be happy to visit it. It's only two blocks away from my house. So I could walk down there. But -- MR. DEELEY: I could pick you up. We can walk together . DR. ROTHCHILD : Sounds good, yeah. I know I'm on the way for you. MR. DEELEY: There you go. DR. ROTHCHILD : But I appreciate you and Chief Namiotka explaining , you know, what you expect to be using it for. And it sounds really exciting and all good stuff to me. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Any other 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 questions ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, with that being said, it seems like a great system that the police and fire can use. Mr. Deeley, after this work is done, is there anything else that is on the timeline for the Serrenti Center? MR. DEELEY: There is indeed. So the next phase and, in fact, both Chief Judge and myself and Chief Namiotka , we had looked at this about a week ago. There is additional funding which hasn't been spent. I know the classroom area which is a larger area which will seat I think it's around -- is it 26 people, I think Chief? Like 26 to 30 people -- CHIEF NAMIOTKA : It is 30, Carl, yes. MR. DEELEY: Thirty people. And with very low costs because the building is not all in bad shape. But with very low costs essentially , basically some cleanup work on the walls, some routing of electric s that we need putting some AV equipment in there. Again, this is a place that can be used for any community kind of training , any community meeting s as well for, you know, for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 emergency services . But that will definitely be part of, again, the attraction to be able to generate revenue from other areas because we'll be able to have multiple training sessions going on in that building , you know, simultaneously . So, yeah, the next phase is this extending the training rooms space and putting some AV capability in there so that we could do kind of whether it's remote training for people that want to come in or, like I said, we can have people onsite there kind of doing that work. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. So what I'm hearing in that, you know, another classroom so maybe electric al. I know electric al and plumbing was done prior. MR. DEELEY: Yeah. MR. SCHUSTER : How about any big projects ? Any maintenance on the outside ? Any structural ? Everything else is good? MR. DEELEY: The vast majority has already been done. We saw a lot of money has gone into the center the last few years. But we really haven't been able to leverage that, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 you know, the spend that we put on there. So that's why it's important to get this thing moving and, you know, get some value out of this building . And, you know, again just getting the ROR, right, the investment 's already been made and then turning that into some revenue generating for potential life for 2022 or maybe before. We'll see what we can do. But certainly what we're planning both Chiefs and I have been sitting down talking about this is putting stuff in place to set it up, you know, so we can have like a booking and some marketing capability of that center. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Any other questions ? Okay. Gentlemen , thank you very much. We appreciate it. MR. DEELEY: Appreciate it. Good to see. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. That concludes our guests for tonight . Mrs. Reed? MS. REED: Thank you. FIFTH ORDER. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comment s? MR. MCANDREW : No, thank you. I have nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I just have a couple of quick comments . The first one is just pertaining to a few of the Sixth Order pieces that we have tonight . I'd just figure I'd mention it now since it's just pertaining to appointment s for the Human Relations Commission rather than a specific individual one. And I just wanted to explain like a little bit of background about it since I previously served on the Human Relations Commission prior to being on Council . And for those who don't know, this commission was built out of an ordinance that was passed back in I think 2003 by the City of Scranton . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 And the ordinance built the Human Relations Commission in order to investigate acts of discrimination against people in terms of housing , employment , or public accommodations . And the reason that that was needed to be passed is because we don't have statewide protections that cover people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity or expression . There are many states that do offer those protection s but Pennsylvania is not one of them unfortunately . And so over the years municipalities have passed ordinances to help protect those individuals or the person. So it's related to the Human Relations Act which our state has which protects people on the basis of, you know, religion , creed, race, etc. And so it just adds for the City of Scranton those protections and then the Human Relations Commission exists to, like I said, to investigate if there has been a complaint of discrimination that would apply to it. And from my understanding , it has not been as active, I think, with the switching of administrations .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 And so now I'm happy to see that there are additional commission ers being added. And I'm hoping that this will reinvigorate the commission . And what I'd really like to see is that they can start to get the word out about the commission , not that we want there to be such complaint s. But we -- it's important that Scranton citizens know where to go if they do encounter an issue. And I've had people over the years remark to me that, you know, they've had experience that they would have brought forward a complaint but they just weren't aware of the commission . And so I think it's important to explain the work that they are responsible in doing and so that people know where to go for help if they need it. And on another matter I was going to ask Mrs. Reed to maybe send correspondence over to OECD or the Office of Community Development . I received not so much of a complaint but I had a conversation with someone from the South Scranton Little League regarding the field and facilities that they use. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 they have been trying to get several improvement s and upgrades to the facilities . And some things they haven't received a response on. And I know that they had they applied for grants that I don't believe they had received but they were looking for other ways to make these improvement s. And it sounds like I would think very important ones. So that field is home to the Challengers which is a special and (inaudible ) sports team. And they don't have handicap accessible bathroom s, which I would think would be really important for those who need it to have that sort of access. And then, you know, one of their other issues were regards to the lights that are very costly for them. And they wanted to switch to new LED lights that would be more energy efficient and cost effective . So I was just looking for some more information from OECD about ways that we would work with them to help make those improvements . I know that there's also some issues with PennDOT because they have a piece 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 along the park that they are also having issues with and so they're going to be having a meeting with them to discuss those changes . And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Thank you. Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : I just have a few real quick. I was able to touch base with Tom Preambo down at DPW today. And I passed along some poor road conditions that I had reported to me. One was the 200 of Prospect Avenue. I know that's been ongoing for a while. And that's actually the utility 's responsibility to pave, I believe . That was what the representative from PA American Water was referring to when they got, you know, behind last year in terms of their paving. So that's going to be on the list to be paved as soon as the factory is open. And I also got one for 100 North Cameron. So they're going to take a look at that. The street sweeping I did ask about that. That's going to be done differently this year. Instead of having a schedule , you know, neighbor hood by neighbor hood each week, they're 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25102 sort of going to follow the recycling schedule . I'm going put together a full explanation on what that was. I didn't get a chance to look at the website . I guess it is on the website exactly what they're doing. It's -- they're really just going to follow the recycling schedule . So instead of just hitting one neighborhood for one week, they're going to hit it multiple times. That's the reason behind it. And all three street sweepers will be out on the street. In terms of -- Mrs. Reed, I don't know if this would go to Miss Cipriani , but regarding the zoning officer , have we hired a zoning officer yet? And also, I know that Mr. Oleski has been out of the LIPS Department . So who's signing the certification s for the construction permits. I also just had a question on that. And I'll forward that along to you, Mrs. Reed, in an e-mail. And then lastly, you know, we're grateful that Congress was able to pass the American Rescue Plan and that was signed into law by President Biden last week. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25103 I think it's important to note that this isn't just, you know, an open check where you, you know, you could spend the money on everything -- on anything . There's certain restrictions to it and there is certain things where the money could be spent. So I think they'll be a part of discussions going forward . But we are grateful that, you know, we're finally getting some aid. And that's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. I first want to officially congratulate our colleague and Council woman Jessica Rothchild on having her beautiful baby girl. So great job and I saw a picture of baby. She really is beautiful . Good luck and God Bless. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you so much. She's getting fussy right now. MR. GAUGHAN : I could imagine . That's great news. So two other things I want to mention . I wanted to thank Director Preambo of the DPW. I mentioned two weeks ago there was a very dangerous situation at the top of Ferdinand Street and his department and he really led the charge to take quick action 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25104 there. And they are address ing that situation . So I want to thank him personally for that. Also, we did send a request to City officials about speeding on Sanderson Avenue and Electric Street. I've been contact ed numerous times by one neighbor in particular out there. So we're going to see if there is anything else that we could do. One of the ideas was to put one of those speed monitors up to potentially try to at least tamp it down for a little while. And as Councilman Donahue mentioned , good news has been really hard to come by this past year with the pandemic and everything else that's been going on. We did get very, very good news in the fact that the American Rescue Package was passed by Congress . And President Biden led the charge with the Congressional Democrat Center Casey, Congressman Cartwright. I know Council , Mayor Cognetti has been advocating for this funding for a long time. And we're extremely grateful and glad that they came through for us. Cities often face enormous challenges even outside of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25105 pandemic . And in many of the times we're left to fend for ourselves. We have federal mandates and no way to pay for them. And then we have to turn unfortunately in many respect s to the taxpayer s of our City who are already overcharged and don't have another dime to give. In this respect , this money will go a long way. And it is sorely, sorely needed. I mean, over the past few months we've heard from the Pennsylvania Economy League or financial coordinator or Act 47 Coordinator we've heard from. PFM, our financial consultant we've heard from the administration official s that next year we're looking at a sizeable deficit . The year after that a sizeable deficit . Some of that because of the pandemic and some of that because of the other challenge s that we face. And again, we're not in a unique position because almost every other city, borough , township across the Commonwealth is in many of the same situations . I do think it's -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25106 MR. DONAHUE : Not so much the townships , sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : Right, maybe not the townships . I do think it's important over the next few months to establish priorities for how we're going spend these funds and make sure that, you know, the greatest amount of people are affected positively by this in the City which I'm sure will be the case. So I did speak to the Mayor. We are going to work together , Council , Mayor Cognetti and her administration to make sure that these properties are established that the funding is spent in a very transparent way and that the public can see every dime and every dollar that's spent. So again, grateful , much needed relief and finally some good news, after a year of not so good news. That's all I have. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO A CONTRACT BETWEEN THE CITY OF SCRANTON AND OPENGOV FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CITY MANAGEMENT OPERATING SYSTEM. MR. GAUGHAN : At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-H be introduced into its proper committee . MR. DONAHUE : So moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? I want to say a few things about both 5-H and 5-I as a package . I was -- as I said during the presentation tonight by OpenGov , I was very impressed with what they had to present . The bottom line is the City has to do something . We heard tonight that both the financial management system and the operating system -- management system of the City is going to be outdated. We're no longer going to be able to use the one that we currently have. And it goes back to the early 2000s. What they presented tonight brings the City of Scranton I think in finally into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25114 the 21st century with technology . I've been a big proponent since I've been on Council of making the City more technologically friendly and more efficient . And if you look at other cities who are really progressive in Pennsylvania and around the country , they use technology to their benefit to be more efficient . They're not afraid of it. So I think it's very, very important that we approve this. There obviously is a cost to it. But I look at this more as an investment because the benefit is our government becomes much more user-friendly in terms of the people who live here, who pay taxes, who want to look at different information like our finances . This really opens the books in terms of that information whereas they would have to do a Right To Know request or you jump through hoops to get something that could easily be presented to them by OpenGov in their platform . So that would be number one. Number two, one of the things that I really liked about this was the permitting and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25115 licensing aspect. There's no reason that if you're a contractor or if you are trying to do business in the City that you need to physically come down to the building and get a permit. In other cities it's all done online. And if we go with this company it looks like that is going to be the same case in the City of Scranton . So we're making it easier on people, more user-friendly . We already have outdated technology . I think this makes us much more efficient . And I think it benefits the residents of the City. So I'll be voting in favor of this. There were some question s that I would like answered before final passage in terms of the detail of the cost that was not included in either of the items on our agenda. The disclosures , again, I don't know how they were left out but they were. We need to see those before we vote for this, I believe . So as long as we get that breakdown and that documentation , I will be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ?

On the question , I'm going to be voting for this agreement . It's the first step to solve this problem that has affected all the people in this area for decades upon decades . It is an absolute shame what some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25123 people have had to go through . I've -- and since I've been on Council I've been fighting for the people down there. And unfortunately because of so many of the things that were mentioned here tonight and other reasons if we go back a few years with the prior administration this has taken a long time. And it will ultimately take according to what they said about two to three years for final completion . But I'll thrilled that this is the first step. And we're taking it. And eventually this problem is going to be solved. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I also -- MR. DONAHUE : I agree with Councilman Gaughan there. I mean, this should have been done a decade ago. But at least we're, you know, starting this process and getting the ball moving, you know, they've -- the people on that block have dealt with too much over the last decade. MR.

We have a lot of situations that involve mental health in Scranton and in Pennsylvania and around the country . And our police officers in many respects are under some really, really stressful situations that require , you know, instincts to kick in right away. And I think any time that we can invest in this type of training environment which provides the realism that this system provides and real life training scenarios , I think it's a huge benefit for our police department . I also think the one benefit of this is the fact that it's probably going to end up being a revenue generator . And Scranton is going to be the leader on this in our area. According to the Chief and the Business Administrator we don't have -- no other community in our area has anything like this.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25130 So they're going to be coming to the Serrenti Center and we're going to be able to generate some revenue . So these are all good things. It's a positive project . It's not going to affect our budget and our bottom line in any way since this is all going to be funded through an LSA grant, very positive for the police department and very positive for the City.

PREVIOUSLY TABLED - FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FOR ADOPTION - RESOLUTION NO. 120, 2021 – ACCEPTING THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE REVIEW BOARD (“HARB”) AND DENYING THE CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS FOR L. R. COSTANZO CO., INC., 123 NORTH MAIN AVENUE, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA 18504 FOR THE FOLLOWING UPGRADES TO SITE LIGHTING THROUGHOUT THE PROPERTY AT PNC BANK, 201 PENN AVENUE, SCRANTON , PA 18503. MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Community Development ? DR. ROTHCHILD : As Chair for the Committee on Community Development , I recommend a final vote of Item 7-H. MR. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? On the question , just so we're clear on what this vote is going to look like, a yes vote -- if you vote yes that means you're voting to uphold the HARB's recommendation which was to deny the application . And a no vote will be a vote against the denial and in favor of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25133 applicant . I stated earlier during the public hearing that we had that I'm going to be voting no just solely -- well, based on two things, the testimony that we heard tonight and also the review of the HARB's denial. In my view, the application does not violate anything -- any of the criteria that is set forth in our code for the historic district . We can't make businesses jump through hoops for minor things like this I don't think. I think we'll actually drive businesses away. I am very supportive of the HARB. And I do think that their efforts to preserve our downtown and the historic nature of our downtown are important . In this instance , I don't believe that a personal preference should, you know, drive this project in the other direction and make them again jump through hoops. I think we have to look at the very specific criteria that is set forth in the code. And for those reasons , I'm going to vote no against the resolution and for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25134 applicant . MR. DONAHUE : I agree. You know, they didn't meet the, you know, the criteria that was outlined . And like Councilman Gaughan said, you know, I think it was more stylistic differences than, you know, basically off of what's in the code. So for that reason I'm going to be voting no. DR. ROTHCHILD : I'll also be voting no. You know, I appreciate hearing from the applicant s in our caucus earlier that I felt like that they really helped explain where they were coming from. You know, they already purchased the materials but, you know, I also don't think that it has an impact on the historical building or the historical district . So, you know, I appreciate the work that HARB does. But I don't agree with their decision just in this instance . And I'll be voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, I'm voting no. I posed a couple question s. They were answered . The applicant s pleaded their case. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25135 I thought they did a great job doing that. And, you know, I thought the historical piece of violating were stretch ed. And I agree with Councilman Donahue . This is -- PNC's been around since I'm kid. So, you know, like you said jumping through hoops. And they're comparing lights to the 70s. 70s to what? They were approved -- they were okay when they were in the 70s looking like that. I just thought that they did a great job pleading their case. And I'm voting no. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Anyone else on the question ? So again just to be clear, a yes vote means you're voting to uphold the HARB's recommendation which was to deny the application . A no vote will be a vote against the denial and in favor of the applicant . And I think we lost Councilman Schuster . So I'll give him a second so he doesn't miss the vote. Sorry, Tom, we lost you. Did you have anything to say on the -- oh, you're muted. MR. SCHUSTER : Sorry, I was losing my internet connection . No, I agree with you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25136 all from what I've heard. But I plan on voting no as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : No. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : No. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Gaughan . MR. GAUGHAN : No. 7-H has not been adopted . MS. REED: EIGHTH ORDER. OLD BUSINESS . 8-A.

Is there a possibility we could have Kevin send a letter to Joe O'Brien to see if there's going to be a request for qualifications to select law firms that are going to be working on the Meadow Brook Project how they are going to be selected and I think that should be about cover it.
