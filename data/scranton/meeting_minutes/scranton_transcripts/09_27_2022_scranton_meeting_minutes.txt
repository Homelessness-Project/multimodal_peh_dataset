DONAHUE : Are there any comments on any of the Third Order Items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one. I just want to say L'Shana Tova to all of those who celebrate Rosh Hashanah . MR. DONAHUE : Are there any other announcements ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I'd just like to announce that on October 1st, the North Scranton Neighborhood Association Watch is going to have their October fest. It's going to be between -- actually I don't have the times. But it is on -- MR. MCANDREW : Five to eight, I think. MR. SCHUSTER : So five to eight on October 1st, the North Scranton Neighborhood Association Watch will be holding their annual October fest. That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Are there any other announcements ? I just have one. Tomorrow Wednesday , September 28th at approximately 1 p.m., Marywood University will be testing their emergency notification system. The system will go off for about one minute. It will probably be heard in most of Dunmore , Throop, Green Ridge, North Scranton and the plot section of Scranton . The announcement will state that it is only a test but just so everyone is aware if they hear that in their neighborhoods tomorrow . Mr. Voldenberg . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : Joan is always first, so Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I understand that we have an approved DPW union contract . Is that going to come up in legislation for your approval ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Do you know when that will come? MR. DONAHUE : I do not. I was told that we are going to put that -- that it was just being put into the legislative format. I was hoping to receive it for next week. But as of now, we haven't received it yet. But there is still the possibility that we receive it tomorrow for next week. MS. HODOWANITZ : The other three, police, fire, and Single Tax Office, any progress ? MR. DONAHUE : Those negotiations are ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : And any progress on the 2021 audit? Never mind. You gave me your 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 answer. With regard to the payroll preparation tax, I saw the article in the Times this morning , the school district 's concerns . And apparently of 8,500 potential accounts only 2,400 businesses have made a payment for the period of April 1st to June 30th. That is 28 percent . So that means that's 72 percent are delinquent . And you had anticipated collecting 1.8 million for the nine months of this year. But you've only collect ed 248,000 so far. Now, I understand you're going to have a caucus with Berkheimer on October 25th. Will Berkheimer , one, answer the questions about the self-employed and rental income? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : And two, have current information on how much has been collected ? MR. DONAHUE : That is the plan, yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okey-dokey. Hallelujah and pass the ammunition , I looked at the City's website and there's a delinquent refuse/trash fee database . It's one file. It's as of August 1st. As of August 1st the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 principal that is delinquent is $10,209,772.98. And the interest is $434,198.20 for a grand total of 10,643,971.18. That's as of August 1st. Now, you need two more databases to add there, one on delinquent property taxes and one on delinquent payroll preparation taxes. And I'm hoping to see those before the end of the year. So give a warning note to Berkheimer . Don't let them slide. I attended the Composite Pension Board meeting on September 21st. And I was dismayed to learn that the four vendors that they have, PFM Asset Management , Mellon Bank, Durkin and MacDonald and I think Thomas Anderson , all of their contracts are expired anywhere from 12 to 18 months. Yet we are paying taxpayer dollars for those vendors to manage the 106.5 million dollars that remains in the fund. Now, is that any way to oversee and provide internal controls for taxpayer dollars ? I recommend that you send a recommendation to the Mayor that she have a come to Jesus meeting with all her department heads, all the commission 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 authorities and boards and get a current list of all the vendors with which they are doing businesses and paying taxpayer dollars and what was the expiration date on all of those contracts ? And anyone expired needs an RFP ASAP. We can do all of these grants and all of this other stuff. You should not be handing out government money, taxpayer dollars when you don't have a valid contract . You're asking for trouble . And God forbid it comes down, you'll have no excuse. You need to fix that. And let's see, oh, yes, and I was very pleased to see at my request PFM did provide a copy electronically of their monthly document which got into Third Order. And you should be looking at the City's performance . Ignore all the other extraneous material about the markets . As of January 1st, the fund was 135 million . It is down as of August 31st to 106 million . And this month it's going down even more. So you need to have current contracts with those vendors or you're going to be explaining what happened to the money. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here today is that, you know, I've done eight videos on rewriting the City Charter . And in one of the videos I went to Pine Brook to Chick Feldman Field, took a look at that field and the surrounding area. And the reason I'm saying that is we're having a discussion on Lackawanna College using that area. Look, there has to be an agreement that they repair any damage they do to that field. And to be honest with you, the City needs to get something for it. The City needs to get some kind of money, some kind of -- it doesn't have to be a lot of money. But I think the residents have a right to expect a return on something they rent. You don't have to go crazy and try to bleed them dry. But, you know, it's time to really have all of this stuff in writing , not in make believe . And, you know, since I bring that up, you know, ECTV I think they do a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 really great job. I don't know why their funding is so low. And I don't understand because the franchise fee should be supporting ECTV and it's not because they've made a couple videos that I was in for -- because I want the Home Rule Charter rewritten . And I think that today's agenda really drives it home. I think there is 3 and a half million dollars here of grant money that I think that the resident s should sit on these boards and decide where this money is going to go and how it was going to be spent and whether a lot of that money should have been diverted somewhere else. But you know in saying that, you know, ECTV should have its own little area to work from, whether it's a building of their own, a building that's been condemned or a abandoned and then funding found to rehab it and give them a base to work from because if this is a community asset that all the residents of the city and the county and probably a lot of other places, you know, rely on for -- or can rely on for information , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 think we should enable them and empower them and make them independent . You know, I don't know if -- I don't know how they feel about making the videos that I present because I think that I'm controversial as far as the government itself is concerned because I don't think they appreciate my opinions . And I don't know what play that has on ECTV but hopefully none. But, you know, I'd like to see some really meaningful legislation come out and start to enhance the life of the residents of this City. And I think until we can put citizens on these boards and they can see that they're part of the process and have some control on where this money is going -- you know, people talk about taxation . I really think that we need to consider who we're taxing and how much we're taxing them for and pay a lot of attention because I think the American people and Scrantonians in general are severely overtaxed. And, you know, people speak about tax money as if it's free and it's just floating in the air. And that's not the case. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 You know, we need a dedicated small business incubator in this City driven to create employment and opportunity for the residents because you can spend all the grant money from whatever source it came from in every part of this City at one time or another and it will all revert back to the same condition it was in when you started because you're just chasing blight and that's not the answer. Empower ing people, giving them employment , giving them a living wage, giving them an opportunity for advancement not only for the citizen s but for the whole city because the city goes where the residents go. And if the resident s earn money and they're successful , the city becomes successful . How? By the success of its citizens . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just on a couple points there too, so the agreement with Lackawanna College is on our agenda tonight as 6-A. For ECTV funding we did increase their allocation last year at their request . And we'll see what they request this year. And the grant funding that's on our 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 agenda tonight , that grant funding isn't awarded yet. That is just the City agreeing to be the conduit for that application . Thank you. Next on the list, Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : Good evening , Council . I hope Billy King is well. A meeting was held last Thursday night that the neighbors at GMC and the Council pushed for. It was very disappointing . Rendering s were shown of a garage to be built on the entire even side of the 400 block of Colfax, were just that, rendering and not plans. The height of these rendering s is based on underground parking for first floor, which they would not need to bother changing the zone to civic for that height. I think they said 48 feet but insist they do need to change the zoning because if they run into a problem then they would have to change and build up again, which would definitely not be acceptable . The 300 block would be their ED department and trauma. And the 200 block would be a very high garage filling the entire block also. Two blocks of garages is not healthcare 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 that keeps people from having to leave from New York and Philadelphia for better services . Two blocks of garages will not offset revenue from taxes. The cancer center, that benefits people probably from having to leave town maybe. But that's going in Dickson City. The behavioral center which we very much need, that's going in Plains. Now, you could correct me at the end if -- I know if the taxes are wrong that I'm trying to talk about because I'm not really up on that new payroll tax thing. But that's going in Plains and the orthopedic center is already in Scranton . So what payroll tax is going to offset the tax loss to the City from all of homes that were brought down? They also admitted that they didn't budget for the nicer looking building on the 400. They told us what they thought we wanted to hear but they also said their bottom line is what's going to rule. That's why they need to change the zone because they really -- so we really didn't learn anything that we didn't already know except that those other blocks are not going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 have the buildings on them that we were guessing . The whole blocks are going to be filled with garages. And there will be a possibility of any of the little green spaces that are left will be pocket parks. And then on my side of the street, one of the houses that everybody was complain ing on Facebook being torn down will be used for offices supposedly . And everything else will be green space for gardens or pocket parks. Well, they didn't spend $230,000 to pull down my friend's house -- Salvatory 's house to put a garden in there for the neighbor s. So obviously that's like a holding thing until they decide to eat up the rest of the block if they ever can in the future. So right now we're begging you still not to let that civic go through because they're not giving us a chance here at all to really come to a compromise because a compromise as I could see it is unless we want to. Now this is a letter that went onto their employees and I brought a copy for each of you in case I don't have time to read it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 An employee gave it to me. And this is a copy of what they said the day after the meeting . If I could read it without my cheaters. We're moving forward to our efforts to expand Geisinger Community Center by meeting with the Scranton official s and our neighbors in the Hill Section . Our goal is to make better health easier for our community by improving our hospital as a place to work and to get care. We will be sharing some preliminary concepts of how we might expand our emergency department , convert more of our inpatient units to private rooms and create a better parking solution on campus to show our community how an expanded GCMC can meet our community 's healthcare needs. These concepts are purely concept ional and subject to change based on numerous factors between now and a potential final plan. It is possible that some of these meeting s, conversations , and conceptual rendering s become part of our local news coverage in coming weeks. So we wanted to tell you first. As 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 we learn more about the City's rezoning decision and engage our neighbors , we'll share more details with you in the meantime . If you have any questions , our managers have been briefed on the situation . Thank you. So the key words in everything that they said to us, everything they proposed to their employees is subject to change. So what their deal is, is that they want to get that civic thing so they can -- I know. Time's up. I'm leaving . MR. DONAHUE : But I'll reach out to you and discuss some things we're talking about to help. Thank you. Next on the list, Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , City resident , homeowner , taxpayer . I'm glad Joan mentioned Berkheimer . She reminded me of something that I forgot about. Last month I got a letter from Berkheimer . I've been retired since 2018. And this letter said that my wife and I haven't sent a tax return for our business . I don't know what they're talking about. I worked different jobs over the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 years. I never had a business . I have an accountant that does my taxes and he gives me the form every year to send in. I never owe anything . And now they're telling me my wife and I have a business all of a sudden. That's news to me. If that's the people we have collect ing our taxes for the City I think we're in trouble . But I thank Joan -- thank you. I put that letter aside a month ago. I still never made a phone call. I got to give them a call and straighten them out. Anyway next thing, last meeting when I was here I mentioned a few things to the Mayor about getting into City Hall. And she said, you know, I want to make this building safe. We're not going to have everybody running through . I said, well, put a police officer downstairs . She said we can't afford it. Well, it seems like we can afford a lot of other things like you people you hired a -- you agreed to hire an outside firm to find funding for the City which I don't think we needed. We could have spent that money on a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 police officer for downstairs . We have a beautiful new door there now. Whenever we need money we seem to find it. But we can't put a police officer downstairs so we can come and go as we please and get business done in our City Hall. The City Hall belongs to the people not the Mayor. Lastly, you're probably sick of hearing this. But last year I was told by the supervisor of DPW we're going to get our corner fixed on Bulwer and North Rebecca and so far nothing . Now the colder weather is setting in. So I'm probably going to have to wait another year now. I think this is getting ridiculous . I know if former Director Preambo was still in charge it would have been done already because he was doing a heck of a job. And when I asked the Mayor why isn't he there anymore, it's a personnel issue. Every time somebody resigns or whatever , it's a personnel issue. But I think the people of the City should know what's going on because he was doing a heck of a job because I spoke to him last summer. And he said he watches the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 meetings all the time. And when he hears people's problems he gets it taken care. So now we have the Business Administrator as the acting DPW Director and nothing is getting done. So I'll keep coming back until it's done. I might be on my death bed by then but who knows. MR. DONAHUE : We did get a response . I just have to find the response to -- and I'll address that in Fifth Order. We got a response to when you were in the last time we reached out seeing when it would happen. We did get a response . I just can't -- I just wasn't able to find it real quick. I'll address it in Fifth Order. MR. SPINDLER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list Charles Cortese (phonetic .) MR. CORTESE : My name is Charles Cortese . Good evening , Members of Council . My family and I are resident s and property owners in the 200 block of Wheeler Avenue. I am here concerning CMC's proposal to construct an eight-story parking garage in the 200 block of Colfax Avenue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 Our property extends from Wheeler Avenue to Sherwood Court. The rear of our property all 120 feet of it will be adjacent to the propose d garage. An 8 foot garage is approximately 75 feet tall. With the addition of elevator housing , HVAC units, lights and cell towers on top the height may exceed 85 to 90 feet. Just imagine an 80 foot wall in your backyard . The walls at Lewisburg Penitentiary are not even that high. Sherwood Court is barely wide enough for a single car to drive through it. DPW trash removal trucks have a difficult time to maneuver through the court. They have to back down the court to collect the trash because they can't turn onto Roselyn Avenue because Roselyn is a one-way street and is too narrow. Using our garage and parking areas in the rear of Sherwood Court now is difficult because of the traffic . Imagine how difficult it will be if this garage is built. We live in a residential zoning area. We have for too long had to bear the burden of the aggressive nature of the hospital 's expansion programs . The peace and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 tranquility of our backyard s and neighborhood will be forever gone and will be in the shadows of an 80 foot high monster wall. The devaluation of our property is immeasurable and our tax base will not reflect this devaluation . Please consider what I have said concerning the parking garage and the rezoning issue that comes with it. Please do not make us a victim of collateral damage for the sake of Geisinger 's aggressive expansion plans. Imagine having an 80 foot wall in your backyard . Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . Many of you won't like my opinions on things tonight and I could care less. I leave no question about my absolute dislike of the illegals , not immigrants , Biden's no English speaking , uneducated , unskilled just useless people that will never contribute a thing to America . Our country 's been infested with them. But today when I read the paper this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 morning on the front page is this article about a Congolese family. They're unhappy with the way things are. Yet they have hospitalization , welfare , food vouchers , who knows what else, six children in school. What are they, $15,000 a piece? Six children in school and two males living with them 20, 24 years old; and they're so unhappy with the situation I guess the finances he threatens to leave Scranton . Well, I'd like to do everything within my power to help him achieve this if it's possible . I just can't imagine what this group will ever achieve . They will never be Americans . They will never assimilate like we need. How can you be so thankless , so ungrateful for everything being done and put in print in the paper how unhappy you are with situations . You know, if I could round up all 123 million illegals if I was in a position to do so, I think I'd just put them in concentration camps because they'll never be Americans . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Ellman, that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 not -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Councilman Donahue , this is enough. MR. DONAHUE : Relax. That's not acceptable . Mr. Ellman, are you native American ? MR. ELLMAN: I didn't hear you. MR. DONAHUE : Are you a native American ? MR. ELLMAN: Yes. MR. DONAHUE : You are. I mean, because otherwise we're all immigrants , right? MR. ELLMAN: I am not saying anything adversely that affects you people. I know how far I could go. In back of here it says what you can do. This is my opinion . This town is full of people making 750, 850 a month trying to keep a roof over their heads and here is a man living on practically nothing a whole family complaining about it. I'll tell you what, before it's all over this country will wish there was more thousands like that stormed Washington . They'll wish we had a military . They'll wish we had some bright people to stick up for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 America and fight for America because we are in terrible -- our Navy is second now. We have just went down the tubes the past couple years. There's no coming back again. How would you like to be in the military with such leadership that we hear on television in Washington ? MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: These aren't leaders. I'm sorry I went over. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. ELLMAN: I'm sorry I offended you. See, there's too many people in this City are fearful of saying anything . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Next on the list, Angelo Jarman. MR. JARMAN: It's good to see you again. I've come to reiterate some of what I spoke about last week in support of upzoning Scranton and deregulating some aspects of our zoning code as well as my support or other aspects of urbanization for the City. So to reiterate some of what I said last week, I do believe that Scranton zoning as it is now is better than a great deal of cities 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 in the country where building anything other than a single-family home is just outlawed entirely . However , our housing supply is too constrained to meet the demands. And when that happens it causes housing prices to skyrocket needlessly . And I do believe the best solution for this to allow for the denser housing construction that many other cities have done, had great success . It does not mean necessarily building skyscrapers or allowing industrial plants in residential neighborhoods . But even solutions as simple as outside of downtown allowing four or five story apartment building s where we could have more people living in a smaller area and cost the City less in terms of infrastructure . If we can have a 100 people living on a single block instead of 100 people spread out across a mile considering the roads can cost one to two million a mile and that's not including the cost of water, gas, electric infrastructure . And it really -- we really do owe it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 to the citizens of Scranton to everyone living in Scranton to take a more responsible measured stride in how we zone our city because no city in America can afford to have this sort of lumpy house that's spread out. It costs us too much money. If we were to just to raise taxes to cover the replacement cost on its own, we would have to have taxes more than like double or triple in some instances . And I believe denser zoning is a solution to that. But in addition to building denser housing we can ease some restrictions on mixed use residential housing , such as, allowing new construction in Scranton that, for example , as you might see in other cities or even some areas in Scranton that have been grandfathered in with older zoning codes. You have commercial properties on the first floor of these buildings . And you might have a second, third, fourth floor that's all housing . And when you have -- that is on a single lot of land you have revenue coming into the business . You have taxes coming into that business . You have taxes coming in through the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 incomes of these resident s, and then you have a more valuable property because that would bring in more tax revenue for the City -- well, it would be per unit, like, per person living on that property would still be paying relatively low amounts into those taxes. Having those sorts of developments in Scranton I believe would do a lot of good at increasing the character of the City. It would do a lot of good towards decreasing dependency on automobiles for transportation , more people would be able to simply access most of their daily needs through walking , biking, or taking public transit which would further decrease the burden on the City to replace our infrastructure . For example , today rather than driving downtown and parking I walked from my house over in Green Ridge. It was a -- for me it was a relative ly flat walk. Also, I can't say the same that it would be easy for everyone else in Scranton , but if we had -- if we were spending less money on replacing our roads with everyone driving large vehicle s wearing them down, we could afford to have better maintain ed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 sidewalks . We could afford to have better public transit. And like I said, I do believe we owe it to all the residents of Scranton to build the City more responsibly rather than wasting money on spreading everything out as far as possible . Thank you very much and have a have a good day. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, you too. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. JEFFRIES : You caught me by surprise , sorry. As I always say I wasn't going to talk tonight but when they mentioned about Berkheimer I have to agree with Les. I received a letter in the mail as well and I thought , huh, what's this about? So when I opened it I did call them. They told me to ignore it. So if that is someone that's going to be handling our billing , you know, here I am a citizen and Les got a letter and how many other people got letters , wasted postage, wasted paper, wasted someone 's time to put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 together that information to come out and then waste my time because I had to call down there and ask them what was this letter all about. And second thing I wanted to address was the article in the paper that was just addressed by the other gentleman that was up here. I read the same article . And it's amazing the different perspective that we take when we read an article . The article was about inflation and the dollar and how far our dollars are going. It gave a graph of the different expenses of how much we're spending on housing or food, our gas and all of those things. And it did go into with this family was suffering from the high prices of everything . But it could have been any family in that article . It doesn't have to be a Congolese family. There's a lot of families out there suffering because of the high prices. So to zero in on just one individual family is wrong. That's not right. And we all should look out for each other and for you to point -- there is nothing that gets me more when you say those people. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 You know, that's grouping everybody into the same bucket. And that's not right. So I had to address that tonight . If anyone has an opportunity read that article that's on the first page of the paper and it goes back to page number six. And I read the whole article . And it was very enlightening . And it was not -- it was just amazing as the gentleman stood here and talked about that article . And I read the same article and we both came away with different perspectives . So just think about that. That's all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you for that, Norma. Also, was the letter you received from Berkheimer in relation to the Payroll Prep Tax; do you remember ? MS. JEFFRIES : I don't. I don't recall. MR. DONAHUE : Okay. I'll follow up on that. Okay. Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka , first, I would like to address some words that were said here before this body tonight . I understand that some of them were distasteful 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 and some of us were shocked and definitely put off by them. But I would like to remind everyone out there that the First Amendment does protect speech. And the First Amendment was always ruled on as protecting speech particularly heinous or discomforting to people because the voices that were in the past that were so suppressed from speaking were truly those that were oppressed . The general population who everyone agrees with does not have to fight for their First Amendment rights because they are not confronted . It has been the history of this nation even if they did not like the speech that was coming out from someone , to honor that as part of First Amendment . That changes when it comes to fighting words and some of the territory that was stepped on in that speech. But I would just like to put forward that even though we do not like some things that are said, there is a right to say them. Now onto the door downstairs for the entrance , I would be interested to know if in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 case of an emergency in this building if the electronic safety door to protect anyone in here is actually unlocked because I thought that if someone was waiting at that doorway and someone came from the front of the building who was armed, sure, the employee s have a back exit out. They could scurry through the offices. But anyone who is trapped in that foyer has no escape route unless if an alarm is triggered , those doors are unlocked . There is a safety issue involved when you make a cattle trap for people in a building that has no exit from it because the only exit for them would be the front door. There usually has to be a second exit. And in case of emergency , there should be something that trigger s that door to unlock. I understand these days we -- in an emergency everything locks down. But in this case that's not actually feasible . It actually puts a hazard to anyone who is stuck on the public side of that doorway . Lastly tonight , I've heard a lot money put out through grants, through some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 matching , some not where funds are found all over to supply businesses and government and operations with free money that limits the taxpayers -- the Scranton taxpayer 's requirement to directly pay them. That's all well and good. But what I have not heard is we have positions in this body who are over six months unfilled that lay out there vacant for an extraordinary period of time. I think as a reference I believe the recycling position at the DPW has been open now for six or eight months unfilled. Maybe it's time and cost cutting to put something forward that says if a position is not filled within six months, maybe it's time to rescind that position and cut the City budget. If it has not been necessary in a six-month period then they should have to come back before this body and explain why a position that has gone unfilled that has not collapsed the system is again valid and necessary . We're looking at budget constraints . We're looking at spending , but I have seen very little effort come before this body that says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 we need to cut in this section . We never trim the fat. We never evaluate what we can lose. And part of that I believe are positions non-mandated ones that sit idle for a long period of time. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just to comment on -- we do give wide latitude in terms of freedom of speech. But Council 's rules do state and they will be followed , no person including members of Council shall use their time during citizens participation to personally insult or attack any individual , name calling , profanity , racial or ethnic slurs, discriminatory remarks based on race, color, religion , national origin, ancestry or place of birth, sex, gender identities such as sexual orientation , disability , marital status or age or any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official business shall not be permitted . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I do intend to get to a few other things like the contract that finally made it for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 stormwater and why you're wanting to move a couple of introductions to final passage tonight . But first I have to -- yesterday when he came home from school I was given this and what I'm to say by my almost recently 12 year old who cares about my life. Okay, now it says, the Sol Vapor sign on the Moosic Street near 307 north is blocking the site of traffic as you are turning left coming out of the parking lot at Dunkin' Donuts behind hello -- oh, behind Dunkin Donuts -- behind -- beyond hello and the Lake Scranton Urgent Care. He said I am to tell you that the green is heavy traffic area and the yellow is moderate traffic area and the sign is in the green area. And it's an accident waiting to happen. And the "X" means that is where the 81 exit is. And any of you who come out of there know how people do come down. I have -- it brings up what 311 does, you know, three -- I've asked about this sign myself through the 311 I think it is at the Mayor's office. And nothing has happened . And I don't know what you do when that doesn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 happen? You know, it's right -- the sign is right next to the curb. And, you know, maybe if you're in an SUV you could see the traffic . But if you are in a sedan as I am you are taking your life in your hand. MR. DONAHUE : We'll reach out to zoning and Code Enforcement to take a look at that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. Now, why are 5-F and G being -- MR. DONAHUE : So we got a memo -- so we got the request last week we request ed a memo for backup that will appear in our Third Order next week because we didn't get the memo in time. But due to a clerical error on the part of the administration there was two pieces of legislation that weren't sent down but need to be approve d by Council before the deadline of September 30th for the application of these grants. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, now -- thank you for that. I am happy to see that there was a contract awarded, but I do have a lot of issues on it. I'm not going to have time for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 them tonight . Maybe I'll put something on paper and e-mail it to all of you. But the one thing that I do know it doesn't even have a firm date for when the product is to be delivered . It's sort of, like, well, you know, when we get around to it. And we hope to do it within 12 months. The heck with, you know, hoping to do it. I mean, we need a firm date when that will happen. Now, this has been a crazy one from the very beginning because the RFQ went out on the 24th of June and the proposals were due on July -- yeah, due five days -- five working days later on the first of July of this year -- last year -- this year. And, I mean, you don't get something like this unless something has happened before. And up until the end, this company that is being awarded it, I have problems because they are already our consultant on our MS4 and also did one of the other reports and has all kinds of information already in their hand. And I will continue next week. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I'm going to mention this tonight once more briefly . Senate dumps water to the sewer plant. I agree with that because all they'll do is pollute the gorge behind Nay Aug Park. And reverse osmosis to me sounds like money flowing up to the dump and the pollution falling down to us, reverse osmosis . Now, I was reading the paper about the Fire Department up on East Mountain . And I think that we should at least have a well heeled rescue truck up there and whatever else they need. A lot of times they come down here. But actually East Mountain is -- my house is closer to East Mountain than it is to Scranton Central City. So I'd like to see the fire hall there stay the same place. And what we have to do is what we have to do. And on taxation once again it was mentioned we're up to 38 percent tax exempt property now and something has to be done. We can't just keep taking in tax exempt buildings and allowing them to eat their way through our property tax because people can't keep paying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 more and more and more every year. I also parked on Adams Avenue tonight and there's been some talk about City Hall being overgrown with needs for space. And on the other side of the parking lot for the fire hall, there is a building that probably has not been occupied for 20 years, who knows how long. I've never seen any activity in there as long as I have been coming to Council . And I was wondering if we couldn't get a little eminent domain going instead of moving who knows where and putting up some buildings and biting the bullet on it but keeping things tight with the City. I think it's a good idea. It's directly after where the firemen park and you could put a building there. You could even take the court because there's nothing left there that -- to really service any buildings there or work out an idea for yourself. But that building has been vacant. It's had nobody in there for at least 20 years. Now, the vote is coming up. And I will remind people that there are people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 running in many other states that want to relegislate Social Security , Medicare, all federal programs every five years. There's one guy from Wisconsin that wants to do it every year. So you will be sitting and waiting to see what kind of bone you're thrown. Point being that we have a governor candidate that's proclaiming he wants the right to overrule the vote in Pennsylvania even for the electoral college . And we have a senator candidate that didn't even live here. And I'm sad that mister -- our other candidate took a stroke. But he's not totally invalid. And, in fact, he's doing pretty well. And it's time that Pennsylvania ns open up their eyes because if we have two Democrat senators from Pennsylvania then you overrule at least the kind of clowns that they elected from Florida . And they are clowns. Thank you and have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : So I guess the only comment I have tonight is there was discussion in public comment about the door downstairs . Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the Police Chief and just address those safety concern s that were brought up tonight about the door downstairs , maybe get an overview on safety for that door if anyone in the foyer is in harm's way if that were to occur and just an overall reasoning behind the safety of that door. And to add onto that also, this door here the glass on the window -- the frosted glass on the window, can we ask the Police Chief too if he could just explain how this is safe? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask both points. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Um, yes, I do have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 comment . I have no problem listening to other people's opinions here. That's important to me to hear discourse and to hear opinions from our citizens . However , we do ask for a level of decorum here on Council . And I believe that's been repeatedly broken in our chambers . And I don't understand why I need to keep addressing hateful disgust ing comments here. I don't understand people's fear of immigrants . And I'm not going to try to understand that here tonight . I did not read the article that was brought up. I certainly will now take a look at it. But I feel to -- the speaker said that they don't know -- they know where the line is to not cross. And I don't believe that is true because to bring up concentration camps and to say that undocumented immigrants belong in concentration camps, I mean, do you realize what happened in concentration camps? Millions of people were killed and tortured. My ancestors -- I'm 50 percent Ashkenazi Jew. And it is so hurtful . And I just can't see what reasons someone would want to say that and bring that up here. I can't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 imagine that is just for attention unless you just purpose ly want to hurt others. And I don't know how it has an affect on your life that there are undocumented immigrant s in this country who just want a better life for themselves and their families . So I will not stay silent when issues like this come up. (Speaking foreign language ) I will not stay silent. And I do speak Spanish too. So that's all that I have for tonight . I just continue to ask for decorum here in our Council meeting s. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Well, I have a couple. So there was couple issues brought forward to me over the weekend and really this week and I passed them onto Mr. Voldenberg . So they're in motion. I have couple for next week. I just got some texts that I have to deal with so and put them together . But I like Mrs. Hodowantiz 's point she brought up today that we have expired vendor contracts . And a prime example was labor counsel a month and a half 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 ago. What I would like to do is request that administration if they don't already have it put together a bidding schedule with all vendors and when they're up and present it to us, put it on the website so we can keep an eye on these and have a better handle on this instead of, you know, coming before us final hour. We need an extension because , you know, we didn't put it out to bid or we forgot to put it out to bid. So please send that correspondence and request . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. The only thing I have, Mr. Voldenberg , can we send correspondence to zoning and possibly Code Enforcement regarding the sign that Miss Schumacher brought up on Moosic Street? I believe the address is 1141 or at least that's what I was able to come up with on my map, but it's at the stop of Moosic Street there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 in the morning . Sir. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

ROTHCHILD : I make a motion to suspend the rules and move 5-F to Seventh Order for a final vote. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , we did receive a memorandum today with this legislation and also with 5-G which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 is up next to suspend the rules -- requesting that we suspend the rules. This legislation wasn't sent to us for last week's meeting due to a clerical error and -- but both have to be approved and attached to the applications which are due on September 30th. And so the memorandum that we did receive will go into Third Order for next week so the public has the opportunity view it. We just did not receive it by the time we posted our agenda for this week. Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : Just on the question , I didn't get to see this memorandum until I arrived here today. I don't have an e-mail of this memorandum other than the paper that I was given when I arrived today. So I'm just going to remind Council , remind the administration that when we're expected to vote on something like -- and especially pass it through to Seventh Order that we're getting to us in a timely manner. Do we have a deadline to accept legislation ? It was Wednesday at noon, wasn't it, Frank, or am I off with that one?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 MR. DONAHUE : Tuesday at noon. MR. VOLDENBERG : Tuesday at noon. MR. DONAHUE : So when this request did come down, I did request that a memo also come down to explain why this wasn't brought to us in a timely fashion and why it did need to be passed by suspending the rules. And I don't think that request -- what was that, Friday, Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : That was Friday, sir. MR. DONAHUE : Friday. So that request was made on Friday and then we were, you know, we didn't receive it until today. MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. As I said in caucus, these are for grant submissions . So I don't have an issue moving it forward . But if it was a different type of legislation I would. MR. DONAHUE : I agree. I don't -- I wouldn't, you know, personally I wouldn't be agreeable to suspending the rules on anything that, you know, unless there was a valid reason for doing so. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , I'm a man of procedure and process . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 And to move this item or this piece of legislation 5-F and then the next one 5-G from Fifth to Seventh Order because a clerical error, how do you miss both pieces like this? I have a problem with it. Of course, it's time sensitive like everything else that is usually sent down our way. And there's always a sense of urgency , oh, let's just put it through . I mean, of course, I'm going to vote to put it through but I'm still disturbed by the fact that we're not following procedure . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ?

DONAHUE : On the question ? On the question , I know there was some question s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 that were posed last week in terms of does the City and Lackawanna College have a plan for maintenance and repairs for the field and then also the fees and amounts prior to -- or questions regarding the fees and amounts prior to entering into this agreement . We did receive a response from that the Parks Director Marissa Duffy that she will do the field and site assessment and determine what repairs are needed when this term is coming to an end which is at the end of this year. They are also working on a rental fee schedule to submit to Council for approval for all City parks that we'll expect to receive by the end of the year. And then if approve d, the fee schedule would begin in the beginning of 2023 moving forward . Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , I did pose some of those questions regarding this agreement last week. I'm glad to see we got that information . Again, we got it late today. I did not have a chance to look at that. It isn't up tonight for final passage so I will move this legislation 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 forward . I'll get a chance to review that information and share my thoughts with it. Last week when I spoke about it though, it didn't seem -- the price that was arrived at didn't seem there was any research done of past agreements especially with a college that has had past dealing s with the school district and other such facilities in our area. So I did have some of those questions . I'm glad to see we got some of that information . I'm glad to see that there is a plan moving forward . That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'll also be interested in seeing the additional information that be sent to us prior to final vote next week. I'm glad to see that perhaps this will help to standard ize the process for future lessees of city parks. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. I'm also glad to see that there's going to be a realistic 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 number instead of one pulled out of the air to rent this field with the construction of a realistic fee schedule . That is all. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And just to reiterate , I don't think we're going to get the whole rental fee schedule by next week. But we are expected to get it by the end of the year in the form of legislation to review and then either approve , amend, etc. But I believe we are also waiting for a schedule of when Lackawanna will be using Chick Feldman . So can you reach out, Mr. Voldenberg , again and make sure that we get that -- have it posted on the website before our final vote next week. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Donahue . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , also if I may add, when we you send over that correspondence there, can we make sure that there is differentiation between say, you know, Lackawanna College who student s do pay for tuition and they accept funds there to like an organization such as a little league or a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 neighborhood group.
