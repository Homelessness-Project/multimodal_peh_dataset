CORRESPONDENCE DATED MAY 31, 2023 FROM OECD REGARDING CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT FOR CITY COUNCIL . 3.B. MINUTES OF THE SCRANTON FIREFIGHTERS PENSION COMMISSION MEETING HELD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 APRIL 19, 2023. 3.C. OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER DATED MAY 30, 2023 FOR THE PERIOD JANUARY -MAY 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. SMURL: I have just one. The South Scranton Residents Association is tomorrow evening at 509 Cedar Avenue at 6:30. That is it. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So seventy -nine years ago today the greatest generation participated in the D-Day Operation of June 6th, 1944. It brought together to the land, air, and sea forces of the allied armies and what became known as the largest amphibious invasion in military history . The operation given the code name overload delivered five naval assault divisions to the beaches of Normandy , France. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 So without D-Day we wouldn't be sitting here having a good day. So let's always remember . And that is all I have. MR. KING: Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : I'm just -- I guess I'll -- thank you, Mr. McAndrew for mentioning D-Day. It's the first I've heard of it all day and usually we heard of it -- we see it on TV and everywhere else. My grandfather -- both my grandfathers were in World War II. But one was in the European Theatre of Operations , the other in the pacific . But he went in D-Day I think plus seven and crossed the line (inaudible ) and thank you for mention ing that tonight . DR. ROTHCHILD : -- so first of which I have announced before the Greek Festival officially started today and will be going on until Saturday . I actually grabbed some before I came here tonight because I just couldn't wait. And it's from 11 a.m. to 7:00 at night at the Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church at 505 North Washington . And if you want to order in advance you could do so online. You could check out the menu as well 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 at GreekFoodScranton .com. And the Pride flag raising for the city took place on Saturday . And I appreciate Councilman King was able to be there. I was not. I was away this weekend . But I appreciate all those who attended . I think it's a great way for our city to celebrate LGBTQ Pride Month. And I'm sure some people maybe Miss Jeffries will talk about the Electric City Flower Show, so not to steal her thunder but that's going to be taking place this Saturday . I think it starts at 10 a.m., and might go onto 3:00. So it's throughout the day. You could go to the park. It's a free flower show. There's tons of other activities . It's great for kids. I brought my daughter before. And they're going to have food trucks as well. So I'm looking forward to that. And another thing going on Saturday , it's a busy weekend for a lot of events in our city. The Scranton Fringe Festival will be hosting their annual Gay Story Slam. And I'm actually looking forward to being part of that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 I have in the past. And it's a great way to raise funds for Scranton Fringe Festival . And that will be Saturday night. It starts at 7:00. And you could buy tickets online at the Scranton Fringe Festival 's website . That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . One thing I'll mention I know we received an e-mail from a resident from up near Clearview Street who, you know, obviously we all know there was an extreme ly difficult situation that occurred up there in North Scranton yesterday morning that resulted in an individual taking his own life. This resident was very thankful for the Scranton Police at how professionally they handled the situation , did everything they could to try to negotiate with this individual for several hours. Unfortunately , it didn't end well. But the resident was thankful for the professionalism and the way that our Scranton Police Department handled that very difficult situation and tried to get it resolved as peacefully and safely as possible . So I will agree with that resident 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 and thank our Scranton Police Department for, you know, a job well done under extremely difficult circumstances . And it just makes you realize that each and every day our Scranton Police and Fire Department are out there putting their lives at risk trying to keep us all safe. So I want to thank them for their continued work and professionalism . Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZEN S PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I want to thank you for correct ing the issue with the flag. It was corrected the very next day. That's good. Next, this business of the smoke that's pouring down from Canada, I had the opportunity to watch the Channel 16 news at 4 and 5 p.m. this afternoon . At 3:00 they were saying that the public health situation was unhealthy . And then at 4:00 it went to very unhealthy , which was the top of the scale. And the weather man was saying if you don't have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 be outside , do not go outside . It's going to be bad and getting worse tomorrow . My question is, don't we have a public health person that's looking at issues like this advising the administration about actions that we might take, consider our employees , DPW picking up garbage . They're outside several hours a day. Fire firefighters and police, they're outside . And then, of course, there's the homeless which we all try to ignore. They're outside 24/7. I would very much like to know if only next week what the administration decided to do and what they did to protect the public because I think this is a public health issue and a serious one. With regard to Item 5-F the amusement tax, I was looking at the budgets for 2021, 22, and 23. In 2021 they budgeted $50,000. That went up to $200,000 last year and again this year. Now, this legislation says for the financial impact the tax generates approximately $200,000 in revenue each year. I can't find out how much we collected in 2021 and 22. If you could find 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 that out for next week, I know they have software issues upstairs where they don't really break it up. That's why I couldn't find out the nonresident tax payment s that were made. But it would be nice to know or are we just throwing out $200,000 as a convenient number? Then Items 5-O and 5-P, Scott Gassenmeyer who is our now Director of Parks and Recreation . I'm very impressed by his 12 year history in the Marine Corps. I was looking at his resume. But I got to tell you, with all of the attributes that he cites in his resume, leadership , training , project management development , these are all common attributes of all noncommissioned officers and commissioned officers . I was looking for something specific in terms of training or experience relevant to parks and recreation as Miss Duffy had had. But I didn't see any. The other thing was he's getting a residency waiver. Now, if you looked at the legislative sheet it's through January of 2026. But the Mayor's memo says he has six 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 months to move into the city. I'd like to know which one it is. I understand Attorney Kennedy was also going to get a waiver. Apparently she was the only person that applied for the position . So that would make more sense. I would also like to know -- oh, the overtime regulation 5-G, I would like you to tell us in Fifth Order the reactions of the unions and the administration to your proposed legislation . Also, where do we stand on the firefighter contract ? It's not on the website , only the arbitration reading is. Where do we stand on the police contract arbitration ? Also, on the website , the refuse database is still from February 28th of this year. So it's getting kind of old. And they have not yet posted the property tax database . You need to get that posted. Remember next week is Flag Day. So if you're going to fly the flag, please do so according to protocol . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Faye Franus. MS. FRANUS: Faye Franus, Scranton . I can't begin to tell you how ecstatic I am to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 be here tonight . I sincere ly want to thank each and every one of you on Council for putting this legislation on the agenda for final passage next week. Thank you each and every one of you; and especially you, Attorney Gallagher , for all the hard work and legal advice you gave for this. It means a lot. This is a big step for the City of Scranton to get transparency and accountability at last. I just want to reiterate one thing. I'm pretty sure this was in the legislation but I couldn't see too well, the name of the person, the date that they worked, the reason they worked, detailed account of what they did for their overtime and the hours they work. I just want to make it straight that the hours they work should be, like, if they went from 2:00 to 6:30, not just say four hours, the time that they went and the time that they got back and then the amount of money they made that day. But I was talking to my son this morning . I was telling him how happy I was that this was going in front of Council . And he said to me, mom, it's great only if the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 people in the city have access to it at the beginning of each month to look at the overtime report (inaudible ) said at the end -- at the beginning of the one month for the previous month. Like example , July, you could go under July 1st or July 2nd and see all of June's overtime for all the departments . That's what's important , like, to have it on the City's website . I talked to Mr. Voldenberg today. He said he would discuss this with you. Either put it on the City's website with the title on it overtime for all departments for the month of June, July, August, each month just like the City Controller gets a report every month. Either put it in the City Controller separate account , a separate report for that or the City's website so people could go online and see very easily and not have to do a right to know. It takes 35 days to get a right to know. I did a right to know for April and it's June and I still didn't get it. So I want to thank you again because it's totally wonderful 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that you're doing this. I'm very, very pleased with everything you've done. I also want to mention I got an e-mail from a friend of mine that got their water bill this month. And it was -- they have five people in their family and the bill was $360. And they're renters . They said they can't afford it. They have to move out of the city. So I'm just wondering how many more people might have to move out of the city because they can't afford their water bill. That's why I really asked, Mr. King, if you could please have the Council and the Mayor write a letter to the PUC to appeal it, to appeal the fact that only Scranton and Dunmore are paying for it because the PUC, they got a letter from the Council and Mayor they could really consider that. Because I think many, many people are going to be moving out of this city because it's like a car payment . They just can't go from like $100 to 360. And this is what's happened since January . So all these people may be living -- we can't afford to lose any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 people going out of the city. Now another thing, I was in New York last week. And I went by the post office, the New York post office. It's a block long and they had the whole building on the top made up in Gay Pride colors. It was beautiful . It was actually spectacular . I ordered my Gay Pride flag. I got it today. I'm going to have it hung up next week. And I just think it's a wonderful time of year, Gay Pride Month. And I hope that everybody hangs their flag on Flag Day for that respect to. But let me leave you with this, thank you again. I don't often say that. But you know I mean it from my heart. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Franus. Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here today is, you know, my father was a World War II guy who fought in Europe and went from high school to World War II. And I just hope we don't end up fighting another war with somebody like China where we're going to lose just hundred s of thousands of people.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 And I think the people should really not take their freedoms lightly . They should appreciate all the sacrifices that veterans have made in our country going all the way back to the Revolution and even before that point when they were trying to make us a free nation. The other thing I have here, next week I'd like the Mayor -- I can't seem to get ahold of the Mayor to set a meeting with her over ECTV. But I want to discuss that next week with this Council and the questions I had. But tonight I want to say something about the Guardian ad Litem program , which I think is very important in the city and in the Commonwealth and, you know, in regards to custody . At one time in my early 30s I used to help people in court and in support basically fathers . And they had his Guardian ad Litem program . Danielle Ross was a Guardian ad Litem at one time. She was the one that started the program . But the fiasco that has taken place over all of those years was the bias against men in court by the judges. We had judges who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 just were completely lost. And they still are. But now we have a different situation . We have a woman Sarah Scotchlas who is suing a Guardian ad Litem which is Brenda Kobal. And she had practiced family law and custody and support issues. She never should have been a Guardian ad Litem because a Guardian ad Litem should not be an attorney who has practiced law in front of that court. It should be a -- an attorney who understands the law but has never practiced it in front of the court where they're going to represent a child because they should have no biases and no connection to the Court. Their only concern should be the child. And I think that this woman allegedly lost her custody because she was taking medication for Lyme disease . And Brenda Kobal was just misreporting facts to the judge which was Julia Munley. You know, when all of this stuff went on with the Guardian ad Litem at that time, they had removed Conahan and Shiverella in Wilkes-Barre. They were going to take the whole court out in Wilkes-Barre. But they didn't do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 it because they didn't -- the federal government didn't understand how it was going to tell people that they could rebuild the court and give it credibility . The FBI was going to remove the whole court, not just those two judges but all of them in one shot. And when they came here, they weren't looking for the guardian . They were looking for judges. They were going to take judges down. But they couldn't come here and take judges down because they just took them in Wilkes-Barre. So if they took them in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, it would have shook the whole thing up. And you might say, how do know that? I know a lot of things I don't talk about in these Council meeting s. And I could tell you that that's a fact, okay. But the problem we have in this court is we need people to write letters to their state representative s and their state senators . And in every case of divorce , every case unless there's some real situation , all custody should be joined, not one parent having custody over the other one but joint custody .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 Because when you grant sole custody then what happens to the noncustodial parent generally is their whole side of the family loses contact with the child. And when all of this stuff is winding , these children lose contact with half of their family. Somebody's got to wake up and see that we have real problems . And when you look at all the crime statistic s and everything , it's all broken homes, shooting s and everything . So I would just like people to call their state rep or their state senator . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I debated how I was going to start to speak tonight . But I will start on something that's been bugging me all week. And I think I spoke about it last week and the performance appraisals of the city residents . Well, would you believe I got e-mails from some people that said I was wrong that they do -- some managers do do performance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 appraisals . And to those managers I say thank you. And I probably shouldn 't have made it a blanket statement that affected all because I did hear from some managers that they are doing performance appraisals . So that's great. But the other thing I thought about was the first day employees . And, you know, I'm putting on my HR hat again. The first day that you come to work you get your login to the system. You get your picture taken for your ID. And you do your W-4 form. You do your I9 form. You show that you're a resident of your -- your Social Security card and different things like that you have to show on your first day. And one of the things that you also do on your first day is that you read the handbook. And being that the handbook was just being written , I was wondering then what is it that they do on the first day as far as the handbook . And then I also thought I would sure like to read that handbook . Will it be put online that I and others can read it and if not, I don't have time to submit a right to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 know. By the time I do my daily readings in the morning and prayers and all, I don't have time for an extra lot of reading . So I'm going to ask that City Council follow up on that. And if the handbook is going to be put on the website so that I would just like to read it because I've done so many handbook s and I would just like to know what they put in there, not for a critical or anything because I can't do anything about it. But I'd sure like to know that first day employees are getting all they need to know because that only improves the operation of our city if we orient our new employees successfully . So I started with that. So I'm going to end on a good note. And that's the Electric City Flower Show. And that is Saturday -- how could I forget -- the time is going by so quickly . And thank you, Dr. Rothchild , for mention ing it. It does start on Saturday at 10:00 and it runs from 10 to 3. And we're just so excited about the children and the activities that we have for the children . And the children are our future. And I guess that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 why I get so excited about anything that I could help with children . They're going to be having their scavenger hunt. They're going to get a little tree to plant and watch it grow. I think that's one of the things I miss most about giving my house up in New Jersey because of the trees my kids planted when they got them in school and I had to leave that all behind. That's kind of sad, but it's a part of life, I guess. But, you know, I just want to let everyone know that there is -- it's free, free, free, you know, and you're there for the day. You could stay as long as you want. There is a bus that's going to come and that's a free bus. And unfortunately it's not handicap accessible . And it's been donated to us to use that day. But Route 18 is the Colts bus that runs up by the park. And it's a block away from the flower show. And, you know, so I'm just looking forward to seeing everyone there. I'll be in the SMRA tent. If I'm not, I'll be about answering people's question s. But we do have to be there. We'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 be there early to make sure everything is in order and ready to go on Saturday . The weather is suppose d to be just perfect . And we couldn't have asked for -- what it looks like it's going to be a great day. Of course, with the smoke and all, I hope that's gone by then because it's kind of hard on your throat. But one other thing I wanted to mention too about the kids. I'm not sure if the kids that graduated from our Scranton public schools are -- I lose track of when their graduation is. But I just want to congratulate -- MR. KING: June 16th. MS. JEFFRIES : June 16th, so could I please say congratulations to all the graduates who are graduating from all the city schools and whether they are going onto higher education or whether they are going to go and serve in the military or if they're going to get their first job, I just want to say, you know, congratulations to them all and to their parents too as well who kept them in school for those 12 years as well their kindergarten 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 years. You know, I just had such a great time, Mr. McAndrew . I just keep thinking about that day that I interacted with the kids up at the CTC. And I'm just hoping that going forward I could interact with kids from the school a little bit more. So congratulations again to the graduates of our Scranton School District . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Shanolle Buoly -- I don't know if I'm pronouncing that correctly . Is it Shanolle ? You're not coming, okay. Thank you. I apologize for mispronouncing the name. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, thank you, Council . Scranton as every community in America has a list of City Codes for all of us to follow. That means everybody except our very own mismanaged code enforcement office. They seem to -- could care less about our City Codes. They are a runaway out of control sanctioned entity. I don't know why people are so fearful of Oleski to confront him. Sometimes I think he must have a picture of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 everybody coming out of a massage parlor or something that he holds over people. This department 's past inept total deficiency is why Mr. Garanin {phonetic } who sued the city a couple years ago won $285,000 judgment just two years ago under everybody that is still in office including Miss Hayes. The codes for condemning -- and let's say I'm condemning a property are set in stone. They require a lengthy and legal process turning off the utilities and so forth and having the house inspect ed by the code enforce ment. It's a big deal because when my house burned years ago I had to go through all of this. Presently this administration is and has allowed unscrupulous property owners to avoid these requirements especially for eviction . The houses are condemned by the owners. The people are out immediately . They have 24 hours. Who could move and get your furniture out? Last week -- two weeks ago now, the house -- five houses from me there's a family of five and they were evicted . I don't have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 reason why. I don't know why. They had two children going to the special school though the bus would pick them up. There was a condemned sign there that day. The next day the owners against the law about being -- cleaning up a condemned house were in there cleaning it up, all the furniture , clothes and everything was out on the street just like next door to me that I got fined for. This total eviction process is being allowed by the City of Scranton . It's going -- it's being allowed by Mr. Oleski's office. This is senseless besides completely unlawful . There should be some protection for the vulnerable part of our society . Let's just take it for granted the people didn't pay their rent or can't afford to pay their rent or utilities and so on. It's still -- there's an eviction process they have to go through that they are avoiding . And these unscrupulous people are completely avoiding the law. And I believe I was told that Scranton is liable under these circumstances . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 I'm sure you people are a lot more familiar with the condemning process . You know, to me, the ignorance of this city is why we lost the prime neighborhood around Nay Aug. They took advantage -- the hospital took advantage of the city's ignorance . And it just keeps going on and on. Like I said, two years ago the exact process that was used against me cost you people $285,000, the exact thing. They didn't seem to learn. Well, thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: I wish somebody would look into this process . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That exhausts the sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard at this time? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First of all, I would like to take a moment out to reference the Nova Kakhovka dam accident that just happened in Ukraine . When we look at the smoke here, it's time to take a look at 10 to 20 communities downstream from that dam collapse who are being flooded out and who have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 to evacuate their homes. The zoo was flooded and the animals were killed over there. It is a catastrophe that has taken the entire Dnipro River downstream and causes risks to the ZNPP nuclear plant just because of the water reservoir . Though that's being handled , we also have to look at the action of destroy ing that dam is horrible because planting season was a number of months ago and they were just getting ready to go into harvesting season. This is not something to be ignored . This is actually a devastating action with the flooding of these people. And I wanted to take a moment out to recognize their suffering . The request -- there was a request for Council -- the Council prior to appeal -- send an appeal to the PUC for the water bill. I think that has come forward three times already and you would look into it. Has there been any documentation sent out to the PUC at this point to request for an appeal? If you can answer that in Fifth Order, by all means do so. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 There was also a request for one of our youth who came in here for the same response to putting up reflector s and painting the cement barrier at Spruce and Jefferson . As the incoming path of that bridge is -- does have reflector s and is painted and marked, the city side of it has absolutely no markings at all. Have we gotten any response back from the state on taking care of the end of that bridge and painting it to make it more visible ? Moving onto hiring from out of the city. Obviously it seems again the population of Scranton are just a mindless glue sniffing (inaudible ) because we have no good employees here to fill positions that we constantly have to look outside the city. And we have to spend taxpayer 's dollars to supply payroll for other communities . I don't understand that. As for the waivers , why don't we just move that to final vote anyway right now. We know what it's going to be yes, no, yes, no, yes. It's going to be a 3-2 for all of those waivers because that's what the Mayor wants and that's consistent . Prove me wrong but I don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 think it's going to happen. Now moving onto 5-D, the introduction ordinance amending the city's open burn policy. Though I understand the reasons for it, this prohibition is illegal and insane. Whoever produced this steaming pile of dong needs to not do these paperworks . When an ordinance is passed by this body we all -- produced to this body it would be nice if like the House and the Senate, the person introduced this document was actually a signer of the document to say who brought it forward to make them the owner of the legislation that comes before this body. There's a problem with the flag burning ordinance as it runs afoul as the Supreme Court has said five or six times beforehand, you cannot ban free speech. And you cannot license it where your free speech will be allowed by the city if you file paperwork two days beforehand. The city does not have the right to legislate your first amendments . There is a prohibition of the exercise thereof or (inaudible ) freedom of speech. That's the oath 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 of this body. You cannot say you have to wait two days to burn a flag. It's unconstitutional . Follow your oath. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer , of course. Water bills keep coming up and I have some questions about that. You know, we're probably paying for cooldesocks and fashionable communities out there to have sewer plant help and such. I mean, we just sprawled out to an unGodly over the last 50 or 60 years. Every old country road that used to have a farm along it has a bunch of upscale housing . And we've got nothing out of this. Now, we weren't -- and the bills are up through the ceiling . For some people it's up to 100 a month. My water and sewer bill used to be about 50, give or take a little depending on the better half out with the garden or something like that. So we really need to just get out from under this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 So it's -- why the heck should we be paying to help other people with their sewer situation ? Like I said, it's nothing of what was promised in the first place. And okay, last week I got a little stern about the smoking in parks. That's my libertarian roots. Certainly , all I would advocate is that somebody has a place near, a concrete ground or something . I deplore people that throw butts, but they absolutely shouldn 't do that. And they should be penalized for it. There was an article in the paper. I've seen it before on (inaudible ) and it's a new drug that's getting introduced into the fentanyl and it causes severe skin lesions , severe infections and even possibly amputations of limbs and so forth. So at any rate, I picked up the paper today and our courts are denying people the right to have proper drugs for drug treatment to -- that calm the desire to use heroin and, of course, fentanyl which is far worse even than heroin. So we really need to change some of our policies here. We're actually cutting our nose off and thinking that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 our face is prettier . Now, it's been discussed here with pilots and new emphasis on getting pilots. And while I was sitting there during the comment ary period last week, I was thinking , you know, I have been preaching this for well over 10 or 12 years that the state should be replacing a lot of this lost money. We're 53 million dollars now according to the report short on school subsidies . And we're either -- well, 37 percent is 2019 figures for tax exempts . And if somebody is unable or unwilling to provide a pilot -- and I don't want to see people going hungry turned away from the soup kitchen or something just because they donated a couple of bucks to Scranton that they would sign on to petition the state to begin to replace some of these tax losses. It's too much. 40 percent is too much, and 30 percent is just a little less. But it is really too far to expect the citizens to be able to pick this up. And the wages in Scranton aren't the greatest . And a lot of the higher earners moved out to that lovely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 cooldesock {Phonetic } in the country into that fashionable house and we're stuck with the bill. But thank you and have a good night. MR. KING: You too. MR. DOBRZYN : I hope you would consider we really need the tax exempts along with us to get this money replaced . MS. SCHUMACHER : Good evening , Marie Schumacher . Excuse my eyes but between the pollen and the smoke I'm squinting a lot. I was happy to see what Mr. Basalyga is planning to do with the bistro corner. Just a couple of days ago my young friend and I had walked by and read what was on there and just sorted laughed like, yeah, wouldn't it be nice if that was real. And now it appears that at least there's hope that it will be. I must also admit that I still hold a bit of a grudge against our former Mayor Courtright who I will say gave Mr. Basalyga both the old and new parking garages there for one dollar. And it just wasn't right. Unfortunately nobody stopped him. The -- Tom hit it well on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 residential waivers . I think we're overdoing it. Oh, if anybody could -- apparently did not whisper in our DPW Department 's ear that they have the obligation of maintaining the properties that are owned by the county Land Bank. And the grass just keeps growing up on Harrison Avenue and that needs to be taken care of. And then also, I don't think we should have to ask every year but I will. The bushes on East Mountain Road and going around Mountain Lake Road are growing well into the street. And I know the DPW has a special instrument to take care of that. And the sooner they do that the better if anybody wants to talk about the Land Bank, they could also mention that. And then I start going through some of our contracts just to see what we were missing . And, for instance , there was one with the sign replacement . It was executed in December of 2021. And there was an estimated 2,000 signs mostly in South Side or all perhaps until the limitation of the available dollars 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 which was $306,000 is reached . Can anybody up there tell me whether or not we have reached that and if it has -- is that project going to be able to be completed and how? MR. KING: I don't have that answer. We could inquire about that. But I think that they have 221 -- 220,000 built in for the signs this year. But if we can check on that, please, Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And this is -- again, do you ever go over the website and see how scarey or disappoint ing because I went on the list of current city contracts . And I'm not sure, for instance , that one must be finished . There was one on Bloom Avenue culvert replacement that was executed in September of 2021. And I'm pretty sure that was also accomplished , was it not? I guess maybe it was the last -- somebody on the last Council . MR. KING: Which street was that, Mrs. Schumacher ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MS. SCHUMACHER : Bloom, Bloom Avenue. And I'm also even more sure that the south tower restoration contract was completed . It was waterproofed . The contract was executed on June 23 of 2021. And why it's still on that list of current contracts , I do not know. And I'm out of time. Thank you. MR. KING: We'll check on those. Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. Motions . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. I'll keep it short tonight because that smoke is also bothering me. Just one important item, a group of people will be up on the 500 block of Harrison Avenue this Sunday. There are three Land Bank properties up there that are going to be cleaned. And that's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : There's a few things 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 I have. So let's see so, Mr. Voldenberg , I'm going to give you a couple addresses here, 1502-1504 West Gibson Street there was a fire there I think -- I believe over a year ago and just get an update on that property . We also spoke about short-term rentals . So could we reach out to the proper department and look into where we are with short-term rentals whether we have a database of these properties , where we're going with them. I know with the new zoning they have to go in front of the zoning board. We did get several addresses in the last few days, 1710 Elizabeth Street. There is also on West Gibson and one on Doud Avenue so if we could check into this and see where the city is with short-term rentals . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. SCHUSTER : I got somewhat of a bathhouse update. Last week I asked about the bathhouse over at Weston Field. And we did get a response that there is going to be a structural assessment planned. And we may get an answer for next week.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 So I'm curious to see what the structural assessment says for that. And can we also reach out to the LIPS Department and see what the turnover time for processing permits is? From here and there I do get calls about permits that have been held up. And I don't know if there is an average time. But if we could reach out to that department and see what the processing time is and if they are being done in a timely manner. Moving on, another address I have is 1736-1738 Prescott Avenue. So this is -- I believe it's a lot where a home used to be but now it's a vacant lot. They have overgrown trees. There's no real upkeep on the property . They are starting to get rodents. And I think some of the neighbors were dropping off some of their clipping s in this property as well. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, with regards to the address that Councilman Schuster just spoke about 1700 of Prescott Avenue, I believe I was asking about that property a few weeks ago if they were able to find out who the owner was. So if we could get code enforcement there to check it out and then send them a ticket. I think that would be great. There was a tree that fell there a few weeks back. And the tree was able to get cleaned up and some other things that were -- that were going onto the nearby properties . But I think it's still a problematic lot for sure. Okay, just a couple things that I had. One, we received a response from the fire chief on questions I had that one of the pieces of legislation that's in Seventh Order. That was for the grant for the alarm systems . And I was just interested in knowing which -- which rescue houses or firehouses they would be going to, what the order would be. And some of it even says certainly subject to change depending on the needs and if there are failure s with the current systems. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 But he had mention ed that Truck 4 on Main Avenue and Engine 8, Market Street; Rescue 1, Wyoming Avenue. Those are the top three that they want to get to first. And then others that they're hoping to be able to get to or might get to in the future if they have additional funds, Engine 7, Luzerne Street; Engine 2, Gibbons Street; the fire headquarters over here on Mulberry which he said was the most complex and the highest cost. And then Engine 10 on East Mountain Road but that might not be done if they're considering a new fire station or there are updates to that building . So that was the response that I had gotten on that. And with regards to the flag repair outside , they did pull down the flag. They felt like it was in relatively good condition . There were just some strings that were hanging from it so they were able to cut those and make the repair. But I think they were still looking into obtaining another flag. I think it would be good to have a backup flag if something does go wrong with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 that one. And that's all I had on that. And someone brought up the condemnation process which I did make a request a little while back for us to be able to post that on the website . I know there is not an exact process because there are, you know, if there are legal things that come into play with it, then it doesn't always go according to plan. But I think it would still be helpful for to us to be transparent about how properties could get condemned . So I would like to ask again if we could get that onto the website . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll look into it, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. That's all I have. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Yes, thank you. I have a few issues and concern s brought to me by residents . So the first one is on West Market Street and Yard Avenue, there's resident s up there that travel or walk from Bloom Avenue to Noone's Market. And they can't use the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 sidewalks . All right, so the city has put many wooden horses across the sidewalk . And they have been there for the last 10 months. This is -- what is happening to fix these sidewalks ? Can someone in the city please get these sidewalks fixed so people don't have to walk on the road? And, you know, this is a safety issue. Okay, so then maybe that's the case and we verify that. Thank you, Mr. Schuster . So I have that one. Let's see what else we have. Also, I don't know if you remember last year on Capouse Avenue where the tire barbershop was that was condemn ed over drugs and shooting , very bad area. So the neighbors over there are up in arms because apparently the same owner that has approval now to open a 24-hour laundry and detail shop. So can you confirm that? Can you make sure it went through zoning? Can you make sure everything is on the up and up? I have pictures also that were sent to me and I'll forward you on tomorrow . MR. VOLDENBERG : Thank you, sir.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 MR. MCANDREW : Joan Hodowanitz as usual brought up a good point about, you know, the quality of air we're all dealing with and struggling with tonight . And it's going to be worse tomorrow . So you posed a great question . What is our health coordinator doing about it, if anything ? Can you reach out to administration and see if that's on their radar, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : And like Mrs. Hodowanitz wanted a response for next week, so I'm sure we could get one. And so here's another issue. It's very sad. This is a couple that lives on Capouse Avenue. They reached out to me in '22. And they're an elderly couple that struggle with some health issues which is very sad. But they live near the Melba Bar, all right. So they have to deal with the rooming house associated with the Melba Bar. And there's multiple rooms there. This couple, like I said, is experiencing some health issues. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 They used to have a car. They are no longer able to drive but they do have the handicap parking spot. But people renting the rooms at the Melba Bar seems to be parking in front of that for the most part, which is very concerning . So their daughter does come and pick them up who is a PA and takes them to, you know, some appointments and have the placard in the car. But they're unable to be picked up in front of their house with the handicap spot that was issued to them. So she asked me if -- if there was some other type of sign. I know we've been down this road a couple times where they can reserve it or handicap reserve and I've heard yes. I've heard no or stop and pickup and drop-off only. But she believed there was a sign years ago when her parents -- she's a lifelong resident there and, you know, and is experiencing great issues. So that's an issue. And also with that issue with the Melba rooming house, there's -- they are coming out of there and standing and partying so-to-speak in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 yard next to her. There's a heavy smell of marijuana there. There's constant drug activity in and out. So, you know, this is a big issue that we talked about -- I don't know if you remember . We had correspondence with these issues. But now the parking is another one. So could you please reach out to code enforce ment to whoever we need to reach out to with regards to the signage if it's available and definitely the police department ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I'm sorry I have a bunch of issues for you tonight . But I don't know about you, did anybody walk in the back door today and see another set of doors before you get on the elevator ? Well, there's a new set of doors. To me, it's another barrier for Mr. Raines who comes here. He has issues parking in the back. He has issues trying to get in the building . He's been locked in building because the button to leave -- the handicap accessible button to leave.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 So now I see this new set of doors, didn't hear about them, happened to just walk upon them. So, you know, it would be nice to know what are they for as Council men because we have to go through them. Are we going to have to use our fob to enter them? If so, then how does the public get in or out? And the poor handicap , that is the only way to get in the building because of the ramp in the back. Now there's another barrier presented to them. Is there going to be a way for them to hit a button? You know, luckily Mr. Raines comes in with his loving beautiful wife that helps him and that's admirable . But what if somebody tries to come here who cannot who has no one else with them? How do they get past that new barrier that is present ed to them? So, please, can you get all the information ? I was shocked to see it today not knowing . All right. Mrs. Jeffries , I can't wait to see the handbook too. I've been asking for like I said last week, I want a copy. I want to read it. I also believe that it should definitely be on the website . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 I don't want to hear like we always get from the legal department . Well, I don't know about that. We have to be careful . I think, you know, we introduce it in third order if it's done. Let's do it next week. And then let's get it on the website . I'd love to hear what the employees have to say about it. But that will probably come. What else do I have? So, oh, I'm sorry, I have two that are written on a napkin that I had to write before I got here; and, no, it's not a bar napkin. So we don't need them jokes. MR. KING: Although it could have been. MR. MCANDREW : It could have been, yeah, you know me well. All right. So this issue is still Weston Field park. These poor ladies -- I feel so much for them. And so the pool is open this week; but guess what, it was cold, like, very cold. And they're waiting on a part. One lady who is 89 part of the zipper club and they call themselves that because in the past they all had open heart. People that -- residents 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 went there in the 70s, 80s, you know, recommended therapy . One had to go to the doctor's because her feet became red and the doctor said stay out of that pool. So I know we have a new parks director . I know he's going to take a deep look at the pool. But can we please get an update? These ladies are relying on me weekly, you know, and I will continue to be their voice. But they encounter just obstacle s every time they go over there to swim. You know, they want more focus on them. So can we get an update on all that? They want to be heard and I don't blame them. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And next, so there's a property over at 1318 Dorothy . It has four apartment s. There's kids living in the back apartment . A neighbor reached out to me and said it's ridiculous the amount of rodents that are visible . He's worried about the kids -- and I don't blame him. That's a public safety issue. Rodents harbor tons bacteria and carry disease . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 And he's telling me he's seeing rats and mice. I mean, everybody gets a mouse in their house once in a while. But to see them during the day running up and down the steps of this property scares the hell out of me. That means it's so infested it might be beyond anything we could do, maybe condemning that which would be horrible . But on behalf of this resident concerned , he's worried about his property and everybody else's and the poor kids that are living there. So could you please send over the proper authority to investigate that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a number of things myself. As far as the PUC appeal, as you know, we did send a letter on behalf of City Council to the PUC expressing concerns for these outrageous rate increases . As of yet, we have not sent anything to appeal. I would like to ask our City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 Solicitor , maybe talk with the Solicitor for the administration and look into the possibility of the Mayor and Council look into try to appeal those increases if we could, Sean. ATTY. GALLAGHER : I don't know -- I'll double-check, but the last time I looked I think you have to file the appeal prior to the rate increases going into effect. So we might have witness missed our window on that. MR. KING: If you could look and see if there's anything we can challenge at this point, I would appreciate that. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yeah, maybe the informal complaint process we might be able to go through . But I think on the formal complaint we missed the boat on it. MR. KING: Okay. Thank you. Frank, can you look into the issue that Miss Schumacher brought up with the leaving the city, see where we're at the with the state in terms of fixing that -- I guess it's a barrier , right? It just needs to be corrected by the state, just see where they're at with that. I did meet with the Mayor this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 afternoon . And I can tell you that absolutely the smoke is on her radar. I know that she is working with the health coordinator for the city. And she has reached out to some of the unions. So I'm not exactly sure what actions are going to be taken. But absolutely it is a concern of the administration and they are going to be looking to do something to address that. I'm not exactly sure what the resolution to that is. But that came up in the middle of our meeting this afternoon . I would also like to congratulate all the upcoming graduates . Scranton and West Scranton will graduate on Friday. I believe the Scranton High graduation is at seven. I think West Scranton is at 7 or 7:30. They alternate each year. And I actually have a graduate . That's how I know so much about that. But I want to wish them all well and hope that they have extreme ly successful whatever -- if they end up going into, you know, Career Technology or if they end up going into college or into the workforce or Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines , we wish them 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 well. We want them to be productive citizens . I know we already address ed Joan's concern about the flag. Faye Franus, we receive d a response from LIPS regarding the rental registration . So this came from Robin Selemba , it was the rental registration forgiving debt for rental registration fees for years owed prior to 2022. The answer was no. Fees are not charged for vacant or owner slash family occupied properties . So then there was a question who gave rental registration authority to forgive the fees. They're not forgiving the fees. But if they're vacant or owner slash family occupied properties , there is nothing owed there. Does the Law Department or City Council have to approve an action such as the forgiveness of the fees? The 2016 rental ordinance sets regulations regarding rental fees. Those were the answers to that question . Overtime legislation for city departments is looking to be introduced this evening in Fifth Order. Marie Schumacher 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 requested Nossaman progress since the date March of 2023 report. I got something here from Eileen Cipriani who indicated the city in conjunction with their partners Nossaman have worked on a variety of funding opportunities for 22-23. Nossaman 's expertise has been invaluable in reviewing federal guidance and regulation s to assist the city in determining opportunities that give the city the best potential for funding . In working with Nossaman , the city has had the ability to speak with federal funders to craft strategy to position ourselves for Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act grants and assist in developing regional partnerships . Nossaman has been instrument al in navigating federal community appropriation s process . The city has submitted an application through both Congress man Cartright, Senator Casey's offices and coordinate with Senator Fetterman's office. City has worked with Nossaman to research opportunities to fund workforce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 development and issues centered on energy-related employment . Contact s have been made to the Department of Energy Commerce , EDA and Transportation . Activities include but not limited to 18 e-mail exchanges discussing various developmental issues under consideration by Scranton , three video meeting s and phone calls, meeting s with Chris Casper, Economic Development Specialist of EDA, U.S. Department of Commerce to discuss clean energy EV programs with Scranton on April 5th, 2023. Meeting s with Chris Casper from EDA to discuss coordinating grant application s from the city and Lackawanna County Community College and Johnson College for EDA maintenance programs on April 10th. Discussion with JP Pearson , Pittsburgh Intermodel, Pitsview AL to introduce the idea of relocating some of their trailer manufacturing to available space in South Scranton . Ongoing discussions are pending . The discussion with Mayor Cognetti on Scranton 's vital role as a weapon supply to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 U.S. military for the Ukraine war. That's the most recent update I have on that, Mrs. Schumacher . MR. MCANDREW : I think they're looking for a dollar amount they're supposed to bring in or almost guaranteed to bring in. MR. KING: I don't know that there is a dollar amount at this point. But that's what's ongoing at this point. So I don't know that they could provide that but we could ask. Scranton Sewer Authority approximately 16 to 17 easement s remain to be secured by the Scranton Sewer Authority from Pennsylvania Water Company . The escrow balances as of April are easement escrow with Blackrock, FNCB is $4,330,795.82. Indemnity escrow with Delaware Trust is $4,416,954.99. A request was submitted to city public health coordinator for quarterly department report. Council also asked if the office would assist in any way regarding the city homeless population , which I believe that Mr. Argenta had asked about that. Mr. Ellman, speeding on North Main Avenue. Council followed up with Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 Police Department Traffic Officer and Deputy Chief for increased patrols and update on all properties presently in question was provided to Council . We sent a request to Scranton Police Department regarding quad and electric bikes on Heritage Trail area also. Virgil Argenta , DPW supervisor was notified of the overflowing city-owned trash receptacles and litter on North Main Avenue and Jackson Street for their action. Scott Gassenmeyer newly appointed Parks and Rec Director was notified and schedule d to meet with contractor for inspection of Weston Field Pool bathhouse on Tuesday June 6, which would have been today. The City Law Department is going to follow up with advice regarding the Ethics Board Solicitor opening . We sent a request to Don King City Planner for copies of the Planning Commission recent meeting minutes . Also, Mr. John Howells of Clearview Street sent a request that Scranton Police Department Traffic Officer and Deputy Chief to increase traffic patrols in the area of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 Clearview, Theodore , and Bundy Streets as they intersect with West Pass and Return avenues . Also, in a meeting with the Mayor today and Eileen Cipriani , she indicated -- they indicate d that postcard s for rental registration had gone out June 1st. If they are not the current owner, those current owners can reach out to Robin Selemba in the Rental Registration office and that will be taken care of. Also, she indicated to me that so far code enforce ment, they found 700 rentals that were not on the books that are going on the books. So it sounds like those code enforcement officers are doing the job that we hired them to do. Thirty rentals identified as not are paying their proper garbage fees. There might be five apartments that might have only been paying for three. That is also being addressed . So I thought that was a good thing. Let's see if there is anything else that I have here. DR. ROTHCHILD : -- not fully up and going yet -- well, it's up and going but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 they're running into some roadblocks . We're going to get more information from the Assessor 's office to help them further that data. So that is just what they have been able to gather so far. But there's plenty more data out there. And I think there will be more properties that they will be able to find that are rentals . MR. KING: Thank you. And also, just a reminder now that's it's starting to get warm and the parks are opening just to remind people if they're walking their dogs in the park to make sure you pick up the waste if that happens and also to try to keep your dogs -- there's a leash law. Try to keep your dogs on leashes in parks. And I think that that's important . And that's all I have at this time. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – CREATING OVERTIME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL CITY OF SCRANTON DEPARTMENTS AND EMPLOYEES . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-G be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? The one thing I have on the question is, I'm just a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 little bit concerned about -- I just want to make sure that we're not violating the Home Rule Charter and particularly Sections 203 and Section 502 actions requiring an ordinance . I just want to make sure that if we move this forward that it's properly written . Like, I know there's concerns about -- right now the way it's written covers every single department which would include the Scranton Police Department which could, you know, be identifying undercover policemen . It could be identifying investigation s and things like that. That's the way it's written . So I certainly don't, you know, I don't want to see it written in that manner. I don't know. That's a concern that I have. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, while we're on that, I've been told or under the impression that the police department and fire department would already be in compliance with the way that we have this ordinance written . So we'll see what we hear back from the administration on that. I think if they're under compliance I think they would fall in line with this. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 MR. MCANDREW : I agree with you, Mr. Schuster . I mean, we were already told that the fire department and the police department do a fantastic job tracking overtime . It's every other department that lacks that. So that could be tweaked I'm sure. And that shouldn 't be a problem because -- and I don't know if the Home Rule Charter is trying to say like we discussed in caucus that, you know, we're kind of doing day-to-day, we're micromanaging . No, our job is oversight . Our job is to scrutinize . So I'm glad we're moving this piece of legislation forward and not tabling it and not waiting for administration to be able to dissect it or hold it up. So I'm happy that we're moving it. And I'm okay with tweaking it a little bit. But we didn't ask administration to create this ordinance , our solicit or did. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I appreciate our solicitor creating this legislation and bringing it to us. But I think there are some things that need to be flushed out. I do want to make sure that we do it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 right. And I want it to be something that's enforceable and able to be implement ed because I do support us tracking and having a more detailed report for overtime. But there are some questions that I feel like that have started to come up. And in terms of enforcement , I want to know, like, what's the consequence if it's not enforced if we enact this ordinance . I do want to make sure the administration is on board and that the other departments are so that this will be properly completed once we pass the legislation for it. I also think we do need to discuss if it is something that will be made available to the public if we're going to get regular reports . Miss Franus had brought that up tonight . And I think there were some further questions on how it would apply to those other departments , ones that might already be doing it if it's going to change it or not for them because it does seem to be a bit general being the way that it's written . Like I said, I want to make sure that it's done right and that seems like we may 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 need some amendments moving forward on this. MR. SCHUSTER : So while we're talking about this, just two things that stuck out to me over the years. When it comes to overtime I know I've been pretty vocal about DPW administration overtime and not last year but the year before we went over budget 729 percent with DPW administration . We've had it spoken about several times in public caucus. And one thing I would like the public to take a look at is we had overtime in that department for January , February , March, and I think it was either April or May. Once this was brought to light, we had zero overtime in that department . Now, taking a look back at the gas cards, when an investigation was looked into the gas cards, we saw that amount of money drastically reduced. I'm going to say, like, we are an oversight body. I could see maybe, hey, let's look at this thing; but I hope this thing does move forward . MR. SMURL: My concern with the new legislation is that it takes over what's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 existing and it's for all departments . I just don't want to jeopardize any of the police department , the undercover, or anything like that. I'd like to make that clear that they do not have to advertise that part if there is something that we really, really should not advertise . MR. SCHUSTER : With something like that, there could be another way to designate those people without exposing a name. MR. SMURL: Yes, I would like to see -- MR. MCANDREW : They track it now without that concern . So I don't see it's an issue. MR. SMURL: Well, our new legislation I don't know if that takes over everything and if that's the new rule for everyone . I just don't want to see it overrun in the police department -- MR. MCANDREW : I think the department s are smart enough to withhold that. I just don't want to see this as a speed bump holding this up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 MR. KING: What I would like to see is that if this gets introduced tonight that those concern s are addressed in the legislation . I appreciate Attorney Gallagher 's work in putting this legislation together . I just want to make sure that we do it correctly . We follow the Home Rule Charter and don't violate that and make sure we're not violating any issues concerning , you know -- ATTY. GALLAGHER : I advised Legal to get us the -- whatever recommendations or concerns they have by this week so that next week we either amend or you guys decide what you want to do with it. I have yet to hear from them. I talked to Jessica Eskra once and then after I told her that we were going to introduce. I told her to get us any concerns by this week so that we could make a decision next week. So I'll wait for that response from them. MR. KING: Thank you, Attorney Gallagher . MR. SCHUSTER : Just so I get this straight , Solicitor Gallagher reached out to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 Jessica Eskra and she's to get back to him. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yes. I told her to get back to me this week so we could come to some type of conclusion . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay, but unofficially you haven't heard back from her yet. ATTY. GALLAGHER : Not yet. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-H.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR UP TO $250,000.00 TO BE USED TOWARDS THE DAVIS TRAIL REHABILITATION /RESTORATION PROJECT . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-I be introduced 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , looking at the backup documentation it seems to be written as the whole trail will be asphalt ed. So, Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the administration and see if this is to be the case just that all the entirety of the trail will be asphalt ed? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll clarify that, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Yeah, I think that that's a concern . Many of us here on Council discussed in caucus do we really want the Davis Trail blacktopped. I know I've spent a lot of time walking , especially during covid down there. I understand that it gets washed out a lot of times and it could get rough in places. I think that there is ways to be able to address that without having to get into blacktopping , you know, through the woods down 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 by the, you know, the back side of that parking lot and then over into the gorge. Just, I don't know that blacktopping is the way that this body wants to see it go. MR. SMURL: Yeah, I don't believe blacktop is the way to go. I believe if they do blacktop and I believe it would change the direction of water -- the natural water flow and stuff. So that could get us into another -- a bunch of problems . So we don't want to change the natural water flow. And by blacktopping , I think we may be doing that. MR. KING: Okay. So maybe we can, you know, check with the administration and once again possibly amend this application in some way. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I would like to see which sections they're thinking of doing that with because I think that would be appropriate in some areas of the trail because I know, like, it's really hard to bring, like, a stroller down there or for someone to use a wheelchair down there with the surface that's -- that's there already . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 So I don't know that would need to be the entirety , but I would like to know if it's just planned for a section of it or where exactly . MR. KING: I don't know, from looking at this when you look into here under narrative at the bottom, by implementing asphalt surfacing , the city will be able to ensure that all community members will have safe accessible experience . Additionally through these implementations the possibility of opening a trail for cross country events can become a reality . I could tell you that as a former cross country runner, it was -- I ran blacktop all year long. And then I run district s on grass, on a golf course or some -- that certainly doesn't give our kids any advantage whatsoever running on blacktop. Presently a large portion -- I'd say it's probably 40 percent , 60 percent right now where it's dirt or grass that they run on. And the other part is blacktop. That's certainly -- I mean, cross country 's isn't meant to be a road race. It's meant to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 cross country , dirt, grass, hills. So I just -- I don't see where that benefits cross country kids either. And I'll say I'm an expert in that. So if we could get some answers I would appreciate that. I'm still -- you know, I'm in favor of introducing this. But I want to see if this could be amended in some way, shape, or form. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-J. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RE-APPOINTMENT OF THOM WELBY, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , TO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE SCRANTON MUNICIPAL RECREATION AUTHORITY FOR AN ADDITIONAL FIVE (5) YEAR TERM. THOM WELBY’S TERM IS EFFECTIVE UPON EXECUTION OF THE RESOLUTION AND WILL EXPIRE MAY 31, 2028. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-J be introduced into its proper committee .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR.

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF JOYANNA HOPPER, Ph.D., SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , AS A MEMBER OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR A TERM OF THREE (3) YEARS. JOYANNA HOPPER’S TERM IS EFFECTIVE UPON EXECUTION OF THE RESOLUTION AND WILL EXPIRE MAY 31, 2026. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-K be introduced into its proper committee . MR. SMURL: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 took time to look into the backup of this document and also in the resolution itself. And in both the backup and the resolution it states that Miss Hopper will be appoint ed to not only the board but also to chair the board. I didn't feel that this was appropriate . I felt like the board itself should appoint their own chair. So I would like to make a motion to amend this. And I'd like to remove -- MR. MCANDREW : I'll second that. MR. SCHUSTER : I would like to remove in the third paragraph where it says is both member and the Chair of the Environmental Advisory Council if we could just amend it to remove as both member of and chair of. MR. MCANDREW : And also under other notes in the backup that also could be removed , pretty much the same thing. I don't want it hanging there. MR. KING: Yeah, I'm not in agreement with that either. That should be the board's decision once the five members are impanelled , then the board will vote who the chairman is going to be. I don't think that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 appropriate . So there's been a motion to amend. Is there a second? MR. MCANDREW : I second. MR. KING: There's been a motion. There's been a second. On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , so, I mean, this is basic Robert's Rules and Parliament ary Procedure . But to send this down to us not only, you know, we were back and forth with the selection process , how many do we get to pick, how many does administration get to pick. So, you know, we arrived and had a compromise where we select two as our body and then administration will select three. But select three and the chair without even going through any proper procedure is beyond me. So, of course, I'm voting to remove that. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm in agreement . I think that the board should be the one to select the chair for this body and not the Mayor. MR. KING: Okay. So we have a motion to amend and a second. All those in favor of amending this motion signify by saying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2581 aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it. Let's go back to the original motion. I'll entertain a motion to introduce 5-K into it's proper committee . All those in favor signify by saying aye -- as amended . MR. MCANDREW : As amended . MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , just so when we're looking at these three resolutions , we have -- this is the first of three. This individual here, we have a third individual Bernie McGurl who has had an extended amount of time onboard. So just one thing as we move into passage , this term here is for a three-year term. The next one is for a two-year term; and Mr. McGurl's term is for a one-year term. Usually members that have the longest tenure, the longest involvement may get the longer terms. So just for something to be put into 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 consideration for Council , I may like to take a look at the terms of these terms -- the length of these terms and if it's something -- MR. KING: I have no problem with that. I'm just wondering if the administration or the Mayor talked to Bernie McGurl. I know he's going to be retiring from his current position . Maybe he only wanted to do one year. I'm not sure. So if we can inquire to that and get an answer I'd appreciate it, Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. KING: Thanks. Okay. So all those in favor of introduction as amended signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-L. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF JESSICA NOLAN, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , AS A MEMBER OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR A TERM OF TWO (2) YEARS. JESSICA NOLAN’S 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 TERM IS EFFECTIVE UPON EXECUTION OF THE RESOLUTION AND WILL EXPIRE MAY 31, 2025. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-L be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I've known Dr. Nolan for a long time now since I was at the University of Scranton . And she's always been a strong environmental advocate . And she also used to have an environmental group that would meet at Jack's on a monthly basis. And I would often go to those meetings .

ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-M. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF BERNARD McGURL, SCRANTON , PENNSYLVANIA , AS A MEMBER OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR A TERM OF ONE (1) YEAR. BERNARD McGURL’S TERM IS EFFECTIVE UPON EXECUTION OF THE RESOLUTION AND WILL EXPIRE MAY 31, 2024. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-M be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , as I said in the previous 5-K, I do think he's had a history of conservation in the area. He's moved Lackawanna River to Class A trout stream river of the year a few years ago. I think he may be best suited for a three-year term, but we shall inquire . MR. KING: I agree. And quite frankly , you know, when this came up I recommended to the Mayor that she should -- the first name that came to my mind was Bernie McGurl. So I think he'll be a great asset. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 And if he wants to serve longer than one year I think it would be welcome . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'm also very happy to see Bernie McGurl's name here tonight . And I'm happy that he wants to serve even if it's just for a year. Maybe he'll be interested in being reappointed after that. But I really appreciate all the work that he's done with the Lackawanna Trail. He's made a very large environmental impact on our city and our county while he's been doing that work. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-N.

VOLDENBERG : 5-O. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – APPOINTMENT OF SERGEANT SCOTT J. GASSENMEYER , DUNMORE , PENNSYLVANIA , TO THE POSITION OF PARKS AND RECREATION DIRECTOR , EFFECTIVE MAY 22, 2023. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-O be introduced into its proper committee .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so now we heard a couple things tonight about this gentleman . And is he going to -- is he going to take the six months to find a place to live here because the resolution immediately after this is a residency waiver. So I'm unclear on this. MR. KING: I spoke to the Mayor this afternoon . She told me that Mr. Gassenmeyer is actively looking for a home. I think his wife is originally from the Minooka area. MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so with that said, I will vote yes tonight . But can we try to get some clarification maybe from him now that he's an employee you could reach to him and say, you know, the word on the street is you might be moving in or -- I would like to know that before final passage for me. And then also, as we brought this up and I know he's in agreement of getting his lifeguard certification . He stressed that. But again, the ladies that I speak to would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 like to know a timeline on that because , you know, their concern is every time they're without a lifeguard , this gentleman 's office is going to be there. Maybe he could cover an hour or two and they'd love to have that security . So can you ask him, like, you know a ballpark area or a timeline when he's looking to do it? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll speak with him tomorrow , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I have some of the same sentiment as Mr. McAndrew . If Mr. Gassenmeyer was a resident of the city, I wouldn't even be bringing this up. We have heard it before that individual s that were hired were going to move into the city and then it never occurred . I will move this forward but I reserve on my vote on final passage of this individual . I will be voting no on the waiver which is coming up next. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-P. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR SERGEANT SCOTT J. GASSENMEYER IN HIS CAPACITY AS PARKS AND RECREATION DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-P be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : So on the question , here we are again with residence waivers . I'm a God fearing Irish Catholic and I'll be honest with you. I would not give Jesus Christ a waiver or vote for one because it's not fair to everybody else. Now waivers are being thrown at us 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 every time we turn around. So it's not fair to everyone else, the gentleman -- the officer in this room, Frank, everybody else here that works here has to live here. So I'm going to be consistent with my no waiver vote and just I'll be voting no. MR. SCHUSTER : Also on the question , I'm going to come from a budgetary standpoint . This and several -- I would say last three years when it came to the budget process , we were told if the salaries were to raise, it would be easier to get individuals for these positions . This is one of the positions that the line item for salary was raised as well as 5-Q coming up. The salary was raised. I think this individual should be a resident of the city or move into the city. MR. KING: In speaking with the Mayor she indicated to me that point eight percent of all the employees in the city are -- fall under that are not resident s, which means that 99.2 percent of them are. It sounded like this guy was pretty well vetted. I don't know. I believe that Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 Smurl had an opportunity to meet with him and said that he's pretty well qualified . I haven't met the gentleman yet. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. I'm sorry, no. MR. KING: Okay, 3-2, the motion moves forward . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-Q. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS TO WAIVE THE RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR ATTORNEY KATHERINE “KATIE” KENNEDY IN HER CAPACITY AS FIRST ASSISTANT CITY SOLICITOR IN THE LAW DEPARTMENT FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-Q be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 MR. SCHUSTER : Going back to the budget again. This is a full-time position that was added this year. The salary is $77,000. And the budget process we were told in order to retain individual s, get high quality individuals we needed to up the salary. The salary was raised. It was made a full-time position . And again, I think the individual should be living in the city to accept this position . Also on the question , Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out what areas we advertise d for this position in? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: On the question , it's my understanding that there was -- because this is a full-time position at $77,000 there were only three applicants . All three were from outside of the city. No one from within the city did apply for this position . MR. MCANDREW : On the question , so if you can't find three people that live here, put another add out. I've done it in my capacity on other boards. You know what -- and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2593 also, and this is no offense to Mr. Gallagher our solicit or. I said this in caucus, you can't swing a cat in Scranton without hitting a lawyer. I'm living here 60 years. And there's lawyers -- everywhere I go I see a lawyer, whether it's at Gerrity 's, in a bar or a restaurant . So I find it very hard to believe in a city with a population of 74, 76,000, you know, that's always the number thrown around, that we cannot find a lawyer that would, you know, whatever experience level they're at, coming out of law school, moving back from law school that we cannot -- maybe we didn't do or advertise well enough to see if we could capture a larger audience of lawyers . So, I'm sorry, but I'm voting no for this residency waiver. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I've been in support of waivers in the past when I feel that they're justified . But I do have a number of questions come up on this because I also, you know, realize that there are a lot of lawyers within the city and was wondering why we didn't have any applicants who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2594 were from the city. You know, I was told that even though $77,000 sounds like a lot of money in terms of lawyers , that's not -- they get paid a lot more through private practices . And so a lot of them aren't willing to leave a private practice job to come to the city and work for that amount full time. This is a full-time position . So there were a couple of other questions that I had too which we discussed in caucus, those responses that I received to that. For now I'll be in favor of introducing this tonight . But I think other questions might come up. MR. KING: Public comment is over, please. DR. ROTHCHILD : That's all I have on that. MR. KING: On the question anything further ? All those in favor of introduction signify by aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Was there just one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 aye? You said aye? MR. SMURL: Yes. DR. ROTHCHILD : I said aye. MR. KING: Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. MCANDREW : No. MR. KING: Okay, 3-2, the motion moves forward . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-R. FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – RATIFYING AND APPROVING THE EXECUTION AND SUBMISSION OF THE GRANT APPLICATION BY THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO FISCAL YEAR 2024 APPROPRIATIONS THROUGH THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY FOR UP TO $2,343,750.00 TO CREATE AN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS AND TRAINING CENTER ON THE PROPERTY CURRENTLY OWNED BY THE CAREER TECHNOLOGY CENTER OF LACKAWANNA COUNTY. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-R be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 Voldenberg , can we reach out to the Business Administrator to see if this grant has been awarded yet to the city? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : SIXTH ORDER. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
