MR. SMURL: Please remain standing for a moment of silent reflection for our service men and women throughout the world and for those who have passed in our community , especially Mike Murphy. Thank you. Roll call, please. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. King. MR. KING: Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Here. MS. HERBSTER : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Present . MS. HERBSTER : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Here. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3.A. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM CITY BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON JANUARY 3, 2024, REGARDING UPDATED PAYROLL PREPARATION TAX COLLECTIONS AS OF JANUARY 2, 2024. 3.B. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS REGARDING RUBICON UPDATES RECEIVED JANUARY 5, 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a comment on Item 3-B. So regarding Rubicon , the last time that the -- I'd say that the administration of Rubicon was in to give an update, they said that they were going to have another rollout in January . Can we just get a date for the rollout in January or an update on when we're going to do the rollout for the month of January ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much, Frank. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I do. I'm sorry, I believe -- and I think Joe Gilhooley is here tonight . I believe the week of January 29th there is going to be a PUC hearing between 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 American Water Company rate hikes -- I'm not sure if we have an exact date. Joe might be able to provide us with more detailed information when he speaks during Fourth Order. But I just want to let everyone know that. Also, the fact that so many people filed complaints -- formal complaints , has caused the PUC to put the brakes on moving forward with this rate hike. So I think that was a big plus for the resident s of the City of Scranton and Dunmore . And, you know, that was through a lot of effort by, you know, Senator Marty Flynn along with State Reps Kyle Donahue , Kyle Mullins , Bridget Kosierowsk and Jim Haddock along with, you know, Joe Gilhooley and his crew that are spearheading this. But I think it's important to note that we were the first ones to really start screaming about this thing and that kind of got the ball rolling . So I want to applaud my fellow Council members and actually some members -- people that have spoken here about this rate hike. And I'm hoping that they hear us loud and clear. And we'll see what happens . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yes. I would just like to wish Captain EJ Gallagher of Truck 2, the Truck 2 Captain a very happy and healthy retirement. Captain Gallagher started his career in 1981 serving the Scranton community for 43 years. Twenty-four of those years were served as the Truck 2 Captain and -- at the headquarters . So I want to wish him a happy, healthy retirement . And what else do we have here? Friends of the Poor in addition to the regular food pantries at Jackson Terrace and Valley View, they just want us to remind all of you that the monthly satellite pantry at St. Luke's Episcopal Church will be open next week, which will be Tuesday , January 16th from 1 to 3. Thank you. And that is all I have. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? Fourth Order. So starting a new year so I'd like to update the adopting of Council Rules. So Attorney Gilbride will update us on rules. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 would just like to remind everybody both attendees as well as Council members yourself of Article 5 of the regulations of Council Section 1 which states: That no person including Members of Council shall use their time during Citizens Participation to personally insult or attack any individual , name calling , profanity , racial or ethic slurs, discriminatory remarks based on race, color, religion , national origin, ancestry or birth place, sex, gender identity , sexual orientation , disability , marital status or age and any other behavior that is inconsistent with the purpose and intent of conducting official businesses shall not be permitted . The Council President shall have sole discretion in determining if and when any persons violate these rules. Any person in violation shall be ruled out of order by the Council President and may be removed from the podium and/or meeting at the Council President 's request . That's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Fourth Order. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: All right. First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I want to point out that today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. So I would like to extend my thanks to all the police officer s that serve the City of Scranton . They do their job well. Now, I wasn't here last week because I was a little under the weather . And so tonight I want to start by commenting on the 2022 audit which has finally come to pass. There's not enough time to go into too many details. But there were two items that had me on the floor laughing . And I'm sure they had you on the floor laughing too. The first one was on page 69. It's management 's note (inaudible ) 21 on the Sewer Authority . You remember those guys. Quote, the City agreed to share in the upkeep of certain stormwater assets with the seller -- the seller being the Sewer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Authority and Dunmore . Management believe s such upkeep will be de minimus to the City. My question is, which assets are we talking about that would be de minimis to the city? In other words, no cost? Does this mean there will be no Rain Tax? I think you know this is a question you need to ask the Business Administrator . This is their comment . I would like to know what assets are going to be de minimis to the city for upkeep. That was a surprise to me. And then on page 98, corrective actions for Item 22-001. This was the lack of financial statements from the Scranton Parking Authority . Now that has been going on since fiscal year 2012 when the Parking Authority went bankrupt . They've never done financial statements . Here is the corrective action as given by the city management , quote, the City informed the Scranton Parking Authority Solicitor in August, 2023, that the independent auditor 's report that it submitted for 2022 audit does not meet generally accepted auditing standards . The Parking Authority Solicitor was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 not aware of this noncompliance . This is after 11 years of noncompliance . The Solicitor informed the city that the Parking Authority will engage an auditor to complete a generally accepted auditing standard compliant 2023 audit and timely submit said audit to the City. Anticipated completion date March, 2024. And believe me, I will ask you every week have they submitted their financial statements . And they had better because if they haven't broken the code after 11 years, I see no magic in year number 12. Also, the union contracts are still not on the City's website . For the firefighters , it's 282 days; for the police, 165 days. They are suppose d to take 120 days to dot the I's and cross the T's. And Mr. Ufberg got paid again in the month of November almost $5,000. Now, the overtime , I was looking at the police overtime , they went from -- they have 168 percent spent on their $950,000 2023 budget. So in 2024, their budget will be 1.2 million for overtime . DPW admin was budgeted 3.5 thousand dollars for 2023. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 They spent 268 -- 268 percent of their budget. And in 2024, they're downgraded to $500. I want to see if they could pull that off. And with regards to the police recruitment incentive legislation , I could understand why they need a lot of overtime funding if they are at 80 percent operating strength with vacancies and injuries and retirements . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Miss Hodowanitz . Marie Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I come to you tonight to ask you to do something that I have not heard done but I'm hoping you will agree. Yesterday 's paper the -- if you saw it, started off with the headline , "Officials talk tax relief for flood victims ." Now if you recall and I am -- put anything up that if Joan Hodowanitz had not come to this podium and told you guys what happened to her and her family when she was young and asked for this, it never would have happened . So I would like to ask that you can, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 if you can, make it the Joan Hodowanitz statute when you send it over. Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Miss Schumacher . Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner, taxpayer . First off, I want to piggyback on what I spoke about last week with the parking enforcement ticketing citizens parking in the wrong direction on their street. When the school year started , I started driving kids to school in Dunmore back and forth. In Dunmore , I see a lot cars facing the wrong direction in the streets and they don't get ticketed . In Carbondale , I know somebody that lives there, they could park the wrong way. They don't get ticketed either. But in Scranton who taxes the city residents to death, not only are we doing that, we ticket them for facing the wrong direction on their street which is ridiculous . As I said last week and many other times, the parking enforcement people selectively use that rule. The kids that are causing safety hazards up by the University of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 parking right to the corner so you can't see anything , they don't get ticketed . But myself parked facing the wrong direction at my house, I get ticketed . I pay my taxes. We shouldn 't be punished for facing the wrong way. I don't know what the problem is. There is no safety hazard facing the wrong way on your street. But parking right up to the corner so people can't see when they are at a stop sign, that's a safety issue. And the kids at the University are never ticketed . Moving on, Christmas week, it was on a Monday. My garbage is usually picked up on Monday. So it was suppose d to be picked up on Tuesday . It wasn't picked up Tuesday . Wednesday comes, it wasn't picked up Wednesday . Thursday comes, it wasn't picked up on Thursday . Finally I called DPW. I said, my garbage was supposed to be picked up Tuesday . Today's Thursday . It still wasn't picked up. He said, "Are you on Bulwer?" I said, "Yeah." So I asked -- I figured they must have got a lot of phone calls because how did they know I was on Bulwer. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 Finally Friday came -- oh, he said we'll be up later in the day on Thursday . They never came Thursday . Finally it was picked up on Friday. So I don't know what went on that week, but everybody 's garbage was piled up all over the place. Thank God it wasn't the summertime . That wasn't right. While we're on the subject of garbage , last week I saw the garbage recycling schedule s here so I got one for myself and my daughter . People were asking me about them. Are they going to be put in people's mailbox es like they have been in the last couple years because not everybody is coming here to get them. Last couple years the mail carrier s put them in everybody 's mailbox . MR. SCHUSTER : So those went out. I don't know what week they went out. But they went out prior to last week because we had some questions about them that came out last because it was a six month calendar that was sent out. Did you get one in your mail? I take it that you didn't. MR. SPINDLER : No, I didn't. I got one here last week but never got one in my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 mailbox and a lot of other people I know didn't either. I don't know why they make it six months at a time. That's ridiculous . And about the opposing the water rake hike, I got a form and I filled it out. And I called the office to see whether I should drop it off or mail it in myself. They said, oh, no, drop it off. The guy must have misunderstood me. He said, "What's your address ?" I gave my address . A couple of days later in my mailbox I find a whole folder of forms. So can I leave them here in case the people want them? MR. KING: That would be great if you could do that, Les. MR. SPINDLER : I gave them to a lot of people that I know. MR. KING: I think that the deadline has been extended. I'm not sure. I think Mr. Gilhooley will fill us in on that shortly . MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, because , I don't know, maybe people -- I know if everybody in the building here filled them out or if they want to. I'll just leave them here. Okay. Thank you for your time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I still -- I stick to my comment I made last week though that I still feel Scranton City Council is corrupt . And that's how I feel about the whole thing. But let's take a look at your ordinance here quality of life. Let's say that somebody comes in and they're ticket for, well, let's say accumulation of rubbish . They go to the Building Appeals Board. They don't -- now in the transcripts they call it a meeting . But it's really a hearing . And the person prevails and wins the hearing and there is no accumulation of trash on his property , nothing . Why isn't he given his fee back for the appeal? Why does the city keep it? He won the case. His money should be returned to him. I mean, I know that the city is trying to raise revenue . But to be honest with you, it's not the way you should conduct business . Now the other thing is, okay, when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 your inspector comes out and reaches a conclusion , why are we even guessing ? He should take picture s. Leave one picture there and take one picture as evidence so that we know exactly what we're talking about here. Now, when you're talking about high weeds and grass, is one weed that's over 8 inches high a violation of the ordinance or does it have to be more than one weed? And you might think that's a trivial thing to ask. But I don't think it is. Are you talking about a whole yard over 8 inches or can your inspector come out and say there's a weed that's 8 inches high right there on the sidewalk . I'm going to write a ticket for quality of life. Here's the other question . You could answer these if you want. Should the inspector show up at the quality of life hearing ? Should the person making the accusation s against the citizen in the city appear or should just the Director of Licensing and Inspections appear? Does the person who is being accused of something -- because this is a court, does he have a right to have his accuser face him 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 and be asked questions by the person who's accused of committing a violation of the quality of life ordinance ? You've created this law. Does it follow anything that has any semblance of law or is it just something where you run roughshod over the citizens because then they go there. And I ask these questions because recently I had a quality of life violation . And I took the city to the magistrate . The magistrate in South Side quit the case because I won every case the city's ever taken there, okay? I had somebody in the quality of life including the Chief of Police in Scranton one time come on my property and say he could do whatever he wanted. He had a quality of life ordinance . They towed a car off my property . But they also brought it back because I went to the magistrate and filed a complaint for criminal trespass and theft against the tower and the city. And then I came and met the chief because now he wanted to come in -- he wanted me to come and talk to him. And he asked me not sue him. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 what I'm saying to this Council , it's all corrupt . You can't turn this city around by punishing the residents here. That's why I've taken the Council and the Mayor to Federal Court and ECTV. We're going to see what happens there. And that's why the last time your inspector came to my property , now we're going -- the magistrate in Dickson City managed to rule where the testimony didn't support the verdict . It's not legal. The city attorney came to a hearing and didn't know why he was there. But my complaint was clear. And now I've had to go to the Court of Common Pleas because I find this government to be completely corrupt and without merit. And you have the opportunity to straighten it out. But you don't want to and I don't know why. But you know something , you can't browbeat the citizens beyond a certain point. And the city's population base went from 140,000 down to 75. And city government hasn't done a thing for the residents of this city in my lifetime .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 And sitting here with suits on and acting like you have any idea what you're doing is a crime in itself because the residents in the city deserve much more. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Joe Gilhooley . MR. GILHOOLEY : Thank you, Members of Council . My name is Joe Gilhooley and may I approach ? MR. SMURL: Sure. MR. GILHOOLEY : Tonight I -- first of all, let me thank the Scranton City Council and the Borough of Dunmore Council for their interest in opposing the water and sewer hikes that Pennsylvania American Water is requesting . You guys have been great. Billy has taken the lead on this and I'm very grateful for his help. Every time I call he answers . And I know you guys have been talking about it so thank you very much. I believe the Mayor is adopting a resolution . I believe it's almost done and completed . It should be before you very shortly . I provided you with official complaints to the PUC today. A formal 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 complaint means that you could take an active part in the hearing , which I believe at this point like Billy suggested will be the week of 29th and most likely on January 30th or February 2nd at Scranton High School. We're working on that right now. Those are the two dates that are most important . I would urge every single Council member not only to fill out the complaint but testify at this hearing . I don't know how your water bills have been affected but I -- this all started with an 88-year-old woman who still works. Her name is Ann Harrington . She wrote to me about the $100 bill -- the increase in a month in one year. And that was last year with 70 percent increase that Pennsylvania American Company was awarded through an administrative hearing procedure . And unfortunately , the City of Scranton wasn't notified of this hearing or the settlement agreement . Dunmore Borough wasn't notified of it. So they had -- they weren't even at the table. So they kind of underhanded us all. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 We really got blind sided with major water and more importantly sewer rate hikes. You pay more now for your sewer to get rid of your water than you do for your water. It's outrageous . Secondly , it is a total result of the Scranton Sewer Authority sale. If PA Water made a bad decision when buying the Scranton Sewer Authority sale, it's on them, not on the ratepayers of Scranton and Dunmore . We're getting killed over this. We need to show up in unity. I left the claims here for anybody and it is, Wes? Les, dropped the complaint at the office which is right across the street. We're open from nine to one every day and then from four now to six in the evening . You could pick up complaints . We've had hundreds and hundreds of people come in. It's probably the one issue that I've seen in my entire life affecting the local community that so many people have taken an active part in. So I would again urge Council to fill out your complaints . You could drop them off over here.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 Or here's another thing, Les, we actually have people driving out and picking up and dropping off complaint s because the seniors are the people that are affected the most and they can't get out. So we have made it known and I'm reiterating that tonight that we will drop off and pick up the complaints . The most important thing you have to do here is fill out two complaints , one for water and one for sewer. So you'll see two complaints there. Now the PUC under their brilliance have decided to make it one hearing for both complaints . But you still have to fill out two complaints , one for water and one for sewer. And make sure you have your account numbers on there or they'll throw it in the garbage . I would like to give you -- the public our phone number over at the office that we have. It's 272-892-1441. And it's located at 341 North Washington Avenue, again, 272-892-1441. I'm going to leave it with this. The people in the City of Scranton and Dunmore are being affected but so is all of Lackawanna County with the water rate hike.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 But we're being destroyed by the sewer hikes. And I don't think a lot of people realize it. I know I'm repeating myself, but the importance of that is astronomical in this hearing . You got to go in and say PA American , you guys made a bad business decision . You lawyers didn't do their due diligence . And I'll give you a quick final thing. People from outside of our area Berks County filed a complaint , got a lot of other people to join into this complaint , went to the PUC and filed a complaint against PA Water. The judge said settle the case. They settled the case on the backs of the Dunmore and Scranton residents . Let's end it. Let's take part. You guys are the leaders of this community and I respect every single one of you up there because I know everyone except Mr. Smurl, you know, and Tommy Gilbride a great solicit or. I would have him there speaking also on behalf of Scranton . He could take an active part in the hearing based on his on position as solicitor . So I'm grateful for your help. Spread the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 word. Get your neighbors to call us for complaints . Call us. We'll deliver more complaint s to you if you need them. And again, let's take care of this. Let's help the seniors , okay? MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Gilhooley , and thank you for all the help you're performing for the citizens of Scranton . Rick Little. MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council . To start, I would just like to establish one fact that public housing in Scranton is a not for profit. Is that a fact? Scranton Housing Authority is a not for profit agency? COUNCIL MEMBER: Yes. MR. LITTLE: Yes, okay. And the field office for HUD I've been told that HUD owns by the former attorney -- owns Scranton Housing Authority . Maybe they do in some messed up -- maybe they're paying their taxes. Let me get to the point. They're rich. They have so much money. If we have housing problems , we should go to the Housing Authority to begin to address the problem . The problem though is that anybody who raises a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 question , they own everything . They own the police. They are the district attorneys . They own the courts and the Courts are crooked too. I mean, you look at the magistrate court. There's no record going back for 28 years that they have been doing. There's no record of the thousands of people that were made homeless by this Court in an improper prosecu torial setup by the district attorney and the magistrate judge. There is just no record. I mean, there's a record of the complaint and the judgment . But after that, they have docket numbers but the docket numbers don't go back a month, a year, 30 years. It's bad court. And I've been in that system for -- I never thought I would be living in public housing in a million years. But I went to family court fighting for my child. I learned a little bit about courts and how absolutely crooked they are. It's the worst of the three branches of American government , the courts are the most crooked . And, you know, I could go into, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 know, the bar associations and how they got that way. I learned in New York State Law. But then I ended up here and they're evicting me all the time. Even when I prevail, they went back and evicted me. And, you know, way before they evicted me I go to the Area Agency on Aging. These people have them in their pocket. They have the Lackawanna Pro Bono in their pocket. They have Northeast Penn Legal in their pocket. You know, and I complain that, you know, people are breaking into my room all the time. And, you know, they confiscated my stuff. They broke the lock. I called the police. The police say see the manager and it's still locked up. And they're still doing all kinds of stuff to move me out as a retaliatory eviction mainly because I know what I'm talking about. I did a right to know. I saw how much these people are making, you know. Karl Lynott as Executive Director , he's making almost $200,000 a year on top of his salary for the district attorney . I read in the paper, you know, and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 same with David Coyne. You know, they have dual jobs. So it does no good to go to the court. I removed them to Federal Court the second time they took me to the magistrate court about less than a year ago. The judge just ignored it. And then I'm learning again -- trying to learn the law. I got the appeal at Court of Common Pleas just fighting away. And then I had to do another motion for removal and I hope Judge Moyle accepts it because this is crooked as all hell, the court system. They know these people. You know from the newspaper the (inaudible ) the youth services thing with the district attorney and the whole thing about the police officers and the social workers , same thing is going on with housing . And that's the problem with housing . You got to look at housing . You know, why are these people so fantastically rich. The old manager Debbie Letteri , she's still working there on a salary. How do they afford to pay these people? How do they afford to pay -- MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Little. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Your time is expired . MR. LITTLE: I'm done? MR. SMURL: Yes, you are. Thank you. MR. LITTLE: Wow, he got to go on two more minutes . MR. SMURL: Well, it involved the entire City of Scranton . Yes, thank you. Mike Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , resident of the City of Scranton . The first thing I want to talk to you about this evening is something that was brought to my attention and that's a HOP Code. What a HOP Code is, it's a Highway Occupancy Permit. The Keyser Valley Community Center has yet to receive this HOP Code after PennDOT had done extensive work to that parking lot and that water runoff. For three months (inaudible ) from the County has tried to contact this administration for the HOP Code to no avail. This evening that parking lot is filled with 2 and a half feet of water. Mark, you know this. You live in that area. Tom, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 you do as well. Mr. King, you've been there several times, Mr. Smurl. Jennifer , you know the area as well. All right. This area has extensive issues with flooding, water runoff. And it is -- it had to have been addressed prior to this. This never should have happened , right? But it did and it's unfortunate . Now, a very good citizen of this city had mentioned about $5,000 that is going to be given to those affected . You know, we could have actually had given more money to those people if this administration had spent money a little bit more wisely. You know, with one of your -- with one of your -- excuse me. With one of your -- your -- I'm stuck for words here. You know, I care about the city. And when you care about the city, sometimes your words stumble a little bit. You received addendums from the City of Scranton as far as what you do on a weekly basis. One of those addendums that you actually received was at 4:00 and it caused the city to single out veterans $100,000. That 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 money could have gone to those citizens , okay, or how about money that was given to startup businesses where they just take the money and moved out of the city. Our Law Department did not set up those contracts properly . People just took the money and ran. You know, it's unfortunate . When we don't spend money wisely, we see a lot of things happen. All right. You know, I talked about this park -- Nay Aug Park for years. Most of us grew up and we have memories in this park. All right. Children don't have that and are able to share those same memories . We're down to two pools. You know, the Connors ' administration 12 years, they did not close one pool. They did not add one penny in property taxes. They spent the money wisely. All right. From there we went to the Doherty administration . With that administration he paid the bills other than the union fees, all right, and it was shameful . All right. Now this administration , nobody wants to work for this administration because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 morale is at an all time low. When you fire an employee and each of you receive d a 12-page report, Christen Chizek{phonetic } all right, the only one that was able to address this so far was Stacey Lange from Channel 16. I've read this report. I want each one of you to comment on it, all right, because the finding s in that report in what I read for one employee to be singled out for wanting to do the right thing, for standing up for this city and speaking their mind when something goes wrong just to be singled out and ultimately fired is ridiculous . And she's not the only one. You know who else was fired? Marty Flynn's mother. Nineteen years she worked here in this city, dedicated employee . Carried -- coming to work every single day wanting to do the right thing. And in return she gets fired. You know how? Human Resources Director went out, knocked on the door and fired her with one year left until her retirement . You know why overtime is so much? Because nobody wants to work for this administration . It's shameful. It's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 disrespect ful. And look at those pools, those pools remind her more of Oregon than Scranton . And I guarantee you when she goes to take those pilling s out of those pools, she's not going to find a bit of gold, not a bit of gold. It's shameful . It's disrespectful . We could do better. We will do better. I want those documents . And I want each one of you when I'm done here to tell this body and these citizens of the City of Scranton what you are going to do next. Mr. Gilhooley made a great point about extensive fees to water and sewer. Get accustomed to these document s. It's very important you do so. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Mancini. MR. MANCINI : Is my time up? MR. SMURL: Yes, sir. MR. MANCINI : Her five minutes are up as well. Good evening . MR. GILHOOLEY : Can I answer one question ? MR. SMURL: Not -- outside maybe, but not here. Your time is already over. Thank you. MR. GILHOOLEY : (Inaudible .)1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MR. SMURL: I understand that. That's fine. Yes, I do. Okay, anyone else that didn't sign in? MR. COYNE: Good evening , Tom Coyne, Minooka . First on the agenda I notice we have a change to contract 5-D and 5-E that the city waives actions on the contractor and the contractor waives actions on the city indemnifying each other. The reality is if something goes wrong, this sets it up so that the people could try to sue both parties and each will point their finger at the other saying it's their fault and both will be -- claim to be indemnified from any action. The sole purpose of them indemnifying themselves and their contractor is to strip the people to being able to fight in court from any harm that is done by these bodies. And the indemnification was really about the contractor . There would be no need to force the contractor to have a liability insurance because what good is liability insurance if they are indemned from any issues? Continuing on from the last session , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 I touched on a right to know. The right to know office in my case the attempt to hide legal settlements paid by the people's money. Part of the request was based on the city making an undisclose d settlement including pushing a new law into effect, having an executive session with Council noted as a legal issue when the case that was presented for the reason was already withdrawn from the courts and was pulled out of that body four months prior as it was a negotiate d settlement . As it was already agreed in settlement , there was no need for an executive session other than to hide the actions from the public in direct conflict with the Sunshine Act. Without the Times reporting , the public would have been blind to two settlements for abusing and weaponizing the offices of License and Inspection . Settlement using the people's money though uncomfort able and embarrassing should be open to the public. Payoffs and hiding it is an antithesis of good governance. The Mayor's transparency stand -- moving onto was an early promise . Let's go back to Carl Deeley and his 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 attempted appointment to the IT Director . And eventually when it was rejected by this body, he was moved into an IT manager with no IT Director on top of him making him the de facto IT Director at that time in direct conflict of this body. At that time the body approved a contract with Jessup's Bedrock IT group on the assurances that it could make one system for Scranton governance and tie it all together . They evaluated , bid, and got paid $1,250 a month and eventually withdraw it after the process saying we cannot do what we promised to say. Part of that promise early on was a walk-in terminal downstairs for this one record system so that the public could access in City Hall and view unified any records they needed. This never happened and as a matter of fact, we can't even get into City Hall itself. And we have another thing creeping up now is the change in the ethics form. I did a little research into that. And I understand that after four years they want to do a campaign donation change. Maybe this should be considered after the next election for Mayor, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 not right before it. It should be staggered not in election years but off of election years. And the Mayor is constantly pushing for parity with Reading even though the median income there is higher. But if you actually take a look at Reading and their documentation , their numbers for their ethics are on parity with the City of Scranton . So if the Mayor constant ly wants to point to the City of Reading as a guidepost of what this city should be based upon finances here, maybe this city needs to follow that path and not increase the campaign donation through ethics. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . I know a lot of Scranton ians will appreciate your attempt to avoid the water increases . Last week before 5:00 in the morning , I was going down Green Ridge and I missed a red light. You know, there is no traffic and I was thinking of it. In the meantime when I looked to my right where the library is, there used to be a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 sign -- a big thermometer in front of it where they wanted I think the goal was 250,000. It was gone. So I was wondering if they made it or got some grants or something . I didn't run the light in the meantime if you're wondering which was a temptation . This weekend I saw in the paper said you want to redo North Scranton . It's too late. It's too late. The school and the Zoning Board have allowed single family homes to become boarding houses. And they are full of undesirables because I walked once in a while when it's warm out all the way down to Market Street with my puppy. It's a bad situation . Every one of these houses has a driveway and a garage. And there's so many people. The sidewalks are useless . They park on the yard and make mud holes out of it when the houses around them might be well kept. That's the first demise of a neighborhood I believe is parking on the lawn, which I guess is allowed if it's your house. We got some serious holes in the wall of taxation. What happened about 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 attacking the non-profits ? The last time anybody really did it was Janet Evans. And Mr. Vogue{phonetic } told her to go to hell. You know, it's the -- here they have that complex downtown that was unused. And the next thing I know, we were responsible for putting a roof on it. Am I wrong? That's what I remember with the articles in the paper. Unscrupulous developers and property owners are just taking advantage of Scranton 's ignorance . We just -- the public is just -- when you talk to people, there is so many low income people that are really fearful of a reassessment. You people don't seem to realize the majority of houses in this city are prewar. Mine was built in '35. I've had the plumbers there the last year, electrician last year. It's an old house. I've remodelled it inside. There's so much great expenses besides taxes that are causing people to lose their properties . You know, that's the American dream but it's not possible in Scranton with the taxation . You got to plug this hole up and attack these phoney non-profits that the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 is just full of them. We wreak with non-profits that are fraudulent . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . You know, it came to my attention -- and I have three already blown out old style TVs if we could get some kind of a project . You had to pay the last time and I would be willing to pay to get rid of before people start depositing them on other people's curbs because one of those computer screens was deposited in front of my house and my wife brought it in -- I was a little cross with her -- on our property . It was in the gutter there. And it cost me $35 to dispose of it. There's somebody in the neighborhood that every time they have something that's going to be hard to dispose of, it gets finagled . I found tires, rubble, construction rubble and so forth, so if we could. And it also came to my attention I have -- I'm taking -- well, I'm taking care of her recycling barrels but we haven't passed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 them out in years. And people should be encouraged more to recycle . Okay, in going through my little mess of papers, I'll pass this out to you but I'm going to recover it again. Eleven year old 20 million dollar office building demolished in sign of the times. It's up in Olyphant but therein again, I pointed out last week that county gave them a tax abatement so somebody from Scranton theoretically would have to replace that money that they wouldn't have received from a 20 million dollars building . And some other food for thought , in Los Angeles , which you see their homeless problem constantly on the news, 42 percent business occupancy . This is what some of our Chamber of Commerce s and whomever decide to build all of these properties and they turn a handsome profit at it and they disappear and 11 years later you have a 20 million dollar office building . And by the way, any type of office property is usually not suitable for occupancy of tenants because when you get that promotion , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 that big promotion , you get the corner office meaning you have a window. So unless you really enjoy staring at the wall as opposed to sleeping along the railroad tracks in a tent, there you go. Now, on this quality of life, I had some falling out, not with the city but with some of the people that were pushing it at the time because I felt that all too often you're staring at an abandon ed (inaudible ) dump out your front window and that's what you could afford. And then somebody is coming by and saying, oh, you got this old lawnmower . There's two tires over there, a lot bottle of water, a case of water bottles on your front porch. I don't know why that exists, situations like that. I really felt that quality of life should have a warning , give them 30 days. That's what I was given when my next door neighbor had -- I was in a multidwelling . And they have a lot of cars that they abandon . So they drive a car for a while. When it no longer worked, they parked it in front of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 house. Well, I had one that I used to switch the plates back and forth and I got told about that. So, you know, like I think it's time to at least ease up on this quality of life and make it more amenable that people don't get treated like public enemy number one. I'm going to drop this off. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments , it was mention ed about the non-profits this evening . If you recall back on December 12th we did end up passing a resolution to hire Rudolph Clarke LLC, who was going to go out and do a HUP test to evaluate wether these non-profits who may been approved 10, 20, 30 years ago to see whether they actually still qualify as nonprofit s. So that company was hired, and I'd like to give them an opportunity to go out and do a report and then report back to City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Council and to the administration and see. I think that's a good step in the right direction to address that situation . Number two, there's an individual who hasn't been here in quite a while and I think deserves some credit for this Pennsylvania Water -- American Water Company rate hike that really brought it to Council in the past and kind of help get it kick started. And that's Faye Franus. I give her a lot of credit. She was hot on this issue early on probably before everybody . So, I don't know, maybe Faye is watching . I just want to thank her for, you know, bringing this to light and really lighting a fire under our backsides to get moving on this thing. So she deserves a lot of credit for that. In terms of an individual came up here and made the blanket statement that we're all corrupt , well, I'll tell you what, anybody could sit here. You want to say that we're corrupt , well, first of all, tell me what laws we broke, where our corruption lies and go to the District Attorney , go to the State Attorney 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 General , go to the FBI. I don't care, go to whoever you have to go to and report us, get an investigation going. But don't come up to this podium and tell me a parent of three children who's a city taxpayer who we make 12,500 bucks a year to sit up here and do the best that we can and constant phone calls, e-mails, text messages all week. And guess what, that's what I signed up for. When I ran for this I understood that. But to stand there and call us corrupt , good luck because I'm not going to sit here and be called corrupt . If you think that we're doing something up here to break the law, then, guess what, go out and get us investigated . I don't care, and bring it out. Don't make blanket statements that we're corrupt . I'm not going sit here and take comments like that. You're not going to come up here and tell me I'm corrupt . That's ridiculous as far as I'm concern . I don't have -- maybe this thing is wrapped up. Speaking of being on the phone, on my way down to Harrisburg the other day I got a phone call and I have been in touch with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Senator Flynn's office concerning the -- it would be what Mr. Mancini mention ed earlier about the Highway Occupancy Permit. I was kind of being and intermediary trying to contact the administration to find out exactly what happened . I was informed that initially when this was approved , the work, it was bid out and the lowest bidder -- contractor did the work but never applied for a permit from the City of Scranton . So when they did the work, there was no permit issued. And now the state -- before we can go onto the state, we need to have the plans. And we need to have the actual permit so that our engineer can review that and then it gets submitted because what will happen is, if our engineers sign off and we haven't reviewed those plans, then it's going to come back on the city, you know, we're going to falsely say that, yeah, we approved it. We don't know that the contractor followed the original plan. So sometimes , you know, all things aren't necessarily what they look like. I don't have the ability to open it up to the -- maybe Mr. Smurl might have more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 information on that. That's all I know at this stage of the game. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : So I plan on touching on that tonight as well. I had that in some of notes in here for that as well. I'm going to start with ethics before I forget it. I did bring it up last week that -- according to our city Ethics Code, the campaign contributions had been raised. We did get a letter from the Business Administration stating that. After the meeting last week I found out that looking into the code, it can be increased every four years according to the Consumer Price Index. I for one though as I stated last week, I would have been in agreement with keeping it as it is at this point in time. I didn't see any need to raise it from 5,000 to over $6,000. Next, so it seems that a lot is going on with the Keyser Valley piece. This has been something in the works for a number of years going as far back as probably 2018. I think some of the approvals came in 2019. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 But -- and maybe some of the members up here know a little bit more than I do. I was an intermediary here for -- between the Keyser Valley Community Center Neighborhood Association as well as the administration to try to get this moving along. But, Frank, can we reach out to the Business Administrator Eileen Cipriani and possibly Don King, Tom Oleski and get the definitive update as to what's going on with our highway occupancy ? I know that the community center felt that they had their stormwater consistency approval that was approved by the city. And then this got pulled back and now it's going into some kind of review. But it seemed that was approved and now they're reviewing it over again for the third or fourth time. So if we could reach out and just get what is the definitive update as to what's going on with tieing the community center project into the right-of-way on Keyser Avenue. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information for you, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. Also in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 the Keyser Valley, I sent over some pictures of some sinkholes that were opening up on some of the roads over there and one that was opening up in a yard. The sinkhole that was in front of the driving range in Fawnwood has been addressed for the most part but another sinkhole has opened up a little further up. It is on the roadway . I was going to ask for an update. We did get an email today -- was it today, Frank, that we got the email? So they're beginning to process that sinkhole on Dogwood Circle and Forest Glen. MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct . I'll follow up to ensure that it's repaired. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you for all the work on that, Frank. We got somewhat of a response on the recycling mailer. The mailer went out for our recycling , it was only a 6 month rather than a 12 month. And we didn't have any information on why coming into last week. But it appears that there may be some changes in the second six months of the year that may affect that calendar so only the first six months were put 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 out. So I'm hoping that that's going to be a positive for the city, although it's going to be two mailings. Last week we did ask for a price of the total cost. And that was something that we had asked last year as well. So can we just ask for a total cost on mailers so we know the ballpark that we're looking at? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Frank. Another question I had was, recently the Scranton Housing Authority was attempt ing to give some monetary relief to the affected victims of the floods on September 9th. And as of yesterday they decided to give $20,000 to the Scranton Area Foundation . I guess the Scranton Area Foundation is going to be a passthrough for some of these funds. Can we ask the administration why we're using a third party as passthrough funds -- just to get the reasoning as to why we're doing this rather than giving direct aid to those people affected . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll clarify that also. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That's all, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, thank you. First, I brought this up again last week. It's a complaint that I've received numerous times about trash and some quality of life issues along the alley on Front Street in South Side. And I received good news today that that has since been cleaned up. It appears to be clean. So I was happy to hear that. Unfortunately , it does become frustrating when it takes so much time to get issues like this resolved . But I'm glad that it's been correct ed by whoever the property owner is. And also received a question about the tablet, cell phone tents that some people might be seeing around town outside of shopping plazas. I wasn't quite sure what they were myself. And I think it's attacking like maybe low income population to those tents. And so Mr. Voldenberg was able to clarify for me today that code enforcement did look into those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 tents. And they are licensed to be there and that it also might have to do with some sort of government funding program . Did I get that right, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Yes. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. So if anyone else had question s about that, I just wanted to make that clear. And I know that Councilman Schuster had also brought up the DPW recycling calendar . I just want to provide there are some additional details that I thought were helpful that were include d and the cost which we had asked for too. So the cost for the list labeling, postage and production was $10,955. And they said that they had also made several changes to ensure more consistent deliver y to resident s and reduce the cost. Production of cards were reduced by nearly 10,000 pieces. Address ing was presorted for the post office. They leveraged a recycling focused grant to offset costs as this is an educational piece for residents . And adding the second mailing will help them to meet 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 (inaudible ) recycling education requirement s and also gives them some more flexibility during the year if we need to add things to the calendar further . So I felt like that was definitely a helpful explanation . It seems like there's some cost savings there. And I know we've had a lot less complaints about people not receiving it this year and there being issues with mailing compared to last year even though we had one this evening . And lastly, I wanted to bring up again the reserved handicap parking legislation , which our solicitor has already gotten right on which is great. So he was able to review the ordinance . And he looked into the ordinances from other municipalities , including our neighbor Wilkes-Barre. So it's not just reading that we're looking at. And he found some interesting changes in their ordinance s that could help to correct at least one of the problem s that we're -- that we're seeing with some residents . And so I was going to allow him further explain . And so this is not, you know, a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 decision that, like, we've made as a Council as of yet. But it was discuss ed in caucus and I felt like it would be helpful for resident s to know that this may be a possibility for the city to improve on this legislation and to make it a little easier for those who need to use handicap parking in front of their properties . Solicitor Gilbride , do you have further details to add? ATTY. GILBRIDE : You're correct . As you know, Council receive d a draft memo from myself in regard to the reserve handicap parking issue. It is -- first of all, it is allowed under state law and the local governments are deputized by the state to perform that function . Several municipalities around us, including the city of Wilkes-Barre but several others as well also have these programs in place. I have spoken with several of those entities in an effort to determine problems they have with it so that, of course, when we draft our ordinance we try to stay away from the problem s they're having. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 So that ordinance should be present ed both to the Council and as well to the administration to make sure we're not stepping on any toes of the administration how they're going to enforce it. DR. ROTHCHILD : Excellent . Thank you. And one last thing I wanted to bring up, so for the complaints -- formal complaints that Mr. Gilhooley spoke to earlier and thank you for providing us with the forms, it is still -- I also wanted to stress how important it still is for people to fill out those complaint s. Even though the PUC has seemed to back off of the rate increase s, there is still going to be hearing and it's important to get as many complaint s in as possible prior to that hearing so that that they know just how much this is going to affect Scranton . So that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have two quick things. So I am thrilled tonight to hear in caucus that there's some leeway with this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 handicap parking . For four years here people complain ed to me about it that, you know, I got a sign in front of my house. I pay a fee to the city but I can't park in front of my house if someone else has a handicap plate. I was told by the city, you know what, that's it and that's it. That's the law. So I am thrilled that Solicitor Gilbride has found -- I don't want to call it a loophole. I want to call it a better way for our residents because like I stated a week ago or the week before, you know, there's one lady -- you know, there's a few that reached out to me. But there is one in general that is handicap ped. And guess what, you know what, and when she goes to store, she has to park a block away from her house to carry her groceries and more. And this almost on a daily basis because she lives on Main Avenue. So to hear -- and I'm sure she'll be thrilled to hear that, you know, there's hope. She's probably eventually going to be able to park in front of her house at any given time and not take a chance going to the store whether it's an uncertain ty when she gets home 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 that she can park in front of her house. I'm thrilled to hear this. This is great news today. And then secondly I have -- so I'm just going to report out what I asked last week. So last week I asked the status on the city's street sign replacement project . I know it's a hot topic with Miss Jeffries and a lot of residents complain about it. And like I said, one of them had a great idea. I don't remember which one about the sleeve. So I asked for an update on the project and considered a newer method of utilizing sleeves that have been utilize d in other cities. These aren't cheap. They're well made and easy to produce now with technology that replace -- just cover the sign. And I thought it was a great idea. So -- indicating the respect ive street names on them eliminating total replacement of the sign. So the answer I receive d was the traffic team does not have the capacity to install signs at the necessary pace. We heard that last year and that's unfortunate , okay. So, okay, with that said, the city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 has procured a vendor to assist in installing the street signs. We know that too but not much has been done. We've heard the same story two years in a row. Additional ly in September , the city applied for a multimodal grant for street signs. And we are awaiting a decision by the state. Great. You know, I realize that these are costly. I realize -- because we've heard that every year too that we -- we get some money. We start the process and it stops. So I'm hopeful that we continue this project because it's warrant ed and it's a long time coming. So with that said, they have not researched the method of placing sleeves over the street signs. They said we can look into this as a possibility . I hope they really take a deep look because every year we hear it's too costly and there's not enough manpower to do it. I think a sleeve requires less manpower and is definitely cheaper . So I hope they take a good look at this so we could finally get all the street signs updated . And that is all I have. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I guess, I'll comment on the Keyser Valley Community Center, the project up there first and the reason it is not tied in the storm drains yet. It turns out that the parking lot was paved. But it was paved without a permit. So, therefore, the city cannot sign off on allowing anything to be completed up there until we have it inspected . So the contractor was to be -- came to City Hall, was suppose d to be here today to have this completely finished providing all the documentation that is required . Now there is no -- for any city property or building or anything , there is no fee for the permit because the city owns the property , therefore , the permit is free. All you have to do is be a license d contractor and do it properly . So that being said, hopefully they were suppose d to show today and provide all that information . And if that was all provided , the city will release the numbers required by PennDOT to tie into the stormwater system. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 this is not the city's fault. This is not our fault. This is the fault of whoever told the guy go ahead and do it you don't need a permit. That is not so. You need a permit for every construction that you do in the City of Scranton that is over a specific amount of money. But everyone knows parking lots that have to be paved you need a permit. So, you know, we can dance around this all we want. But it was done improperly not by the city. So hopefully that has been completed . From what I gather it has been completed . But unfortunately -- I don't want people yelling out through here without doing this properly . So I apologize for not letting you up here and just yelling back and forth but I simply can't have that, okay? Thank you. The second thing I have is 1326 Brook Street, this was to do with that bright light shining into people's houses. The city zoning officer sent a certified letter to the homeowner regarding the light and the city requirement for homeowners to adjust or shield the light shining directly 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 into someone else's property . Mrs. Schumacher , the Beautiful Blocks Program per the city administration , the funds from the budget allocated for 2023 have been used and all of the 2023 project s are complete d. The city has funded additional $40,000 in 2024. But more details will come forward when NeighborW orks -- and I believe they are coming to Council too in January . So maybe they'll roll out then what we're going to use that for. Okay. The 1700 block of Dickson Avenue, there's multiple request s for there. One is it's next to a -- people live next to a senior living that was just constructed . They put it to code enforcement . Contract or was being requested to enclose a propane tank to reduce the noise vibration or move it to another work site. I guess the city will send code enforcement for there. Large uneven paving cuts on that block. DPW pave inspect or notified and contact ed Pennsylvania American Water Company to review it. The Water Company advised back that the RLE, their contractor will patch the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 uneven road and advance for a larger waste water replacement by PAWC in 2024. Then the road will be resurfaced curb to curb but not until then. They are putting a big new water main in there. So we're not going to pave it twice. Sidewalks not shovelled by the senior building project . Code enforcement was notified to either have a contractor /developer to show shovel or plow or maintain their sidewalks . So that was all taken care of. That's all I have. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
