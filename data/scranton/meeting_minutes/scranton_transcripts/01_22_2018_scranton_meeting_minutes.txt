This is going to be a public 19 safety announcement. The Civil Service 20 Commission would like to announce that they 21 will be conducting an entry level exam for 22 firefighter and EMT candidates. The written 23 exam will be held on Saturday, March 3, 0 24 a.m. The test location will be University 25 6 of Scranton DeNaples Center, room 407, which 1 is located at 900 Mulberry Street. 2 Interested candidates can can pick up 3 applications at the HR Department on the 4 third floor of city hall starting today and 5 continuing through Friday, February 2, 6 between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. 7 There is a nonrefundable application 8 fee of $100 required for the testing. 9 Candidates must be at least 20 years of age 10 on the date of written exam, possess a valid 11 driver's license, have a high school diploma 12 or GED, give excellent moral character and 13 be able to pass an extensive background 14 check. The top 60 candidates on the written 15 exam with the score of 70 percent or above 16 will be able to proceed to the next level of 17 the testing process. 18 So if you want to be firemen now is 19 the best chance that you have. Go sign up 20 and take a test and good luck, everybody. 21 MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? I have a 22 couple of announcements to make. The first 23 one, we had an executive session earlier 24 this evening to discuss pending litigation. 2501/29/2018 09:13:25 AM Page 7 to 10 of 33 4 of 11 sheets 7 Also, I'd like to remind people that 1 DPW crews are continuing to collect2 Christmas trees that are left at the curb3 until the end of this month. The trees4 should not be in bags and they will be5 recycled.6 Another reminder that snow from 7 sidewalks need to be removed in 24 hours8 after the event by city code. One of our9 former inspectors wanted to announce that as 10 well. 11 And, finally, since our meetings 12 have changed ECTV wanted to announce the new 13 broadcast schedule for city council 14 meetings. So, obviously, Monday at 6:00, 15 those who are watching now the meetings will 16 be broadcast live. They will also be 17 broadcast Tuesday at 2:30 p.m., Wednesday at 18 10:00 a.m., Saturday at 12:00 p.m. and 19 Sunday at 8:00 p.m. So that will be the 20 schedule ongoing. 21 MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS' 22 PARTICIPATION. 23 (The following speakers gave public 24 comment: 25 8 GERARD HETMAN. JOAN HODOWANITZ. BOB 1 BOLUS. LEE MORGAN. DAVE DOBRZYN. RON2 ELLMAN. MARIE SCHUMACHER.)3 MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS. 4 MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or 5 comments?6 MR. PERRY: I just have one quick one 7 from one of the speakers brought up parking8 meter, parking was a hot topic this last9 week and I know we met with NDC which 10 referred us to ABM and we were sold a 11 professional bill of goods and that's what a 12 we anticipated operating with and working 13 with as a public and private company. I'm 14 just asking for them to hold up to their 15 bargain just a little bit more, especially 16 when it comes to communication on what's 17 happening with our meters as of of right 18 now. 19 And I think the suggestion that was 20 brought up about posting downed meters on 21 their website is at the very least something 22 that they could do. So if there is not any 23 objections to sending a letter from council 24 to ABM. I would just like it stating that 259 we would like any and all down meters on a1 go forward posted on a website with a an2 approximate date of correction. I mean, I3 don't think that's too much to ask and I4 know there has been discussions going on, I5 know Councilman Evans will talk more on this6 but, yeah, it's a private company but they7 are working with the public and they need to8 understand that and one of the things that I9 felt comfortable with this company was that 10 they -- this isn't their first rodeo. They 11 have done in other cities and bigger cities 12 so they know the game plan. 13 So, again, all we are asking for a 14 little courtesy, keep us up-to-date what's 15 happening so we can relay that to the people 16 who ask us. Sometimes we feel like we are 17 in the dark here way too often when it comes 18 to situations like that and in today's day 19 and age we really shouldn't be. There 20 shouldn't be -- you know, information should 21 be supplied like that, so I'm just asking 22 for them to keep us in the loop so we can 23 keep everybody else in the loop. Mr. Rogan, 24 that's all I have for tonight. 25 10 MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. Mr. 1 Donahue, any motions or comments?2 MR. DONAHUE: Yes, I don't have much 3 tonight, but I'd like to briefly touch on a4 few different issues. First is the last5 meeting I was able to review the engineering6 report regarding the Young/Kennedy property7 and also sit down with Mr. Young to go over8 his concerns. There was a meeting held last9 week between the Youngs, Kennedys, 10 representatives from O'Reilly Associates as 11 well as Councilman Evans and Gaughan. I did 12 not attend because if there were three 13 council members present it would have to be 14 be publically advertised, which would have 15 further delayed the project and I wanted 16 Mr. Young to be able to express his 17 concerns. So I'll just let Councilman Evans 18 and Gaughan go into further detail regarding 19 that meeting. 20 I would just like to say that I'm 21 looking forward to working with the 22 administration over the next coming weeks 23 and month to move this project forward so 24 that it's acceptable to all parties. 255 of 11 sheets Page 11 to 14 of 33 01/29/2018 09:13:25 AM 11 Secondly, I would just like to touch 1 on the situation that arose last week2 regarding the downtown parking meters.3 Unfortunately, you know, irresponsible4 financial decisions by prior councils forced5 the city to give up control of parking6 assets in order to stave off the city's7 financial collapse, but we have to deal with8 the cards we are dealt, but I think moving9 forward we need to work with AMB to first 10 make sure that absolutely no parking spaces 11 have been or are taken out of commission 12 just because the meter is being serviced. 13 There are downtown business that rely on 14 that continuous flow of traffic in and out, 15 you know, for their businesses. 16 Secondly, I think we need to start 17 to develop a process to more importantly 18 facilitate communication between ABM and the 19 city, downtown businesses and residents as 20 well as the public at large. 21 And then, lastly, I would just like 22 -- I would like to make a motion to draft a 23 letter to Auditor General DePasquale in 24 support of his request to expand his 25 12 office's authority to include the municipal1 authorities -- to expand his office's2 authority to include municipal authorities3 as well as the state legislature. The lack4 of authority to perform those audits without5 being asked to do so undermines the primary6 role of the Auditor General as the public's7 fiscal watchdog, and I'd also like to copy8 Senator Blake as well as State9 Representatives Flynn and Haggerty along 10 with that. 11 MS. EVANS: If that would be in the 12 form of a motion, I would second that. 13 MR. ROGAN: On the question? 14 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, on the question. 15 I am in full support of Senate Bill 597 and 16 the effort by the Auditor General Eugene 17 DePasquale to gain greater oversight over 18 municipal authorities throughout the State 19 of Pennsylvania. The fact that the Auditor 20 General currently doesn't have the authority 21 to simply come in and audit an authority 22 without being invited is absurd. 23 The Auditor General's efforts are 24 particularly important for the City of 2513 Scranton in light of the stonewalling that1 city council, the public and the media faced2 when asking questions about the sale of the3 Scranton Sewer Authority and Pennsylvania4 American Water. In May of 2017 after months5 of stall and delay tactics by this6 administration and the Scranton Sewer7 Authority, I asked the Sewer Authority board8 to invite the Auditor General in to audit9 the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority to 10 Pennsylvania American Water, a very simple 11 request. In one of of the most egregious, 12 appalling and spineless acts that I have 13 ever seen the mayor's appointees to the 14 Scranton Sewer Authority board voted against 15 the request. They voted against 16 transparency. If everything was done above 17 board, as Mayor Courtright and others so 18 often have suggested, then what is the harm 19 in shining a little light on the deal to 20 make sure and verify. I would urge Mayor 21 Courtright in addition to the others that 22 Councilman Donahue has asked, to sign onto 23 this letter and to fully support the Auditor 24 General in his quest to increase 25 14 transparency and accountable in local1 government. Thank you.2 MR. ROGAN: Anybody else? 3 MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question. I 4 have no issue with this whatsoever. We have5 asked the Auditor General to take a deep6 look at this and other issues and it could7 have prevented and would have prevented a8 lot of questions that we had if we did have9 an independent third party audit the 10 situation. I can't stress that enough and 11 to have it refused so many times, you know, 12 it's kind of unthinkable, but, yes I'm 13 absolutely in favor of this motion. 14 MR. EVANS: On the question, quite 15 frankly, this is really a no-brainer and 16 long overdue so I welcome this legislation 17 and I applaud the Auditor General for 18 bringing it forth. Truly he is somebody who 19 has the best interest of all of the citizens 20 of Pennsylvania at heart, so I absolutely 21 will vote for this. 22 MR. ROGAN: All those in favor 23 signify by saying aye. 24 MR. PERRY: Aye. 2501/29/2018 09:13:25 AM Page 15 to 18 of 33 6 of 11 sheets 15 MR. DONAHUE: Aye. 1 MR. EVANS: Aye. 2 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 3 MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed? The ayes 4 have it and so moved.5 MR. DONAHUE: That's all I have. 6 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, 7 any motions or comments?8 MS. EVANS: Yes. Briefly on the 9 Young property, I don't want to get too deep 10 into this because we are still -- it's still 11 a work in progress, but Councilman Gaughan 12 and myself met with Reilly Associates and 13 the Youngs and the Kennedys and we feel like 14 we developed a framework to resolve this 15 issue once and for all. So we are waiting 16 on the administration to respond. So far 17 from what I -- the people I have talked to 18 within the administration has been 19 favorable, but we haven't heard from the 20 mayor yet, but I expect a positive response 21 and finally we will be able to put this 22 issue behind us and get this think taken 23 care of for the Youngs. 24 On other news, our Monday meetings 25 16 will I think in my view open up additional1 opportunities for more work sessions and the2 revisions of the idea sessions that we3 started a few years ago. Previously our4 Thursday meetings and scheduling conflicts5 played a role in delaying renewal of the6 sessions, so I would expect because of the7 change to Mondays that he will have more8 meetings than in past years and we will have9 more informative work sessions as well as 10 more members of the public involved through 11 work sessions and the idea session format 12 that we expect to start soon. 13 With that said I would like announce 14 the first idea session for 2018 on February 15 22 at 6:00 p.m., that's a Thursday. It is 16 our goal to have at least one per quarter in 17 2018, a total of at least four meetings this 18 year to meet with the public and come up 19 with real ideas and real solutions. 20 The format will be quite simple. We 21 will meet here in council chambers. The 22 sessions will be approximately one hour or 23 longer. The public will be invited and 24 there will be a clear subject objective for 2517 each meeting. The first 30 minutes are so1 of the meeting will be to develop as many2 ideas as we can on the specific topic and3 the last 30 minutes or so will be to develop4 and reduce those ideas to manageable,5 workable, doable ideas as a council and the6 community that we all can get behind.7 So the idea session will be simply 8 called 6 in 60. So we are looking for six9 ideas in 60 minutes. The first session will 10 be inviting the small business community, 11 and quite simply the charge for that evening 12 will be what ideas do they have that would 13 make the City of Scranton more business 14 friendly for the small businesses that are 15 currently operating in the city and to 16 attract more small business into the city. 17 Of course, my fellow council will be 18 asked to participate and while the first 19 meeting will be co-chaired by myself and 20 Councilman Gaughan, future meetings will be 21 chaired by two different councilmen and the 22 subject for those sessions will vary 23 depending on need and the interest of the 24 chairs. 25 18 Finally, I want to make one thing 1 perfectly clear. These are not complaint2 sessions, they will be idea sessions. So if3 you chose to participate we will be asking4 to leave your complaints at the door and5 join us for a positive session on making the6 city the best it can be. That's all I have7 right now.8 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Councilmen 9 Gaughan, any motions or comments? 10 MR. GAUGHAN: Yes, thank you. First 11 of all, I want to thank Councilman Evans for 12 bringing up the idea sessions again, I think 13 it's a good idea and I think what we saw the 14 last time when we went through these 15 meetings was a lot of good things came out 16 of them. Specifically, we were taking a 17 look at technology, Councilman Wechsler and 18 I, and one of the ideas that came out of the 19 meeting was the program that we have now 20 Granticus, so we now -- the public can see 21 everything that we see up here where in the 22 past you would have to come down and ask for 23 a copy of the legislation, now everything 24 that your councilmen up here see you can see 257 of 11 sheets Page 19 to 22 of 33 01/29/2018 09:13:25 AM 19 online, you don't have to request it1 anymore. So we are opening up the lines of2 communication between the governing body and3 the public so hopefully we will see more of4 of that.5 I just have a few citizens' request, 6 the first one, Mrs. Reed, we received a7 letter from a gentleman about 623 Crown8 Avenue, apparently the property is9 collapsing. He provided pictures to city 10 council so I'd like to know if this property 11 is not currently on the demolition list and 12 if we could find out what the status is from 13 Licensing and Inspections. 14 Also, just a brief update on the 15 land bank. To date, the land bank has sold 16 43 properties in the City of Scranton and 17 were previously on the Tax Claim Bureau of 18 Repository or unsold properties. 19 Mr. Pappas, the business relations manager 20 for the Department of Planning and Economic 21 Development reported to city council that 22 they also have several additional properties 23 at different stages of the disposition 24 process. So to date, in my opinion, I think 25 20 that the land bank program has been pretty1 successful, so we look forward to more2 properties being sold in 2018.3 Solicitor Minora had sent a letter 4 out after our request two weeks ago, January5 16, asking the Attorney General for an6 update on their sewer sale review so we'll7 look forward to a response from the Attorney8 General.9 Also, the NDC meetings, we were 10 discussing this in caucus and it's my belief 11 that these meetings should be public. There 12 has been a lot of conversation about the 13 parking meters and other things related to 14 the parking system in the city and in the 15 downtown and I think that if you are going 16 to have public officials, the mayor, the 17 city controller, and others on the board 18 that they should be open to the public and 19 the fact that NDC is a private company 20 doesn't mean anything to me because they are 21 dealing with a public entity. They are 22 dealing with taxpayer dollars. So it's my 23 belief that these meetings should be open to 24 the public. And that's all I have this 2521 week. Thank you.1 MR. ROGAN: Thank you very much. 2 Just a couple of the items, my colleagues3 already touched on the issue about the4 meters being down, and I did have a number5 of people that reached out to me and I know6 Councilman Evans was right on the spot with7 getting the ball rolling with this, but the8 downed meters really is a serious issues for9 the business owners in downtown Scranton. 10 So if it's agreeable to my colleagues, I 11 would like to send correspondence to ABM 12 that in the future when meters are down that 13 they are not bagged, that people are just 14 allowed to park for free as has been past 15 practice when the meter is inoperable. 16 Secondly, regarding the recycling 17 bins, which Mr. Dobrzyn has brought up at a 18 couple of meetings, if we could see if the 19 city does do any enforcement regarding that. 20 I have noticed a lot of people using the 21 city recycling bins more so for garbage than 22 recycling, particularly blue bins more so 23 than the red bins. 24 A couple of questions came up 25 22 regarding the meeting date changed to1 Monday, I believe, and our office did look2 into this, there is currently I think it's3 three less meetings than last year, and as4 Councilman Evans mentioned, filling in with5 idea sessions throughout the course of the6 year more than likely council will meet more7 this year than last year.8 And regarding the meeting date, the 9 meeting date is selected by the members of 10 council to the date that works the best for 11 their schedule. Since I have been on 12 council, I believe we met on Tuesdays, 13 Thursday, possibly Wednesdays and now 14 Mondays, so we have met every day but Friday 15 for the most part, so there has been changes 16 as different people come on council to fit 17 all of the schedules of the different 18 members, so Monday was what worked best for 19 the five members of council. 20 On the agenda tonight there is quite 21 a bit of legislation for our police 22 department, and I just wanted to take this 23 opportunity to commend Chief Carl Graziano 24 for all his hard work on behalf of the city. 2501/29/2018 09:13:25 AM Page 23 to 26 of 33 8 of 11 sheets 23 The first piece of legislation we are going1 to vote on is a grant to allow the police2 department to implement programs for the3 prevention and response to drug overdose4 deaths. As we all know, that in5 Northeastern Pennsylvania, and all6 throughout the country, drug abuse has been7 a growing issue and I'm glad that our chief8 is being proactive on that.9 There is also further legislation 10 regarding the Serrenti Center, which I know 11 we have debated this at length at our 12 council meetings, so I will just touch on it 13 very briefly, but this is a great program, a 14 great building the city is attempting to 15 acquire from the federal government to have 16 a lot of training and to have an additional 17 police presence in the Hill Section. Not to 18 mention just a storage issue, it was cheaper 19 to acquire this building for free from the 20 federal government than to construct even a 21 pole barn. 22 So I just wanted to comment briefly 23 on some of these items and really all of the 24 legislation as pertaining to the police 25 24 department and I want to thank our chief and1 all our officers for all of their hard work.2 That is all.3 MS. REED: 5-B.

I think this is extremely 15 unique and innovative and I think what's 16 going to happen here is you will avoid this 17 stigma of arrest that usually follows a 18 recovering addict post-treatment. 19 I think that the other thing that 20 this program is going to do is build 21 community trust. The last thing that 22 someone needs who is addicted to drugs is to 23 be thrown this jail. They need help. So I 24 think this contract for recovery will build 25 30 that trust and I think it is extremely1 unique, and again, I commend Chief Graziano2 and the Scranton Police Department. Thank3 you.4 MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the 5 question? All those in favor signify by6 saying aye.7 MR. PERRY: Aye. 8 MR. DONAHUE: Aye. 9 MR. EVANS: Aye. 10 MR. GAUGHAN: Aye. 11 MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed?
