Immediately prior to tonight 's meeting , an executive session was held in regard to personnel matters including investigation s and ongoing litigation issues. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 MR. SMURL: Thank you. Dispense with the reading of the minutes . MR. VOLDENBERG : THIRD ORDER. 3-A. OVERTIME REPORT FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS AS PROVIDED BY CITY CONTROLLER RECEIVED MARCH 28, 2024 FOR MARCH 2024. MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So the Scranton Police Department will be having their annual car seat check. It will be Thursday , April 11th from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., no appointments needed. You could have your child's car seat checked for recalls . Certified car seat technicians could help check for the best installation . Techs can answer questions on harnessing and proper use. This event is rain or shine at the Pennsylvania Ambulance on 1000 Remington Avenue, Scranton , PA. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. KING: I think Saturday , April 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 12th, there's going to be another fundraiser for Detective Gilmartin . And that's going to be held I believe at Montage Mountain . Is that correct ? MR. MCANDREW : It's Friday. MR. KING: Oh, it's Friday, April 12th. I apologize . So if everybody could get out and help support Detective Gilmartin , that would be great. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Scranton Municipal Recreational Authority meeting is this Thursday evening at the community building at Nay Aug Park. It begins at 6 p.m. And also on Thursday evening at 5:30 p.m. at Lackawanna College is the downtown Streetscape Project . That's in the People's Security auditorium , 501 Vine Street. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, a reminder about the solar eclipse on Monday, April 8th. If you would like to view it, you should go to the Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Public Library . And they will have a large screen TV with a hookup from NASA. And they also have solar eclipse glasses . And the weather is predict ed to be sunny. So it should be a good deal. If you want to go, call the library at 348-3000, press five to get the reference libraria n. Also, just a reminder that Library Express is closing to the public. The last day will be April 21st. Everything in the store is now 50 percent off. So you'll get several bargains . With regard to that public meeting at Lackawanna College on the Streetscape for downtown Scranton , that's the old walkability study from last year. I encourage residents of the downtown to try to attend. Among other proposals is a recommendation to replace 23 of 30 downtown traffic lights at intersections with four-way stop signs. And one of the intersection s is the corner of Linden and Wyoming where the Cathedral is. So just imagine all the people getting out of mass trying to cross the streets . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Also, they're proposing changing several of the currently one-way streets to two way including North Washington . So if you live downtown and may have a safety issue with trying to cross a street with four-way stop signs, the time to ask questions and express your concerns is now, not after the fact. So Thursday , 5:30, Lackawanna College . Be there. The union contract s are still not on the website . The firefighter 's contract , we've been waiting 364 days. It will celebrate its one year anniversary on Thursday . I was told 120 days to dot the I's and cross the T's. That never happened. This is a copy of the right-to-know request that I mailed into the City's right-to-know officer today. I used to do it by electric means, but they never answer me. So I thought I'd try the post office. You can't get into the building to deliver it in person because the right-to-know officer has no phone number. At any rate, I'm request ing it. And I'm going to pursue this because there is something wrong, something rotten in the City 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 of Scranton that you cannot see a public document like that. And no one's given me a reasonable answer why. Also, the police contract is now let's see -- 249 days late. And I saw in the newspaper that we're going to look at a skate board park in Weston Field. And that might be a good initiative and a good idea. My question is, is the city going to be liable for injuries and accidents ? And what kind of supervision is going to be there when people are skateboarding in case a child gets injured ? Have those issues been discuss ed and you should do that before we commit any money. I was happy to see the overtime report that DPW is still at zero for the month of March. But I don't understand why Parks and Rec for the year has used up 54.7 percent of their overtime . What's going on in Parks and Rec in the winter? I would like to know. Also, could somebody please tell me what is the life expectancy of a department head in Scranton ? Again, we now have a resignation of DPW just after we had to remove a person from OECD. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 I can't remember all of these people. I need a scorecard because I don't know who's on first. So somebody take a look at that. And with regard to living in Samter's and the lights from Mr. Basalyga 's movie house, I have no problem . I love the lights. It enhances the downtown . It's classy. It makes you feel alive. And it improves the safety of downtown because no criminal is going to stand on that corner and sell drugs or molest a pedestrian . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Jennifer Reed. Jennifer Reed. MS. REED: Hello. My name is Jennifer Reed. And I've been a Scranton citizen for the past 12 years. To say that I'm disappointed in this city and some of its residents would be an understatement . People are being lied to, tricked , and cheered for something that is egregious . I understand the term cleaning up the city sounds really pretty. I promise you that it is doing more harm than good. There are statements that have been made where people are unaware of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 fact that they are not throwing out people's ID's, Social Security cards, birth certificate s and sentimental items. This is, in fact, happening. Not all camps that are being destroyed -- sorry, cleaned up or abandoned . Being given a 24-hour notice to vacate will surely clear out a place but it doesn't mean it was abandoned . It means that they were forcibly removed from an area. Not only is this happening right under our noses, but the people that are being displaced are not given an alternative place to go. They are basically being told to figure it out, just don't do it here. I had called the Mayor's office on March 25th, 2024, at 3:23 p.m., and asked if they were aware of the cleanup that was being done. And the person that answered the phone said we are unaware of the situation . Someone will get back to you. They took my information and lo and behold they never reached back out. Yet, they were quoted on March 23rd, just two days before, "The city was made aware of a citizen 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 organize d cleanup that occurred today. Separate from today's clean up, the city has work of private property owners to help clean up trash accumulated at similar sites over the past four months." This is the same office that told me they didn't know. How can we trust that people will be taken care of in our community if we as citizens are being lied to by the people in charge? Just like the rest of society , these people are good or bad. But we are here now, people treating fellow humans like animals. These people are trying to survive like the next person. And you can't even get into a shelter without an ID. And this is for everyone in the room. Raise your hand if you've ever been homeless or are currently homeless ? Now raise your hand if you want to be homeless . Those numbers went down. I slept in my car for two weeks when I was younger because I was an active drug user and my aunt would not allow me to be in the house until I cleaned myself up. I learned a lot in those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 two weeks. I was also working at the time which made things more complicated . Do you know how hard it is to find a shower when you're homeless or to even use a bathroom when places won't let you, how to stay warm without having your car running all night or even worse, being lonely in a tent? If I hadn't had a job, where would I get food? Without a home I had more than most people today. And I have over a decade clean. I could guarantee you most likely would not be able to survive on your own for two weeks with only the clothes on your back and no one to fall back on in the middle of winter, especially . I have been delivering food and supplies to these people for almost three years now. And I've heard their side of things for this long. I've seen people get jobs, move into apartments and at the beginning of their unfortunate homeless journey and many of these homeless people do have jobs. Many of us are feeling this way, people that have homes. We have come together 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 to make sure these people are having their very basic needs taken care of for them because places that are suppose d to be doing this are not allowed to just due to the fact of facing the backlash from those above them. Shelters are not allowed to help the homeless because heaven forbid you give a homeless person a tent since they have no other options left. If all of you choosing to sit here in your position of influence elected by the people, you could make a difference but choose not to. If it affected someone close to you, would you do something then? Stop sitting idly by and forcing individual citizens to do the job that the city should be doing. Give these people better options. If you don't like where they are, give them a place to be. Give them porta potties and a place to throw away their trash. People in the homeless community have told me themselves that this would be a big improvement and it would give them a chance to feel like more than just dogs that it would give them a place to have a little bit of their 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 dignity back. The people that took away these things from them can keep their pat on the backs and their smug comment s. I have watched good people in the past two weeks regardless of religion , political views and economic backgrounds come together . I know I am exhausted . I work 50 hours a week and I raise a family and I still make time to help these people. I hope that these words will keep you up at night. And I know that they won't matter to you as you're in your home having your dinner with your family and it wasn't served to you in an aluminum tray. And you could cover yourselves in your warm blanket in your warm bed. Sir Winston Churchill said we make a living by what we get. But we make a life by what we give. I plan on continuing to give. And I hope that you will make the right decision and start helping as a community instead of letting us down. If this continues as it has been, many of us will know who not to vote for next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 time. Just remember whoever saves one life, saves the world entire. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Aaron Lee. MR. LEE: Good evening everyone . My name is Aaron Lee. I'm a citizen of Scranton . Currently at this present time I am homeless . And Jennifer and all the other people that have provided help for us is really appreciated . A lot of things that we are actually going through is trying to find jobs. If we have not a warm place to sleep or take a shower as which was said, these things is hard for us to accomplish to set goals, to actually be able to be successful , along with we have to maintain our presence , our presence of being as one to make sure that no one falls below what goal should be accomplished of, being successful , being straight forward to achieve your goal and also lead others that may need some push, some hope, anything that is possible . Jennifer , Patrick , all the other organizations that's actually out there that are helping and putting the time in, getting off of work and actual doing a whole lot more 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 than a lot of others are and stereotyping us. It's hard for us. Sometimes our heart is pumping very fast. Some of us get stressed . Some of us are depressed. Some of us have mental health problems . And it's kind of hard for us to voice our opinions or to go out to meeting s or to ask for help without the proper resources that we are requesting for. Some of these things is just needed for us to actually move on so that we are not stereotyped so that we all could come together as a city and be able to work things out. Us homeless people, many of us have diplomas , have skills, have worked, have lost jobs under a nature that was not asked for us to. It could have been a fire. It could have been a weather disaster . It could have been a death in the family. All of these things count. And some of these things are just being overlook ed. One thing I want is everyone to be equal. And by everyone being equal, it will cause less stress, less depression , just by less everything . Some of these homeless people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 and me and others that's in this room that may be homeless would like a job, would like to be part of the development , would like to donate funds to help onto our own brothers and sisters . I really think that we should really just all come together and make sure that the homeless people are cared for as those, Jennifer , Patrick , CIC, and all the other organization s, United Neighborhood . The funding, we can't really focus too much on funding if we can't focus on that. We have the homeless that's capable of doing these jobs. One thing, I'm employed . And it's very hard to get to and from work when your job has certain hours for you. I'm a per diem. I do a home health aid. I would like to go to work clean clothes on my back. I have to present myself to these people, help the elderly, make sure that they're well taken care of. For a lot of these people that's here today, they may have an elderly that needs to be taken care of. So we have to be very professional as well and try to keep our own lives on the outside which we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 shouldn 't because one thing in life is, is that we all have one to live. That's all I have to say. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Lee. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Lee, can I ask a question ? These the agencies around the City of Scranton , are they helping you? You said yourself you have a job. Are they helping others to gain employment and gain housing , things like that? Are they helping people to -- MR. LEE: How I explained , some of these people have mental issues which is health issues. And it's kind of hard for them to explain . Some of these things come because of their medication that they're on. Sometime s they may need someone to speak for them. And we're just shutting out to the side like our voice is not to be heard. So, yes, they -- these things are available . I filled out when Section Eight came on the first of last month, one of the first applicants and I'm still waiting on an answer. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. So the agency actually helped you to fill that out and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 pointing you in the right direction ? MR. LEE: Yes, that came from United Neighborhood . And I did the next steps myself to go over here to Scranton Housing Section Eight and fill out that paperwork . And I would like for all the homeless people to be able to do that and have a chance to fill out those paperwork s and be able to be moved up on a list. There's a lot of people that are not following the rules of Section Eight as well and we're not getting an equal chance. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, have you noticed that these agencies help with mental health referral s, things like that to get individual s that may have mental health needs into the right services ? MR. LEE: Yes. They actually do make the appointment s and referrals but also again, it goes down to the mental health and situations with the counsellors . If a counsellor calls out and he's suppose d to represent them for an appointment or go with them, provide the transportation , remember there's a health issue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 They forget. Some have dementia . Some are elderly. Some of these people can't be mobile to make it there. The weather can stop some of the people that should have been here or could have been here. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. LEE: You're welcome . MR. SMURL: Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . Last week I talked about the garbage down by Redner's? It was left from I guess the homeless were chased out of there. Was DPW informed about that? The garbage when -- off the expressway going down towards Redner's. I talked about it last week. MR. KING: Frank, did we ask -- MR. VOLDENBERG : That was sent out and put on their list. MR. SPINDLER : Nothing 's been done yet. It's still there. MR. KING: We'll ask again. Can you reach out to them again and see if somebody could get by and pick that up, please? MR. SPINDLER : And that leads me to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 my next subject . Joan already talked about the DPW Director resigning . If Tom Preambo was still DPW Director -- I don't know why he isn't because I still to this day think he was forced to resign. He was a really good DPW Director . He did a great job. He told me he watched the Council meetings. And when he heard something needed to be done, he got it done. And I know that for a fact because I forget what it was. I needed something done. He heard me on the meeting. And they were up there in a couple of days fixing whatever I needed. I can't remember exactly what it was. But I met him a few years ago at the Novembrino Splash Pad. He came over to me and told me all this. He watched every meeting and if somebody had a problem , he would take care of it. He didn't need Council sending him notices or anything . He took care of it. And to this day, I still think he was forced out of office. And when I asked our Mayor about it, oh, it's a personnel issue. I can't talk about it. That's what she said about Lenny Namiotka 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 being demoted too. She demoted him on a Zoom call and didn't have the guts to tell him to his face. Next thing, I'm going to piggyback on what Joan said. She stole some of my thunder about the Scranton Art House. I saw the article in the paper. The LIPS Department is out of control . You're harassing a man that's trying to improve the city. Downtown Scranton has been a ghost town for years. This man, he's trying to do something . It's bright lights. It's the Electric City. We should be proud that it's all lit up like that. These people that are complaining choose to live downtown. Downtowns are lit up. He shouldn 't have to turn those lights out. LIPS is out of control . And Mr. Basalyga said he'd even buy shades for the people if they can't sleep at night. Joan said she lives there, doesn't bother her. This man is just trying his best to help the city. He's remodeling the old Tinks building . It's going to be I think like a dance club and a restaurant . A dance club's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 going to be downstairs . People try to do good in this city and this administration is trying to chase them out of town. It's ridiculous . I think the person that has to leave town is our Mayor. Oh, that's right. I think she did. She's living in Clarks Summit now. Another thing with the city, now we're suing our zoning board. It's the most ridiculous thing I ever of heard of. Who we should be suing is Pennsylvania American Water. The article in the paper the other day about the gentleman from Dunmore , Mr. Buzelli who used to fish in Roaring Brook all the time. And I read the whole story. And he said, you know, you can't fish there now because they are not stocking the Lackawanna River or Roaring Brook now. And the fish eggs that are there, they're covered by that sediment. They're never going to hatch. So Pennsylvania American Water is ruining the environment . They are killing our rivers which were all cleaned up. And DEP gave a slap on the wrist where they just fined the landfill . They should be fining Pennsylvania American Water 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 for ruining these streams and rivers in our community . We should be suing them, Pennsylvania American Water instead of our zoning board, which the city appoint ed. Well, that's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . It's always interesting coming to Council and to hear the things that I hear sometimes . And one of the things is the homeless population . You know, as I sat there and listened to the presentations that were made, my church works with the homeless people. We work with the Keystone Missions and we do meals there. And we do what we call our sleeping bag project . And we make sleeping bags for the homeless . We do it on the first Monday of every month. And we sew them together and take them down to Keystone . So there's agencies , churches and things out there. But as I heard them talking and they talked about the United 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Neighbors and they talked about the CIC Center over there. I think that's the name of it on Linden Street. I thought do we as a City of Scranton have a coordinator ? Do we have someone at City Hall who knows all the different agencies in the city and what each agency is doing? This gentleman should not be questioned on different things that are going on. He is just his individual person. There should be an agency that's out there that knows about the numbers . For this young lady to stand up here with a board with the numbers of homeless -- I guess that's what it was. I couldn't read it all. But do we have a coordinator that's a city representative and paid by the city that oversee s and meets with all the different agencies in the city so that we know what's going on with the homeless population ? I don't know. I just know what my church does for the homeless . And I think, you know, I read the budget. Maybe I should look in the budget and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 see if there's a line item in there for a homeless coordinator that could coordinate with all the cities and the churches in the City of Scranton . What I came to talk about -- that took up two minutes of my time. But what I came to talk about tonight was Earth Day. Earth Day is April 22nd, which is a Monday. And the Saturday before the 22nd we will be having Earth Day cleanup up at Nay Aug Park. I don't have all the specifics right now. But I will have it by next week. I know that last year, you know, we had different agencies like the Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts and things that they would come up. And, Mr. King, you were there, you know, and cleaned up. And other people probably came as well, Mr. Smurl. So we're having that again. And I'll have more -- all the particulars next week. And that we'll be meeting at Nay Aug Park to clean up and to take care of that. And one of the things that I notice as we go through the park that the leaves have not been picked up. And maybe, Mr. Schuster , you could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 find out something about the leaves and why they are still down because we are at springtime now and we'll start to have the music concert s on Sunday. So it will be nice if those leaves from the fall could be picked up. The next thing that I had that I wanted to talk about was electronic billboard . And I know that you had mentioned that. And I think it was on Wyoming Avenue there was one and on Green Ridge Street. And it told us when the trash was going to be picked up, what cycle we were in. And I know you were concerned about who was paying for that. I don't know if we ever got a readout as what that was all about. If we did, I wasn't here. So if you could just give us an update on that. And then also, the street signs and Mr. McAndrew had mentioned something that I was also thinking the same thing, you know, I sure hope you're not going to come six months from now and tell me that $330,000 was spent and we don't know where it went. So that way with this $330,000 and the previous $300,000, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 $600,000 as been allocated for street signs. And here we are still talking about street signs. So I'm hoping you could give us -- not just me, the citizens of Scranton a breakdown of how that money is going to be used. And I know I spoke with you. And I thought maybe when it was put out for bid that it would list, you know, how many of this and how many of that were going to be done. So hopefully you could let us all know how that money is going to be used. MR. MCANDREW : Norma, I could report some information out in Fifth since last week. MS. JEFFRIES : I'm sorry, what was that? MR. MCANDREW : I could report out in Fifth Order. There's some information I got. I didn't get a lot, but I got some for you. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. And then the last thing I wanted to say was that when Les was here and he spoke about Mr. Preambo -- that's his name, Mr. Preambo . And he was a great guy. When he was here and he heard me talking about street signs, he reached out to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 me and had me down, invited me down to the DPW on -- I forget the name of the street down there. And as being new in Scranton I didn't know exactly where it was and found my way there. And he was so gracious . And he showed me that database that they had there which was huge and showed me how the stop signs and the street signs and the different things that they keep track of there. And then he took me over to where they were making the signs and the pixelation that they use to make the sign so that they are not faded out by the sun. And it was just such a formal education for me. And it's just funny nobody's ever invited me back again. But I guess I could go ring the doorbell and they'll let me in. I don't know. But that was a very big education for me. So thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Ronnie Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council , I just got a few things. Probably you guys wouldn't find them interesting anyway. But one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 thing, I'd like to agree with Pat Clark, which I never in my whole life done when he used the statement -- when will the state finally do its job and stick up for taxpayers . Well, in our case, when will this Mayor do her job and stick up for taxpayers ? I don't expect much out of it. I don't know how many countless times I stood before this and other Councils complaining about the pathetic going on with the zoning board. They're responsible for much of the destruction of our tax base, our neighborhoods , and the worth of the city. I think the examples that I've given about my own neighborhood full of a half dozen illegal boarding houses that they made from single family to apartments and full of people, you can't use the sidewalks no more. Nobody seems to care. Not one thing has been done. I told you two weeks ago little kids are in the street on the 2100 block of North Main because there's cars completely blocking the sidewalk . And there's hedges and so forth. Nobody cares. And another thing, we cannot allow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 developers or anybody oppose the zoning -- I forgot what I was saying -- how can I do that? It never happened to me before. You know, I've told you before that I'm a dyslexic . And I start seeing things sideways and upside down and everything else. That's what's happening for some reason. Our code enforcement is what I was thinking . None of these people, these develop ers are no more than the parasites Geisingers and Lackawanna College . They're no better but they cannot be allowed to dictate their terms and go against the code enforcement . And as far as the article in the paper about a lawsuit , the code enforcement should overrule any kind of ads in the paper because it was there -- it's history for us. You know, people put up signs they're not responsible for your hat and coat but they are. The city is responsible up to a certain point that the developer cannot be allowed to go against our city codes and it will start a precedence . That's terrible . We can't cave into their demands anymore. Enough 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 is enough of them. And one thing about the homeless , Norma knows that Roseanne and me been since the 90s try to help Jason in our own little way. What's happening with the $300,000 low income house? Why can't somebody be divulged about it? You know, it seems like it's just being swept under the rug. And as I remember several years ago when they wanted a skateboard, which I was in favor of, the idea of injury and insurance came up and it was tabled. Thank you all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Ron. Tom Coyne. MR. KING: Mr. Voldenberg , can you ask code enforcement to check the 2100 block of Main Avenue for vehicles parked blocking sidewalks ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Shoutout to Debra at home. Now, I was given by someone to present here who couldn't make it, a list of departments and how many have served in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 them. So far under the administration we've had four City Business Administrators , four City Treasurers , two Assistant City Planners , two City Solicitors in the Law Department , six City Assistant Solicitors , four Park and Recreation s Directors , three OECD Directors going on four, three OECD Deputy Directors , three financial managers in the Business Administrator office, special assistant s too numerous to report on, three fire chiefs, three police chiefs, three human resource directors , three Information Technology Directors and four DPW Director if you count the interim director Larry West now going on five DPW Directors . That's a lot of turnover. Now, onto my subject I'm going to define some words. To collude , to act together often in secret to achieve an illegal or an improper purpose . To conspire , conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit an illegal act along with the intent to achieve the agreed goal. Premeditation is when an individual 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 contemplate s for any length of time the undertaking of an activity and subsequently takes action. Premeditation is defined as thought over advance . Premeditation and deliberation can occur in brief intervals . The test is reflection , not time as one can follow another and judgment can be formed quickly . Criminal intent also known as mens rea. The legal translation from Latin is guilty mind. Why I do define these words, because I want you to fully grasp the situation because these are not just words. We recently had news of a DPW resignation of Mr. Pietreface on March 29th as if it was a surprise . But this is not the case. The Mayor said the position will be posted and Dennis Zarcouf {phonetic }, the department 's current manager emergency coordinator will be in charge of its day-to-day operations until the new director is named making him an interim director without vote or approval of this body. What is not said that Zarcouf who works as a manager I believe does not reside in the City of Scranton is beyond the six month 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 period. And I believe a waiver has been submitted and sits with this Council now for over three weeks, a waiver of residency for him (inaudible ). If I'm wrong, please let me know. You're aware that if a person fails to move into Scranton or leaves Scranton 's residency , they are no longer eligible to be an employee . You have six months to move into Scranton . And on departure or failure to move in, that termination is instant. This is enshrined in the city's charter , the founding law. There is no higher law. I would like to hear from Council if they had any residency waivers present ed in the last month for who, what action has been taken, even if the action was just to set it aside. The words -- when you become aware of the violation of the law there is a duty to report it. Has this body directed the Law Department and HR to remove that employee as the law requires ? To knowingly sweep it under the rug is a premeditated act to collude and conspiracy to violate the law. You may not be aware, but there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 no confidentiality protection in participation in an illegal act. Even as a lawyer, all that communication including attorney /client privilege is not protected . So again I ask, has a waiver been submitted to this body in the last month by whom and though not acted on, has anyone directed at the minimum to the law office and the HR Office to properly resolve this? The floor is yours. Answers ? MR. SMURL: I'll answer that for you. I received the residency waiver from the Mayor's office and the Business Administrator 's office. And I still have it. I have not put it on the agenda until I receive information I was requesting from our Solicitor . I received that all this afternoon and next week it will be on the agenda. MR. COYNE: I believe you receive d that from what I've gathered three weeks ago, whether you're going to put it on the agenda now or not is a completely different situation . And again, this employee is over six months employed for the City of Scranton , correct ? MR. SMURL: I believe he is now, yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 MR. COYNE: Why? Six months, nonresident , gone, city charter . If you are not sending it to the Law Department , if you are not sending it to HR and demanding an immediate termination , then you are conspiring to violate the City Charter and the law and you should not be in office. MR. SMURL: Well, there you go. Thank you. MR. COYNE: That's the law. Follow it. MS. LABROSKY : Good evening , Council , Lynn Labroski , life-long resident , homeowner, business owner, fed up taxpayer . I hope you all had a blessed Easter. I know I did. That being said, I'll get right to it. It's extremely difficult for any one person to get up and come to this podium and which should be a platform for Scranton residents to pose their question s and concerns to Council . I believe that Council members are suppose d to take those concerns back to our elected Mayor and work in conjunction with one another to get these questions answered and concerns addressed as well as legislate for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 people whom you were elected by. If I'm wrong, please kindly correct me in Fifth Order. Unfortunately without a doubt, there are way too many issues in this city to beat the five minute counter clock even if 100 people showed up tonight . Time is precious and it's promised to no one. Yet, week after week many dedicated residents take the time out of their busy schedules to come to this podium and ask the same educated questions but the answers just never come. So I'd like to take a minute to talk about some of these fine folks behind me and I hope they're not upset that I'm doing this. But I call them the diehards. So by now I think Joan and Marie should actually be on the city payroll because I'm sure it takes a lot of time and effort for them to look at all these budgets and audits and contracts which seem to never come. And, Norma, God bless her heart. She always comes with good news but she just can't seem to get her around town. Can we please get this lady some street signs? Oh, please -- Les, my friend, he's been asking for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 his sidewalk to be fixed for two and a half years. We have volunteers . Can we just cut the red tape and fix his sidewalk ? And then we have Mr. Little who stands here week after week begging for help. But I don't know if we could maybe find this elderly gentleman a home. So I'm just not -- I mean, the issues are redundant . And I'm not comprehending . There's a lack of common sense in our local government. But I won't stand here tonight and point fingers. I believe we have some really good people on Council and in City Hall and they are trying to do what makes sense. But it cannot be easy to fight the machine . But I say this, we the people, a phrase that appears in the preamble of our United States Constitution . It emphasizes that the idea that the Constitution is the result of the collective will of the people, rather than the creation of a monarch or a ruling class. This phrase represents the foundation of American democracy . And the idea that the power of government should derive from the will of the people and certainly not the Royal We. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 We, the people, deserve better. And that should include every resident regardless of their race, religion , or political affiliation . We the people need to stand up and come together in a nonpartisan way because we can. Scranton resident s deserve better than what is being provided , better than high taxes and potholes , better than being locked out of City Hall, better than waiting four years on a call from a Mayor that never comes, better than being snubbed when you use the trigger word like corruption , better than the Mayor that puts bureaucracy before safety, better than a city that sues itself, better than leaving the good of this electric city in the dark and the list goes on. So I think we all need to come together and work together as it should be. I have met some really terrific people in the last several weeks. And it seems to me that most of us common folk are all on the same page. But the organization and leadership in this city is lacking . So I just want to go off the cuff now and just ask where the common sense is when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 there's a gaping hole in the middle of a road where children walk to school every day. But we got to cut through red tape. We can't just put some dirt in the hole or put a piece of plywood over it. Nobody could ever get an answer from the top person in our city government . So there's just all of these concerns . A nice gentleman used to clean up the viaduct every year. He can't do it anymore. He has cancer. When we were cleaning up the Heritage Trail, there was a young man that did do the cleanup of the viaduct in honor of this person that can't do it anymore and the bags of garbage have been sitting there for a week. Nobody will pick them up. So it's just a sad day in this city when we just can't use our God-given sense to make some good decisions . And I'm just going to ask that I'll close with this that we stand up as residents , we take our city back. And in the meantime if we can just all pray for our leadership, that would really be fantastic . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Rick Little. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Rick, you. MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Voldenberg , would you reach out to DPW make sure they -- see if they could swing by and pick up the garbage that's near the viaduct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thanks. MR. SCHUSTER : Also, while we're on that -- MR. LITTLE: Hello, Scranton City Council , my name is Rick Little. Continuing from last week on my odyssey of homelessness in Scranton . Last night I was walking around in front of the City Market. And there's all of these cars. And one of the homeless shelters , a specialized homeless shelter on Adams Avenue -- there's two of them. They call them halfway houses. People that get out of jail and they put them in there. At some point in time somebody made laws, you know, like, we're caregivers -- probably was Josh Shapiro , I guess, because his picture is on there. But all of these homeless shelter s they're really just 5013Cs like everything else 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 like Scranton Housing Authority . I also saw the same night, you know, a guy being led into St. Anthony's shelter , which is on Olive Street. And it gets very confusing because it's in the same building as the St. James Manor. And it's the same building and in the back of that same building is another homeless shelter for people that -- halfway got out of jail. I tend to think that might be the women's one because I see all of these women. There's hundreds of beds there. And plus in front of the building they have the refugee thing. And I always see the truck with NAACP truck there. And it's always open and people are always coming in. But there's no housing for the elderly. The City Market the -- let's see, I covered that. The one for the citizens of Lackawanna County is only for 20 Lackawanna citizens . Yet there's, you know, hundreds of people being served on this higher thing. Scranton has to take back its property . I don't know what this, you know, final reading . I'm glad to see Scranton from the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 Pennsylvania Department of Transportation because I could see over the last hundred years, you know, things being taken away from Scranton . Scranton Housing Authority , as I said, last week I went and got the deed down there. There's no records . All along there is no records of how many evictions , especially in the magistrate court. It goes back to like 1996 and all of these evictions are based on violations of the lease. No one has read -- and when I say no one, I mean the people that are adjudicating it. They don't read the lease. They don't even present the real lease in their legal papers. There's no reason that I should have been taken to court in the first place. In fact, it was illegal because HUD SHA's main duty as a federal housing authority is to stop homelessness and provide safe housing for the elderly and disabled . And if the tenant can afford the rent, it's SHA's federal duty to find funding . Now, you start looking into HUD. I tried to get on the board of SHA. This is the biggest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 problem I see. Scranton has lost Scranton Housing Authority . It's really run by the District Attorney 's Office. And I -- it's my opinion that the District Attorney 's Office is running the courts. They have their people in there. And they are running the courts in the two most vulnerable things, the youth services and the elderly. CIC, you know, all of the things that they set up to take care of the homelessness , I mean, I go down there. It's the same people out of the halfway house. And they come there and all of these charities , you know, good people. They bring their food to CIC. This is a daytime place. And I watch people coming. They have cars. I didn't have a car. They come in and they just take the food and go. You know, there's a lot of food. There isn't very much housing . And there needs to be a holistic review of the DA courts. And I would just like to promote a book called the Luzerne Railroad by Larry 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Hohal, H-O-H-A-L. Vote, know who your clerks are in the courts, know who you are putting in charge. MR. SMURL: Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . Okay, I'm going to review the actions of the past three mayors. After Mayor Connors we got Mr. Doherty . And one of the incidents we had a homeless advocate here talking about how they showed up along, the trail to be -- the river trail and tossed everybody 's belongings into the river along with the current police chief. So, you know, we have a long history here of not treating people right and certainly wallets and papers should never be thrown away. Now, last week I got home from our errand. And these people were on my front porch (inaudible ) Energy. Now the Mrs. declined these people to sell us cheaper electricity . The letter reads, has sent a request to your local utility to remove it -- energy programs from your account . They didn't even discuss gas and gas is listed here UGI Utilities . And my attitude of these companies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 and the deregulation of the electric is that they have more copper in their telephone than they do at getting electric ity to my front door so don't bother me. And out there in TV land, you better pay attention . Don't even talk to these people. They come on your land. Tell them get the hell out of here. I hope I won't get a reinstatement bill from PPL. Now, we do need a kinder more gentler home inspection in quality of life. If you have a pretty egregious violation if you own a workplace , you don't get an initial fine if OSHA comes in. And they only come in on complaint now. They don't come in because somebody up the street thinks they should or whatever that doesn't work there. And there is no initial fine. There also is an initial conference . So what I'd recommend is that I don't want to kick people or beat up on them either. But they are our employee s and we should tell them to behave and such and how we want them to behave. Here's another issue. Predenial for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 leachate permit jeopardizes plan. Well, I spoke on this last week. I do not trust the landfill to do anything competently . Everything imaginable -- and I worked at garages and dealerships . Those oil filters went into a barrel. You know, all kinds of nasties and it went to the landfill . There was a battery company recycle r lead operation , those battery casings went to the landfill . And they're all sitting there rotting away. And they'll eventually be in our water flowing over the falls. So please, go after them like a Rottweiler that you stole a bone off of, you know, and that's all there is to it. And the streetscape business came up again. I resent anybody that's 501C3 or C4 sticking their nose into any facet of my life. Two colleges in this town are pushing this. I don't know what they want. Do they want to empty out the downtown some more so they could buy it all up? What do they want? And, you know, the other ones, I mean, I have nothing against somebody that wants 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 religion or go worship . I don't have to kneel on glass and say the Rosary to go sleep in the same bed with my wife. You know, excuse me. There's a lot of stuff going on in this country that's making me very angry. You know, a couple months in jail over one of those stupid laws that they come up with and then that's what happens . Thank you. Have a good night. MR. SMURL: That is all for sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. VERCHUK : Would you accept the distribution of a handout? MR. SMURL: Yes. MR. VERCHUK : To begin, I would like to thank the City Council and the states for finally getting the reflectors and the thing on the Spruce -- formally Spruce -- Biden Street painted , the barrier . And I just distributed a handout. I'm Eli Verchuk and I reside at 2 Leslie Drive in Scranton . I provided you each with a handout from the Times-Tribune from March 28th, 2024 regarding the Art House Movie Theater , which I urge you to review in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 conjunction with my remarks today. I stand before you today to address a matter of concern regarding these fines imposed on the Art House, a movie theater located at the corner of Lackawanna Avenue and Penn Avenue. And it's come to my attention that the Art House has been fined for it's so called bright lights, which -- I'm sorry, while I understand the importance of city ordinance s and regulations , I would like to highlight the significance of this establishment to our community . The Art House has served as a cultural hub and a beloved entertainment venue in our city providing joy and cinematic experience s to resident s and visitors alike. Moreover , the Art House represents a rare instance of positivity and vibrancy in our city where too often good news is scarce. It would be regrettable to stifle such a beacon of hope in our community . However , I urge the City Council to consider the impact of these fines on the Art House and its ability to thrive. Moreover, I respectfully suggest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 that members of the City Council take a drive by the Art House on the way home tonight to witness if the lights are on to witness first hand the brightness of the lights in question . This firsthand observation may provide valuable insight into the situation and aid in making informed decisions regarding the fines. In conclusion , I kindly request the City Council review the situation regarding the fines imposed on the Art House and consider alternative solution s that support both the (inaudible ) of our art community and city regulations . Also, I put a box on the back of that handout I distributed from Joan Hodowanitz who lives across in the Samter's building . And she stated in that box that she does not seem to have an issue with the lights. And in my opinion , it also will help reduce crime. And that's all I have to say tonight . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , city resident and homeowner on the East 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 Mountain . First of all, has anybody gone to see what -- the way the stormwater is being handled at the University of Scranton 's latest building ? MR. KING: I think it was indicated that there's certain requirements that they need to follow in terms of zoning and city planning . And a lot of that relates to stormwater as well. So before they could proceed with any of that construction , I believe that they need to be able to pass all of those inspections . MS. SCHUMACHER : It would be nice to know how they are doing it. Now, does DPW keep any kind of statistics that you know of? I sent a right to know to our right to know person, not to the DPW. But it's not -- I mean, it's not over the time that they have to give you a response ; but I would think it would be a whole lot faster because what I asked was that the last year -- the most current year that Seymour Avenue was paved from 307 to East Mountain Road. And to me that would take, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 a phone call to DPW or whoever does that kind of stuff and be able to give an answer to that. But there is no answer yet. Probably get a 30 day you have to get a response and it probably won't be done. So it just leads me to ask what, you know, do they -- whenever they do a road, do they put a -- have a log of what they've done on that road? MR. SMURL: Marie, I don't know what their documentation system is for any of that. I've never looked into that. MS. SCHUMACHER : It might be good to do that I think, you know -- MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we look into to see if the DPW does know the answer as to the last time that Seymour Avenue was paved? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask that question . MR. KING: Can we also find out if there's a documentation -- some type of system that records , you know, when streets are paved and documented and cataloged so that it could be -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. KING: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : And that leads me to another thing because in the last budget you did away with the pave cut person. Are you planning to put that back into the -- back into the employment area next year? MR. SMURL: Are you saying they eliminated from the -- MS. SCHUMACHER : Pave cut. We had a pave cut. MR. SMURL: Inspector , yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. MR. SMURL: I don't believe that was eliminated . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah, it was. MR. SMURL: Okay. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And then my young friend, I would just like to again -- this which was just incredible . When I went out on the porch and got this paper I couldn't believe it. We have been watching that thing get those lights and all the work that was put into it and then, you know, here's Mr. Basalyga and he's trying to do something good for the city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 And what does he get, a ticket from the city. I just think that's terrible . And I think he deserves a -- well, maybe not from the administration ; but it would be nice if you guys went on his side and thanked him for what he is doing downtown . Down the other -- down the back alley I think that's his again too, is it not, all the work that's being done at the end of the court? MR. SMURL: Dix Court, yes, that's his building too. MS. SCHUMACHER : Yeah. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Marie. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . A couple months ago I mentioned that I'm a big fan of those that are present . Those that are present make good decisions . Over the last two weeks, three of you are present . For the first time in years I feel that we finally have a group of people that care about the city that are being proactive as opposed to reactive like this administration . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 This administration has become dull as our street signs from 30 years ago. There is no substance . And she brings nothing to the table. You know, even the littlest of things like replacing signs becomes a big issue when it becomes $150 per installation . You know, when we take these signs what are we doing with them? What, are we scrapping them? You know, you see a lot of these dull and faded signs in man caves and things like that. Why don't we just take these signs and try to resell them? You know, there's people that have owned their home for several decades that would love to see their street name, a street sign that says like Ferdinand Street or something like that. You know, it helps with the installation . I asked last week about canines . It's unfortunate that this Mayor cannot even look at our safety issues and realize that we're -- we have a deficiency with our canines . I have to address Council as opposed to her accepting a phone call. You know, when you're from the other side of the country and you really don't understand what's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 going on around here, things like this happen. You know, I've asked this Council to contact the utilities as far as our manhole covers and when they go to cut our roads. We have these ordinances in place. We need to push them as far as we possibly can. We need to make the utility companies aware because , you know, when DPW works hard to fix these roads, we're also seeing these cuts that have been there for a while, a reminder of several water main breaks like up on West Linden Street, two of them. Neither one of them were filled in properly . It's a reminder of the unfortunate loss of water, you know. I'm not too keen on the PA American Water. I looked at those documents for the sale of the Sewer Authority . There is a rain tax in there. Frankly, Mr. Smurl, you didn't even address it, not once. Several weeks you received documents , you know, sitting in that chair having that gavel, you are suppose d to lead by example . My opinion , you are the weakest link. You are like the Mayor. You bring nothing to the table. And it's unfortunate because this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 is the time where we need you most -- you the most. You know, we have a railway system coming through . We have a police department that's deficient . We have police chief and a head of detectives who were approve d through that Lee app. You know, that's that old testing that was done through the Scranton Police Department which most of our older police officers took. They lead by example . This is the fabric of our police department since 1866. And that's taking the responsibility -- the ability to carry yourself and lead by example . That was passed from generation to generation . This administration took something that she thought works in Portland , brought it here leaving all of our officers at risk. It's unfortunate . You know, I think you need to bring both of them back in before caucus and address the issue. And as far as Lee Morgan and others who have brought up the fact that whether you're head of parks, after six months if he doesn't have his residency , he's gone. Now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 that this Council is back in the hands of the people, let me address this. There's going to be no more out of town approvals . You know, this is what happens . You have a laundry list of those that were here, let go, fired, whatever . That's because we allow them to come in from out of town. It's the who of who you don't know. You know, we're only as good as we surround ourself with. And come next May 20th, which is my son's birthday , we're going to have a new Mayor. I assure you of that. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Have a good evening . MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I have several comments in reference to the work that was done at the corner of Biden Street and Jefferson Avenue. I know that we put in for that back in January . And I'm thrilled that that was finally completed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 I just also want to report that the barrels that are busted when you leave the city and go out towards Pittston Avenue, there's a split towards 81 and a split to Pittston Avenue. Several of those must have -- obviously must have been hit and they've been busted there for a while. I'm told we got an e-mail that DPW will be replacing those new barrels within two weeks. So that's an update on that one. In terms of John Basalyga and the lights, I don't know if I could speak for all of Council ; but I could speak for myself. I was appalled when I saw that report because I think that is a prime example of, you know, some of the resurgence of downtown . And, you know, we have a number a developers who have taken some old -- I don't want to say dilapidated building s, but at least many of them abandon ed, former factories which were vibrant and support ed this area for many years have all been converted . I know I remember going to Samter's as a young child getting a new suit and, you know, that building is now, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 Commonwealth coffee on the first floor and there's beautiful apartment s on the second, third and fourth floors. So I applaud Mr. Basalyga for what he's trying to do to improve our downtown along with the former Tink's building and many of the other buildings Casey and Adam Donahue and Mr. Mammano and, you know, Art Russo and Charlie Jefferson . There's many others who are revitalizing our downtown. So I support Mr. Basalyga in that. And I believe that when cooler heads prevail that we could arrive at compromises and settle these things without having to end up with code violation s and things like that. And I believe that is going to be resolved . So I do support that beautiful new lighting there on the corner of Penn and Lackawanna Avenue. As far as the canines are concerned , I know we put that request in. We did get a response from the Mayor. It's not necessarily the full response that -- we were looking for three additional canines on top of three that already exist, if I recall. That was the ask. The response on March 27th was, we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 currently have three dogs, two narcotics detection and one explosive dog, all are trained in tracking and apprehension . One of our dogs will be retiring soon. So planning ahead, Chief Carroll present ed the need for funding to Council during a budget hearing . Council approve d the funding . The next canine handler is in the process of selecting a dog and training vendor. He should be training by fall and have the dog in service by the end of the year. It still doesn't address the fact that we're looking to possibly add additional dogs. So I think when we get into budget discussions , that will be something that we'll have to bring up during those discussions . And fourth, I asked for a list of all the paving that's going to occur. I know I just got a list when I arrived here this evening . I know there was at least one or maybe two mistake s on there. I'm going to read to you real quickly of the roads that are schedule d to be paved this summer, the 100 block of Lucky Run Road, 15 to 1700 block of Euclid Avenue, 1700 through 1900 block of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 Manila Place, 1600 block of Parkhurst Place, the 600 block North Evans Court, the thousand block of Howell Street, the 800 to 1100 block of Drinker Place, 1500 block of Ross Avenue, the 900 block of Stipp Court, the 6 and 700 blocks of Colfax Avenue, 2100 block of Ash Street, 300 block of Max Court, the 100 to 300 block of Meadow Avenue -- thank you, please -- the 400 to 500 block of Factory Place, the 1800 and 1900 blocks of Kirst Court, 100 block of Nichols Street, 2600 to 2800 block of Murphy Court, the 2800 to 2900 block of Hamm Court, Nay Aug Avenue and the 1400 of Mylert and Albright Avenue, the 500 to the thousand block of Hemlock Street, the 2300 to the 2800 block of Stafford Avenue, the 200 block of Jefferson Avenue, the 1900 block of Mulberry Street, Nay Aug Road from Arthur Avenue to Mulberry Street. They have a list of some alternatives which include the 4 to 500 block of Lackawan na Avenue, the 2200 block of Prospect Avenue, 22 and 2300 block of South Webster Avenue and the 700 to 1100 of Saginaw Street. And I'm guessing these alternatives are based on how the pricing comes in to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 all of these other project s done. And there may be a few mistake s or changes in there. So I would think if some of the ones that were mistakes were already done or listed, that these would be the next ones in line at least for this spring and summer. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. I'm going to go off of some of what Mr. King said. This Friday I did get out to the Art House Theater . So I will say I was sad to see the article in the paper on Thursday because my wife and my son had planned to go see Ghostbusters on Friday. And that plan was in the works for a week. So when this article came out the day before, it was a shame that I had to see it. I do support any develop er that's improving our city. And this is an improvement to our city. I did get to the opening of the Farr Street Tavern which was in my neighborhood where I grew up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 And I think it's been an improvement to that neighborhood as well. I'm going to go through a couple things there. I hope I could get them all. I had asked that the zoning meeting -- some of the neighbors on Euclid Avenue and Hawthorne Street that were affected by one of the variance s that was up at the Zoning Board meeting . At the meeting the zoning officer said that letters were sent out to the resident s. I did not know of any of those resident s that received letters. But I got an answer back because last week I asked how did the department notify the neighbors there. It says five letters were mailed to neighbors near the property in question and three signs were posted. As required by Zoning Hearing Board notice -- put a notice in the advertisement section of the newspaper . I did see that notice in the advertisement section of the newspaper . I still did not get verification that letters had gone out. We -- several times the public and Council has asked for updates on the Serrenti Center. And the administration 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 has received our request to get a caucus and an update of Serrenti Center. And they're going to get a possible date. But it has yet to be determined . Looking back I have an answer for Norma on the recycling billboard s that were up in the city. So I did ask -- I'll get back to that one. I just hit the button on the computer and it went through . It did say from what I remember from reading here, I asked for the cost of the project . It was $2,000 a month for the billboard project . And the city was going in a different direction . I asked what the metric was how we determined whether that was a successful spend of that money because I thought , you know, maybe we would see an uptick in what the tonnage of recycling were. I thought I would receive an answer like that. I did not get what that metric is that they were going to use to whether it was a success or not. They did say that grant money was used for it and the grant money had to be used for education . So after the meeting I could pull that. I'm sorry. I hit the space button 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 here and I lost that e-mail. Frank, there are two signs down that I got calls in the last two days. There's a sign down on the corner of Lafayette and Caroline Street in West Scranton . It's on the ground on Lafayette Street. I did send that over to DPW, but if you could follow up on that. And then I was just told that there is also a sign down on the corner of Bundy and Return Avenue. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of them both, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you. Mr. King read off a list of streets to be paved and there are also some streets that the water company is going to pave. So I could read them off as well, Rundle Street from Main to the dead end, Watson Street from Main Avenue to the dead end, South Grant Street from Jackson to Washburn ; North Grant Avenue, Price to Jackson ; Washburn Street, Hyde Park to Sherman ; South Sherman Avenue, Price to Washburn ; South Sherman Avenue, Washburn to Luzerne ; Morris Avenue, Washburn to Jackson ; Prescott Avenue, Ash to William ; East Gibson 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Street Harris to Richter ; Snook and Elmhurst , Conroy to Linwood ; Penn Avenue, Spruce to Mulberry ; Maple Street, Meadow to Webster ; Cherry Street, Pittston to Prospect , Brook Street, Pittston to Prospect ; East Locust Street, Pittston to Prospect ; Prospect Street, Fig to Beech, Willow from Pittston to Bergen, Alder Street, Cedar to Bergen and Pittston Avenue, Sanders Street will also be paved. That's all for now, Mr. Smurl. If you could allow me to go back if I could find this e-mail I could get those answers. MR. SMURL: Yeah, sure. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I do. First off, I just want to say my apologies for some of my absences lately. I was dealing will a illness for a while and then also gave birth on the 21st to a beautiful baby boy named Calem. So I'm happy to be back here but also really happy to bring our boy home to complete our family. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 There was a property that I've been asking about for a while that we did receive an additional update on. I know there are neighbor s within the South Side neighborhood that have brought it up at a meeting recently. That's the rear of 621 Alder Street. And for that property , there's been a hold up with the magistrate 's office. And that's where the issue lies and the response that we received from the city about that. So apparently they never received a plea from the address that it was sent to and so there's going to be a warrant put out for the property owner to be able to bring them to court for the issues with that property . And so the city is basically saying we don't have much control over what happens once it gets to the court system which has been part of the issue with a number of properties in the past, not just this one. But hopefully they will get a court date and try to bring the issues to light and get them resolved at this property . And there was another property that I've brought up a lot in the past too which is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 at 429 Prescott Avenue. And they had a fire a couple years ago now. And I thought that they were suppose d to be -- that it was going to maybe be placed on the demolition list because the property owner said they were going to do -- they were going to renovate the property and then never did. But I didn't see it on the demolition list that I receive d a few weeks back. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would be able to check on the status of that property what's going on there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . It's condemned but not on the demolition list as of yet. DR. ROTHCHILD : Right. Okay. Yeah, I think that's all that I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . MR. SCHUSTER : Excuse me, so, Norma, when it comes to the recycling billboard program , the billboard program costs $2,000 a month. I asked which line item they were coming from. The recycling education is paid 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 for by the Department of Environmental Program 904 grant. So it wasn't coming out of the city budget. The metric being used to determine the program whether it was a success , it said education is a requirement of the program . So it was just saying that the money had to be used for recycling education . Will the city continue to the billboard program , the city has canceled the contract for the billboard s and is working on develop ing a new strategy for recycling education moving forward . There was also a question about recycling bins. So I can put that out there as well. The city provides blue commingled bins and red cardboard and paper bins to resident s. To retrieve bins, residents should visit 101 West Popular Street in Scranton 18509 or City Hall popup events. And they could get blue commingle d or red recycling containers at those events. They also said that the Christmas Tree Program occurred in 2023 to recycle the Christmas trees and also in January of 2024. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 Thanks. MR. SMURL: Thanks, Mr. Schuster . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I got a couple. So when I read the article about the Art House marquee being too bright and for the city to say dim it during the day and shut it off at night, I was appalled . This gentleman has done more for the city than most people. He makes an investment in the city and, you know, we should be -- and to say this might be a nuisance , we bring up nuisance properties for three years in a row and they're not address ed. But this is going to be referred to as a nuisance to some people because of the lights? This is the Electric City. I think that's no secret. Everybody knows that. And he should be applauded for all the work he's done and not a slap in the face. I just think it's ridiculous . Next up, so on March 4th we got a list of the demo -- the property is going to be on the demolition list for this year, this spring of 2024. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 With that said, a gentleman reached out to me on Monroe Avenue and told me that there was a house at 929 Monroe that was suppose d to be torn down for many years. So could we please inquire about that house, Mr. Voldenberg ? Maybe there was an asbestos inspection that we're not aware of or maybe it fell off the radar. But can we take a look at that or have them -- MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Report back to us. Thank you. All right. So for the past two weeks I brought up the ANZ Hotel, formally it was the Sheridan on Meadow Avenue, a lot of suspicious behavior . There's a lot going on, a lot of criminal activity . And I asked and inquired to make sure that since the property changed owners, was everything up to code, you know, were the inspections done, were fire inspections done, were the health inspections done. And we were told yes. But then after that I said, you know, could you please clarify if this is consider ed a nuisance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 property because in addition to the amount of police calls and arrests related to the violation s of the nuisance section or other city ordinances and the response that I got, which I'm glad to hear is this inquiry require s additional analysis from the proper department . So it's still being looked at. And that goes out to the people that have been asking me about it and are very concerned neighbor s. So at least we got that answer. Also last week I asked about the street signs that, you know, were made last year. We ran out of money. And then this year we got a windfall of $333,000. And I asked last week what is $333,000 get us with signs, how many, how much, installation , you know, is that a lot of money or is it not enough of money. And I asked about the contract . So what I got back was per contract it's from 2023 to 2026. So there's a contract with Mack Signs, the total price of the street sign installation project is $125,290. And the project ed completion date is September 1st, 2024. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 So can we get some clarification ? I mean, if we're getting 300 -- we got a grant for 333,000. And we're only utilizing 125,000 or 125 to 190, it still doesn't tell me how many signs we get out of that type of money or is -- so here I'm going to ask my question again. So what does $125,000 get us in the way of signs for this projected completion of September 1, 2024? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll find that out, sir. MR. MCANDREW : I mean, if there's remaining money, keep making signs because I know we only do so many a year. But now we're just -- we farmed it out so we don't have to rely on our own employees to make them, so just a little more clarity with that. And what else do I have? I believe -- oh, no, no, no -- so on Penn Avenue, I brought this up in caucus. So I got a phone call Friday. I believe it was -- no, Thursday I'm sorry, that the water company was doing this project on Penn Avenue, the block where all the restaurants are, the block where Studio RD is. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 And the merchant s there are like, whoa, what's going on here. And they went out to the water company and said what are you doing and they said we're putting up signs. The street's going to be blocked off for five days to a week, something like that and you'll have no water. And they're like wait a second. This is our livelihood . You know, restaurants can't operate without water for sanitary purposes . How do you do hair in a salon without water? And I guess the water company said to these residents -- and they said why don't you do it off hours? And they said that's too much overtime . So, you know, a company like this who is, you know, almost tripled our water bill in a year or will, to have that type of attitude and doing work in our city bothers me and it bothers these resident s -- merchants . So I brought it up in caucus. I also brought it up to some administration here in the building . And during caucus I asked Mr. Voldenberg to please contact the water company tomorrow .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 And let's have a little dialogue here because this is affecting people's livelihood s. And there should be some type of compromise . And there wasn't really much notice for these poor people that, you know, like I said, it's their livelihood . So we need to do something about that. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Lastly, we just missed one item, the 3000 block of Murphy Court off of Davis Street to be placed on -- to be repaired, patched , or whatever they have to do there. That was also (inaudible ). That is all, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.
