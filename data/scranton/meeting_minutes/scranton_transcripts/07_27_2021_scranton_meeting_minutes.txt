AGENDA FOR THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING HELD JULY 28, 2021. 3-I. MINUTES OF THE ETHICS BOARD MEETING HELD JUNE 9, 2021. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? I have one comment on 3-G, the overtime report, very, very concerning . We received an e-mail 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 from the City Controller that as of the July overtime report, the City is current ly at 90.7 percent of its budgeted overtime . There are a -- Controller Murray in his e-mails states that there are 12 more pay dates left in this year and ventures to say that the City will almost -- is very likely to exceed its overtime budget unless changes are implemented to curb the spending immediately . I would like Council to send correspondence to the Mayor and the Business Administrator asking for an explanation and what the plan is to curb this spending from here on out. Also, one of the things we discussed in caucus was that so far to date there have been 29 budget transfers , interdepartment al which does not have to come to Council for approval . However , that is concerning because of the high amount. I don't remember in my eight years on Council seeing that high of an amount this early in the year. Usually you'll see that at the end of the year or even spill into the next year. Anyone else on the question ? If not, received and filed. Do any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I do. Our friends at Friends of the Poor would like me to announce that if you missed the drivethrough food giveaways that the pantries are still open, the one on Jackson Street -- I'm sorry, Jackson Terrace, 148 Meridian Avenue, it's open Monday, Tuesday , Thursday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. And the Valley View Terrace building number 9 on 950 Pear Street, that is open Monday through Fridays , 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. And I would also like to wish assistant Fire Chief James Floryshak a very happy retirement . He finished his last shift this morning . Thank you for your dedication and service to the residents of our City. That's all I have. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, Lackawanna River Conservation Association will hold a cleanup of Leggetts Creek on Saturday , July 31st from 9 a.m. to noon. They're calling it Bio-Blitz. There's going to be some cleanup of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 greenway that connects McLain Park with the Dutch Gap Little League. And they're working with volunteers of Mary Mother of God Parish as well. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Anyone else? I have a few. First, as I mentioned last week -- it's been actually mentioned the last two weeks. There's a fundraiser to benefit Shane Conway and family, Saturday , July 31st, 2021, so this Saturday at the FOP Lodge, 46 Aston Mountain Road in Moosic from 3 to 7 p.m. There will be hamburgers , hotdogs , pasta, beer and soda. Adult tickets are $20. You pay $25 at the door. Youth from ages 10 to 20 are $10 and kids under 10 are free. Mr. Conway is our City Clerk, Frank Voldenberg 's son-in-law, good friend of mine, good friend of my family's. As I stated last week, his wife went to school with me in high school. And I hope that everybody in our community whether you are from Scranton or Lackawanna County could make it out to this benefit . It's very important . The one thing as I said last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 about Scrantonians and actually anyone from our area in Northeastern Pennsylvania is that when there is a family in need we step up to the plate. So again, I hope that everybody could make it out to that. One of the other things I wanted to mention , I talked to the DPW Director . And he wanted me state that there are several openings in the DPW. They are accepting applications for the fall and full time union rate position s; pack-master driver with a Class B CLD with no restrictions , an auto repair service technician with a focus diesel engines and part-time casual workers starting at $13.58. So you could go to the City's website and submit an application . Also, this will be our last Council meeting before the recess in August. I also have a -- one thing to say on our decision last week to rename the Central Scranton Express way after President Biden. I know that there are several people here tonight to speak on that. And I'd like to make a few things very clear. First of all, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 the Council under my direction formed a committee early last year to discuss and consider renaming a street after President Biden. We met several times as a committee and Leslie Collins who was head of Scranton Tomorrow was intricately involved in the process . The decision to rename both the express way and Spruce Street was publicized on the front page of the newspaper months ago. There were also several other articles about it as well and at least two editorials . City Council had three public meetings where we took comments from the public on the renaming legislation . These meeting s were advertised in the newspaper on several occasion s as is required by law. Also, after the committee was formed last February I updated the Council on numerous occasions on where we were in the process . Over the last three weeks only a handful of people came forward and expressed their opposition . I have spoken to numerous people around the City and business owners on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Spruce Street who are in favor of this decision . The Mayor, Council , and Scranton Tomorrow are committed to working hand in glove with the Spruce Street business owners to help with this transition and any inconveniences . I've stated that publically on several occasions and I spoke with the Mayor again about it early this afternoon . It's my belief that sometimes in order to achieve something (audio interruption .) His whole upbringing was about the values instilled in him that he learned here in the City of Scranton . And these values guided him throughout his entire life. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to capitalize on something good for our City. And that is what we did. Something that regardless of your political affiliation we could all be proud of. And as I've stated the decision has been made and it's final, period. Thank you. Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. GAUGHAN : And prior to Citizens 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Participation . Solicitor Hayes? ATTY. HAYES: I see there are several new -- speakers who are not regular speakers at Council . For the benefit of the stenographer who is recording everything that is said today, could you please state your name, spell your last name for her benefit and give your home address so that we have an appropriate record of your comments here tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. The first speaker is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , 101 Penn Avenue, Scranton , H-O-D-O-W-A-N-I-T-Z. I thank Mr. Donahue for updating me on the posting of the labor agreements on the website . I hope when we come back in September that that's a done deal. Next, did the City ever do a cost benefit analysis prior to renaming Spruce Street? If so, what is the projected cost to business owners, resident s and taxpayers . And is the City prepare d to compensate Spruce Street residents and business owners? And I'll take that answer in Fifth Order. Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Next, I encourage taxpayer s to start attending meetings of the City's Ethics Board. The board meets the third Wednesday of every month at 6 p.m. in the Governor 's room. This board's work is very important . It receives and disposes of allegations , violation of the Ethics Code. I attended the June and July meeting s. And I was relieved to see how seriously the board members took their duties. So come to these meeting s if you can. Your input is important . And finally , I want to say something about delinquent tax collections and Scranton 's 10 percent legal fee. I don't believe Scranton should be subject to a 10 percent legal fee when neighboring communities are charged only 1 percent . As I understand it, Scranton 's fee is dictated by a municipal act but the fee charged to other municipal ities is dictated by a real estate act. I would love to know the reasoning behind this. It may be legal, but it isn't fair. In my opinion , you should amend both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 acts so that everyone is charged the same fee. Having said that, you should know that I am not overly sympathetic to delinquent taxpayers . I understand that people sometimes deal with unexpected financial crises such as job losses, medical emergencies and so on. My own parents lost their home in 1963 to a mine cave. They did not have mine cave insurance -- very few people did. And our home was condemned on the spot. We lost everything . It took five years of legal wrangling before the City bought the property . Now, during that five-year period, my parents who were homeless continued to pay taxes and insurance on a condemned building . How did they do it? My father worked three jobs seven days a week. And we saved every penny. Why did they do it? It was the law. Today, however , people who can't pay their taxes in full can enter into a payment plan and avoid a lien or sheriff 's sale. They can also sell their property in favor of a less expensive residence , rent an apartment or apply for Section Eight housing . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Unfortunately , some people refuse to consider any of these options . And as a result, other taxpayers get stuck with their bill. How fair is that? The point is, we all have to live within our budgets . But we shouldn 't have to pay other people's bills. So if there is anyone out there who can't pay their taxes and is too proud or stubborn to enter a payment plan, call me. I have a box of Kleenex with your name on it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening, Council , Les Spindler , S-P-I-N-D-L-E-R, Bulwer Street, Scranton , City resident , homeowner . Now, last week I heard the owner of Scoops on Spruce complaining about it would be difficult to change the name. I think it's a very easy decision . Instead of having Scoops on Spruce, just make it Scoops. For the longest time I always thought that was the name of it anyway. Going by in the car, Scoops just jumps out at you. I never knew it was Scoops on Spruce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 until this controversy started . Name it Scoops. That solves the problem . And I think it's going to benefit the business in the long run, all the publicity that these places are getting , the people that watch these Council meetings , read it in the newspaper , on the news, all the publicity these businesses are getting . They're probably going to make out better in the long run because of this. Next thing, over the weekend I heard a commercial for Attorney Mastri asking all the small businesses to come here. He's a small business . Well, I don't consider an attorney 's office a small business -- my opinion . My daughter worked for a small business . She's a hair stylist and lost her job during the pandemic . I don't think Attorney Mastri ever lost his job and never lost a paycheck . My daughter was on unemployment until she got a new job which probably is a better one. She works at Alexander 's now on Washington . So if anybody needs a haircut, go see my daughter at Alexander 's. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Next thing, Friday I went to the ribbon cutting at the splash pad at Novembrino . And I met Director Tom Preambo from DPW there. Never met him before. He knew who I was, came and introduced himself . He thanked me for the kind words I said last week about getting the stop sign up on Dorothy Street so quickly . And I said, if somebody does a good job I'll compliment them. And he said that night when I first spoke about it, he watched the meeting back later that night. And he said the next -- Wednesday morning the sign was up. I said, wow, that's terrific . So he invited me down to DPW for a tour. He said just call the office and make an appointment . I said, yeah, Norma Jeffries who comes to the meetings , she went on that tour and she spoke very highly of it. I'm going to take him up on that. And he also introduced me to his assistant Cecilia who a -- I said, oh, that's a nice name. My four-month old granddaughter , that's her name. Lastly, I don't know if you any of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 you saw the paper today about the seven year autistic girl who was saved in Roaring Brook. Well, everybody again did a great job from Detective DeNaples to the rescue people. It's just my opinion , but I think Detective DeNaples deserves a proclamation . She went into that water up to her thigh she said and probably saved that girl's life. So I think Council should look into a proclamation for her. I think it's well deserving . And that's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time and see you in September as the song goes. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Next speaker is Bob Bolus. Excuse me. There's only one person allowed to speak at a time. Thank you. Excuse me, there's one person allowed at the podium at a time. MR. BOLUS: He's not at the podium. Go ahead. Do what you got to do. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Excuse me, I just have service process . That's all it is. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, you could serve someplace else. Please take a seat. Thanks. MR. BOLUS: What you were just served was a federal lawsuit -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. GAUGHAN : Oh -- oh, my God, I'm so scared. Kyle, hold me, please. MR. BOLUS: You don't have to worry about it -- MR. GAUGHAN : Believe me I'm not worried about anything with you. Go ahead. MR. BOLUS: I'm glad. You also received a petition to remove you from Council for your derogatory remarks. MR. GAUGHAN : I read it. I had a good laugh. MR. BOLUS: March -- MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, I had a good laugh. MR. BOLUS: You could play games with it. I'm a serious player. I will not accept, tolerate , allow you to insult me in the ways you did as -- let's see here, what did you want to call me an ignorant fool, weak-minded bully, disgusting , disgraceful comments spewed uneducated venom. These were all your comments . MR. GAUGHAN : All true. MR. BOLUS: Good. I'm glad you're standing by them. It's Council 's position that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 you violated -- this is the rules of Council which you went and violated . And I intend to make this matter personal publicly . I've submitted it to Council . It's up to Council to make the decision whether to retain you. MR. GAUGHAN : They have. I'm retained . Thank you. MR. BOLUS: Pardon? MR. GAUGHAN : I said we talked about it. I'm retained . Your letter went right in the garbage by the way. MR. BOLUS: So you're saying Council members -- MR. GAUGHAN : We talked about it individually and we all had a good laugh. Go ahead. MR. BOLUS: You're saying Council members have refused to remove you from Council on the violation of the Rules of Council that you implemented , correct ? MR. GAUGHAN : I didn't violate any Rules of Council . I could prove that you're an ignorant fool. All you have to do is replay all the YouTube clips. MR. BOLUS: I asked you a question . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 MR. GAUGHAN : And I gave you an answer, didn't I? MR. BOLUS: No, you're answering it -- is Council members refusing to honor the Rules of Council and remove you? That's a simple question . MR. GAUGHAN : No. MR. BOLUS: Okay. We will take it into the courtroom then. MR. GAUGHAN : I look forward to it. MR. BOLUS: It's not a problem . Mr. Hayes, you'll enjoy every minute of it. We filed an injunction to stop renaming the street after Biden. MR. GAUGHAN : That will get thrown out too. MR. BOLUS: And that's going to go forward . MR. GAUGHAN : I'm sure it will. MR. BOLUS: There are many people here that have been affected by what I say the incompetence of the City. It's the voice of the people that speak, not a handful of socialists that want to name a street and destroy everything they built over many, many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 years. The purpose of the injunction -- and I've been a business man in this community for over 52 years. How many people have you ever employed ? Any Council member? Yet, you want to do derogatory comment s to me but I've employed over the last year hundreds of people all through the country , not just in Scranton . Yet, you want to insult people. I raised an issue with Jessica . I simply asked that you identify yourself as a physical therapist -- MR. GAUGHAN : Excuse me. Excuse me. Address the Chair of the meeting, don't address individual members . MR. BOLUS: I'm speaking to a Council member -- MR. GAUGHAN : And I'm enforcing the Rules of Council , address the Chair of the meeting , not individual members . Thank you. MR. BOLUS: I'm asking Doctor -- MR. GAUGHAN : Address your comments to -- MR. BOLUS: Okay, Mr. Gaughan , let me ask you this. The Doctor's name is there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I'm asking you as the, Doctor, identify yourself -- MR. GAUGHAN : She's a physical therapist -- MR. BOLUS: I know she's a -- MR. GAUGHAN : She's a physical therapist . DR. ROTHCHILD : -- yes, I'm a physical therapist . My credentials are PTDP -- MR. BOLUS: She has the -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Doctor of physical therapy . MR. BOLUS: -- to call a doctor. I'm not objecting to that. What I'm telling you and asking you is identify that you're a physical therapist . It's a remarkable -- it's a credible profession . I go to physical therapists . But she wasn't on the front line with the MDs and doctors but she can't even give an injection , okay? And I'm asking you respect fully as a taxpayer in the City to identify yourself as -- out here as a physical therapist . It's as simple as that. DR. ROTHCHILD : I just did. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 MR. BOLUS: I believe you do by law and I'll bring that matter up. Well, this isn't over -- MR. GAUGHAN : Jeez, I'm shaking in my boots. MR. BOLUS: -- deposition -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Also, Council man Gaughan , I have worked with COVID-19 patients -- MR. GAUGHAN : Oh, I know that. ATTY. HAYES: I wouldn't give any credence to this. MR. GAUGHAN : He's a joke. Thank you. Good night. MR. BOLUS: We'll see you for your depositions in August. Enjoy the evening . MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is Tom Dailey. Tom Dailey. Thank you. MR. DAILEY: Council members , I'm a small business man -- ATTY. HAYES: Sir -- sir, for the benefit of -- a stenographer is recording everything here. MR. DAILEY: Thomas Dailey. ATTY. HAYES: Your home address ?1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 MR. DAILEY: 801 Clay Avenue, Scranton . ATTY. HAYES: Thank you. Go ahead. MR. DAILEY: I've been in business 51 and a half years. Not to be disrespect ful, that's probably longer that some of yous were even a twinkle in your mother and father's eyes. I'm very concerned about changing Spruce Street's name. Small businesses have a tough enough time as it is. First of all to get started , they need money. Either borrow it from their family, if they have savings they get it from that. If they don't have that they get it from remortgaging your house. You can't get startup money from a bank. The other thing is, when you start talking about small businesses you have three things to factor in. One is location . The second is recognition of service , name or product . And then the third is servicing . The most important one of all is location . People assimilate with location , XYZ corporation is doing business on Spruce Street. One of their clients says, oh, go to XYZ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 corporation business on Spruce Street. You change the name, there is no more Spruce Street. You guys are suppose d to be helping small business es, not defeating the purpose of small business . It's your civic duty to not change the name of Spruce Street. I have no disrespect for President Biden. He's my President as well he is yours. I look at it this way. I don't think he's done anything for us locally ; McDade yes, he did. Cartright, yes. I just don't see where you could reward something to someone that's only been in office six months. I don't care if you name it Eisenhower , Reagan, Obama. It still makes the same problem . These people have to adjust. Who is going to pay for all of the factors involved in changing your street? It's chaotic . And I think that you have a duty to small business which you should be support ing because that's the backbone of this country . You should be supporting small business , not (inaudible .) Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Next speaker is Richard Laurito . MR. LAURITO : Richard Laurito , 2805 South Webster Avenue, Scranton , Pennsylvania . First of all, I would like to thank City Council for voting in favor of renaming the Central Scranton Expressway and its direct continuation Spruce Street after our native son Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Now here has been my longstanding take on the state of the City of Scranton . In 1930, the City's population peaked at 143,000 residents . Coal was king here. And as the mines slowly closed, the population began its long decline . The University of Scranton is a great source of income for our City businesses but not really so much for the maintenance of the City itself. It is a tax exempt Jesuit school. The amount of taxable property they have bought up and made non taxable are staggering . Although assuming the population has dropped by almost 50 percent , we must still provide services basically for our less densely 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 populated municipality . The DPW must maintain the exact same amount of roads and bridges and must also resurface the same exact amount of roadways mileagewise . Our police force must patrol and respond to calls on the exact same amount of miles of streets . Our firefighters must do the same. Our refuse collectors must pick up waste on exactly the same amount of roads distance wise. All of this must be done with fairly close to one half the tax base that the City once had. As a little guy in the 60s my mom would load myself and my four older sibling s on a bus after dark just before Christmas . We would disembark on Lackawanna Avenue. It was like stepping out into the movie set of the it's a wonderful life. It was absolute pure magic. When I walk in Manhattan today I always think of those Christmas time forays into Central City. The streets were that busy. Music played everywhere , retailers decked out their storefronts with incredible displays . Christmas lights were everywhere . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 Maybe I'm suppose d to be using the word holiday instead of Christmas in the year 2021, but I have never been one to worry about being politically correct . I'm pretty much an old school kind of guy. I remember riding my bicycle down 81 between Davis Street and River Street just before it opened to traffic . The interstate system and the national park system are two of the greatest achievement s ever brought to the American people. That said, traffic and now commerce now basically bypass the City and its businesses . In 1968 the Viewmont Mall opened. In 1971 the Wyoming Valley Mall opened. And I remember the excitement that the accepting stores of the Wyoming Valley Mall itself brought to the resident s of Scranton . Our downtown was being eaten by those two malls and the ease at which the interstate system provide d from our (inaudible ) shopping excursions such as Reading , Allentown and Bethlehem. So here we are some 50 to 60 years later. We have become a distress ed city. For sure some of it was due to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 mismanagement. But the actual distress began with the coal mines closing , the interstates bypass (audio interruption ) City Council and a Mayor an opportunity to keep our wonderful City moving forward . I truly believe that they are doing wonderful work. And by no means -- I am by no means envious of any of them. But I must give them kudos for bringing transparency to Scranton 's government . We all know too well the political holds that have plagued our city in the past. So back to my first paragraph naming the Expressway and Spruce Street in honor of President Joseph R. Biden is going to be a huge boom to our City. There's a palpable hatred among our citizens over politics . The last time that it was this bad was during the civil war. Donald Trump brought hatred to the forefront of American politics once again. The people who oppose the renaming are overwhelming Trump sycophants . Donald Trump got blown out in the 2020 election because he was a pompous ass when this nation needed a thought ful and sincere leader to face down this pandemic .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 Joseph R. Biden, Jr., is exactly the man for the job. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. LAURITO : Let us all do what is right and in the very best interest of the City of Scranton . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a good night. Next speaker is John Heim. MR. HEIM: President Gaughan , I -- ATTY. HAYES: President Gaughan , I just want to remind everybody to refrain from personal insults and name calling during their comments . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. HEIM: John Heim, H-E-I-M, Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania . I'm the owner of 406-408 Spruce Street and Scoops on Spruce. I'm here to make sure the City Council knows that the 400 block of Spruce Street is on the National Historic al Register . And it was put there because of a lawsuit over the Steamtown Mall. The people that sued got a historical district in the City of Scranton and the block of 400 is part of that historic al district . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 When I renovated my building s on Spruce Street, I had to go in front of the historical commission . I was told how to renovate my building , what colors I could do. I had no choice in the matter. I had to follow their recommendation to get approval to do any work on the two buildings . I am now told with the name changing of the street, Spruce Street will be taken off the National Historic Register for the 400 block. And I'm also told the way to put it back on the National Historical Register is to have every building owner reapply to be put back on the National Historic Register . I'm here to tell City Council I will not reapply to put my two buildings back on because I want to be able to choose paint colors that I want to paint my building . I want to be able to choose the design of my sign for my building . So 406 and 408 Spruce Street when it is removed from the National Historical Register will not go back on. And I'm told that the group of people that sued the City to get this historical district now has standing to resue 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 the City. I hope you people looked into all the problems and causes of changing the name because what's going to happen now is there will be lawsuits filed. I, as a taxpayer for my buildings and my businesses in the City of Scranton , will now have to pay more money because someone didn't think about this from beginning to end of what causes changing of a street name would make. Thank you for your time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Dominic Mastri. ATTY. MASTRI: M-A-S-T-R-I, residential address Moscow, Pennsylvania ; business address 538 Spruce Street, Suite 402. Mr. Chairman , members of Council , Solicitor Hayes, good evening . I urge you to reconsider the renaming of Spruce Street. And I'm not here for political reasons . We have a President from Scranton . That needs and deserves recognition from the City. To me, that shows that the American dream is alive and well in Scranton . You could be born in Scranton and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 become the leader of the free world. That deserves recognition , whether or not you voted for President Biden. But as a business owner and most of my business es depend for marketing purposes on Google scores and search engine optimization . If there is a change in Spruce Street, there is going to be a change in my search engine optimization level and my Google score. And I understand that Council and perhaps the federal government will do what it can to assist small business owners. However , that's really something that I can't come to Council or come to whomever in a few years and say I have a downturn in business because that's something that's really hard to quantify . And four days ago I started a web - in an effort to help I started a website site and I started a Facebook group. Our Facebook group now has over 500 hundred members . And I think it's important to note that after the tumultuous 2020 election and especially some of the remarks that were made here tonight , that this is an issue that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 bringing Democrats and Republicans alike together and I don't think that Council or the Mayor should turn a blind eye to that. And I think that we should look for a better option to recognize President Biden's achievement . And that can be maybe just limiting it to the Central Scranton Expressway as we did with the Casey Highway and the McDade Expressway . So again, I urge Council to reconsider . I thank you for your time and attention tonight . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. ATTY. MASTRI: Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Next speaker is Tom Coyne. MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, 3244 Oak Avenue, Minooka . Members of Council , I bring this forward with heavy heart and a plea from the (inaudible .) In the last few weeks there's been a growing undertow of discord . We have reached a point where the desires of public and the desires of the ruling body have come to an impasse .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 The head of Council expressed opposition to the people speaking before the body. He took time in Fifth Order to chastise the public for daring to present opposed opinions . Timely or not, no matter how vehement the support, this attempt at chastising citizens for given rights is concerning . In the last year and a half I have directly comment ed on actions and inactions of Council in relation to the Mayor's office and the lack of accountability to duty of office. The health of our City's population by charter was given to City Council . The administration of health directive from Council was given to the Mayor. From this, the new position of healthcare coordinator should be under the direction of City Council and serve to coordinate between Council 's direction and the Mayor's duty to implement . During the 2020 pandemic , the Mayor was allowed fiat to create new directives without action or consultation of City Council . The Mayor was allowed to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 retroactively supply emergency orders and to continue them beyond expiration and reapply them by again backdating emergency extensions . Numerous times procedure for employment , position change or contract s were circumvented and allowed to be approve d with only rumbling . Recently there's been a call to re-evaluate the City Charter before this body. Many of the rules by Court are based on interpretation of the taxation ability from a 50-year-old charter now seem in conflict with the will of the people. This is what some consider overbroad expansion of powers granted from the people and believe the interpret ation of the intent needs to be resolved and clarified by a new citizens ' review. This action borne out of the discontent that large developers are ploys to reap the benefits of a decade of exemptions while the tax burden has been foisted to the individuals . Seniors and children of the City who by birth and burden suffer the impact now and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 the future by tax obligations through inheritance has fanned the flames of change. We have a Council who request s information from the Mayor on items that Council s table. And when the Mayor refuses to respond , or respond s in way to deflect and not directly reply, this body does not call the Mayor to appear before Council . It approves of the action and sends the rebuke that has no teeth. We have a Council who voted five to zero not to allow Mr. Deeley as IT Director because he is unqualified . And as expected to circumvent Council 's direct authority , he was immediately put into the technology -- Information Technology management position . With no director as the top occupied position , he's effectively the interim IT Director in direct conflict and opposition to this body's ruling. You reward this direct act of defiance by providing the Avero contract to perform the duty Mr. Deeley is unable to perform . The power of this City Council is the same as the US Congress , to control the purse strings. This is one of the powers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Council seems unwilling to take a firm grasp of. For those who oppose the renaming of Spruce Street, you have 30 days from the Mayor's signature or a pocket approval in 10 days. And the qualified voters of the City shall have the power to require reconsideration by the Council any adopted ordinance . Your chances here for a referendum , the time is running . The ball is in your court. On the verge of recess, I implore you to re-evaluate your stance on how this body performs and fails to perform the obligation to the City and the obligation to the population . I refer to the charter 's preamble and ask you to reflect it over the break. We, the people of the City of Scranton in adopting this Home Rule Charter recognize that government is competent only when those who compose it work as trustees of the people and a servant to the people. Good government must be responsive to their basic human needs. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Next speaker is Ron Ellman. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council , Ronnie, Ellman, 2609 North Main Avenue in Scranton . I'd like to congratulate Mr. Snedeker for another wonderful achieve ment. He just impresses me how every year the bicycle ride -- last year his attempt to do so. I know the City supports him so much. Let me tell you something . This is part of my 200 names I collected to run for a seat on Council . I have to next week to make up my mind or not weather I'm fit for it. But there isn't anybody from the City represented by you people. You know, there's an old adage in politics , you can't go against the will of the people. You continuously -- the Mayor continuously just -- it's like we're not out here. We don't count. I know I talked to a couple hundred people. And I didn't hear one person in favor of changing Spruce Street. The rest of them didn't care about the Express way. But you are just hell bent on this with the whole City divided. It must be like 60/40 or something listening to people in here. You know, this -- it's like hero worship for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Mr. Biden. And I didn't vote for him. But I'm not mad at him or nothing . The paper in 2016 said he left here as a child and didn't return for 50 years. Now all of a sudden, he's a frequent visitor in the paper now. One statement or the other is a deliberate lie. Either way, he's not deserving of all the problems created in this town over a name change. Isn't the expressway enough? You know, our Mayor is suppose d to represent every single man, woman, and child in this City. And she doesn't. She is completely leaning to the left here, I guess, I could say. I've lived here 50 years. I've lived in the same house over 25. I'm not some inexperienced opportunist from 3,000 away that bought herself a mayorship. I don't want a penny in donations , not one penny. I'll use my own funding to run if I continue . But you're not going to sit there and these people aren't going to sit out here and tell me you're not obligated . When you have $300,000 in donations , you're obligated . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Just like Mr. Courtright is obligated with $600,000 worth. That's why the eight colleges got 10 million dollars in the middle of people waiting in line for food. These colleges have endowment s they could have paid their bills with. Well, I hope everybody has a nice vacation and cools down. And I hope -- I hope you have a good lawyer. It could be worse, couldn't it? MR. GAUGHAN : It always could be worse. MR. ELLMAN: I don't know, that's a hard act to follow tonight . Well, you all have a nice month off. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Next speaker is Al Young. MR. YOUNG: Albert Young, Y-O-U-N-G, 1713 Wyoming Avenue, Scranton . My remarks here tonight are personal remarks . I am not picking on anybody politically . Good evening , Council . I guess it's my time to bug you again. It's been a while. I do have a few remarks at the present time. Last week, Bill, you had a dissertation on condemnation about different 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 items. And I texted Councilman Schuster about the situation . And the first item I have is condemnation , the garage at 1709 Wyoming Avenue. This has been condemned for over two years. The original condemnation sign is still on the garage. And it is dated 6/26/19. If it wasn't for the City Solicitor changing the easement language , it would have been taken care of. Shame on him because we're still dealing with the problem out there. Number two, Solicitor Hayes, I'm sorry. You're the only one in this group that did not receive a text from me this week because I don't have your e-mail address . Last -- let's see here. Council members should do something about the property at 1809 North Washington Avenue. This place is a disgrace . Over the last five years that I have been a member of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association , I know for a fact that this piece of property is on LIPS's radar. Councilman Schuster sent me a text this week to find out if it was on their radar and it was. Former president of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 association Mark Seitzinger made two requests . Former Council woman Attorney Mary Dempsey while she was sitting at the dais made a request . Attorney George Reihner is deceased , made a written request . And there is no reply as of yet in his files. I checked . And I have made a couple of requests myself as President of the Green Ridge Neighborhood Association . I think something should be done. And I don't care how it's done, when it's done but do it soon. I don't care -- we don't care who owns it. We don't care if the taxes are being paid or not. There is a situation here where if there is an owner, you have the option to repair it, sell it, or demolish it. My wife broke her shoulder because of the sidewalks there a number of years ago. Number three, Meadow Brook Creek stormwater , DEP finally stepped up to the plate after 50-plus years and started something . This spring we finally got a grant writer that knows how to write grants in this City. I understand that the grant is on its way. But I feel that because the DEP stepped up to the plate back in January and now 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 in June and the grant is finally coming to fruition , the City is moving in baby snail steps. The easement s and whatever else is needed I haven't heard of anything yet. Number four, the much discussed situation , Biden. The City blew it. Personal opinion , again, no politics on this end. I heard a lot of excuses for it and against . And I know first when it was first discussed , Wyoming Avenue was on the chopping block for renaming . I went and checked to see what it was going to cost me just to have my 401 situation turned over as far as the addresses . It was over $3,000. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Mr. Young. MR. YOUNG: -- I'm sorry. MR. GAUGHAN : That's okay. MR. YOUNG: I need a couple seconds more. I do have a request . Bill, I would ask the, Doctor, please when you're speaking in the microphone, please speak up. It's hard to hear you at home. I'm sorry. And thanks to Council . MR. GAUGHAN : Thanks. Have a good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 night, Al. Next speaker is Marie Schumacher . MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , S-C-H-U-M-A-C-H-E-R. First question I have is I came home tonight and planned to watch the caucus and it wasn't on. What are the rules as to when it is on ECTV and when it is off because when it's here we can't hear. And when so if you stay at home, then you miss it. MR. GAUGHAN : Yeah, if we have a guest like the Mayor was here and Larry West and Eileen Cipriani , the caucus is televised . Otherwise , the caucuses are more informational for the Council . They're open to the public. We just go over the agenda. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, then I suggest until you invest in a decent sound system where we could hear sitting in the first row, you continue having them on ECTV because it is impossible to hear. Moving on, how much longer is the Scranton Sewer Authority going to be -- I couldn't find anything in the minutes . I know they had a meeting . But do you know how many open items they still have before they could close that down because that would bring in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 some money to the City. MR. GAUGHAN : I agree. But it's all dependent on the satisfaction of the liens. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. GAUGHAN : It's all dependent on them as you stated, closing out the liens. When that process will be completed , I don't know. MS. SCHUMACHER : The easements you mean. MR. GAUGHAN : The easement s I mean. I'm sorry. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Well, could we find out? Don't they put in there -- the minutes of their meeting ? I know they had a meeting but I had a conflict so I didn't go. MR. GAUGHAN : We can request how many of them are left. But in terms of the process , I don't know who we can find out. MR. DONAHUE : I don't know the exact number. But the last time we got an update it was around 30 that are still out there. MS. SCHUMACHER : And what timeframe was that, months, weeks, years? MR. DONAHUE : Two weeks ago that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 there's 30 easements that are left. Those are out of the 38 that opted out of the class action. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. Now, I'd also like to ask what is the actual head count of people working in the City? MR. GAUGHAN : I'd have to look in the records . I don't want to give a wrong number. I don't know off the top of my head. MS. SCHUMACHER : How does it compare to what is in the budget? Are we over, under? It seems there's been a lot of switching around. You call this building and with very few exceptions do you get anything but leave a message and we'll call you back. Sometimes it happens and as I said, few exceptions . That is not serving the people. And I -- you know, it would be nice to be able to walk through this building and open a door and look and see if there is a person there quite frankly because I question how many are on the head count, how many work in this building at a desk and how many or were there or how many are still working from home? MR. GAUGHAN : We can get that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 information from the HR Department . MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes. Now, going through the -- just recent things in the paper, Wolf plans to require landfills to test more. A while back I suggested that we put some sensors in the leachate line going -- that goes through Green Ridge so we know when there is leachate going through it because I keep hearing rumors that there is some. Have we done that? And if not, why not? MR. GAUGHAN : That I don't know. We can look into that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Cognetti joins call for citizenship pass for immigrant s in the county illegally -- country illegally . During Fifth Order those who are willing to share your position on that, I would certainly appreciate hearing it. SLIBCO targets remote workers . We're going after more remote workers. And I don't think it's fair because you don't have a system to collect the local service tax as you do with the people -- the business es that are here. And I don't think that's fair. We talked about this a long time ago. Has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 anything been done? I mean, we keep bragging and patting on the back about how many of these people we have that are working out of town from here and living here. I don't think that's right. We got to find something that applies to everybody or it's wrong. And again, on one of the things tonight , it would have been nice if you have a map that is one that is readable and it has some streets on it so that you could tell where the area actually is. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : That exhaust s the sign-in sheet. Would anyone else like to address Council at this time? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , D-O-B-R-Z-Y-N. If you could pronounce it properly , you win five bucks. By the way I'm still running for dictator , world dictator . All righty. I wound up on the wrong page here. Oh, okay, well, as I was watching the news today, a letter every now and then 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 this fall instead of attending -- meeting . Okay. As far as the Spruce Street, I don't want to bang it around anymore. But please reconsider Spruce with Joe Biden Way as a compromise . It's good to compromise . I see a lot of people are -- have problems with it. And it's really -- we have a couple of people running for election this fall. And I don't want any Trump flunkies getting elected over Joe Biden Way. Can't afford them anymore. Now, here's my favorite one, of course, statewide on voting (inaudible .) In Fulton County they let these ya-yas play with the machines . The stop steal people or Maga people or QAnon people -- and that's who is in Arizona , by the way, QAnon people. And they believe in flying saucers and lizard people that live under the earth and rule everything . They'll find out when I get elected dictator . That's for sure. I'll show them. But anyway, these machines now are disenfranchised . They have to be rebought and paid for and recommissioned as a, you know, they're no longer legal. And the question in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 my mind is, could they even be replaced by fall? And if they get their nose into Lackawanna County possibly or somewhere like this, what would we do? Maybe they'll start playing around in October ? This is really ridiculous . Their whole new voting laws and the whole -- it's just a way and don't get fooled. It's not only for black people. If you're 70 years old and you could stand in line for 6 and a half hours because of the paltry way that the voting election is run in your state, that's just dandy. But white or black at 70 years old, I don't know if you could do that. A lot of people can't. And they might not even have the time. I used to vote at times in Susquehanna County at quarter to eight because that's what time I got home from my workday . So keep your eyes open. And I would appreciate it if you people would start to advocate for us much. You're public officials . Don't let somebody steal this country off of us. As far as the infrastructure and everything else, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 forget about it. It's going to get torn apart in two years just like they tore apart Obama Care and 60 votes against it. And the most important thing is that we can straighten it out in 2022 and 2024. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : So that is the most important part of everything . Thank you. Have a good evening. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. KERBER: My name is Ed Kerber, K-E-R-B-E-R. I am someone who works in a small business on Spruce Street. Attorney Dominic Mastri is my boss. One of the things that I do is I help him with the marketing . And one of my things that I -- MR. GAUGHAN : Sir, I'm sorry. Can you give -- do you live in the City of Scranton ? MR. KERBER: I do not live in the City but I do live in Clarks Summit. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, I'm sorry. Only City residents are allowed to speak at the meeting . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MR. KERBER: Only City residents can speak at a meeting ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. That's in our rules. MR. KERBER: Okay. I'm sorry for wasting my time. MR. GAUGHAN : No, I -- thank you. MR. KERBER: And I'm sure you'll not listed to me like you don't listen to the other people. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else from Scranton like to address Council ? Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you back there, Norma. Come on up. MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries . And I live at Colfax Avenue in Scranton . And I wasn't here last week. I guess I could say this that I was elected Assistant Secretary of the Lackawanna County NAACP. So I was installed as an officer last week. So that's why I wasn't here. So I wasn't able to give any input to the name change. So I know you read everything and that it's a closed deal but I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 hope not. And I just thought I would give my two cents' worth. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. MS. JEFFRIES : And as a resident of Scranton , I've been back in the City it's five years now. And I do enjoy walking down Spruce Street. And one of the things that we do is to go to the ice cream store, Scoops on Spruce and to get the ice cream to walk through downtown Scranton . And if you look up at the buildings , the architect ure work in Scranton on some of these buildings is just priceless . So I say all of that that as the summer and, you know, you're on a month's vacation . And I don't know if you do things or not. I just hope that when we return in September and that the City Council is getting to look at the -- this building and how it's going to be renovated and when we come down Mulberry Street, you know, you could see the spiral up there at the top. And, of course, it's in dire need of repair up there. So not only is the City Hall building such a great place and it's beautiful because of the architect ure and everything , but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 downtown is also beautiful with the architect ure. So I'm just hoping that as you go forward with changing the name of Spruce Street that it doesn't change or chase any of our buildings and any of our businesses out of the City. We don't need to lose any more revenue s from buildings moving out -- businesses moving out of the City. One other thing that I have been reading the back of the cover here and I would have bet money that this is changed , the rules of Council because I thought that I had read that you can't get into politics that you're not suppose d to give any kind of political involvement . And I've heard a lot of that over the last few weeks about the Republican party this or the Republican party that. And I just didn't think that that was part of our rules and regulation s of Council . So have these changed at all, the rules? And if they have, I just think that Council needs to look at some of these guidelines on the back and what are the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 guidelines of Council and that they need to pull the reins in on some of the political things that are said that I've noticed over the last few weeks. So, you know, enjoy your summer vacation . I've enjoyed mine as I venture out into doing other things here in the City. And I wish you all well. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you very much. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. NEWCOMER : Hi, my name is Charles Newcomer . I live at 414 Adams Avenue. And I have some ideas for the area of Dickson City. I would like to do (inaudible ) animals and alcohol . I think there's a definite need for that. Foundation where you could help the newest people out when they -- you have like fire houses and, you know, people that are losing homes. This foundation would (inaudible ) little kids that, you know, would have hepatitis . It could help out with that. I think there should be an Ikea in the Dickson City mall -- in Dickson City. There should be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 a Hooters in the Steamtown Mall, a PF Chang's -- across from Adams Avenue. There should be (inaudible ) separate bartenders . There should be a jacuzzi club in Scranton -- take out. We should be able to wear in America . Sheetz where the old (inaudible ) I hope schools will sell Jolly Ranchers . I think they should be -- I think there should be recycle bins in the complexes -- public complexes . I think there should be cash cab type thing was a game show like the game show that was on whatever . (Inaudible ) and freedom because they're not picking you up to go to the hospital . I think there should be a Dickson City gym, an internet cafe in the Steamtown mall, in the Viewmont Mall. There should be MR4s in every hospital possible . There should be gondolas . (Inaudible ) -- is not picking me up probably because (inaudible ) there was an advocate . Scranton McCarthy is not picking me up. A bunch of lawsuits (inaudible ) left in my food. Advocacy Alliance is not giving me my full checks -- bank fraud, bars are kicking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 me out. (Inaudible ) people are saying I'm blind -- going blind when they are doing my profiles on Facebook . The post office is not deliver ing my mail. (Inaudible ) Scranton Counseling (inaudible ) lawsuit . It's like 2.4 -- it's outrageous . I need help with that. And that's it. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Okay, thank you. Have a good night. Would anyone else like to address Council tonight ? Frank, thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. GAUGHAN : Okay. Councilman Schuster , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. SCHUSTER : No, nothing at this time. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Councilman McAndrew , any motions or comments tonight ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I have a couple comments . So yesterday -- I know, Mr. Gaughan , you've been also in contact with these resident s. But I promise d I would bring up their issue and try to get some more feedback for them because they're not satisfied . So yesterday I met with residents at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 812-814 Clearview Street. About a month ago a garbage truck was in their neighborhood and a hydraulic fuel -- or the hose exploded and started spraying all over these properties . So one of the resident 's roof was hit with it. They have a lot of dead grass, eroding asphalt , cars were affected by it. And I was up there. And you could still smell it. And it's still visible . So my understanding is that the City said it's resolved . Obviously it's not resolved . It was power washed and degreased only. And then there was one little sewer drain that was cleaned out. But every time it rains, all this comes back up out of the soil. It's like an oil slick. I saw pictures . I was there yesterday . You could smell it. Birds are swimming in this. If this is -- you know, they were told that, you know, there is only so many gallons so it's not consider ed a spill. This is considered a spill to me. So I promised , you know, that we would take a look at this. I know you had some more conversation with the City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 But these residents have not had the same communication that you have. So I urge you that, you know, let's get a hold of these people because they are not getting anywhere with regards to calling the City and having this all satisfied . What else? Let me see. There is still an odor present . I was there. It's horrible . I could smell it. You could see it. So if, Mr. Gaughan and Mr. Voldenberg , I know we had a little discussion tonight . So let's please reach out to the people that -- whatever the department that told me that this is resolve d because evidently it's not. And, I guess, you know, an insurance company is going to get involved . So please let's follow up on this for these residents . All right. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Sure. And on that point, I did meet with the resident s and I did follow up with the HR Director . What happened is a hydraulic hose had broken off from a DPW truck and had sprayed hydraulic fluid over the houses and on their property . I met with the neighbors out there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 One gentleman on the corner had documented everything . I got -- immediately we sent a letter to the DPW Director . I got in touch with Mr. Preambo who called me back immediately . And they did go out and they did do the best that they can. At this point because it was an accident , the DPW Director had informed me that they have to go through the HR Department to file the -- file a form and it has to go through the City's insurance company since it was an accident . At that point from what I'm told from the HR Department and Mr. Preambo , an adjuster or a gentleman from the insurance company would come out and assess the damages and they would take it from there. I did speak to a member of the HR Department . And she informed me of the process . And then I was told that the neighbors were in touch with the HR Department . If there needs to be additional followup , we will do that. Dr. Rothchild , any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a few comments . We spoke about this in caucus. But 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 I wanted to update the public that yesterday I did do a walk along with John Eastman and Larry from the LIPS Department , Licensing and Inspections and Permits . And that was on Harrison Avenue. We walked up and down Harrison for about an hour and reviewed several of the properties along each block that there were issues with, a lot of quality of life problems with overgrown bushes and grass and things that were blocking the sidewalks . So there were actually a few times that we needed to step off of the sidewalk and walk into the street. And that is like a huge safety hazard. I know I wouldn't -- I wouldn't walk down Harrison Avenue with my baby in the stroller because of how hazardous it is. And I want other people to be able do that and to feel safe. Also, the amount of vehicles illegally parked which was not necessarily a LIPS matter but any problems that were not -- we are forwarding along to the appropriate departments to have taken care of. But it was a great opportunity to have a discussion with them on what we may need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 to change in the City, what policies we can change or ordinance s that could be introduced to help with the enforcement of the issues because right now with the process of issuing the quality of life tickets -- well, first, they'll get a letter and then they would get ticketed . They could receive another ticket and it could go to the magistrate from there. But someone may choose to clean up their property once or cut the grass once and then there is nothing that the magistrate can do about it. And then they just let it happen again which is really problematic . And there is also not a great way of tracking when properties are sold and there is that turnover -- the properties that there have already been issues with. So there is quite a few things to work on with that. And I was also surprised that several of the properties that were identified along that road were owned by the land bank. So Mr. Voldenberg was able to obtain a copy of the land bank owned properties throughout the City. And we plan on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 correspond ing with them to have those properties address ed because the land bank needs to be taking care of that. Unfortunately when properties are demolished or if the City or the land bank takes over them, we need to be following through with maintaining those properties and not add to the blighted neighborhood s. And at least one area was also suppose d to be maintained by PennDOT . So we'll be reaching out to them. That's right after the bridge where they knocked down some houses in order to build the new Harrison Avenue bridge. There's very overgrown weeds all along there. And it's just -- it's not nice to drive into the City and to drive up and down that road every day and to see that or to have people visiting our area going up to Nay Aug Park and to see the blight that we have in our City. So I am fully committed to working together with our City departments on that as well as the blight in our other neighborhood s which I've been a part of in the past. I did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 ask about the committee . There was suppose d to be a code enforcement committee getting started . And I am on the committee for the building permits . But I was informed that once they wrap up with that committee , then they'll begin the code enforcement committee . There was a blight task force that was started last year that I'll also request an update on how that's coming along. But I haven't received any recommendation s for, you know, ordinances or things that we could bring through Council on that as of yet. But I'm looking to be as proactive as possible . So that's all on that. And there was just one thing I wanted to respond to in terms of Mr. Bolus's comment s during Citizens Participation . I'm really not sure why my profession is a topic of conversation here. I think it may have to do with something of me being a woman and having a doctorate , which is I guess is unbelievable for some. None of the other Council member's degrees or profession s have been question ed in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 my time being here on Council . That's because they're not relevant to City business unless there was a reason to abstain from a vote or if there is a conflict of interest . I never present ed myself as a medical doctor. That would be fraud because I'm not one. But I do have a degree, a Doctorate of Physical Therapy from the University of Scranton . And I know it could be confusing to some, but since 1996 there have been education al program s for PTs to receive their doctorates . And in 2016 -- accredited program s were required to be doctorate . So it's not -- it's not anything new. If anyone is interest ed in the scope of practice for physical therapists , I'm happy to discuss that at another time or you can look at the APTA's website and find out more about that. And that's all I have to say on that matter. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Councilman Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly , I did get a couple complaints regarding quality 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 of life that I'll be passing along to Licensing and Inspections , one's at 403 Stafford Avenue. This has been ongoing for a couple years, a lot of overgrowth . They actually cut a tree down in the front yard and then never moved the tree so now it's all growing up around that. And then also 535 Gibbons Street, the garage in the back, the roof actually caved into the garage. And there's a bunch of critter s and stuff living back there. And I've got a bunch of complaint s about that one and also, a couple complaints about overgrowth onto roadways specifically on East Mountain Road and also on Ash Street between Roaring Brook and Mark Avenue. So I'll be passing that along to DPW and hopefully they could get some of that trimmed back. Over the weekend , I had the first instance where I had to call Animal Control . I come to find out that the number on the website was not the correct number. So if anyone -- I did reach out to the IT Department today and hopefully we could get that fixed as soon as possible . But if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 anyone needs to call Animal Control , the correct number to call for the most immediate response is 570-780-1756. You know, I think we have to work through looking at our budget and how we deal with Animal Control and the resources we give them. It's not necessary all year. I think they need staff. But they do get inundated with calls between the months of June and August. But is something we're going to get into after the break. And that's all I have for tonight . Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg , 1452 West Locust Street, a gentleman reached out to me. This has been an ongoing issue. The DPW was out there last or the year before. There's issue with the degradation of the street and the neighbors want an update on what further action will be taken. The sidewalk is also caving in. So if you can check on that I would appreciate it. I was informed that there -- DPW has been working on Leach Creek. As we know it's been 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 in Third Order several times, the back and forth between the Council and DEP and the DPW. And I do want to thank Mr. Preambo and the DPW for their quick action. I really have been impressed with how they can make a -- what is a really bad situation manageable and at least try to fix a situation and address it. So I do know that there was DPW workers and equipment out there today and they were working on it. So I want to thank them for that. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY -- FOR ADOPTION -- RESOLUTION NO. 188 2021 -- AUTHORIZING THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO ACCEPT A GRANT FROM THE MOSES TAYLOR FOUNDATION . THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO SUPPORT THE CITY'S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF THE PEOPLE OF NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA . MR. GAUGHAN : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety? MR. MCANDREW : As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Safety, I recommend final vote of Item 7-E. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. GAUGHAN : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : I'll go first. First of all, it's unfortunate -- I don't want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 vote against a grant. But it's unfortunate that the grant and the healthcare coordinator is under one resolution because the grant is a generous grant given by Moses Taylor Hospital . But the Mayor decided what she wanted to do with it. So I have a problem how it's being used. That's the only problem . So because I believe it's, you know, having a health coordinator is going to be a duplication of services with the upcoming development of the Lackawanna County Health Department that they're working on now. Also the health coordinator is a private contractor . So this position was never put out to bid. So I have a problem with that. This is non bid. And there's no more emergency declarations . So this should have been put out to bid. Like I said, the money I think would be better spent, you know, instead of education awareness I'm all about that. But I think the money would be better spent towards the mental health and homeless ness issues that were brought forth from the pandemic instead of the education and awareness piece that could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 possibly -- or probably be done in kind by the three big hospital s in Scranton that already serve our community . So that is the reason I'll be voting no tonight . MR. SCHUSTER : So also on the question , at this point in time it seems that this position has already been spelled out from the monies in the grant. I made several statements on this matter over the last few meetings including funding after the third year, including a residence waiver, interviewing and filling this position . And I do feel it would be a duplication of service s. I feel it would be a better position for the county. And although it does seem nice, I don't believe it's in the City's purview . MR. GAUGHAN : Thank you. On the question , I'm going to be voting yes for this grant. And I just want to state a few things I think we should remember . First of all, this is a grant. It does not affect the City's bottom line in any way, shape, or form. If we were all to reject this, we'd basically be taking money in my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 opinion and throwing it right down the toilet and flushing it. Second, we're still in the middle of a very serious pandemic . Anybody who's paying attention to the news knows now with the rise of the Delta variant and some people's unwilling ness to get life saving vaccines because of so much misinformation , it would be foolish for the City to not want the advice and guidance of an epidemiologist . We could wait for the county but we don't know how long the creation of that department is going to take. And as we enter the fall and winter months, this whole thing could not come at a more crucial time in my opinion because of the nature of the pandemic and what might lie ahead. As someone stated tonight , who knows, we may be wearing masks again in Pennsylvania . And they are already starting some places around the country . So I will be voting yes for this. The other thing I wanted to mention too is, in my understanding that, you know, the Moses Taylor Foundation did not approach 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 the City. The City -- the Mayor approached the foundation . So it's not like they just came to us and wanted to throw money at us. This was an active effort on behalf of the Mayor and her administration . And I'm going to vote for it. I think it's important . DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I'll also be voting in support of this piece of legislation . I believe that it will be beneficial for the City to have a public health coordinator and not just because of the obvious and what we've gone through with the pandemic this year. But I think there are many issues that this person will be able to address for the City. And it's not just because I'm in health care myself which has been made obvious tonight . I truly think that we don't need to wait for someone else to do this work and especially when we have a grant and the money to do so. I think that it will be a way of spending this grant money well. And I look forward to speaking more with Dr. Saxena and getting to know her and looking forward to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 work that she does for the City. Thank you. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just briefly , I also believe that, you know, a health department is the purview of the county. But given this grant, I think this is a bridge from Point A to Point B. That county health department won't be set up in the next year. It's going to take some time. So this is a bridge. We're not guaranteed the full years of the money. There is an approval process every year from the Moses Taylor Foundation where the health coordinator has to meet certain metrics moving forward . So at the same time it is a grant but it is a bridge until we get a county health department . So for that reason I'll be voting yes. MR. GAUGHAN : Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please.
