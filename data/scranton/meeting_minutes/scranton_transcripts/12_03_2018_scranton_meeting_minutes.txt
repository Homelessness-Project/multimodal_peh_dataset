CHECK RECEIVED FROM SINGLE TAX OFFICE IN THE AMOUNT OF $310,491.81 WHICH REPRESENTS PAYMENT OF AMUSEMENT TAX, 3RD QUARTER FROM LIVE NATION WORLDWIDE , INC. MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments ? If not, received and filed. MS. REED: 3-B. SHARED SERVICES COMMITTEE REPORT DATED NOVEMBER 27, 2018. MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, just one comment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 on this. I just want to read the report -- it's only one page, this came out of the shared services committee that was formed several months ago. The members of the committee were myself, Councilman Donahue , Katie Gilmartin and Paige Cognetti from the school board and I just want to read what the initial report says. "Over the past several months, members of Scranton City Council and the Scranton School Board have met to discuss services that could potentially be shared between the city and the district . The shared services committee comprised of City Councilman Kyle Donahue and Bill Gaughan and school directors Paige Cognetti and Katie Gilmartin . It establishes a list of areas of focus and called on administrators from the city and the district to share them input. In addition to the goal of realizing cost savings to benefit Scranton taxpayers , the group endeavors to increase efficiencies , improve productivity and convey a collaborative spirit between the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 city and the district . The entities are interdependent . The outlook of one cannot improve if the other is trending in the opposite direction . The following list reflects issues discussed and areas identified as potential opportunities for collaboration . The committee will continue to work with city and district administrators , prioritize these items, define plans and assess possibly savings . Under finance we discuss delinquent tax collection , payroll tax conversion , real estate tax discount period, the ten-year citywide LERTA for improvement s in new construction --" which is obviously on our agenda tonight and I think at our last school board meeting they actually did discuss this. I think it's going to be on a future agenda at the school board. "Property tax exemptions and the HUP test. Under purchasing , gas procure ment cards, health care, pool supplies , chemicals , etcetera , printer and copier services and maintenance , technology . Under operation s, crosswalk safety, pothole repair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 and recycling , and under fundraising and community development complete Count Census Committee , Electric City Shock soccer field project and grant writing services ." And I do want to thank all of the department heads from the city and the department heads from the school district who took the time over this past summer to meet with us with this committe e. A lot of great ideas were shared. We kind of whittled them down to the list that I just read. This could expand, it could get smaller than that. I won't expand on each one specifically , because I don't want to take up too much time but, again, and then we met with Mayor Courtright and the superintendent Dr. Kirjan and it went really well. I think there is a commitment from both the city and the school district , an actual commitment to engage in shared services and I'm hopeful for the future and that we will actually see cost savings in 2019 and 2020. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : I would just like to add to that that, you know, I think at some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 point the relationship between the city and the school district became extremely strained and I think this was the first step in the process to start building trust so we sort of concentrated on the low end route for lack of a better term at first in order to start building a better relationship between the two bodies. MR. ROGAN: If there are no other comments , it's received and filed. MS. REED: 3-C. AGENDA FOR THE HOUSING APPEALS REVIEW BOARD MEETING HELD NOVEMBER 29, 2018. MR. ROGAN: Are there any comments ? If not, received and filed. Do any council members have announcements to make? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, I have two. I announce this every year, it's a very good benefit and it was called Friends of Shannon McDonough "Splashing with Compassion ." They had their inaugural polar plunge in 2014. Since then, Friend of Shannon McDonough has donated to over 33 young individuals battling cancer right here in northeast 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Pennsylvania . They are going to hold their sixth annual polar plunge on Saturday , January 26, 2019, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Montage Mountain in Scranton , PA. They are calling on caring businesses and individuals alike to support their community event. You can visit www.Facebook .com/ friends ofshannonmcdonough if you are interested in learning more about this event. Also, received an announcement today about a winter coat drive at Tripps Park Elementary School and it reads, "Did you know there are almost 600,000 homeless people in the United States? Did you know 15,000 of them live in Pennsylvania ? Did you know homelessness exists in Scranton ? Did you know even some of our friends at Isaac Tripp Elementary school are in need? My name is Brennan . I am a third grade student at Issac Tripp Elementary School. I recently saw many homeless people struggling to stay warm on a cold day. I realize that not just homeless people need 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 our help but a lot of people in our neighbor hoods do, too. My goal is to collect 50 winter items to donate to babies, children , teenagers and adults all over Scranton . Please help me help those in need by donating gently used winter coats, hats, gloves, scarves and blankets. Thank you for the sharing the warmth. Donations are going to be collected for this drive throughout the month of December . All sizes are needed and you can place any donations inside the box near the main entrance of Tripp Park Elementary School. MR. ROGAN: This evening 's council meeting will be our last meeting for 2018. Historically when the budget is passed council recesses for the remainder of the year. Meetings are expected to resume on Monday, January 7. However , if something comes up that requires legislative action council can schedule a special meeting . And one last reminder that bagged leaves will be collect ed next week, the week of December 10 instead of newspaper s. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Please bag your leaves and leave them out on your scheduled recycling day for DPW to pick up. Newspapers will not be picked up this week. It will be dedicated to leave pickup only. MS. REED: FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS ' PARTICIPATION . (The following speakers offered public comment as follows : John Litwinsky spoke on city business . Les Spindler spoke on agenda items and city business . Joan Hodowanitz spoke on agenda items and city business . Lee Morgan spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Ron Ellman spoke on matters of general concern . Marie Schumacher spoke on agenda items and city business . Dave Dobrzyn spoke on city business and matters of general concern . Jay Walsh spoke on matters of general concern .) MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS. MR. ROGAN: Mr. Perry, any motions or comments ? MR. PERRY: Yeah, a couple of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 comments . The hill section parking has come up the last couple of weeks and we did speak a little bit about it last week. Chief Graziano got back to us, as I said. I have also spoken personally with the police officers and some of the enforcement people in that area so that problem is going to be taken care of. There will be extra ticketing going on, extra care going on to those dangerous intersections . Also, as far as the budget goes, I want to thank PEL, the Pennsylvania Economy League, for coming in today. We asked them into our caucus. They are the overseer of our finances since we went into Act 47 and they were very pleased with our budget. This is the third year in a row that we have no tax increase s and we were on a plan to exit our Act 47 in three years. They made the note of it. I believe they even made a note that we are a year ahead of schedule as far exiting that. We are exactly where we should be if not a little ahead. They are looking for as far as the budget goes is the city financial ly stable and could we write a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 budget that at the end of the year makes sense and they go back, they during our caucus today they had information from '16, '17 and current information from '18 in our 2019 projection s and they were pleased with all of the numbers that they have as I am. I'm proud of our budget for no tax increase s and also getting our bills paid. It's one thing not to increase taxes, it's another thing to put off things that need to get done and I think you have a seen a lot of improvements . We have done a great job in our city with the grants and getting money from state and federal agencies . We have also done a lot with liquid fuel money, getting roads paved. We've done a lot from our gambling money that is coming in, our lighting program that we did last year, so it's a feasible budget, it's workable budget and it's one that I'm proud to vote for today. Also, I just want go over -- my brother is a little -- he is not quite a public eye, he is kind of private , but I'm going to give a congratulation to my brother 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 and sister-in-law, they just brought a new baby into the world today so I want to congratulate them and say thank you and welcome aboard and, you know, I can't wait to go visit them tomorrow and I love you guys. Also, I just wanted to do a nice happy and safe holiday season to everybody , have a healthy new year and we'll see you in a couple of weeks. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Perry. Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Although , I do believe that the city's financial condition has improved considerably in recent years, I still believe we have a lot of work to do to make sure we exit Act 47 in the best possible position . In terms of economic development , I think we need to -- we need a more coherent vision which incorporates the work being done by Scranton Tomorrow , the Chamber , Scranton planning and neighbor hood and civic organizations along with city and state offices of economic development into one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 long-term economic development strategy . And also in terms of refuse, we did receive a report laying out alternative collection options. From my perspective those options were nonstarters. Realistically I believe the way we collect garbage isn't the main issue. What we do with garbage once it's collected is it's not economic ally or viably for the long-term health of this city or this region to keep dumping waste into a landfill without any viable alternatives . I also believe the situation is made worst by the fact that the owner the landfill also runs the recycling center. As a city, and more broadly as a region, we must begin to explore ways to dramatically increases recycling while exploring environmentally sound alternatives to the landfill . The era of Northeastern PA being a dumping ground for the Mid-Atlantic region must come to an end. And, also, on that note there are complaints in the last week or so and over the weekend of an odor in the Greenridge area that possibly originated at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 landfill so I urge anyone that has smelled anything out of the ordinary to call the State Department of Environmental Protection at 800-541-2050 to report any odors. And besides just wishing everyone a safe and healthy holiday season, that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Donahue . Mr. Evans, any motions or comments . MR. EVANS: Yes, thank you. First of all, I do agree with Ms. Schumacher about the Home Rule Study Commission , it's about time so hopefully in 2019 we could have that conversation . Also, I'd like to recognize the passing of George H.W. Bush. A true gentleman who lived an extraordinary life who taught us about civil discourse and decency in public life. He is a personal hero of mine. 41 will be missed. Our country and our world are a better place because of his service to this nation. Also, last year I had a good friend and a local developer give me a copy of this book right here it's called "Walkable City. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 How Downtown Can Save America , One Step At a Time." The author is a gentlemen by the name of Jeff Speck. It's a brilliant book on how to make our downtowns in our communities not only more walkable but more liveable . While reading this book, I had dozens of ah-ha moments throughout the book and moments where I felt, "Yes, we can do this" and "Yes, we have to do that." After reading the book, I bought six more copies and passed them out to people in the community that I felt would not only get the concepts of the book but would also become strong advocates for the type of change described in the book. But I felt we needed to do more so to continue to move the dialogue forward so for the last year I have been working on getting Jeff Speck, the author, here for a lecture and with the help of Scranton Tomorrow , Lackawanna County, the Greater Scranton Board of Realtors , the University of Scranton and many others it as happening . Jeff Speck will be at the University of Scranton at Lahey Hall on the second floor in the Kane Forum next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 Wednesday , December 12, at 6 p.m. Doors are open at 5:30 p.m. The public in invited and there is no charge for the lecture . The lecture is called "Towards a more walkable Scranton ." So I would ask anyone that is interested in walkability of the downtown the City of Scranton , urban planning , etcetera , to please try and attend. Again, this book is a must read for anyone that cares about sound planning principles and the future of our city. So as an early Christmas present to my colleagues I purchased a copy of the book "Walkable City" for each of them. They will be in our council office tomorrow for pickup. I also have an extra copy for an citizen that would like to read it, and we'll have a copy at our council office for anyone to sign out and return so other people can read it as well. The book also is available at the Scranton Public Library. So I hope to see everyone on the 12, please do your best to attend this very, very important discussion . That's all I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 have for now. MR. ROGAN: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, just two updates on issues that I have spoken about here in the last few weeks. The first one is Froud Avenue on East Mountain there was some serious runoff issues with water. Mr. Gallagher did report that the DPW is going to take a look at it possibly to try to divert the water and he thinks it takes direct water possibly from Fig Street which is a direct shot to Froud Avenue o, they are going to look at that so I appreciate it. Also, Mr. Flynn, who had reached out to me about Murphy Court in Minooka , the DPW said they had going to look at it in the spring to possibly build a curb up because the ground is too cold now and he had some more to the note so we will forward that along to Mr. Flynn. I appreciate the response from the DPW director . Also, I spoke to Mr. Young, Al Young, the other day. Mrs. Reed, if we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 could just a get an update from the Law Department , if possible , on who received the contract to do the work on the Meadowbrook Creek project . I was under the assumption that it was Kreiger Construction and I don't know if that has changed so if we can get an update on that I'd appreciate it. Also, just as Mr. Litwinsky , who spoke about the Keystone Rescue Mission, he left this file here, just looking through it, and he had sent me an e-mail with actual video clips from some of these incidents , it's amazing that this establishment is allowed to operate after all -- if you look at the police calls here from 2016 to 2018 as recently as November 22 it's 17 pages of police calls and incidents plus all of the different photos and videos that I have seen of it, so I think something really has to be done here. That's why I would encourage a meeting , if possible , and maybe council can facilitate this or -- Mr. Perry is chairman of the public safety, could facilitate a meeting between Mr. Litwinsky , the neighbors , Chief Graziano and the Licensing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 and Inspections Department because I think we have to look at how this establish ment is allowed to operate with all of those police calls. I'd also at this time like to make a motion that Scranton City Council place our updated Ethics Code legislation on it's January 7, 2019, agenda. MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes. I have been talking about this now for quite a few months. I would have liked to get this done before the end of the year but that wasn't possible , but I have been working extremely hard to update our Ethics Code, so I would like, and I make this motion so that I can get a commitment from everyone on council to put this on the agenda for the first meeting in January . MR. PERRY: Yes, on the question . I'll second that Mr. Gaughan worked extremely hard on this ethics bill and this legislation I'm in full support of passing it through and getting it on our agenda 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 January 7. I think it's important that in the City of Scranton , especially with local politics , that from time to time we need to update our ethics as times change and it's just more of a way to keep -- just to keep more transparent in days where, you know, not everybody is not as trusting as we want to be so let's get a nice even playing field, especially when it comes to contributions and, you know, other things in our city as far as pay-to-play or anything else that we have going on. It's an important thing and I support it. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: Yeah, on the question , one of the reasons it's important is, number one, our code is dated 1976 and the state went about superseding our code in 1998 by their legislation so effectively we have been without a code since 1998, almost 20 years, so we have all committed to getting this legislation on in January and I think we are all pretty much committed to getting it passed. We feel it's that important and if this is the first piece of legislation we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 pass in 2019 then it's going to start the year off on the right foot. MR. ROGAN: All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. PERRY: Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. EVANS: Aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. ROGAN: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. GAUGHAN : That's all I have. Thank you. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Quite a few things actually . A lot was brought up today. I guess I'll follow up pretty much where Councilman Gaughan left off regarding the rescue mission . I agree wholeheartedly with comments that were made, and I'm trying to be a sensitive as I can to what their goal is. I am all for giving somebody a hand up but not a handout. It appears , especially from these police reports , that there is drug use going on in the rescue mission , in and around the area. It may have started with the noble goal but there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 are a number of problems in the neighborhood . It's been outlined to us the police are there on a regular basis, two, three, four times a month so something certainly needs to be done. My preference on a first step of action would be to look to see how are nuisance property ordinance applies to nonprofits . It's not something that we typically encounter . Normally , our nuisance ordinance pertains to rental properties , landlords , bar owners, it's not every day when somebody comes with this type of a complaint against a nonprofit but there are certainly major issues that have to be addressed . Nobody should have to live like this in our city and it's also, as was mentioned by the speaker , right by our school. Scranton High School is right down the road. So, you know, I'd be happy to help anyway I can. I appreciate Mr. Perry taking the lead. I know he will do an excellent job on this and we will work with the neighbors to get some relief for them over there. Another item that was brought up at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 our public hearing and during the meeting was the ten-year LERTA and the litany of the questions about procedures regarding the LERTA. This is actually already in place just on a three-year version . So as far as how it's going to be implemented and structured , that's already been ongoing . This is just taking that three-year plan and turning it into a 10-year plan so I know there were some questions regarding condominium conversions and that's something that we put in the legislation to encourage landlords to go from big rental buildings to condos. When you condo a building out it does increase the value, it increases the tax base and you create homeowners. Condominium owners are homeowners just as you or I in a single family home. So more to come on the LERTA when we get there, but it is a very promising piece of legislation . A number of questions were also brought up regarding the budget and, again, I'll comment more on that when it comes up, but just to put it into perspective for those who have not seen a copy of it, the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 city budget is 135 pages with thousands of line items, so to go through the budget line by line there are certain things that people are not going to agree with or may not understand , but it has to be looked at on the whole. If you want to look through every line item there are going to be -- like I said, things that are going to be over budget, things that are under budget, but on the whole this is a very sound budget for the City of Scranton , and most importantly , and I can't belabor this enough, that it does not raise taxes for the third year in a row. Three years ago when taxes didn't go up some people just said there is an election coming up in two years. The next year, well, it's an election year. It's not an election year. Not one of us up here is running for office. Nobody in this building is running for office and the taxes are not going up and that's because the last series of budgets that were presented and passed by council were sound budgets , and many of the same objections and concerns that are being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 raised today were raised last year, the year before, the year before. It's one of those things when a document is so large, being 135 pages and thousands of line items, if you went to find something to complain about in it you can find it, but you have to overlook 90 good things to find the ten bad. I'll have to more to say on the budget when that comes up but just because that was brought up quite a bit from the podium tonight I wanted to address some of those issues. And, finally , I'd just like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas . A healthy , happy and safe new year. Thank you. MS. REED: 5-B. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. NO BUSINESS AT THIS TIME. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE - FOR ADOPTION - FILE OF THE COUNCIL NO. 38, 2018 - APPROPRIATING FUNDS FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT FOR THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF JANUARY , 2019 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 TO AND INCLUDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 BY THE ADOPTION OF THE GENERAL CITY OPERATING BUDGET FOR THE YEAR 2019. MR. ROGAN: What is the recommendation of the Chair for the Committee on Finance ? MR. EVANS: As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final passage of Item 7-A. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question . First of all, I just want to say that no budget is perfect and I certainly understand that. You will never find a budget that is 100 percent perfect or that makes everyone happy, and over the past few weeks I was not questioning the integrity of the budget process , and I'm certainly not trying to find fault with every little thing in the budget, I do think it's the responsibility of council to go through every single line item because that is our job. If we look at it just simply as a whole I don't think we are doing our due diligence , but what I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 trying to do is marry up the propose d budget with the bigger picture of recovery . In my review of the budget, I proposed several questions , a few pages long, and I believe that my questions are a part of a good budget process in which elected officials analyze , scrutinize and question everything . Again, not just to question things for the stake of finding something wrong, but because it is our duties as elected officials to do this, to analyze things, to scrutinize things, then and only then do I think you can have an actual Democratic process where if the administration propose s something we vet it, we analyze it, we scrutinize it and then I would feel comfortable certainly voting for it. I take this process extremely seriously . It's my belief, and I have said this before, that council is supposed to be a check and a balance on the strong mayor form of government that we have. I received responses to my questions from the administration that I posed a week and a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 half ago and I appreciated that and most of them were in detail, they were a few pages long, and I know that, you know, the business administrator and others are busy and they have great responsibilities in their position and I don't take it lightly when a council member asks dozens and dozens of questions and they take the time to respond to that. However , I did take issue with several questions that I did not feel were answered in full or where I felt the responses were not clear. Last Friday I sent a very clear follow-up to the administration and today I received a less than professional response from Mr. Bulzoni . In Mr. Bulzoni 's memorandum to Mrs. Reed and myself, I won't go through the whole thing, but he basically questions whether or not I prepared my own questions and my own correspondence to Mr. Bulzoni . He says, "Since one might question whether the council man prepared the communication dated November 30, 2018, which presents itself as an ethical dilemma in combination 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 with 11 pages of previously prepared responses , I find a further venture of some sufficient labor of questionable value." Then he paraphrases General George S. Patton, "I don't cover the same ground twice." You know, I have to say that I found this response to be extremely unprofessional , and I take Mr. Bulzoni as a very professional person. I'm not naive enough to believe that I'm a financial expert and I know all of the answers . I went to the University of Scranton for secondary education , I have a masters in that, and I also went for history and communication s. I don't have a degree in finance nor do I pretend to, but I do write my own questions . I do seek advice from friends of mine who are professional s in the field. I think anybody who does their due diligence would certainly do that. This is not an insult to me though, it's an insult to all off the people that I represent and that we all represent , the taxpayers of the City of Scranton . This 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 isn't council 's money, it's not the administration 's money, it's the taxpayer's money. Instead of ignoring , sidestepping or insulting the people of this city, the administration should just simply answer the questions that were posed. This is what is wrong with our government here in the City of Scranton and at some points over the past few years a lack of transparency . People are generally afraid, I think, to question things and when they are rebuffed they give up. I am not giving up. I will continue to question things even in the face of response that I feel are unprofessional . The mayor is asking us to approve this budget without being complete ly transparent , again, and I won't go through all of it, but I posed very specific questions that I believe needed verification based on the original correspondence that was sent and I did not get that. One of those was the net interest cost associated with the pension note that was passed by this council a few weeks ago. I asked had that borrowing been included in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 the 2019 budget. Mr. Bulzoni gave a response , I didn't find it sufficient and I didn't find it clear. I also brought this up to PEL in the caucus earlier tonight . It says that an amount of $576,027 is due in 2019 on June 1. I don't see that expense located anywhere in the 2019 budget. A cause of concern , my question was not answered . On the mercantile and business privilege tax I asked very specific questions about that, I did not get a response . We are saying that we are going to see a $400,000 increase in collection s from what was budgeted in 2018. The city give a response , and I appreciated that. It says that we have identified 600 accounts subject to a failure to file notice via the audit process , and then I'm told to draw my own conclusions relative to collection activity as warranted . I asked that -- or I commented that it appears as the city is using this information to budget a significant increase in business tax collection s, but 600 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 accounts failed to respond to audit letters . I don't believe that's enough to warrant a major increase in collections and we are already lagging behind, as far as I can tell, this year. So I asked just for clarification , "Has the Single Tax Office and/or Turnkey provided the city with an estimate of 2019 additional tax collection s. Please provide this information ." There is also additional questions I had on intergovernmental reimburse ments, overtime costs that concern me, new hires, an assistant Parks and Recreation director , project major in the Law Department and secretary in LIPS. I didn't -- there may just be a disagreement there but I didn't see the need for those positions . There is also an expenditure in here for the Keyser Valley pumping station . I asked questions about that months and months and months ago, very specific , never received a response . I asked again, didn't receive a sufficient response . So, again, this is why I'm asking these questions and for follow-up. If my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 questions were answered sufficiently , I'd probably be inclined to vote for a budget that does not have a tax increase . Certainly I think any budget with a tax increase is a good thing. You don't want to raise taxes on the people of this city. I'm simply doing my due diligence . I did not appreciate the response from Mr. Bulzoni and the administration questioning whether or not I came up with my own questions , and at this time I'd like to make a motion that we table this budget until these important questions are answered . MR. DONAHUE : Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : On the question . Just to note, we have until December 15 to pass a final budget. I don't see the rush in passing it tonight , especially in light of some of the issues that I have brought up. And let me just make another point, you know, I'm not asking these questions to belabor this budget, I'm not asking these questions , you know, to find something that's wrong in the budget, I'm literally 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 doing my due diligence . This is over a $100 million budget. I don't have the financial expertise to understand everything in it, which is it why I asked very specific questions . Didn't accuse anybody of doing anything , didn't say anything was wrong, all I did was state my concerns and ask questions and ask for clarification which is what I would assume any public official would do with a budget of this magnitude . So I just ask that we table this budget so that we can get clarification to these answers and, again, we have until December 15 to pass a final budget. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else on the question ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, just very quickly just to expand a little about on what Billy said, I don't think there is any reason whatsoever to not take our due diligence , take our time. We have the time to do it. There is still four weeks left in the year which we are getting paid for I believe we should do our due diligence on this. MR. ROGAN: Just a quick comment , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 regarding Mr. Bulzoni and responses that we have received back, I do know that there was a very lengthy list sent to Mr. Bulzoni from Mr. Gaughan that was replied and then a reply was sent to him, I think it was Friday, and he did send a reply back this morning , but I do want to comment that for anyone that's saying there is not enough time, Mr. Bulzoni has been at our disposal any time day or night and I believe , I know I have talked to him on weekends , I'm sure other members on the board have as well. I just think to drop another 50 questions the business day before we know the final vote is going to be is a delay tactic and is trying to create is reason to vote against what is very sound proposal. So I think we should have the final vote. The bottom line is to the taxpayers . Your taxes don't go up and your services are getting better, and this is really the third year in a row have had this debate about know tax increase budget so I'm proud to have voted for the last two and to vote for this one as well, and just a reminder for my 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 colleagues the vote is on the motion to table. Is there anyone else? MR. GAUGHAN : Right. With all due respect , Mr. Rogan, not to belabor this point, I was only given the responses to my initial questions last week so, of course, I need time to review them, and I responded in kind on Friday. I was not under the assumption that this would be council 's final meeting on the budget. I would have just assumed that if, you know, council people, myself, because I'm the only one apparently asking any questions up here, that had additional questions that we would table it because in my review of past councils I don't think any council in the last few years last ever ended on December 3. They have gone to December 10, December 15, even past December 15. Again, I'm simply asking for clarification on certain items that I asked about. I think they are important , not trying to belabor the point. I think this budget with no tax increase is a good thing but I think there are certain items in here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 that were not answered that I think are important , so that's why I made the motion. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. DONAHUE : I would like to just add to that, I did sit down with Mr. Bulzoni and also the mayor and they went through and answered my questions adequately and I just feel that each and every one of us should have that opportunity . MR. ROGAN: All those in favor of tabling , signify by saying aye. MR. GAUGHAN : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. MR. ROGAN: No? MR. EVANS: No. MR. PERRY: No. MR. ROGAN: No. The nos have it and it remains on the agenda. MR. EVANS: On the question , so now we're back to the original legislation , so first of all, I'd like to thank BA Bulzoni for coming in last week for our public caucus. Mr. Bulzoni has always been forthcoming and available to all of us for questions not only on their budget but on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 any matter within its purview . I appreciate Councilman Gaughan 's due diligence in asking some very important questions . They were very similar to many of the questions I had asked Mr. Bulzoni personally throughout several conversation s I had with him during and after the budget's formation , but it was good to get additional information in writing as support for the budget and it actually has lead me to support the budget even more actually . At this point, I'm confident and ready to support the budget. I continue to be comfortable with the openness and transparency of the BA Bulzoni 's budget process and, quite frankly , there is much heavy lifting to support a no tax increase budget but with that said it might be much more difficult a task to create contingency plans if we do not receive favorable rulings in any of the current lawsuits underway. I'm sure this city council would make themselves available for any discussion s related to putting a so-called Plan B together and working with the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 administration . The storm water issue has come up, it couldn't be any clear that the present mode of operation relative to storm water management is failing . The weather over the last year has crystalized that for all of us so we are all anxious to see the results of the storm water study by Arcadis to get moving on this front. There is presently $500,000 set aside from the sewer proceeds for seed money to get started with whatever direction the study seems appropriate so I don't see much of an impact on the 2019 budget relative to storm water funding . So tore now I feel the budget is solid, the assumptions and revenue projections and expenses are solid, so I would be voting "yes" for a no tax increase this evening . MR. ROGAN: Anyone else?

MR. ROGAN: As Chairperson for the Committee on Rules, I recommend final passage of Item 7-L. MR. PERRY: Second. MR. ROGAN: On the question ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, on the question , I just want to reiterate my comments from 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 last week. I know there is some opposition to this legislation . I look at it this way, you know, if we do nothing , you know, if we don't offer any incentive then we are just probably going to remain where we are now which I think is in neutral . Maybe in ten or 11 years or 20 years when we look back at this maybe it won't have the effect that we think it will, but when the Chamber of Commerce came in presented data from other communities that showed they did make a difference and it did move the needle in the right direction so that's the reason that I'll be voting for it. MR. ROGAN: Just to also reiterate some of what I mention ed, I strongly support this legislation and I really want to give you a thank you to the Chamber of Commerce , they have a representative here today. They really took the lead on this issue. One point I want to make that actually isn't just pertaining to this is much work is being done outside of what you see on television . There were many meetings between members of council and the Chamber 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 and I know they are actively working with the school district now, I'm going to be working with the county as well, but large pieces of legislation such as this take time. Unfortunately , it's not something that somebody has an idea and the next day it's implemented , we wish it was that easy, but I really want to thank the Chamber for their leadership on this issue. I'm hopeful that the school district will follow suit and pass this piece of legislation , the County as well, but it really is something that I'm very proud to support or get the economic engine in the city moving, hopefully encourage development not only in our downtown but also in our neighbor hoods, and I think this legislation along with the budget that we pass tonight really represents a turning point for the City of Scranton where we are going from being reactive addressing constant issues over and over again to being proactive and creating a program that is hopefully going to grow the city and grow our tax base which is the key component of this plan, so I'm 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 strongly in favor and hopefully in 10 years I won't be sitting here and none of us will be sitting here where we can look back and say this was a very good thing that got the city moving in the right direction . MR. PERRY: Yeah, on the question . I'm in favor of this. I know when we spoke with the Chamber I was really impressed with the presentation , the data from other cities and the fact that the Chamber is actually standing behind this, is going to help move this forward for us. This is our second swing at a LERTA we had. We actually have a three-year one in place now, it really didn't do anything so what I'm expecting out of this ten-year LERTA and what I'm expecting from us as a city is more updates to -- within city hall so we can get that out to the residents of the city to see how this is working for us, what is it doing to our permit revenue , what is it doing to new construction . If not on a monthly basis like Mrs. Schumacher said on a quarterly basis, but I don't want to see this program kind of start hot and fizzle out. I want to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 keep updates so we can keep abreast of this and communicate that up to everybody on what this program is actually doing for us. That's al. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? MR. EVANS: On the question . Excuse me, several weeks ago my comments on the subject I called this legislation bold and dramatic and for our city it certainly is because I know the status quo has brought you us to where we are today. Yes, we are better off financially than we were a few years ago, but growth is basically nonexistent and the numbers , especially our assessed valuation of real property , clearly shows that lack of the growth. If you do not grow your community or have a limited growth you cannot sustain government at the level that our citizens excepts and deserve s. When you do not grow, your city expense s will continue to rise and you have no alternative to raise taxes to balance your budget. The one-time revenue sources are gone, so now it's pretty simple. When 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 you are out of money, you better start thinking . This legislation is about thinking about tomorrow . With an influx of new construction , jobs will be created , wage taxes will be paid, home ownership will increase , building permits will be granted and additional commerce will be created , and then in year 11 when the LERTA properties go online, new property taxes will be received . Taxes in most cases that would have never happened without this incentive , and then again in your 12th and 13th and 14th and 15th and so on and so forth. Some day we may not need this type of legislation , but today is not that day. MR. ROGAN: Anyone else? Roll call, please? MS. CARRERA : Mr. Perry. MR. PERRY: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Donahue . MR.
