MS. REED: FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. ROGAN: Mr. Donahue , any motions or comments ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. Mrs. Schumacher , based off your revenue question I'd have to look into some of the other ones besides reassessment before I could give you an honest answer on where I feel on that, so I will do that and get back to you next week on that. And also for the Scranton bypass, I mean, we have been getting preliminary correspondence about them doing, you know, the engineering studies and stuff like that so until we see any studies that are done, I mean, I wouldn't be able to comment on that. And also one other request I gave to Mrs. Reed before the meeting was an explanation from the pave cut inspector as to why UGI was allowed to make a pave cut on Walnut Street in Pinebrook not even a week after PA American Water finished paving the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 street. According to our pave cut ordinance that shouldn 't have been allowed unless for an emergency , so I wanted some clarification on that. And I also asked for an update on Meadowbrook culvert project regarding the Young and Kennedy properties over in Greenridge so hopefully I can get that next week. Also, last week Councilman Perry brought up the issue of decriminalizing marijuana and I would just like to say that is something I absolutely be willing to support and I'm just hopeful that in the next few weeks we will be able to start that conversation by reaching out to different stakeholders, especially Chief Graziano and District Attorney Mark Powell to get their opinions on this issue. And that's all I have. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Evans, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. EVANS: A couple of comments . On Mr. Bulzoni , I fully expect the mayor to be sending down legislation to grant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 Mr. Bulzoni a residency waiver in the next few weeks so we'll see when that get here. On the Scranton bypass, I'm not a fan of bypasses to be perfectly honest with you. I think they detract and keep people away from the city, but I'd like to study that a little bit more, but generally speaking I'm not a fan of the concept of bypassing large metropolitan areas of the City of Scranton . On the question Ms. Schumacher made about reassessment , etcetera , let's see, as far as reassessment is concerned obviously it's a revenue neutral issue so I think that in terms of growth it will enhance our tax base because it will allow us for future growth and I think that's all we ever wanted, plus the fact that, I know Mr. Ellman will be thrilled to hear this, but the fact it will bring about tax equity and that's also a positive for the market. The market wants to see how that in order for the market to grow. As far the HUB test is concerned , certainly that would increase our tax base 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 because it would take good hard look at all of the properties that are currently nontaxable or tax exempt and treat them individually to find out once and for all should they be tax exempt. They have done it in Allegheny County, it worked out very well. It's a very simple procedure . They send out letters out for each and every parcel that is considered tax exempt and you ask them why it should be that way and continue to be that way and have them prove the case and at that point you have to go through an appeal process if this is disagreements , but I think that's certainly something that we built into the recovery plan and it's something that we should continue to foster and see if we can get that movement . I know it's mostly an administrative issue, but this councilman is the one that actually had it put into the recovery plan so I expect some action on that at some point. On decriminalization of marijuana , I know Councilman Perry discussed this last week, I have to give a couple of points that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 advocate s of decriminalization have been making for years. Number one, decriminal izing marijuana frees up police resources to devote to more serious crimes. Taxpayers spend between 7.5 billion and 10 billion dollars per week arresting and prosecuting individuals for marijuana violations . Almost 90 percent of those arrests are for possession only. Number two, decriminalization also does not lead to greater marijuana use. Government studies conclude that the decriminalization has had virtually no effect use on either marijuana use or beliefs and related attitude s about marijuana in people in states where this policy is currently in effect. And, three, criminal laws prohibiting marijuana possession do not deter it's use. Marijuana use remains constant despite high levels of enforcement and there is no detectable relationship between change to enforcement and levels of marijuana use over that time period. Now, those arguments certainly can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 be viewed as compelling, of course they are, but there always at least two sides to every issue. One can make the argument that this isn't even a local issue, but an issue for the state or federal government . However , as often the case, state and federal government seems to be a bastion for in action and local governments are left to act alone in many of these cases. So to that point, six cities in Pennsylvania have already adopted similar decriminal ization laws. They are Erie, York, Harrisburg , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia and State College and there are other cities currently considering adopting similar legislation . So while I'm not there with this issue, I do think it's time, as Councilman Perry said and Councilman Donahue said, to have a good hard look at this issue and maybe it's time to have an adult conversation and a full debate on the decriminal ization of marijuana in Scranton . So I concur with my council colleagues that maybe it's time to take that good hard look and maybe the city council 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 happens to be the vehicle for that by bringing all of the stakeholders for a work session or public caucus or even public meeting s of some sort. I think the next step is for all of us to discuss how or if we would like to proceed as a council and even as a community and go from there, so they are my comments on that issue and I don't think I have anything else left for tonight so that's it. MR. ROGAN: Thank you. Mr. Gaughan , any motions or comments ? MR. GAUGHAN : Yes, thank you. First, the street sweeper is scheduled to be in Tripps Park Dicken Street to Gibson Street May 14 to May 18. We discussed this a little bit in the caucus. I would like to know and inquire with the DPW it was mentioned that we have new street sweepers from the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority so what I would like to know is the last street sweeper that we were using where is that, if it was broken down, if we junked it, I would like clarification on that and what happened to that second 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 sweeper . Mr. Donahue mentioned this in his comments , the Walnut Street paving, it was on the news and I have received a couple of calls about it. UGI ripped up the street after it was already paved a week earlier from the water company so I would like to know from the city administration if UGI pulled the city pave cut permit I would like a copy of that and, you know, I know I have said this a lot of times before but it just seems to me that the city is really asleep at the wheel here while the utility companies continue to take us for a ride and I'd like to know who is protecting the infrastructure of the city. We go through this problem every single summer and every single spring and there just seems to be no communication and no one from the city administration who is actually holding the utility companies feet to the fire and protecting our infrastructure and our tax dollars . I also sent a letter to the Pennsylvania Economy League April 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 regarding proceeds from the sale of the Scranton Sewer Authority being deposited into the pension funds. If you remember , there was controversy there. I still have not received an answer on that so I would like Mrs. Reed to send a second letter to Mr. Cross from the Economy League and I would like an answer. They are our recovery coordinator and I think not answering that question is kind of a cop out. Also, you know, I asked for an update on our rentalordinance .com, this company that came in and was supposed to help the city with our rental registration ordinance and we did receive correspondence , a copy of correspondence from Mr. Moran, who is the head of rentalordinance .com to Mr. Bulzoni , the city business administrator , and it says, "Please be advised that CommunityChampions and rentalordinance .com have entered into a teaming agreement to assist the City of Scranton with the enforcement of the rental registration . Community Champion and rentalordinance .com would like to set up a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 status meeting with the City of Scranton on moving the rental registration project forward ." So I would like for Mr. Bulzoni or someone from the administration give some clarification on this. I mean, we entered into an agreement with them. I voted against it for a number of different reasons , but we entered an agreement with this company a year ago so I'd like to know what happened and what went on the past year and I did -- I think we sent a letter last week asking for several things to be answered , so I would like also a copy of this teaming agreement to see what that is all about. Also, I sent a letter to the city administration April 3 about Mr. Casciano , the former business administrator , and his new position in OECD. I sent several questions and I still have not received a response so we'll send a second response there and see if anybody is going to answer that. And that's all I have this week. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 MR. ROGAN: Thank you. A couple of items. First, Mr. Bolus brought up the containers and I did speak with him about it I do agree if the city is going to enforce different laws on pods or storage containers they do need to be applied consistently throughout the city. I do know there are a number of areas that have pods on the streets and it certainly could be a dangerous issue. Secondly , on the marijuana issue, which I missed an exciting meeting last week, I agree with my colleagues regarding medicinal marijuana and Commissioner Cummings ' comments , and they are going after Commissioner Cummings for lack of knowledge on that issue. I can certainly understand an opinion that's different than mine. As my colleagues do, I support medical marijuana in our city. I think it's a resource for those who are sick. I think it's a good business to bring into the City of Scranton to create jobs and we met with some of the firms that were interested in locating here, but what bothers me the most 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 is that Commissioner Cummings was completely ignorant of the fact that in the State of Pennsylvania medical marijuana was legalized quiet sometime ago. So that's what to me it the most disturbing that one of our elected officials didn't even know the status of the law, and not so much her position that I disagree with. Some of my colleagues also mentioned decriminal ization of recreational marijuana , I would not support recreational marijuana being legal in the City of Scranton . I would, however , like to hear our police chief's opinion on it and certainly his opinion would carry a lot of weight, but I do not think until, as Councilman Evans mentioned , federal and state law change that's something the city should pursue, so that's all have to say on that issue. Regarding the Scranton bypass, a number of people have brought this up to me over the last week or so. I know there is a petition going on online. Again, until we get more information on this bypass it's hard to give an opinion , but I do see both 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 sides of it. As anyone who lives in our area knows, traveling Interstate 81 from -- particularly from Wilkes-Barre to Scranton during rush hour is a disaster so I think a proposed bypass would certainly help with the traffic issues in our region. On the other hand, as Councilman Evans mentioned , bypassing the city may hurt local businesses that do stop off traveling through Scranton on Interstate 81 to grab a bite to eat or patronize one of our restaurants or gas stations , so there is definitely two sides to the issue, something that I know all of us will continue to look at as that issue moves forward , but I do think that are petitions out there and I've been contacted by a number of people about this. And, finally , a couple of months ago I mentioned part of Donald Trump's tax law that would possibly give opportunity zones to areas like the City of Scranton and this was published , this was ten days ago in the newspaper , "Governor designates opportunity zones in Scranton , Jessup and Blakely . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 Governor Tom Wolf designated , Jessup, Blakely and parts of Scranton as opportunity zones under a new federal tax incentive program designed to spur economic growth. The designations would stem from President Trump's tax cut program and will allow businesses or investors to delay or avoid paying capital gains taxes on investments made in opportunity zones. The program 's is to spur investors to direct eligible capital gains into new investments with these new zones." Now, the zone that is in the City of Scranton is around downtown Scranton , into the Hill section and into South Side. So I am happy to see that Scranton -- the governor was able to designate much of our area as the zone. I am disappointed that the Main Avenue corridor between West Scranton and North Scranton was not included on this map. I think would have been a prime area to be designated for these opportunities zones. I have had discuss ion with Bob Durkin, the head of the Chamber of Commerce 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 and the mayor on possibly coming up with some other local incentives to put out there not only through these zones but citywide to really spur development and get our economy going, but this is great news so I did want to mention this and hopefully , you know, we will start to see some additional development in those areas because it's certainly needed. And that is it all. MS. REED: 5-B.
