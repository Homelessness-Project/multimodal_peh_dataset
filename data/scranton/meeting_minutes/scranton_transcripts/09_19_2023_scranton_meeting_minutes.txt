CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT DATED SEPTEMBER 6, 2023 FOR CITY COUNCIL RECEIVED SEPTEMBER 12, 2023. 3.B. CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE MONTH ENDING AUGUST 31, 2023. 3.C. CODE ENFORCEMENT REPORT DATED 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 SEPTEMBER 12, 2023 FOR CITY COUNCIL RECEIVED SEPTEMBER 15, 2023. MR. KING: Are there any comments on Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have a few announcements . First, I wanted to mention this Thursday the NAACP will be opening up an office for their Lackawanna branch on Lackawanna Avenue at the Scranton Enterprise Center. I believe it's on the third floor. And that's going to be taking place from 4 to 7. They'll have be having an opening where people can visit. And on Saturday there are a couple events happening, the LRCA is having their annual River Fest. That's going to be down at Sweeney 's Beach. That will be taking place from 11 to 5. And also on Saturday , it's going to be Touch a Truck event at Nay Aug. And that will be from 11 to 3. That's hosted by the Junior League. And that's going to be $5 per person but two and under is free. And also, I just wanted to mention I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 know I wasn't able to make it, but I believe Councilman Smurl had attended . There were a couple of outreach events that the City hosted for the victims of the flooding that occurred two weekends ago and so Thursday and Friday they were both at two different location s. I believe those were pretty successful helping provide resources for those who had flooding to also help them report any damages and then I think there were additional ones this week. And I saw that the UNC and the Scranton Counseling Center were both involved with those two. So I was glad to see that. And that's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I do. So this Thursday Friends of the Poor will be having their monthly food pantry and clothing giveaway, so Thursday at Hilltop Manor from 11 to 1 and also at Holy Rosary from 2 to 3:30. And also I was happy to attend the West Scranton Fall Festival that was hosted at Clover Field in West Side this Saturday . I ran into a couple colleagues , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 Mr. Schuster and Mr. Gallagher . It was just great to see that field cleaned up and repurposed and being utilized for some events like that. Kids had a ball. Every kid there had a blast. My grandkids had a blast. It was very nice to see what they did with that -- with the field. And it was done by NeighborWorks . They did a great job. So that's all I have. DR. ROTHCHILD : I think we must have missed each other. I was at that too and I don't think I've seen my daughter have so much fun in a long time. They had everything there for the kids. So it was really great. MR. KING: Anyone else? The only thing I have I'm not sure who dropped this off here. Apparently there's going to be a book sale. They are -- all events are going to be held at the community room at Nay Aug Park. They are accepting donated books that could be dropped off September 21st and 22nd from 3 to 6 p.m., no encyclopedias or magazines . The book sale happens September 29th from 5 to 8 p.m., September 30th from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and October 1st from 11 a.m. to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 whenever. October 1st is fill a bag for $3 for books. All events will be in the community room at Nay Aug Park. And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . I was shocked , shocked I tell you when I read the paper yesterday and saw Dr. Rachna Saxena is now the County's Deputy Director of their Department of Health. Now, last time I saw she was the city's public health coordinator on a three-year contract dating back to June of 2021 making $120,000 a year from the Moses Taylor Foundation . To quote Mayor Cognetti the coordinator (inaudible ) as of June, 2021. We have somebody at the city who is spending her time all day every day at City Hall thinking about public health. So I said, how can this be? She can't be at City Hall all day every day and be the County's Deputy Director of their Department of Health. So I got on the website and I tried calling her phone number, 445-8010 and guess 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 what I got? This line is out of service . So I talked to Frank tonight . And it turns out that she resigned a week or two ago. But I haven't seen anything in the paper or any publicity , lots of publicity when she was hired. So anyway, it's good to know that she's not double dipping . Hopefully she'll do a good job for the County. You know how well she served us. With regard to Item 5-C, increasing the debt proceeds account and the Court awards account by $3,790,000.00. Now this is the outcome of the settlement of two lawsuits , one was a class action suit against Northeastern Revenue Services on the collection of delinquent refuse fees. And the other one was a lawsuit by Northeastern Revenue against the city for breach of contract . And these suits were settled for as you could guess, $3,790,000. Well, when you look at these items, the note says a third piece of legislation is being prepared requesting authorization to borrow money to restore funds used from the unassigned general fund balance . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 So I assume we're going to see another $3,790,000 loan coming up in the future. And this is followed by oh, yes, 5-D, the time sensitive payment of 2.5 million dollars by September 15 which was last Friday to settle a lawsuit that was the class action suit by Northeast Revenue . Now, I said to myself, gee, we must have been caught with our pants down or we didn't know this was coming that so we're trying to ratify a time-sensitive payment this late in the game. But guess what, the 2021 audit published on March 17th said, hey, you got to pay this money. So why are we doing this legislation tonight when we knew this was coming up on March 17th? That you could answer in Fifth Order. And what else? Oh, yes, let's see, 5 echo, borrowing $4,070,000 for capital project s. Tell me in Fifth Order what are the total costs, what is the rate of interest . Why was there no amortization table included in the backup? And, oh, yes, the firefighter 's contract 168 days and counting and it's still 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 not on the city's website , yet, we paid Mr. Ufberg $37,000 last month according to the controller . Now the pocket park is coming along fine. They got the turf down and the trees up and the manure -- nice odor of manure all over Linden Street. Tell me when we're going to have the grand opening and the audit. I don't know -- tell me what the progress is; but we paid Clifton LarsonAllen $42,000. And what is the status of the MMO which we normally know by the end of August? And once again, with these Rubicon guys, ask them to start picking up the garbage cans in the downtown . You left the one by the Chancery that was overflowing since the festival. It didn't get picked up until September 12th. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Hodowanitz . Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . Well, you know, I was going to talk about something else tonight . But the first speaker talked about health. And you know in January I came here and I asked that maybe somebody young 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 would finally come to Council and some young people would invest some of their time and come here because I thought I had a health issue and I didn't think I was going to be alive much longer. So I thought I'd ask some people in the city and, of course, nobody came because they really don't have faith in our government . And it's so pathetic that I feel bad for them. But somebody has to realize that the health system here is totally collapse d. Moses Taylor is just nonexistent. Community Medical Center is carrying the bulk of everything here and Regional is almost completely collapsed itself. And I had to go to Philadelphia or I'd be dead. And I'm a truck driver trying to explain to doctors that they've got something wrong and here we are. We're trying to talk about the DPW. And I listened to all the political double speak here. You know, I am feeling much healthier and I am going to make a full recover y. As a matter of fact, I had enough time on Tuesday to spend in the law library in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Wilkes-Barre because I never thought I was going to get to federal court. And I think I'm going to get there. And, you know, I sat here and I listened to you talk about licensing and inspections . Well, I might deal with them myself because I can't rely on city government , ECTV, or the Mayor because I've asked you all to intervene and you've ignored me. So I'm going to probably end up asking a federal judge to intervene . And I'm only a truck driver. But we're going to see where I get to. But, you know, I think it's time the residents came here about the expansion of the CMC -- Geisinger CMC. Well, it's been purchased by somebody else now I think. But you know when Ozzie Quinn was part of the tax group here, we spent some time with the first dean of the law school and I spoke to him about medical records following patients and a lot of other issues. And he agreed with me, and I guess the state made many changes there. But I feel bad for the people in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 city that we don't have elected officials that understand that healthcare in the city has collapsed . You just don't understand it. We're talking about collect ing trash. We've been in the city for 100 and -- well, I'll say 150 years. I'll reduce it. And then when I watch the discussion here I'm horrified by the comments and the ideas. I've been a truck driver for a long time. I've set up delivery routes from here all the way up through Vermont in a different class of truck. But, you know, I sit and I watch the city plow snow in the wintertime and think it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. I sit here today and I watch you talk about DPW picking up trash and optimizing routes. And you have no idea what you're talking about. I only did that job when I was 19 or 20 for a couple months because I went to a federal program here and they trained me to be a cement finisher even though I had that skill when I went to those classes because my father was a master carpenter and I knew how to mix cement and build forms. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 But I thought , well, you know, maybe I'd give something to the city and I'd build curbs and sidewalks here and give something to my city. Mayor Hickey was the Mayor then. He killed the program . And we just haven't invested . But the truth of the matter is that DPW, it's never been absolutely run right. But you don't give them any tools. You're talking about 20 yard trucks. I've driven tractor -trailer s through alleys and that doesn't make me special . You just have to know the clearance of the truck and what you're trying to do. Okay, and you have to -- when you look at the truck, it's not just the truck. It's the equipment they're working with. They're just ignored . And, I mean, I listened to this guy talk. I just can't believe that we're hearing that. When I was a child I lived right across the DPW compound on Capouse Avenue. I remember when the guys used to come and put the cans out for you, do everything . And I watched what's going on now in our city. And I believe that we need to move away from Rubicon . We need to make people -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 elect the people that can run the city, get rid of all the authorities , okay, and make a determination to put people that could do the job in the seat, okay. And beating the hell out of the drivers and trash collectors without the right equipment is ridiculous . And I'm not only talking about the trucks. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Virgil Argenta . MR. ARGENTA : Virgil Argenta , Scranton . Mr. King, on September 5th I asked when the last water quality report or water testing was done for our city drinking water. I also made a request that we have a current water test done on public drinking water and have the finding s made public. Where are we at on that? Mr. King, also on September 12th I asked if the pumps were turned on on Merrifield Avenue. If they weren't, was it because the pumps were faulty or that no one from the city turned them on so the city wouldn't have to pay overtime ? If it's true, who made that decision ? Was it the DPW Director , the Fire 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 Chief, or the Mayor herself ? Maybe if the pumps were turned on we wouldn't be dealing with the magnitude of what we're dealing with right now. Someone needs to answer. Were the operations manager or emergency coordinator jobs filled yet? Do we still have a 24/7 DPW callout crew? Mr. King, regarding the Parks and Recreation Director position , when he was hired with Council 's approval , he had assured Council that he was going to get his lifeguard certification that he was going to move into the city. Any idea where we are with that? We certainly don't want a repeat performance of the indoor pool being closed to paying members due to lifeguard staffing now that school's back, do we? The Parks and Recreation Director also stated that the homeless are issued vouchers to use the facility at Weston Field and that they are vetted properly . Who exactly is on site if there is an issue with one of your vetted people? Mr. Smurl, do you know the specific s of this so-called program and how it came about? Can 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 you explain the vetting process and who does the vetting ? With the rumors swirling regarding some of the conduct inside City Hall with their employee s and their directors , we would feel very uncomfortable if these same people were vetting the homeless that are using Weston Field. It's evident that the vetting process in place is highly lacking right now. Let's imagine if the homeless person wasn't taken into custody selling drugs apprehended with $7,000 in our city. Imagine the violent activity that goes on in our city due to homeless population with no crime stats. We have no idea. Imagine if a homeless male didn't stab another homeless male in our city. Imagine if a homeless woman did not bite an innocent female passerby in our city. Imagine if ever a police officer visited a homeless encampment he or she didn't leave with someone in handcuffs due to outstanding warrants in our city. Imagine if a police officer 's safety wasn't an issue, wasn't at serious risk when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 visiting a homeless camp because we have no clue now who lives here with our stellar vetting process in our city. Imagine a city where our children walk to and from school not exposed to dangerous predators living in their backyard . Imagine a city without a drug unit. Imagine a city without specialized units in its police department . Imagine the homeless now using the facilities at Weston Field along side paying resident s in our city. Imagine that you have city official s currently in office facilitating these decisions putting all of our lives at risk. Imagine that in our city. I'll be awaiting some of the answers , Mr. King, Mr. Smurl. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the administration , I did ask some question s about the pump house during caucus. It seemed like the individual s that were here didn't know those answers. But if we can reach out with the question that we were just posed about the pump house and some of the ones I posed if we could get an answer as to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 how that operated during that night. Also, can we reach out about access to Weston Field if what we're hearing here is true? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask both of those questions . MR. KING: Also, Mr. Voldenberg , about the water testing , I guess that would be a Pennsylvania American Water company question if we could look into that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll contact them tomorrow . MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries, Scranton city resident . And where do I start? I guess I'll start with the posters . I was the one that put them up on your desk and everything because I didn't want to use any of my time walking across and giving you the posters . So I just would appreciate if you could share this information with everyone . And the only thing that I'd like to add to this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 is that we get a lot of books. And books as everyone knows are, you know, could be very expensive . And some people use the Kindles and they don't actually get the book anymore. But for those of us that do read books, we know they're very valuable . So, you know, if you got any books that are in good condition and something that you think that you would like to share with others if you could just bring them up to the community room September 21st and the 22nd. And thank you, Mr. King, for reading that. And the hours are 3 to 6 p.m. I won't be there this time because I'm going away. But, you know, just make sure you come out and support this because , you know, it's winter is coming and everyone is going to want to read. So it's great to be able to have a book to read. It's just such a valuable tool. I always think books are, you know, you could travel the world by reading a book. So that's what that was about. The second thing too with this previous speaker , somehow I knew about the deputy director of health leaving .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 And I know I sent her a message to congratulate her. So I'm not sure where I read it but I knew she was leaving . So I knew that that was something that was public knowledge because it's the only way that I would know about it. And also, Council and Dr. Rothchild , thank you for mentioning about the open house with the NAACP on Thursday . And the only difference on what you said and what I said -- have written , it's from 4 to 6, you know, the hours there at the Enterprise Center downtown . So I'm hoping that they have a good turnout. I'll be there and just to -- maybe I shouldn 't say that then you won't come. But I'll be there to greet everyone . And hopefully we could have a good turnout just to hear about the NAACP and their future and what they're looking to do. So the other thing that it just tears my heart as I had spoke last week about the flooding . And as everyone knows about the flooding , I think the city has done a great job with the popup tents and places where people can go to get information and to have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 computers ready to input the information for those individuals that do not have a computer who are not PC savvy. I'm just so glad that the city made that available to those resident s that needed that capability . One of those resident s is my dear friend. And my heart just breaks for her. And we talk every day. And she calls me and I'll try not to get emotional because after I hang up from talking with her, you know, I have just such tears. I just don't let her know on the phone when I'm speaking with her because I'm suppose d to be a support for her and not to wallow in despair of the situation that she's in. She's, you know, a senior citizen . She rents. The first floor of her house they did remove the future and everything . They got that all out to the curb. But she's got furniture and things on the second floor. And she has, you know, she's just in such despair as to how she's going to get her -- the breathing machine that she uses at night. She does these boots that she puts on, you know, for circulation of her 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 legs. You know, these things are just -- my heart just goes out to her and I can't do anything . I can't go over there. And so finally I did call City Hall here because that's all I know to do. And I again gave her information again. And I'll try not to get emotion al and I gave her information again. And she did get a call today. And she called me and she said, oh, Norma, thank you. Thank you. I said, no, don't thank you. We're in this together , you know, so the person told her that they were going to try to get back to her by close of business tomorrow to try help her. And, you know, the news media is great. You know, they tell us everything . But when everybody goes on their normal way, I'm in a dry house and everyone else is in a dry house. But there's a lot of people still suffering from the flood. And they need help. So I just have to be her advocate because she, like I said, she's not PC savvy. She's very, you know, docile. She won't speak up. So I have to be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 her mouth and her voice as she goes through this situation . So, you know, she'll call me and let me know. And like I said, we talk every morning . And the city has done a great job if you could get out there to those things and she did. MR. SCHUSTER : Norma, before you go, one of those other advocates that I don't know if you know this that Mr. Voldenberg who got that information over to the city (inaudible ) you know that, but Frank got her contact information over. MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you, Frank. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . Len Srebro. MR. SREBRO: Good evening , Council , Lenny Srebro, Keyser Valley. Don't you think you should start the caucus earlier , you know, if you're going to be running late like this all the time? You're taking away from people who want to voice their opinion . I thought that Council meeting starts at 6:30. This is late going on. And, jeez, you know, when you're hearing people at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 the table here talking and you just see the back of their heads, you know, things don't register . You know, and the black guy, I don't know who he is. Jeez, I came in a little bit late again -- well, no, I was early for the regular Council meeting . So I didn't catch a lot of what he was saying. But what I did, it seemed like he kept repeating over and over the same thing. So, you know, that's killing our time we deserve , you know, or make it public notice that, jeez, the meeting s ain't going to start until 7:30 anymore or else start earlier . You know, it's not like it went over by a couple of minutes . That was an hour over the regular Council meeting . Myself and a lot of people are elderly and, you know, it's kind of late. So I hope you'll take that into consideration . I want to talk about a couple things. Norma always talks about street signs getting them replaced. You know, I have been a body technician in the automotive field all my life. And I don't know why these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 engineers didn't consider it's called wrapping . It's like a decal. Why can't you just make up decals and put them over the old signs? Now you're saving all of that money on the labor to change the steel bar, you know, and the cost of the new signs. You know, didn't anybody think about that about decals? I mean, the quality is so much better today than it was if you think that decals are going to be peeling or anything . I had a chance to go up last week or the week before, the people on Ferdinand Street who were talking about the atrocious conditions up there. You know, going by on Keyser Avenue I decided to take a ride up there and see what they're talking about. I'm telling you that's the worst road I've ever seen in my lifetime . I can't believe the city won't do nothing for those people. I can't even see how they make it up that hill without four wheel drive, never mind in the winter. You know, God bless those people. Somebody should look into that. Okay, see like I thought -- like I said last week, this flood 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 thing on Merrifield Avenue, it's over with now as far as the public is concerned as far as you guys are concerned . I think that, you know, these people that have lost their homes, it's not over for them. So I would like to know what yous are doing about the flooding problem in Keyser Valley. Can somebody answer me that? Please don't tell me you are going to do another study. You know, the study was done two years ago and nobody knows the results of it. But I do know that or I understand that a grant was given through the flood control and nothing was ever done and nobody knows what happened to that grant money. You know, this is pretty new Council we got here. You know, you guys have the chance to make it right or get somebody to make it right. And the old administration , you know, just like I always say, they tell you what you want to hear and nothing gets done. Anybody can tell me what's -- what kind of plans are for the flooding ? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Srebro, I could only report out what I've been given. There 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 was a study that was done already on Keyser Avenue. It didn't happen this summer. It happened the summer prior to that. And in the capital budget which is on our agenda tonight , there is money allocated to that. So there's a design phase and then the actual construction phase. So like I said, I could only report out what's been given to me. That study has been done. They are moving into design phase and the construction phase over the next two years. MR. SREBRO: When can I see that? MR. SCHUSTER : If you wait until after the meeting, you could have my copy of the capital budget. MR. SREBRO: Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Srebro. Sean McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Good evening , Sean McAndrew , taxpayer . I also am a school director . And before I start, I want to say this is my opinion and not the opinion of whole entire school board. But last Wednesday I sent a letter to the Mayor's office regarding the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 homeless issue over on Olive Street. Every day to and from school our Scranton High students have to walk by that area under the pavilion . And I got a lot of reports of concerned parents about that route. So last Thursday morning I went over. I was there for about an hour. And the situation that I, you know, saw was unacceptable . There was people living in broken down cars for weeks from what I was told. There was somebody living under a trailer overnight . This gentleman , you know, woke up in the morning , you know, pulled his pants down and went to the bathroom right as kids were walking by. I also, you know, saw some other strange activity of what I could only assume to be drug deals or anything . There was drug paraphernalia all on the ground, needles , cut up straws to use for drugs. It's just a deplorable situation for our kids. And there's nothing our district can do to stop that. Like I said, I sent a letter to the Mayor about a week ago for help because this is such a safety concern and I haven't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 heard back yet. The only response I got was an automatic response saying if you have immediate inquiries , you know, please send here. So if I have to have my own town hall there or a photo shoot there that gets people there from the city I will do that because the safety of our kids is my number one priority . Just last week I believe it was Monday around 2:40, somebody was walking by and one of the homeless people bit somebody . Our student s get out around 2:50. So what if that's our students walking by. Thank God it wasn't. But enough's enough. There's a whole little village back there from what I'm told. I spoke with one of the homeless members there. You know, there's a little village back there where they basically said you do not want to go back there. Obviously people walk by. It's not just for our student s either. It's also for all of our resident s or our athlete s who run their cross country paths. This is beginning a bigger issue every day. And it's time that -- if we could work together , let's figure it out. But these student s deserve safety to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 and from school and if there is something our district can do to oversee that we would. But it's out of our jurisdiction because it's off our campus. So I'm here pleading with you guys to help me out, you know, anything you could do to make it safe for these student s because every day I see more and more in the city that it's just not the same city I grew up in. And I think it's time for all of us, the city, the school district , everybody to band together and, you know, take this city back and get it back on track to what it was like when we went to school and how we grew up because slowly but surely we're losing that every day. So is there any suggestion of somebody I could contact ? I've called in the past for other issues. The city, you know, City Hall doesn't return my calls. So I thought sending an e-mail and also, you know, mailing a letter would get a response , especially regarding this issue and I haven't received anything . So if there is anything all of you could do to help and help our student s, I would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 greatly appreciate it. And I'm sure our entire district and our parents would appreciate it too. So thank you very much and you have my contact information on the website or if you want to talk to me after this, anything you can do to help, please let me know. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . We'll reach out to the police chief to see if there's some kind of meeting we could set up or something that the Scranton Police Department can do to intervene or at least show a presence there to try to ameliorate that situation because that's obviously not a good situation for our student s. I absolutely agree. MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, I appreciate that. And also too, at night when, you know, they're leaving the football games or leaving the basketball games they're walking home it's the same thing. It's probably even more dangerous at night because it's not really well lit up there. And I'm a 35-year-old male -- or adult and when I was down there that morning , I was even, you know, nervous seeing the people who were -- the activities that were going on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 down there. So I appreciate it. And if you need anything from me, please let mow know. MR. KING: Thank you, Sean. MR. MCANDREW : Thanks. MR. KING: Dave Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . Okay, I was just in CMC and somebody slipped me some information . I don't know how accurate it was. But they are planning to move to Dickson City on 91 acres behind -- behind the new Gibbons dealership . I don't know if it's still called that because that's starting to change hands. But it's something to keep in mind. And we have two other hospitals everybody thought was just wonderful if they became a for profit hospital and maybe they paid some taxes, maybe they didn't. I don't really care for what I'm hearing out of there. All right. There's been talk about a pool lately. And I don't know how we intend to handle it once it's built. But it eventually it was $5 a day. And as far as an average kid even lower middle class, that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 unapproach able. So that's something you want to keep in consideration . And I would also like to reiterate about high pressure grout being pushed into crevices and cracks. It's hydraulic concrete . The romans used to use it to build piers. You could dump this concrete into water. It's hydraulic concrete and it cures under water. So it's been used for the Hoover dam, something to keep in mind instead of tearing something down and opining about it. And then it might be preferable to repair something for a change. Tax exempts once again, I feel that their conference s and, like, with Henry Amoroso with the water bills and the sale of the sewer plant and our walkability once again. They're only producing one side of the equation . And that's not right. It really is not right. As a 501 C3 or C4, you're supposed to invite let's say per se the democrat candidate and the republican candidate irregardless . It's suppose d to be nonpartisan, not this is what the plan is going to be and it's a great plan. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 With Amoroso and our high water bills, the real estate interest were there. There was a conference thrown up at Marywood . Lackawanna paid for the consultant . It was during the day. And, you know, I walked into the room late because nobody from Marywood would even tell me where the hell it was -- which building . And, you know, I looked around and I saw a lot of business interests . You know, better the tenants pay the big water bill and it gets piled on our taxes to compensate the police and fire department which brings us back to the third issue. We really need to look into the 21 million dollars loss last year out of the pension fund. That's about 30 percent . Now the worst that the stock market did was about 14 percent varying bouncing back and forth over the higher interest rates by the Fed. And, you know, they up and they go down a little bit. What kind of investment , you know, little old me I told my wife 401K go with Standard and Poor's. It's a wide range. She earned 8 and a half percent a year, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 know, during those years. And they were bad years. That was back with Enron and everything else, 9/11. So, you know, we really need a long caucus on that, a big caucus, several hours. And if somebody is not up to the job in that pension board, please just resign. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : It's not your fault but it's got to stop. MR. KING: Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka , first of all, when Rubicon was leaving , I actually took a second to talk to the IT gentleman . And I posed him a simple question . Since City Council has so many question s on the reports and that and he's done the training on the system, why doesn't he extend to City Council training on the Rubicon system for the trash so that they would be able to audit, do their own reports. And one of the interesting comment s they made was, well, they have an issue with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 that because the Rubicon system lacks security protocols . They cannot customize it per the user which is a gigantic security nightmare because then anyone in the position can add, delete or alter the information . And if they don't have security tracking on it, there's no way to tell where that actually (inaudible ). I believe the city government and you gentlemen up there or at least one of you if you were interested in it, should have access to the database , can pull the information , can look at it, can look at reports from one side to another if you so choose. But evidently that's not in the cards. Move onto 7-A, the resolution for Treasurer . It's interesting in the section for diploma or degree it's listed as no. Also interesting is that one of his caveats in his resume in there was he managed the city gas cards and did liquid fuel audits during the theft from the city gas cards. So if I was him, that's something I probably would not have put in my resume that I managed the gas cards during the time that the city was having gas card thefts. 5-D and I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 think E, I guess the city and its lawyers were not aware that they planned to settle because they suddenly had to do an emergency order for the settlement and that the city's lawyers were incompetent enough during settlement is if they had a very specific time period that usually you negotiate during a settlement saying that we would need an extension because it has to go through Council . So this emergency seems like it's an emergency of incompetence and/or they just held it back to push it through as a rush so people would not have time to view it. 5-B, again the Mayor's wrong on the state of emergencies . Flooding , yes, it is an emergency . But the Mayor is not allowed to declare a state of emergency on health, welfare , and the safety. She's only enforcer administrator . City Council is the health -- has health responsibility under the charter . It also lists as so ratified and authorized by City Council . Where is City Council 's emergency order that she's referring to here? I don't see that. This whole thing is a cart before 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 the horse and the Mayor once again doing tasks that the charter points off to this body. 5-E, increasing the budget. The scope is overbroad. I would put in there in the new large money request specifically that the funds are not to be used to purchase or make down payment s on any building . Note in the body the word of the ordinance Section 1, acquisition addition to city property should be removed and specifically banned as it disclaimer boilerplate verbiage in there says what's in there it's not limited to. Financial impact page lists a term of 40 years. The attached Exhibit C shows a term of a note of eight years. Forty years and eight years, that's close. I have concerns moving on about how City Council does contracts and the city does. Original ly it was written to protect us by having it go out there in a bid process to stop it from being self-serving . This process has been in place for a long while. But looking to evaluate some of the recent stuff that's gone through , we had cars 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 that were 22 percent over retail. And looking at the estimate for 166 police vests at a thousand dollars each. That's 82 percent over retail price. We're not in the 1970s. We have an internet . There needs to be a time where this city takes a look at the bids that are coming in, takes a look at the actual retail price and does not pay an excessive amount over retail price for a bid just because it got a bid. Financial responsibility means if we're being overcharged by 20, 80, or 100 percent , putting on the brakes looking at retail and going I don't care how good or if we have one bid, we can't give the bid out because it's robbing the people. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . Regarding street signs, are we going to get some kind of report where we say how many were put up during this prior week so people can think -- know that something is actually happening ? And have we changed the thing so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 that there's only one at a corner? I went looking for someplace this past week, and I found when I was wanting to know what the names of the two streets were, there was only one on one direction . So I don't know if we're -- that's where we're saving money or something . But it's not very helpful when you're looking for someplace . And then the pilot payments , is there a program -- are any of you in charge of at least getting a letter to the people who are not paying the property taxes that they are expected to do something for the city? MR. KING: I believe the administration is sending those letters out. MS. SCHUMACHER : They have? MR. KING: I believe so. MS. SCHUMACHER : Do you know when they went? MR. KING: I don't. I could try to find that out. Frank, can you check on that for us? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, sir. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And the responses would be nice to know too. And the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 stormwater , we've had so many studies on stormwater but do we have a schedule for prioritizing the -- I know they can't all be done at one time. But do we have something that has a priority of which one starts and which one ends? MR. KING: I believe that Mr. Schuster mentioned earlier the study was done at Keyser Valley. The study was done on East Mountain . And I think it's in design development now is the next phase and then the actual remediation . I know on East Mountain , like, Snook Street's included in there, East Mountain Road, I believe Cherry Street, East Elm Street. There's a few others I'm probably missing there, maybe Birch as well. MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, yeah, there's one on Snook that runs all the time which is not a problem now when it's -- MR. KING: I'll try to get an updated schedule for you. MS. SCHUMACHER : I would like to see that because it's going to change a lot when we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 start getting freezing . We're going to have the DPW up salting it every day. And that's expensive too. So it would be nice if they could get fixed before the -- okay, now since I've gotten older, I was raised to respect my elders and I did, I think. And as I have gotten older, I have a different kind of respect for it. So I -- as part of it, I went down and I think older people were always given a lot of help. But I'll tell you, we have some things in the city that are old and need some help. And I have -- may I bring up for you some pictures ? MR. KING: Sure. MS. SCHUMACHER : You know, some people probably in this room because they're too young to know what the WPA is. But if I may, I would like to read what it was. The Works Progress Administration was an ambitious employment and infrastructure program created by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1935, during the bleakest days of the Great Depression . Over its eight years of existence , the WPA put roughly 8.5 million Americans to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 work building schools , hospitals , roads and other public works. Perhaps best known for its public works projects , the WPA also sponsored projects in the arts. The agency employed tens of thousands of actors, musicians , writers and other artists . One of the things we have if you look in your letters -- the envelopes , one of the big projects we have is a place that's visited a lot. It's the lookout on the Scranton Pocono Highway . But if you look at those pictures , it is -- I mean, some of what's happening to it are I'm sure just because it's old. And some of it I think it looks like somebody took a sledge hammer to it and just knocked it off the rocks in the front. And you'll even see there's a hole on the top and the rocks are right there down there at the bottom where they should have been up on the top. So I would like to ask that you -- if I could finish this one, please? If you could get somebody like a mason in there to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 look at that whole section to see how much of it is due to age and how much of it is being done by people. And you'll see there's a lot of graffiti and the other thing is, there is nothing on there -- up there that tells anything about what the WPA was. There's a picture in there of it and there's, you know, signatures on it, which it should be cleaned up. It should be maintained . So it's -- it may be history but people -- a lot of people don't know what the depression was like and what it did to people and I think we should respect and maintain the lookout. So thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mrs. Schumacher . MR. KING: Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, do you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. Mr. Voldenberg , this one on my way to work today I forgot to give it to you. But I will e-mail you picture s at 537 Taylor Avenue for DPW to Director Pietreface . The sidewalk is pretty much gone. And the trees have grown into about 4 or 5 feet into the street. So if you have -- and maybe code enforce ment. See who owns that property if they can do anything with that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Next, I won't be here for caucus next week. And Mulfehan is going to be here. I wanted to ask some questions of them about -- of their studies for gangs and stuff. So I called Chief -- our Police Chief Carroll and asked if I could ask them any question s. He contacted me and said they were willing to come in. So they drove in from DC on Friday evening and we had a meeting . MR. KING: Mr. Smurl, is your mic on? MR. SMURL: Yes, it is.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. KING: Okay, yeah, if you can -- MR. SMURL: They just plugged it back in. It must be good. So I met with them Friday evening . And I went over all the question s I had for them. I know you guys are going to have them next week. So they answered everything that I had -- I was interested in. So that's all I had for them. Secondly, the flood event -- the flood storm recovery that the city had done down at Novembrino Complex and also at the Holy Rosary Center, they had many people come in and a lot of people were helped by the city employees and I thank them for doing all that. And also a lot of donation s from a lot of business es in Scranton . It's great to see the community come together and help each other. That's all I have. Thanks. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, thanks. Quick one for Mrs. Schumacher . There is a website that has the WPA sites and I think they are categorize d by state. You could go on. There's quite of few of them in our area. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 All right. For tonight there's a couple things I had from last week that I don't think we got an answer on. One was the Bread Basket grant. I did receive a response but last week I had additional questions regarding Bread Basket of NEPA. I asked what community center Bread Basket was associate d with and why they are getting grant funding for community centers . They did respond back to me that Bread Basket is an organization independent of the City of Scranton . It's awarded funds from the city budget called grants. The money is called a grant because it is money that's being pushed out from the City of Scranton to an outside entity. The specific line item from Bread Basket was the operational expenditure for community centers . And the amount is dedicate d to giving money to local community centers. The Bread Basket also needed -- MOU to provide receipt s for the funding like the veterans did. And then they just gave a copy paste answer that Bread Basket of NEPA applied as they are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 working out of one of the community centers . So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we could just ask again which community center are they working out of? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get the specifics . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. We did receive correspondence from Clifton LarsonAllen about our audit. I know some in the audience tonight will be interested in this. But it stated that they're unable to issue our audit report by September 30th. So there is going to be a delay. I'll speak with our solicitor but possibly for next week if we could get the response -- MR. KING: I believe it has to do the Sewer Authority . That's the piece that's missing . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, if we could get this response into Third Order for next week. MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. Schuster , I receive d a response today from Attorney Shrive. And he advised that he will follow up with the auditor . I should hear something shortly .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Thank you. Last week I also asked for a list of city vehicle s and who they are assigned to, who's assigned to the vehicle , what vehicle and especially the electric vehicle s if we could just follow up on that one. Sorry, to have you keep doing these same things over again. I also asked for a list of all grants that were applied for and it would be all grants not just our LSTs and others, but all grants that the city has been applied for and what has been awarded and what is pending and then -- MR. KING: And what's been rejected. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. King, if we can also add that. Also the Mulfehan initial pilot study, can we ask the administration how did we get approved , selected or volunteer ed for that since it was only for cities that were involved in that pilot study? And then I think I feel like two weeks ago we asked about the rental registration fees for the apartment s at the University of Scranton . I don't believe we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 an answer on that, did we, Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : Not as yet, sir. I'll follow up. MR. SCHUSTER : If we can just follow up on that one. Thank you very much. I'm sure I have a couple others, but that will be all for tonight . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, just a couple things here. I did receive a complaint that I wanted to have forwarded to code enforcement officer and DPW as well. It's with regards to alley nearby Orchard Street in Moosic in South Side and I believe it's Front Street and there's a lot of overgrown trees and bushes along the alley. But there's also a lot of debris and garbage I think in the photos included because I saw a mattress . So if we could get them over there to help clean that up and determine if there's any violation s or if it's just city-owned property that needs to be cleaned . MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And along Prescott Avenue there has been a Pennsylvania American Water project and between Olive and Ridge Row. And it's really terrible on the roads. And I had been receiving complaints about that. And we were told that that project should be completed towards the end of September , early October which I really hope for. I also use that road quite a bit and it's become really difficult to drive on. So you have to end up taking alternative routes. So I think the quicker that they could get to that the better. And speaking of American Water, I've been bringing up concerns about the rate increases . And I'm still waiting responses for that. I know that the city, the administration has been busy with the flooding that had occurred and, you know, that took priority and importance . But I would like to see what we're going to do with regards to the rate increases in the city. And I would really like to see us come together as a Council with the Mayor, with other local elected officials to see what we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 could do to fight those increases . And I just wanted to touch real quick on what Miss Schumacher brought up about the lookout over on 307. I also pass by there every single day. And I know that there is always cars. There's always people there. I think it's a stop for visitors too who might be coming into the town because that's considered maybe a shortcut if you're coming from 380 from the Poconos. And so, I mean, it's a really nice view of the city. But then you are surround ed by from evidence d in the pictures a lot of graffiti and issues with the stone. So I also would like to get someone out there to see if we can help clean up that area so DPW could see what they are able to do about that. I think that would help us to have a better look for the city, not just the lookout but where you're standing from as well. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : I have a few. So I've been hearing some rumors. Most rumors in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 Scranton are always true or for the most part true and it's unfortunate . But Mr. Argenta made reference to a disbanded city police drug unit. I've heard this for about three to four weeks now, maybe even more than that. So I'm the Chairman of Public Safety Committee . I want to know if that's true. And also in addition to that, I also heard another rumor that detectives are no longer allowed to investigate theft crimes under $5,000. So with that said, you know, I don't like to hear stuff on the street. So can you please -- and I heard these are directive s that came from the Mayor and the Chief. So can you please follow up with both and inquire to both department s and offices to see if this is true. And if so, why aren't we aware of it. And I hope it's a rumor. But can you please get clarification on them two items? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Also, I have been receiving a lot of complaints . And I actually saw this this weekend that during the weekend s there's a lot of construction going on after 4:00 during the week and weekends when 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 code enforcement isn't around. So I saw this firsthand on Main Avenue where the old Mercury Cleaner s is up in West Side -- roof and they're working on it. This is not fair to all the other contractor s that are licensed and applied for permits and do the right thing that there's a few out there. And it's becoming rampant that are doing all of this kind of work when code enforcement isn't around. And I'm even hearing that, oh, you want a roof? Do you want the weekend no permit roof price or do you want the Monday through Friday price? This is real, folks. So, I mean, you know, the word code enforce ment, they changed it from the LIPS Department the name to code enforce ment. So enforcement of the code needs to be done on the weekend s. I'm hearing maybe that it might be a contractual CBA issue where it's not in the contract it allows them to work after 4 on weekend s. But that's not for me to figure out. This is for the administration to figure out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 whether they rotate their schedule s, but we need people. We need code enforce ment. We got a bunch of new cars. We're getting more cars. We have some new hires. We need them enforcing these codes on the weekend s. So that's something I hope the Mayor is aware of or should be. If not, well, she's -- she'll be aware of it now and so will code enforce ment. Please send that over. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Also, so the health, safety, and welfare of our kids is, of course, the district 's priority -- number one priority . Of course it should be -- of course city government 's number one priority . As an educator and a former board member, it's always been my priority one and also as a father. So can I sympathize with the homeless problem ? Sure I can. But you know what, but a blind eye is not the answer. And I hate the scenario we always hear it's not if, it's when. So that element that's very close to our students on the way to and from school has to be corrected . I don't want to talk about not if 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 but when. Then what happens ? Then it's too late. So and you know it's going to start getting dark earlier . I've heard a lot of reports of stabbing s that are occurring . I'm hearing everything that you're hearing . So we can't do a blind eye to it. We can't say, oh, we're worried about litigation and First Amendment rights. These kids have First Amendment rights as well. So please -- and, you know, let's follow up with Mr. McAndrew . He did a great job here. He sent correspondence to the Mayor, e-mailed and a letter and no response . So I expect a response . Also again, like I said, I'm the Chairman of the Public Safety Committee . This falls under that. I need answers to these question s and not wait five, six, seven weeks and get part of an answer or no answer because that's what's occurring with a lot of the issues we try to fix. Our job is here to fix things. We can't do it without the support of the administration or at least a call back or a response . So these are issues that are only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 going to get worse and we have to take care of them. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . City Council receive d a complaint of an increased number of one way drivers on Electric Street in Green Ridge. Council submitted a request to DPW Department for addition of one way do not enter signage in this area of Electric Street and Sunset Street. Joan Hodowanitz had asked about the MMO, received the City of Scranton 2024 MMO obligation from Thomas J. Anderson Associates , City of Scranton 's 2024 MMOs were received on September 18th. And they will appear in Third Order on the September 26th agenda. Norma Jeffries, legislation received for next week's agenda related to a grant application to the Commonwealth financing authority Multimobile transportation Fund to up to $688,911 to be used towards street sign replacement project . So that's continuing . And we'll try to get an update. I think I gave an update last week as to the number that were install ed. But I'll try to get more of an update. And I believe that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 were also looking to put out an RFP to have the city make the signs and have someone else install them. So I'll check on that or, Frank, if we can get just an update on that RFP. Taylor Sudkill Maru{phonetic } had come into City Council chambers last week and talked about a damage catch basin at Olive Street and Farber Court. DPW advised that this is a Pennsylvania American Water Company basin. Pennsylvania American Water Company confirm ed they will visit for review and repair it this week. I know it's a little frustrating when we schedule caucus at 5:45. We'd love to try to schedule them earlier but a number of Council members have work schedule s that don't allow them to get here much earlier than 5:45. Certainly didn't expect it to go over an hour tonight . But we have waited quite a long time to have Rubicon come in here. So we felt it was important to ask as many question s while we had a captive audience here. You know, we've been trying to get him in here for six, eight months at least -- two years, what have you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 But, you know, I apologize that it took until 7:30 to get the actual meeting started . Unfortunate ly, sometimes these things go a lot longer than we anticipate . So my apologies for that. The Ferdinand Street issue, I was up there myself. And I agree with Mr. Srebro, took a video, took photos. And I'm told that that's a FEMA project . It was in the process of being worked on and then that terrible flood occurred . But, Frank, if you could check with the city in terms of where they're at because they were suppose d to work on that or maybe even complete it last Friday I thought . MR. SCHUSTER : A portion of the road was milled out. There has been some prep work done. It just hasn't been paved yet. MR. KING: Okay, yeah, so there was no prep work done when I was there. So you were there Friday. So just if we could get an update as to where they are with completing that because it's like driving on the Baja, really, really bad condition up there. So if we can get an update on that. And that's all I have at this time. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? On the question , I will say I should have mentioned this earlier that I do appreciate the city setting up those meeting s with the resident s following the terrible flooding . I, myself, was over on Leggett Street and I met with one of the homeowners whose home is completely devastated . I think it was on the front page of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 the Scranton Times, truck flipped over, stuff -- I mean, it's just -- it's unbelievable what happened to those people. So all of those meeting s I was told they served 100 families . And they helped them through application . The hope is that -- you never hope that there's million s and million s of dollars of damage, but in this case we're kind of hoping there is so that it rises to the level where these people can get the FEMA dollars . They are hoping to complete that work and submit it to FEMA with the hope that we're going to get some federal help for all of these homeowners . So that's all I have on the question . All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-C.

SCHUSTER : On the question , I'll move this forward . I understand it needs to be introduced. But I'm sure I'll be voting no on it as we move into sixth and seventh . It's one thing to pay a class action suit that we've lost. It's another to pay off a company that hasn't worked above board. It's something I express ed at the time when we first discussed it.

This company Northeast Revenue is suing for breach of contract . Guess what they did? They were part of the pay to play with the former Mayor, identified . It's like a conspirer in the trial. And I wanted to fight it from the beginning when these conversations were had. I don't think we should reward them for their behavior because they feel that their contract -- what happened -- when you commit a felony like that or involvement like that, all contracts are breached . Guess what, they breached their own contract . I'm not going to reward them for it with taxpayer money that we have to borrow for now. That's all I have. MR.
