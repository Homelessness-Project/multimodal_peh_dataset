KING: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. And it's a reminder . I mention ed it a couple weeks ago that the Scranton DPW union workers will have a Truck or Treat this Sunday, October 29th from 3 to 6. It will be at the DPW parking lot on 101 West Poplar Street, trucks and heavy equipment on display , there will be candy, live 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 DJ, decoration s and family fun. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Anyone else? I have two -- well, maybe three actually . Just a reminder for residents who are going to be out and about driving on Tuesday , October 31st that children will be out trick or treating that evening . I just ask everyone if they could please be very careful . It gets dark early and just driving because the kids get excited . They're running across the street. They're, you know, out there trick or treating trying to have fun with their family so just be careful on Halloween night. Also, as a result of Halloween happening on Tuesday of next week, we have several members of our Council who have very young children , some have grandchildren who are trick or treating age, we're going to move our meeting next Tuesday from October 31st to Thursday , November 2nd at 6:30. And the following week we're going to move the meeting schedule for November 7th, which is Election Day to Thursday , November 9th 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 at 6:30. So the next two Council meetings will be on Thursday evenings . And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. KING: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Do we have a status on the audit? MR. KING: Frank, have we received anything yet on the audit? MR. VOLDENBERG : There was supposed to be a special meeting held today, but due to a lack of quorum it's rescheduled to this Thursday in the Governor 's Room at 5:30. MR. KING: So we're basically held up by the Scranton Sewer Authority , correct ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's correct , Mr. King. MS. HODOWANITZ : And I saw the announcement in the legals in today's paper. Mr. Schuster, you head the Finance Committee , correct ? Why don't you and I go there and try to put the fear of God in those people. I guess nothing else is working , but here we go again. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 Speaking of here we go again, firefighter 's contract is still not on the website . It's 203 days. That's much more than 120. Anybody got an idea when they're going to get their act together and put it on the website ? MR. SCHUSTER : I do not. But last night I was going through the fire -- several different pieces of that firefighters ' contract to find a specific item I was looking for. And I couldn't find it in those documents . So it would have been nice to have that. MS. HODOWANITZ : Well, I'll tell you something , you know, for the arbitrator to have gotten it settled after the negotiations , they can't use the excuse, well, we have so many pieces of paper we have to put together . Because if that were true, then they never should have come to any kind of agreement . The arbitrator should not have been able to make a decision . So somebody needs to be asking questions . That is a document that should be disclosed to the public. That's public money. And you know another thing, is you look at the personnel handbook, okay, for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 unionized employee s and refer them in many of the chapters see union contract . So what is a firefighter suppose d to do? He can't look at his union contract because it hasn't been published yet. And the same thing is going to happen with the police, I guarantee you. This nonsense needs to stop. Somebody needs to hold administration accountable . We keep paying Ufberg month after month. This is -- if they made a decision on the contract and it settled , what you're talking about a typing drill. I can't believe we can't find a couple of competent typist to have gotten this done in 203 days? Give me a break. Speaking of give me a break, Item 7-E, Selina Andiappan 's appointment to the land bank, what ever happened to her resume? MR. KING: Did we receive that this afternoon ? MR. VOLDENBERG : We received it late this afternoon , Mr. King. MR. KING: Okay. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Item 5-E, the review of nontaxable properties by Rudolph 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Clarke, LLC, I saw the billable hours $200 per hour for, you know, the lawyers . But is there a cap on the contract itself not to exceed a certain dollar amount for the year or is it an open-ended contract ? MR. KING: I don't know that answer. I think that is an excellent question . MS. HODOWANITZ : I should've become a lawyer. I missed my calling . Okay. MR. KING: Can we still reach out to the administration and investigate , like, the possibility of, you know, putting a cap in there or why isn't there a cap or just some type of explanation as to why that doesn't exist? MR. SCHUSTER : Is that Item 7-A? MS. HODOWANITZ : If you look at Mr. Ufberg's billable hours, you could be paying a lot of money, enough to build a pool at Nay Aug. When are we going to get the draft budget on the agenda? When will that appear? When, in November ? November 14? November 21st? Do we have an idea? MR. KING: I believe it's -- I don't know the exact date. I know it will either be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 November 2nd or I believe November -- MS. HODOWANITZ : You mean the Thursday . MR. KING: Right, right, right, the 2nd or the 9th, I believe . MS. HODOWANITZ : I hope so. MR. KING: Frank, would you reach out to the administration and ask exactly when? I know that they are legally bound to submit that to us. I think it's 45 or 60 days before December 31st. MR. VOLDENBERG : Correct . We should have that by the 15th, but we will have it much sooner. MR. KING: Right. MS. HODOWANITZ : And the only other thing is, please tell us in Fifth Order your progress on legislation for tax relief for the victims of the flooding . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Joan. Mike Mancini . MR. MANCINI : Good evening , City Council . My name is Mike Mancini . President King, you weren't here the last two weeks. I hope your recovery 's gone well. I know you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 dialled in last week. So again, my question is regarding the sale of the Scranton Parking Authority and the Scranton Sewer Authority . Now, actually I would like to ask Solicitor Gallagher his opinion . And I had spoken to three different people with municipal experience , three different attorney s over 50 years' experience . Now, when a body -- elected body goes and ratifies a budget for an authority , they have every right to look at that audit and any trailing documents . Attorney /client privilege is not in play which Attorney Shrive clearly stated after the sale of the Sewer Authority . An authority cannot be actually audited unless the municipality requests the audit along with the Mayor in this case or the Scranton School Board. And then, therefore , the Auditor General 's office has to accept it and put together the necessary manpower . Now, each one of these people in this Council along with the school board which I will be appearing at tomorrow night I will pose the same question to that actual 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 solicitor . Now, I already know the answer to this question . When a body turns around, pays for something , they have every right to look at it. They have every right to audit it. They have to make sure that what they are paying for on behalf of the citizens -- taxpayer s in the city in this case has to be true, correct , and precise . They're not going to be able to pay for something and look at it -- look at the trailing documents and see why 50 attorneys , 3.1 million dollars which clearly could pay for a portion of the pool, right? We're only as good as who we elect. So my question to you, Attorney Gallagher , today is, does each one of these members have a right to look at that audit, any trailing documents to determine if there's any wrongdoing ? ATTY. GALLAGHER : As an elected official I believe they do. MR. MANCINI : Okay. Council members , one by one if you have the ability would you actually want to look at the those 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 documents , trailing documents , transparency to determine why 50 attorneys were paid, one attorney paid $123,000 over one month. And each of you are complaining about $200 to Ufberg. Attorneys received $800 an hour, okay 2.5 million dollars we're looking at. Limerick Township , 71.1 million dollars , two law firms, $600,000. All right, didn't require 50 attorneys , same system. There was not that many questions for this to happen. You have a City Solicitor . You have a title company . You have the insurance for a title company . It's buyer be ware. Not only did the corrupt Mayor sell the system for a lot less than what it was actually should have been sold for prior to Covid, 195 million . My opinion , it was probably worth about 300 million and now probably about 425 million . So not only did he short-sale it, not that he -- he didn't even tell this particular body, prior to the sale would have receive d a settlement statement three days before closing , didn't tell the citizens of the city, taxpayers , didn't tell the media and he didn't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 tell this body. So I'm going to ask each one of you this evening , you have the ability to look at these documents -- trailing documents . What are you going to do about it if you see any wrongdoing? Are you going to go the Times? Are you going to go to local media sources ? What are you going to do as an elected official ? Each one of you that are sitting in those seats, men and women have appeared and sat in those very same seats before you. Many of them did the right thing. We have a railway system that's coming through here in the not so distant future. And I keep saying this. We have to be proactive . We cannot be reactive. All right, our streets are being taken over in blight. Recently we're taking police officers who are allowing them to move outside the city creating additional blight. All right. We're only as good as who we elect. I would like each one of you to state to the people and those who elected you where you stand on this. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Mancini . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council . The first thing I have here is Mr. Bolus donated these two flags to the city. He would like to give them to you, Mr. King, and maybe somebody will put them up, one is the Ukrainian flag and one is Israeli flag. MR. KING: Thank you and thanks to Mr. Bolus for donating those to the city. MR. MORGAN: He thought it was important to do that. And, you know, I hope that the city would replace the flags outside because they look a little tattered , but do as you please. The first thing I would like to hit on because the previous speaker talked about the sale of the Sewer Authority , look it, everybody knows that was a very corrupt deal. But you have to look at the PUC and a lot of other people that had their hands in all of this stuff and the way it was introduced and the way it was followed through . This Mayor that evidently later was found guilty of crimes, committed a lot of injustices against the residents of this city. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 And I lay all of our financial problems basically at the feet of Chris Doherty who absolutely looted this city when he was Mayor. And for all the people who were running around with these Restore the Pride signs in their yard, God help them. I hope they got counseling up to this point. And the other thing I have is, you know, finally the Mayor has responded to my complaint in federal court. Her attorney has reached out to me on G-mail. And the most amazing thing is that I gave a written request to the Council . And I gave a written request to the Mayor, which is my right as a citizen to address my form of government to ask them to rectify things that I think is a problem . But, you know, when a mayor locks you out of City Hall, refuses to return calls, may not be competent and then doesn't want to go to court against a truck driver who's managed to go file some documents in federal court, you know, I just find it that that really proves just how broken our government really is. See it for what it is. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 I mean, look at our city. Look at our country . It's in complete decline . You could see it everywhere you look. This isn't a secret to anybody here. Look at the pool project we're talking about today, just totally out of this world. I mean, no concession . We like to have ice skating in the winter time. I don't know why the splash pool can't second as an ice skating rink in the winter. I don't know why we can't try to develop much larger pools that we're talking about because anything less 1,500 people isn't even worth building . The last pool never had the capacity it needed either. And the most troubling thing is, we're building it with grant money because the city won't invest in itself. The city hasn't invested in itself in so long it's ridiculous . And the people, they've walked away. I know a lot of people who shut the door on their house and just left it there. That doesn't tell you that the people have any faith in their government. I don't have any in Scranton government because I've come to these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 meeting s for almost 40 years. I saw a lot of politics . I've seen a lot of longwinded Council people that in the end did absolutely nothing except more harm to the resident s than the previous Council . And where are we really going here? And the last thing I have here is that, you know, some people may not appreciate when I say from time to time. But if you expand where you get your news from you'll find out now that the Israelis are complaining because the President of the United States wants a ceasefire himself . And when you look at atrocities that were committed against those people, it's absolutely ridiculous . And when you really see the news and see what the Chinese are doing -- you know, Mitch McConnell got up in the Senate and talked about the Iranians, okay, the Russian s and Chinese . They're pushing us right out of the world. And this guy is walking around and he can't even walk up a set of steps and doesn't even know where he is. And people are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 worrying about whether people are Democrats and Republicans , be very afraid. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Good evening , Council . I hope to see those flags out front when I look for a parking place. You know as I read last week's paper of Kelly's account of his admiration of his newfound friend, Dominick Sunad{phonetic } I found it more of an apologetic excuse for Sunad's continual never ceasing letters that appear in this paper. I don't know, for maybe two in the last couple years anyway against Israel and the Jewish people. But he always has his undying unadulterated support for the evil, vile bunch that attacked Israel. This is Kelly's newfound friend. Kelly finds me a bigot for my opposition to all this illegal filth that has overcome this country . But if you have a poison pen, use it. And it's your opinion . It doesn't matter. I said I've sent letters in three paragraphs and they censor it and take a paragraph out and then it sits there for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 months. I just don't see a difference between an opinion and not printing letters . I've heard probably since the school was built a dozen people tell me their letters were lost to the editor. This man seeks sympathy for those in Gaza, forgiveness . Now, what we have is the perpetrators are the victims . That's ridiculous . All of these people on the streets because of our open door policy, I could almost guarantee they're clothed , fed, and housed by American taxpayers . Things have just gotten completely out of hand. It's for the worst. The real Americans are stifled and being put in jail. But what one of Kelly's deliberate falsehoods was the accusation that the Jewish forces destroyed homes and businesses and stores out there, leave of Gaza. This is totally unfounded . It's a deliberate lie because the intentions were to leave everything intact as much as they could because it would appease the incoming occupant s. Maybe somebody would appreciate it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Well, you know, it's a great sadness . And I think Kelly's slop he put in the paper about these people is outrageous . It's just -- I think Mr. Kelly just impersonates a writer or something . If he wasn't, I think he'd be in New York City like some of the other people that came from this area. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident and homeowner . I'd like to thank Bob Bolus for donating those two flags. I thought that was a very nice gesture . And I hope they're display ed and not just thrown in a drawer somewhere . Next thing, well, for a long time now Norma Jeffries has talked about street signs. And someone brought up about possibly putting decals on them to save money. And I know that's something that the city can do. I know from experience because about two years ago there was an 18 wheeler lost in my neighborhood .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 They're not suppose d to be in my neighborhood . There's signs. And they tore the wires off my house along with the street sign. When the new street sign was put up it said was Bulwer Street and North Rebecca Street. It should have been Rebecca Avenue. And I came here and DPW put a decal over where it said street and made it avenue. So we could use decals. It's been done. It's right on my corner. Next thing, last week I was watching the meeting and Marie Schumacher comment ed on a dog that was lost and people put signs up and the dog was found. And Marie said that she and her young friend took the initiative to go around taking all the signs down. I thought that was very nice on her part. We need more people thinking about where they live to do stuff like that. That was really -- she didn't have to do that. That was a really nice gesture for her to do it. Next thing, there was a pothole I wanted to talk about tonight , but on my way here tonight I see it was filled in. It was 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 under the railroad bridge on Main Avenue that the trucks are always getting stuck under. Last year -- not last -- last week in the dark I hit that pothole . So I was going to come tonight and talk about it but I went by this morning and it was still a pothole . But coming here tonight it was filled in, whether that was PennDOT or the city, I don't know. But I would like to thank whoever did it because it was a pretty big pothole . I know Main Avenue is a state road, but probably the DPW did it. I don't know for a fact. Next thing, lately I've heard talk about nonprofits . And I've come to this podium for 15, 20 years and talked about how nonprofits don't give the city enough. For all the taxpaying properties that the University of Scranton took off the tax rolls, they don't pay anything compare d to what they should be paying. And I said that years ago when Chris Doherty was in office. I complained that he was letting them get away with murder. We got to step up and make these nonprofits pay more. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 It's ridiculous . The U is taking half the city over. It's unbelievable the buildings they took off the tax rolls. They got to do more to try to help the city. What they give us is a drop in the bucket compare d to what they make. That's all I have tonight . Thank you for your time. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Spindler . John Howe. MR. HOWE: Good evening , Council . My name is John Howe, resident , taxpayer , Scranton , independent candidate for City Council two-year seat. I come here tonight for two reasons . First, to get a phone call from a friend who has a handicap parking situation where she's calling the Scranton Police after hours where the Parking Authority is no longer in office. People are halfway parking in her handicap spot to where she now needs to walk up the hill to get on the bus in the morning to be able to get to her treatments . Last night Scranton Police showed up and said bring it to City Council because there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 is no ordinance on us to have to ticket them. So here I am on her behalf. Mr. Voldenberg -- MR. KING: Mr. Howe, do you have an address for that? MR. HOWE: I don't have it readily . I would have to get it. I believe she contacted Mr. Voldenberg today. MR. VOLDENBERG : I have all the information from this afternoon . I'll follow up with everyone tomorrow . MR. HOWE: So I just wanted to make sure I followed through on what I said and I would touch base with City Council on that. Thank you for that. Now for the second reason I'm here, I find myself at a crossroad. As you know, elected officials , there's a certain duty that you have to the citizens . And, Mr. Smurl, it seems like you want to skirt the duty and call me a clown. Well, here I am with my big nose and big shoes. Why don't you debate? The people deserve to know what you're going to do for the future. You do great when it comes to talking about the pool with your buddies for five lots 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 you did last week. Landscaping is awesome . I appreciate it. City appreciate s it. It's much needed. But what are your actual plans? Why won't you step up and have civil discourse with somebody . I'm nobody who's anybody special . You could probably demolish me in a debate. But why not give the people what they deserve and what's a time honored tradition of politic s in America . It's the lynchpin of American politics . Do you feel that you are above me, above the taxpayers , what they need? Or do you believe that just your tenure of being Gerald Smurl HVAC technician , owner, business guy is going to be enough just to get you the seat and get you the votes. I'm not looking to, you know, have you have a drawn out conversation . I understand when I got the response s you're busy. You're a busy man as all Council members are. We have two Council members who are showing up this Thursday to a debate. I know you guys have very busy schedules . And for that, I'm willing to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 accommodate . Give me a time, any place that suits your needs and we could give the people what they deserve . That is a part of this job. That is a part of what you were appoint ed to. You weren't elected, Mr. Smurl. Now it's time to put your money where your mouth is and your signs say a little less talk, a lot more action. Give them what they deserve , okay, not ignore me on social media. This is day six now of me being polite and asking. Give me a time. Give me a place. This is just civil discourse. This is the heart of American politics . This is the heart of Scranton . Do we not deserve that? Miss Rothchild , Mr. McAndrew , they'll be there Thursday night. You guys are busy. I know that you guys have jobs, families . But it's what is deserved. What is your plans? What is the ideas for the future and that way we could hold you accountable if you do become elected and you backtrack. You know, it's just -- it's a way of being accountable , transparency . So I'm willing to -- you could reach out to me, call me, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 message me, Facebook , phone number, social media, it's everywhere . E-mail, John dot Howe 1014 at G-mail. I will accommodate . I will switch my schedule around to give the people what they deserve , what they're owed. At that, I thank you all. Have a wonderful night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Howe. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . I'm going to start off tonight with the rules of Council . I think maybe each time before we start Council that everyone should be require d to read the rules of Council . The one I just circled just now and maybe it doesn't fall under that it says -- where is it -- name calling . No person including members of Council shall use their time during citizens participation to personally insult or attack any individual . I'm not sure what that all is involved of attacking . But I don't think that any time we get here to the podium that we should address any of our comments to any 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 individual of the Council members . And, yes, you are all elected officials and you're all sitting there to help us as a citizens of Scranton , but I just felt that that little caveat that you have there in the Council rules, you know, you should be restated. MR. KING: Thank you, Norma. Just so you know, if I felt like Mr. Howe was attacking Mr. Smurl, I would have stopped it. But I think he was just -- MS. JEFFRIES : Well, I'm just not a confrontational person. And when I hear things like that -- not only Mr. Howe just other times. MR. KING: No, I get it, believe me. I'm not afraid to use the gavel. I felt he was being respect ful and just, you know, making a request of Mr. Smurl. Thank you. MS. JEFFRIES : Okay. The things I had on my list to talk about tonight was our streets again. I don't understand . We have a list of the streets that were supposed to be paved this -- over this past summer, I guess. And then they also went around and patched 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 different areas. I know they patched in my area today. So I can't understand why would they be patching now when we're going into winter when they're suppose d to be paving I thought during earlier this year. MR. KING: There was a fall list and there was a spring list. And I believe they only were able to get a certain number done, you know, during the fall. I know that the remainder on that list will be done in the spring. So I guess they're just trying to at least fill a couple potholes to get us through the winter and then -- MS. JEFFRIES : What happened for street paving? I thought mine was on for spring paving. MR. KING: Spring of this year? MS. JEFFRIES : I thought . MR. KING: No, I think the list that came out was the fall of '23 and the spring of '24. MS. JEFFRIES : Oh, I'll recheck it. MR. KING: I'm sorry, yeah.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 MS. JEFFRIES : But I was expecting my street to be repaved and it was not. So and I was also wondering about the street cleaning and where is the schedule for street cleaning . And I know that the leaves are falling and all, but I know that there is a schedule and I was just wondering about that as well. And, you know, when you think of all the things that the city has to do but as someone who had knee surgery and I'm very careful about where I walk, so when the streets have the gravel and that little cinder stuff, it's very difficult . And it's very easy for someone to slip and fall on that cinder. So that's why I bring it up. The other thing that I wanted to address tonight was I was glad I got here for the Nay Aug Park aquatic experience , which was a Council presentation tonight . I would have liked to have been included in the meeting s, Mr. Smurl. I thought I was suppose d to be at the meeting s. But, you know, so I was sort of surprised when I came in here tonight and saw that there was a presentation . Eileen was kind 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 enough to give me the printouts and I will go over them because there was a couple things I had a question -- I always want to be able to raise my hand during caucus. And I know that is not allowed , but one of the things that they were both able to address and I think, Dr. Rothchild , you address ed it as well was the difference between the operating experience and the maintenance . And they are two different things. But yet like you said, there's no line item on there. And it made sense when Eileen Cipriani was speaking , you know, they don't know what the maintenance is going to be once the pool is in there. But I do have the printout now and I'll probably -- I know I will be reading it and marking it up for some of the things that I consider should have been addressed in the presentation tonight . And who am I? I'm just a normal citizen but a concerned citizen about what's best and what I think should be in there. And I think when I speak I speak for not only myself but other residents of Scranton as well. So I thank you for the time tonight . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 MR. KING: Thank you, Mrs. Jeffries . That exhaust s our sign-in list. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard by Council ? MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne. At the pool presentation I found it quite interest ing that the first picture that was involved , when they showed the entire complex of where the pools were, the grand open space, the first pool was about 1/7th of the size of the original two pools. It's stuck down in the corner. And we have over 50 percent of what that area used to be being two general purpose courts and a bunch of pickleball courts. When I saw they were getting a million dollars -- I'm sorry, getting a million dollars , getting $50,000 plus 50 for the pickleball courts and knowing that pickleball courts cost about $9,000 to actually to put down, I wondered what was happening with that money and what was going on. It seems like a lot of money is going into planning and everywhere else other than I don't understand how a million dollars is necessary for eight pickleball courts and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 two basketball multipurpose courts. I'm not even sure we need that many to take up half of the area what that swimming pool area in Nay Park was. Sometimes it's nice when the facilities are separated so you have different activities in different parts of the park because when you go to a park you are suppose d to walk around it and look at the entire environment , not go to one specific spot, stay there for the day and leave. The entire park should have a purpose . So I don't know why we need six or eight pickleball courts specifically in that area. The second option offered about one-quarter of the space for the two pools, the ones that the two pools separate and it was about a quarter of the space that was used prior. I think that is really too small for the capacity and for the limited time that it's open. I understand that 5-B tonight is being fast tracked yet again as 5-B is a duplication of the one that was put forward last week and voted down before this body. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 I understand that it's not exactly because we've changed the end date. But I have no idea why we need a fast track rush to push something through that is retrospective in nature. It's already happened . It's already gone. There is no reason to go from fifth to sixth to seventh other than to push it down the throat without people looking at it. This should follow the normal path of procedure in this body. It shouldn 't be up when it was voted down to be put up again for a revote, especially not this year. I understand that's how we do things in this body now is when things are lost in vote we just vote them again until they go through . I hope Mr. Smurl does the same thing he did in the last vote and votes no, especially if the paperwork that was requested for what happened in these emergencies has not been brought forward . And if it is, please let us know in Fifth Order. Mr. Smurl stated that the pools were both leaking before closing and the large water loss was the decision to shut them down. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 I understand that. But the pool slides weren't that issue. As a member of the body who was on the board and working for those, how come the -- was the removal of the slides ever brought forward to you, Mr. Smurl, or to anyone in the body before it was taken down. And if you were blindsided by it because it was not brought to you, how come this has not been addressed publically since at that point if the body who was in control of it did not authorize it, why hasn't the Mayor been brought to task on doing something that was beyond her power. Do you have an explanation for that? MR. SMURL: When I was -- the pool -- the slides were taken down, I was unaware of that. But after that when I had left the board and it hadn't been addressed any further . MR. COYNE: Why not? The Mayor does not have the authority for that pool complex . It's the board once it's done, correct ? MR. SMURL: Well, the Rec Authority runs the day-to-day operations of the park. But the city actually owns the park. So I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 don't know what would make it right or wrong for taking it down. I disagree it was taken down. I wasn't in town when it was taken down. MR. COYNE: If the city runs it exclusively and closing , why do we have a board? The board is there to make the rules and regulations and operations specifically of that. If the Mayor does that, we don't need a board. No reason for two heads. Boards are suppose d to have authority over what they own in their domain. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Coyne. Is there anyone else who would like to be heard? MR. LITTLE: Hello, Council . I'm Rick Little and I would like to talk about protections for the elderly and disabled in Scranton Housing Authority and how to preserve your home. I've discovered that there is a lot of litigation going through the magistrate court which is a court of no records . I'm trying to figure that out. Anyway, there -- most of the people being evicted are being evicted for lease violations . I would like to tell the elderly and disabled that if you receive that to look 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 at Section 10 of your lease because all city and county agencies , everything , the police, the code enforcement is supposed to go is your right under your lease, yet they are sidetracking that. And I've discovered legislation recently that Scranton Housing Authority doesn't have a rental license . Yet they are using the district attorneys and the courts and the agency on aging and everything to get rid of people. And it's unjust, unfair. I'd like to emphasize the importance of everybody who lives in public housing and everybody who cares about their city and county to please vote in the local election that's coming up on November 7th. There is fast -- deadlines coming for mail-in voting. And the voting around here takes place at the high school this year rather than in the elderly housing . You have to make -- you have to make sure you are registered to vote and you vote for the people that I believe having lived in Scranton Housing for 14 years that are going to protect your rights and that includes Tom 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 Schuster , Mark McAndrew and Marc Pane for City Council . And in the Lackawanna County Commissioners vote, I believe that Chris Chermak and I believe her first name is Diane Campbell are the people in the County Commissioners that you have to put in because a lot of people have been in these offices for years and years. And there's -- it's just driving the city into the toilet. So you have to vote in these local elections . Once people think elections are, you know, either Republican or Democrat and based on the presidential thing. But it's very important to understand that your rights under your lease, under the Pennsylvania Constitution , under everything is to vote because if you get -- they just hand out, you know, you're evicted for violating the terms of the lease. And they never gave me a lease. I had to dig it up. But it's -- it's right there in the lease. And my lease has provisions for grievance procedure s which they've never done. And they've never include d those grievance 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 procedures every time I go to the magistrate court to review it. And these courts are, you know, it's all business . It's all Pennsylvania Criminal Procedure . And if you're not a lawyer, they are not going to listen to you. So please register to vote and vote for the right people, Chris Chermak , Campbell , Marc Pane, Tom Schuster and Mark McAndrew . Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Little. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. LAFRANCE : Good evening , Council , thanks for having me, Pat LaFrance , Scranton resident . I came up here last week and I spoke. I said what I thought was happening to me and I left. I ended up minutes later on that chair that after I spoke at the podium and I had three people who I don't know -- maybe it's the same person using three different social media -- I don't know. But I had three different people I don't know contact me and give me information on what's going on. And it's not good. It's not good at all. There's -- there's people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 screaming to get information out from inside this building and some of them are being hushed. Some time in April -- no, I'm going to say June. Some time in June I filled out a permit for my house to do some technical work in my second floor bathroom . I wanted to do the work. The permit went through -- the application went through the permit office. And Mr. Marino -- one of the Marino brothers caught the application and asked Mr. Oleski can a homeowner do this type of work. And when that was asked I sent a legal pad this size, a sketch of everything I wanted to do in my bathroom , every measurement that's in my bathroom I sent it in. And my permit was approved within 20 minutes , I believe . So I went ahead and I did that stuff. And in the meantime I had an altercation -- a road rage altercation with a Scranton contractor . And that was the day I got invited to the party here. And if he had checked my resume he'd have known people don't invite me to parties for a reason. When I get to parties I raise the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 atmosphere and sooner or later I run into somebody I have friction with. And when I got involved down here Tom Oleski tried to show me his muscle and keep me quiet. And I look at that as a turn-on. That excited me. I'm now his friend forever . And we're going to have fun. So anyway, I notified the City of Scranton through these permits, specifically Robin Selemba and Tom Oleski. I told them that the power on my second floor has been shut off since 2015. The meter was taken in 2020. I stated that on one of my permit notes. They know that for weeks now. Robin Selemba is the manager of the rental registration , whatever . She is sending me letters threatening me, threatening me with I'm not in compliance with the rental registration order. So then I go and I file appeal against Oleski. I filed the appeal yesterday against my permit denial. And I would like to know I filed that appeal against Mr. Oleski, the leader of the zoning department . How does he get my appeal today -- he get ahold of it and he gives 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 me a phone call and says, "Pat, come pick up your permit. Your permit's ready. I approved your permit here. Come pick that up and you could take this appeal and your check. And you could have your $300 too." Not me, babe. I'm not that guy. We're going through with this. They gave me -- Tom Oleski and the other girl, they gave me an opinion -- their opinion on a law that didn't have anything to do with me. So I'm going to give you my opinion right now. The Mayor was involved in something , her and her administration . The permit office knew about this and they were keeping records . They returned these records over to their friend who happens to be a Scranton contractor . That contract or went to the Mayor and showed his hand and said, look, what I got. I got you. The Mayor didn't do nothing . That guy went to the permit office and he abused the permit office and the rights of it since then. And he's gotten so big in the permit office, nobody could do nothing to him now. There are people inside this building screaming out. And 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 they are getting fired. They are being hushed. Somebody 's got to look into this. This is -- how does this guy get -- he gets an appeal and he calls me and he says let's sweep this under the rug? I don't know. That's got to be illegal . MR. KING: Thanks, Mr. LaFrance . MR. LAFRANCE : Thank you. MR. KING: Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . We hear quite a bit about Gaza and all that rage was horrendous . But currently there is about 5,000 casualties in Gaza. I don't want to take a side for anybody . But I think it's time that both of those parties get new leadership . You can't just keep going at it and dragging the world into it. And, of course, Iran is in the picture and, by the way, they are heavily aligned with comrade Putin. So I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't have his little stringy thingy in there with the puppets. And, you know, they'll throw up a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 smoke screen and we'll forget about Ukraine . There's a few people in Congress that think we should switch the -- but at any rate, even as early as -- which it was more than a hundred years ago, World War I, one in five, only one in five deaths and casualties were people in uniform . The rest are just normal people, a bomb hit here or artillery shell. Germans had a cannon that fired 155 miles or something like that, and they hit -- on Sunday morning they hit a cathedral . So, you know, this has to stop and certainly we don't have the resources with how stretched out we are to keep taking sides. It's not in our best interest . The only thing in our best interest is that both parties stop and learn how to solve their problems . That swimming pool was up again, the issue. And we're talking about replacing the swimming pool so it looks like down at Weston Field. And I would hope that any kind of study would include the cost of repairs and if it's considerably less, then judging by the finances 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 of the city -- you know, we just got out of the distressed status. And I don't know, I almost wished that we stayed there. I almost wished we stayed there because it starts giving the ability to go into loans and this and that and back and forth and a lot of money gets spent. And we have 50 million dollars worth of parking garages from 15 years ago that don't have a great purpose . And by the way, back -- getting to our streetscapes or walkability or whatever , in New York City they have bike paths and rat free dumpsters occupying parts of the street. And a man with a food truck has to park his truck 30 blocks away from his neighborhood and hop the bus home. So it's things to consider . We don't need it. And as far as two-way streets , two ways avenues here, the right way to do it would be to have traffic signals on both sides. The traffic signal gives you the right to proceed , whereas many people are trying to beat that stop sign instead of the traffic signal. And that's when some real trouble could come in, you know, the rolling stop and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 it's just not -- as you get caught with a policeman behind you it's because you drove through a stop sign and hit somebody or caused an accident . I'd never get the money out of my car that it's really worth in transit value. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . You too. Is there anyone else that would like to be heard? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. KING: This evening we had an executive session to discuss litigation as it relates to the Shrainer {phonetic } lawsuit and NRS. Mr. Smurl, any motions or comments ? MR. SMURL: Yes, I do. First, I guess I have to answer this, but the way I run my campaign , it's not an agenda item, nor is it have anything to do with city business . And that's really why we are here. So it would be really inappropriate of me to discuss any of that, so I won't. The second thing, Mr. Coyne, you had a question on all of the emergency items. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 Mr. Schuster , I sent them in last week. I assume -- Tom, did you go over all the answers ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I was going to go over some of those. MR. SMURL: So I'll just leave that alone. So he has all of those answers for you. And the other thing, last Council meeting Len Srebro had asked us to go to and look at the flood area over on Meridian -- or I guess it was Merrifield . And we went in two separate groups so that it wouldn't look like it was a quorum or we had any kind of a public meeting . I, myself, and Council woman Rothchild went together . And we listened to all of their complaint s. And so what we did -- I just compiled down all of the complaints and things that myself and Jessica did. And we laid out a map of all the streets they had and where they thought the piping and stuff was to be changed . At some point they figured 24 inch piping was reduced and stuff. But anyway, we made this up for them. I thought Mr. Srebro would be here this evening but he's not. So and we actually went into the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 pump house and checked the pumps. Everything is in operating condition . It looks like there's a new pump there. And there's a new motor there and a bunch of new electric equipment but I guess because that was flooded . But anyway, Mr. Voldenberg , I will leave this with you if you could forward this to Mr. Srebro. And also if you would send this to the administration and ask them if they would forward it to a city engineer just to look at it to see if everything that they're looking for to repair that pipe and all of the other sewer lines and stuff that were connect ed over there if they would just look into that if that would help them. And that's all I have. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Smurl. Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. To followup on Keyser Valley, myself and Mr. McAndrew as well as Solicitor Gallagher did go over and meet with some of the residents in that area. Gary DiBileo from the county came as well and he brought one of the officials -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 the emergency response person from the county that came over with him as well. Two separate meeting s happened and myself at one meeting and Mr. McAndrew at another had request ed that Solicitor Gallagher take a look at as the taxing body of this city if Council can unilaterally move on some property tax rebates or forgiveness . So it's something that I've been thinking about recently. I know it's something that Mr. McAndrew has been thinking recently . I know some news came out that the Mayor has requested a meeting with the city -- between the city, the school district and the county. So I think at this point in time we're waiting to see what's come out of that. I would like to know who's been invited to that meeting. So, Mr. Voldenberg , if we can reach out and ask who's been invited to the meeting. I know at this point, I don't think any Council -- have any Council members been invited to this? MR. KING: I was invited, yes. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Is it possible as Chair of the Finance Committee if I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 could come as well, Mr. King? MR. KING: Yeah, I'll ask the people that invited me. Yeah, I don't have a problem as long as there is not three of us there. That's the key. MR. SCHUSTER : Out of that Keyser Valley meeting , I mean, I've been in the area several times since the flooding . I live in the Keyser Valley. But one of the main things that I wanted an update on, there was a meeting on Friday about the Briggs Street line that Mr. Smurl was just talking about about how many inches the line was that actually -- or at one point in time it went through the property so it carried water away. But now there might be a 90 degree angle in there. I don't think we've received any updates about how the meeting went on Friday and what came out of it. But if we could reach out to the administration to get the update from that meeting that occurred on Friday over that Briggs Street pipe. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. So let's see, we did receive some responses to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 some questions today at 4:00. So I was going through that during the meeting . I request ed a list of -- it stated confidential city vehicles provided to Council members . The administration is in receipt of this request . The information will be forthcoming . And Miss Andippan does not drive a city vehicle . It was included in that. There was a -- we've been getting repeated requests for the fire department contract to be put on the website . And we did get a response that it's progress . The document is currently being worked on by labor counsel -- same answer we've got in the past -- for the city and the union. This is a lengthy process as the comprehensive document has not been completed since 1996. Labor counsel s are actively working on the issue and are scheduled to meet again next month. Mr. Voldenberg , can we ask the administration if we could get a break down of the cost of the labor counsel that had specifically worked on just this contract ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. The 1300 block of North Sumner Avenue, it is -- it does appear to be a court. But it is the 1300 block of North Sumner Avenue. I did get some calls about some complaint s over there as this section of the street is blocked off by two large flower pots similar to the ones at Nay Aug. They're I'd say several hundred to a thousand pounds a piece. And they do block this alley. After some research Mr. Voldenberg did discover this is not a vacated street that has been blocked off and the flower planters were moved. But today's e-mail it comes back, please be advised that the DPW moved the planters the week of 10/17. However , residents are now complaining about the moved planters and would like them moved back to North Sumner. Mr. Voldenberg , Katie Kennedy sent us this e-mail. Can we ask Katie Kennedy for her legal opinion of whether this street is vacated ? And if it's not vacated how we can block a city street when there's residents above it that do not have access when the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 street is blocked ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask for her opinion . MR. KING: Mr. Schuster , someone reached out to me as well from over in that area. I think there's a Paul Harvey version of this in the Rest of the Story. I think we want to look into it a little bit further because I think there's a debate over of what exactly happened there. And I believe that those planters were placed in there back in the -- maybe during the Doherty administration . And I just want to make sure we heard both sides before the ultimate decision . MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I mean, where I'm going with this is it's not a vacated city street and the street is blocked . The situation arose when there was street work done either by the gas or the water company near the bottom of the street and resident s had to park at the bottom and move up to their homes. And if there was ever an emergency at the top, it could be a major issue. So, yeah, I do think there's -- I'm looking at it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 from a legal aspect is it a vacated city street and what kind of -- MR. VOLDENBERG : Mr. Smurl, the City Planner determined it is not a vacated street. MR. SCHUSTER : It is not a vacated street. MR. VOLDENBERG : So the planters were illegal . MR. SCHUSTER : If this Law Department can give us their opinion on why a nonvacated street would be blocked . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it, sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. When it comes to the emergency declaration for the last two weeks I asked about some actions that have been taken under that emergency declaration . And where I was going with that was, I want to determine the costs that we were expending with these project s. So we did get a list of actions that were taken under the 14 day emergency declaration and a lot of the information we got back -- which I was happy to have was about, you know, six recovery and outreach events 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 events that happened proceed ed by a county organized multiagency and response and things like that. But what I was specifically asking for was the actual actions that we've taken that have cost the city money or we've expended funds on. So include d in the e-mail from today it said that there's contracts for Pennsy for emergency paving, rubbish for storm debris removal , acquiring properties at Market and Yard. But can we reach out and ask for the specific actions that have taken place that have used city funds so the costs of the actions that we've taken under our emergency declaration ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. That is all for tonight . MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild ? MR. SCHUSTER : Oh, excuse me, one more thing. To answer Mr. Mancini would I like to see the documents , yes, I would like to see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 the documents . Sorry, that's all. MR. KING: Thank you. Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. I'll start with that question as well. I would also like to see the documents . I have a number of things tonight . First, I would like to speak on our agenda tonight Item 7-G. I had some concerns that come up along from neighbors about this piece of legislation and the addition of utility poles on their street. And I don't think it's quite clear on the number of utility poles and I just want to make sure we cross our T's and dot our I's with this because we've had issues with utility poles being install ed in the city in the past. So I would like to actually make a motion to table Item 7-G. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: There's been a motion to table Item 7-G and a second. On the question ? I'll speak on the question . I had some neighbors reach out to me as well with concerns . I don't think that documentation provide d by PPL gives us enough information in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 terms of the size of these poles, in terms of how much to each side of these poles, where exactly they're going to be cutting through properties , are they going to be near the new Lackawanna Heritage Valley Trail. I'm just concerned about affecting people's property values and really getting some details about the height of these, you know, are they the big huge massive rusty poles that look terrible ? Are they going to be stuck in the middle of our neighborhoods ? Like, I'd like to have those answers before we pass this legislation . DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree also it is noted in there about having to clear out 25 feet on either side of the pole of trees. So how many trees are going to have to be taken down as a result of this? MR. SCHUSTER : So I would have to agree with you -- both of you. So what, we're going to ask for specific questions regarding the specs of the project and the locations of the poles? MR. KING: Correct . That's what I would hope, yes.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 MR. SCHUSTER : I think they should have -- PPL should have a schematic of it that we could get. MR. KING: And in here they kind of provide a crude drawing . But also, there is a note that indicates , oh, if you have any further question s or details, you could reach out to PPL. Well, we're going to be reaching out as far as I'm concerned as long as three people vote for that. MR. SCHUSTER : I'm in agreement . MR. KING: Okay. So there's been a motion. It's been seconded to table 7-G and since it's in Seventh Order, we should do a roll call on that: So if you're in favor of tabling 7-G you would say aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. KING: We're going to do a roll call. I just want to clarify . MS. CARRERA : Mr. Smurl. MR. SMURL: Aye. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MS. CARRERA : Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 MS. CARRERA : Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Aye. 7-G is tabled. Thank you. DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I have a number of other things to bring up as well. And I'll have these forward ed to Mr. Voldenberg too. There is a complaint about a property at rear 621 Alder Street. And it's been empty for several years. It's overgrown with grass and vines. And there's cat problems and other animal issues going on at that property . And the neighbor believe s they've received door tags. There's, you know, and tickets at that property but nothing 's been done. So I'm curious to see if it's going to the magistrate or where it stands now if you could check in on that one. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And we got a thank you from a resident who had a complaint about 717 Harrison Avenue that I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 brought forward . That's been cleaned up and that was quickly rectified . So the neighbor really wanted to thank Mike Doherty who is the code enforcement officer for the Hill for helping in taking care of that. And I had a request and I believe we've gotten this request in the past. They're for crosswalks to be painted at Green Ridge and Wyoming over near the library and also near St. Paul's School on Penn Avenue there is safety concerns in those areas with pedestrians . So it's really important to the neighborhood that they get those crosswalks repainted. I know that the timeline might be shortened with colder weather coming in, but I'd like to make that request of DPW to see if that's possible to get completed . MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll submit that tomorrow . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And I have good news for Mr. Raines. He's not here tonight . But I did receive word that American Water is going to do the Monroe Avenue project before the end of 2023. So I was really happy to hear that that the city, you know, discussed 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 the matter further with Pennsylvania American Water to get that done as quickly as possible and prioritized , so fingers crossed that it happens and that street is paved and his issues are taken care of. And something else I had brought forward and just want to provide an update on and like additional complaint s from neighbors about some of the utility projects that are going on in the Hill Section right now and Prescott Avenue being one of them. The pave cut inspector -- I'm not sure if they've gotten out there yet or if they were going to be getting out there to make sure to rectify that issue. And also Myrtle Avenue, there's been some problems with the construction taking place there. One resident was concerned about the noise levels for the school because it's right near Prescott Elementary School. And it's also been going on in the later evening hours up to 11 p.m., so definitely want to get someone out there to monitor the project and make sure they are operating within the hours that's in the ordinance . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Thank you. And 723 Miller Avenue, that's been inspected and cleaned up based on what I received . And just wanted to note that I appreciate the architect coming in tonight to discuss the different options for Nay Aug Pool. As of now, I'm leaning towards the second option with the separate pools and facilities . I'm a lot happier with what we were present ed with tonight compared to in the past the earlier designs from the other company . And I think that this will, you know, be a better plan moving forward . And I'm happy to see that it's happening and that, you know, the city is going to put money towards it and looking forward to having a pool and those facilities back at Nay Aug. I think that it could really be a great recreational complex and I think we're thinking about the big picture with this. And just to reiterate on the points from Councilman Smurl and Councilman Schuster about meeting with the neighbors within the Keyser Valley, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 think, you know, it was really important that we were there and that we were able to identify those different problem areas with the neighbors . And they know their neighborhood best and they were there that night and witnessed what occurred . And it was even though many of them came during a meeting a couple weeks ago, it was good to hear from them then. You know, they showed us like picture s and videos. And it's just, it is terrifying what they went through and anything that we could do as a city to prevent it from happening again we should. And I did early on provide support for an initiative to provide tax relief for the flood victims , the people involved when the Mayor was here a few weeks ago and had asked her about it. So I'm happy to see that the city is planning on meeting with the county and the school district to see if that could take place within all of those bodies. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 Mr. McAndrew . MR. MCANDREW : Okay, so first up, a couple concerned resident s from Green Ridge came to me. And their concern is that they need help with crosswalk s. And they're desperately needed at the library and Wyoming and Green Ridge near St. Paul's School on Penn Avenue. They're afraid there's going to be a tragedy with some kids there. So, Mr. Voldenberg , would you please contact DPW with this concern and see if they could take care of this for us? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Secondly , I was up at Keyser Valley last week with some of my colleagues there. And the first thing they told me, they said, you know, there was a guy here and his name was Dennis Zackawatiwicz {phonetic } I don't know. I might be killing his name. But he was some type of manager from the city but he must be from the engineering group. And he was shown the area -- the biggest point of contention up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 there that they keep bringing to us and I believe them because they're aware of the effects of this pipe that no longer connects to Keyser creek on Briggs Street or empty into Keyser creek. MR. SCHUSTER : Runs through to the other side of the tracks. MR. MCANDREW : On Briggs Street, yeah. So and it was determined there was a gentleman there who has all of these maps from the 50s. This guy is a lifelong resident there. He knows the affects before this pipe was an issue and after. So and I brought this up a couple weeks ago. I said, you know, I'm glad you told us about a meeting because none of us were aware this meeting was going to take place the next day. And this gentleman said, yeah, we'll bring up this issue. And the neighbors are led to believe and I believe them that because of this -- I mean, the storm was horrendous . We all know that. But because of this pipe issue that no longer continues to Keyser creek, there's four drains on that street to come up.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 And they believe that contribut ed to all the houses that were lower and were underwater. So this can't wait for the construction phase and the planning phase, right, so we did get something back. And I'm assuming that this is from the meeting that was held on Friday. Mr. Voldenberg , is it from administration ? MR. VOLDENBERG : I would assume -- MR. MCANDREW : Well, we can double check. The answer is, the city will work with GPI Engineering firm to identify any potential immediate improvements that can be made. Fair enough. But as long as the improvements are not negatively impacting neighbor ing properties or street. Because where this issue lies is someone built a house a few years ago, took over this property that wasn't theirs and somehow disconnect ed or covered that. They're part of the problem . So to say, oh, we'll take a look at it but, you know, I don't know, we might do something if it doesn't negative ly impact neighbor ing properties or street conditions . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 Guess what? It's the cause. So I don't think the people of Keyser Valley want to hear this is the answer. We can't wait. And that was the biggest thing they said to me. My biggest takeaway was we can't let this happen again. So if they're going dabble back and forth and think about I'm afraid of infringing on someone 's property -- all of these others were destroyed . I need to -- please, Mr. Voldenberg , this answer we received I want to know if this is the answer from the meeting that occurred on Friday. And if so, I want to know when they're going to make a decision and when they're going to fix this. This is a vague answer that I'm not happy with. And I know the resident s of Keyser Valley will not be happy with this answer because it's not an answer. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get more information , sir. MR. MCANDREW : All right. Thank you. So next up -- and this relates to Mr. Mancini's question that he posed to us. Three years ago I'm on vacation in Cape May, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 had a great time. I'm at an establishment with some family members . And we're talking and a gentleman and his wife sitting across from us goes, hey, you must be from Scranton . I said, how did you guess? He said, I don't know, I could just tell by the way you talk and you guys interact. I said, why, where are you from? He goes, well, I have spent some time in Scranton but I'm originally from Harrisburg . I said, yeah, where you do work? And he goes, I work for American Water. I said, really? And I said, well, I'm on Scranton City Council . And really, I know this sounds like a Councilman walks into a bar with an American Water employee . But it's not a joke. This is true. I said really, I said, well, yeah, thanks a lot buddy. He goes, you know what the problem was. I said, yeah, I said, first of all, you were suppose d to take care of stormwater . He said that was part of the deal. We were willing to do that but it didn't happen. He said, but, buddy, you know what 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 happened . I said, what. He said, all the lawyers got the money. So with that said prior to that and this came -- I'm not going say his name but this came from an employee . He's still an employee . But prior to that I was in favor of an audit, voted on it, voted on a letter being sent to the Auditor General . Am I still in favor of that, yes. So to answer your question , do I want to see them documents , of course, I do more than ever. What measures would I take, whatever necessary . So I hope we could still do this. I know we're waiting for an emergency meeting to move this forward . I think we need to do this once and for all because we're a laughingstock . That guy was laughing . He turned it into a joke but it's the truth. And I think that is all I have. Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few items here responses for Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton Sewer Authority advised today as you heard earlier the special meeting schedule d for this afternoon was cancelled due to lack of quorum. The meeting is tentatively 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 schedule d for -- is it this, Thursday , Frank, October 26th at 5:30, okay, in the Governor's Room. Okay, regarding the CBA contracts on the city website , the city law department advised that it's in progress . The document is currently -- you're not going to be happy with the answer -- the document is current ly being worked on by labor counsel for the city and the union. This is a lengthy process . It's a comprehensive document , has not been completed since 1996. The labor counsels are actively working on this issue and they're scheduled to meet again next month. For Doris, there was -- she had inquired about the satellite dishes. There is no requirement in the city zoning ordinance that satellite dishes located on property roofs or yards be removed . The meeting with Mayor feature in the city will continue in November and December . Dates and times will be schedule d in advance via the city website and social media. Submitted follow up request for curb cuts at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2575 Olive Street and Colfax Avenue and East Gibson Street and Colfax Avenue, she's been asking for that for about a year now so I think we really need to try to expediate that if we could, Frank. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. KING: And sent a request for tree trimming near the stop sign at Wheeler Avenue and Myrtle Street. Also for Mark Scarinci , ABM parking research ed noise complaint in regard to the pedestrian exit warning alarm. I think that's out here on Mulberry Street. This is a safety feature to warn pedestrians of the exiting garage traffic . In the event there's a line of vehicles exiting the Mulberry exit, this alarm is designed to sound while a vehicle is still on the detection loop. Also the city fire trucks must alert traffic at the intersection of emergency vehicles passing through that intersection in the city. Also to answer Mr. Mancini , I appreciate you asking about my health. Thank you. And I am for that as well. I would like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 to see those documents . I think that is important . Also, we talked about tax relief. There's going to be a meeting with the three bodies. I just want to say on the record that regardless of what comes of the meeting with the county or with the school district , I think that the city, like, I want to do it regardless of whether those other two taxing bodies provide stormwater relief. I've been around long enough where even though I was not an elected official . I was an appoint ed official as a superintendent of schools where we granted LERTAs. We granted KOZs and people had tax relief for years. And to think that we won't provide some type of tax relief for those people who through no fault of their own got devastate d by the stormwater , I'll gladly go to those meetings. I'll participate in them. And I'll encourage the other taxing bodies to do so and take some action. But I want it on the record regardless of what they say, if they say no, if they say yes, I want to see this body take some action with respect to that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. King, if you would like to make a motion tonight to have Solicitor Gallagher start unilateral legislation from Council , I would second that motion. MR. KING: I don't know that as Council President I'm allowed to make a motion. MR. MCANDREW : You can't make a motion. You could make it. MR. KING: Someone else could make the motion. MR. SCHUSTER : I would make a motion that we have our solicitor start looking into and researching how we can as Council unilaterally provide property tax relief for the affected areas in the City of Scranton . DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. MCANDREW : Second. MR. KING: So there's been a motion to have our solicitor -- there's been a motion and a second to have our solicitor to look into developing some legislation that will provide tax relief to those individuals who were greatly affected , lost their properties , what have you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 I guess it would have to be determined to what level or who would qualify for that but to develop some legislation to bring back to this body to authorize some tax relief for those victims of the most recent flooding that occurred in September . I think it was September 9th. On the question ? All those in favor say aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. KING: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. KING: Also, I do want to thank, you know, obviously I wasn't here two weeks ago. I had some serious surgery , first time in my life any surgery of any kind and kind of a scarey situation . And my colleague s and everyone and some people here in the audience had reached out to me during this time. I couldn't participate two weeks ago due to the surgery and then last week I participated from home because I could do it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 from home but I couldn't do it here as a result of recover ing from that surgery . And I'm still, quite frankly , not over it. But I'm thrilled to be here. I'm thrilled to be healthy . I'm thrilled to be participating back and happy to be in these chambers tonight and serving the people of the City of Scranton . That is all I have for now. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. FOR INTRODUCTION – AN ORDINANCE – RATIFYING THE EXTENDED LOCAL DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY ISSUED BY THE OFFICE OF THE MAYOR AND AUTHORIZING THE OFFICE OF THE MAYOR TO EXERCISE AND ENFORCE THE EMERGENCY POWERS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE HEALTH, WELFARE , AND SAFETY OF THE CITIZENRY OF THE CITY OF SCRANTON AS A RESULT OF THE LOCALIZED FLOODING THAT OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2023 THROUGH OCTOBER 20, 2023. MR. KING: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. KING: On the question ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2580 MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , last week I said very similar things. We did get some of the answers that I was looking for in regards to actions taken during the emergency declaration . But what I was looking for was the project s that we complete d and the associated cost of those actions . So tonight again I'm going to request a list of the actions that have been complete d with the associated cost so we know what kind money has been spent under this order. I do know that it's going to be moving into sixth and seventh . I'll move it from fifth to sixth and sixth to seventh , but I would like to hold it up until we get those costs that are associated .
