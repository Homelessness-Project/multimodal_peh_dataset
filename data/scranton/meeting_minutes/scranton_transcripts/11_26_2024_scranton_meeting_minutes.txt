LACKAWANNA COUNTY PLANNING COMMISSION SUBDIVISION AND LAND DEVELOPMENT EVALUATION REPORTS RECEIVED NOVEMBER 21, 2024. 3.J. PETITION RECEIVED FROM SCRANTON EAST MOUNTAIN RESIDENTS TO HAVE SCRANTON FIRE DEPARTMENT ENGINE 10 REMAIN ON EAST MOUNTAIN . MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : I just have one comment on, you know, Council -- each of the members of Council here have verbalized their support for keeping Engine 10 on East Mountain . So I'm glad to see that a petition was started 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 by the residents there. So I commend the residents of East Mountain on getting this petition together and getting it to Council . MR. KING: On the question , I'm sorry, I'll back up exactly what Mr. Schuster said. In fact, I signed the petition on my way into vote up on East Mountain . I've said this before. We all saw what happened when they pulled that fire station off of the mountain and we had a terrible fire on Froude Avenue. And it took them quite a long time to get a truck up there. If anybody saw what happened on Friday, you couldn't move on East Mountain . If there was a fire, there's no way a fire truck was getting up that mountain . Now, if it was on top, it could have gotten there. But you could not move on East Mountain on Friday. So if there were fires, a lot of people would have been in trouble if we did not have Engine 10 on top of that mountain . So I know that there's not a single person -- I've not met a single person on the East Mountain that wants to see that fire station moved off of the mountain . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 And it covers quite a broad spectrum . It comes all the way over past Oakmont Park. It comes right across 307 over to the top of East Mountain Road, crosses over past Mountain Lake all the way down past Howard Gardener on top of East Elm Street over to Cherry all the way down Moltke Avenue to the end. There's a lot of coverage there. There's two schools . There's churches . There's Temple Hesed is up there. There's a nursing home right across from Lake Scranton . So it's desperately needed. So I'm thrilled to see all the people come out and sign that petition because their voices have been heard. And we already passed, you know, we passed that resolution . And we're going to pass final -- we'll finalize it tonight hopefully to ensure -- and keep in mind we amended it. The original one didn't have the wording in there. We put the wording in there to ensure that even if it's relocated , it's going to be relocated on East Mountain and is close proximity to where it is right the now. So I'm thrilled about that. Thank you. Mr. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 Schuster . MR. MCANDREW : Also, I'm thrilled . So last week the 600 plus signatures on the petition was handed to me outside the door before I came in -- hand delivered to me before I came into last week's meeting . And I read the petition put not the names. I'm very proud of the 600 plus residents that care about their community up there. Their needs and wants have been heard. They've been heard. And, of course, we have listened . And we were behind them and keeping the firehouse on the mountain . And I'd also like to thank and say how proud I am of Jean Marie Warpus who spearheaded the petition and got it done very quickly and got it to us. So again, I applaud them. I'm very proud of them. And don't worry, you're going to be -- it's going to stay there. And, you know, after the study is done, then we get to pick or decide how the, building 's either going to be a new building or how they're going to retrofit the building that's there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 But to be honest with you, I'm in favor of a new building because I was up there. And it's very tight. The truck can barely get in and out. You can't work on the truck. So these are discussions that I'm sure we'll have later on. But once again, I'm very happy with this. And it's in motion. Please, the residents of the mountain , you know, this is going to be taken care of. So thank you again. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? If not, received and filed. Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So I'll start first of all, thanking the DPW, the Scranton Fire Department and the Scranton Police Department their swift response to last Friday's crazy snowstorm and serving the residents . Great job, everyone . Secondly , tomorrow 's, you know, Wednesday and then the day after that is Thanksgiving . So I'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving surrounded by family, friends and great food. Also, I was asked to report or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 announce that this Saturday at 4 p.m., there will be a Green Ridge neighborhood group's Christmas tree lighting at Pretzel Park. So they do a great job. And if you could get there, it's pretty cool. And also, I'd like to announce that Sunday, December 8th will be the 11th annual cookies for kids cancer McAndrew Family Bake Sale. What is it? It's a bake sale that we've been doing for 11 years. Why do we do it? Because the money raised helps kids with better treatment that's usually toxic. So all the money that normally goes to Cookies For Kids Cancer is to develop less toxic treatment for the poor kids that are fighting this horrible disease . And with that said, so we're mixing it up a little bit this year. Instead of just having great Christmas cookies , we're going to have Santa there. So it's Sunday with Santa. So we're going to have Santa Clause there. You could get your picture taken with Santa at the Career Technology Center. And the Digital Communication Class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 is a great bunch of kids are going to take your picture . The print production class with their students are going to print it for you. And it's free. So you get to have an ice cream sunday with Santa on Sunday. And then this year we also in the past we've sponsor someone local, God love him, and sometimes we're happy not being able to sponsor a local kid with cancer because we can't find one. And that's always a good thing. But this year we found one unfortunately . And we want to help him. So he's a local teenager from Mid Valley. His name is Eddie Kaufmann . This past October Eddie was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia despite Eddie being a model of health. In September he felt ill and something didn't seem right. He was sent to Children 's Hospital in Philly which led to his diagnosis . Eddie remains mentally strong and is battling -- he's a warrior -- through all of his treatments . He can't wait to come back stronger and even get back to his teammates at 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Roanoke College where he's a baseball star. He was a baseball star at Mid Valley, a golf star. So half of the money we raise -- and it's okay with this organization because we've done it in the past, will go directly to Eddie and the Kaufman family. So the other half of the money like I said raised will go directly towards research to fund pediatric cancer through Cookies For Kids Cancer. So again, I'm very proud of my family, my students and the community that always supports this. And once again, it is Sunday, December 8th from 12 to 2 at the Career Technology Center of Lackawanna County. Thank you. And that's all I have. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. So planned on saving it for Fifth Order but since Mr. McAndrew has already stated it, there as a quick response to the snowstorm on Friday. So I would like to thank DPW, the Scranton Fire Department and the police department , a lot of trees down and lines down that were cleared pretty quickly . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 Announcement for today is that the Department of Public Works will be closed on Thursday the 28th in observance of Thanksgiving . So please be advised that the Department of Public Works will be following -- will be working on Friday the 29th and working Saturday , the 30th as a makeup day so all trash and recycling will be one day behind this week. Thank you. MR. KING: I'd also like to thank Scranton Police Department , fire department , DPW on a surprise storm. That was one heck of a 1 to 3 inches that we got. I know I had 14 inches up on top of East Mountain . So it caught a lot of people off guard. And power, I know my power was out from four in the morning until probably 6:30. Some people had it far worse. I know over in West Mountain a number of people had it for a couple of days. So it was very challenging and our guys did a tremendous -- I don't want to say guys -- guys and women did a great job getting out there under difficult conditions in trying to get those roads open safely and just really 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 trying to keep everyone -- everybody safe and get the roads open so that people could get around. Also, this Saturday , is the Green Ridge Mile. It's the oldest road race in the City of Scranton . It's a one mile race. It starts up by Marywood on North Washington Avenue at 1 p.m. and takes -- if you're the winner it takes about 4 minutes and 20 seconds . And if you are in last place, maybe it's 15 or 17 or maybe 20 minutes . But it's a fun day out. It finishes at Andy Gavins, been attracting 250, 300 runners every year. It's a nice family event, a lot of kids out there so if anyone wants to come out and support that. I'm not sure who the funding is going to this year. But they always do it for a cause. So that's a good thing. And I'd like to thank everyone that was involved in the family to family program again this year that gave out all the meals and preparations for the meals today up at the Cultural Center. And I want to wish everyone have a Happy Thanksgiving . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 Fourth order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: First on our sign-in slip is Ant Marquise . MR. MARQUISE : Okay, so I'm doing this again for the community because we have more people who have shown up, okay? I come here tonight with a new approach . As I strive to become more organized with my political efforts as well as my work as an activist , I am no longer addressing the Council members . I am strictly speaking to the public and the region of Northeast PA as a whole. I've come to find if you want to get anything done -- listen, man, I'm telling you guys right now I'm dropping jewels -- if you want to get anything done within your community , you have to do it yourself , okay, if you want to get anything done, do it yourself , organize . No leader is perfect . But it is the initiative as well as the character that makes a great leader. As we all know, there is a homeless pandemic not only in Lackawanna County, but across the whole country . Now, I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 lived with these people so I could never look down on them. They are human just like you and I. I've come up with a solution to fight against the poverty in our country . As a musician and an activist , I've chosen to use my gifts and talents to raise funds and be able to provide the proper resources needed to help the homeless population . Now, again, this will not only be in Lackawanna County, I am touring the whole region of Northeast PA in hopes to give back to everyone in need. Eventually I will be financing a global tour to raise funds and fight against the poverty . I know that we have the budget to do more. We spoke about this earlier about an hour or so ago. But I know we have a budget to do more. Okay, we have immigrants with mental health issues as well as drug addictions coming into this country every day. And if we say we are leaders , then we need to do some -- we need to do more forward thinking when it comes to the people. Again, putting money into a pool can wait. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 This is not the summertime . This is the wintertime . We just had Code Blue. I just saw about 50 to I don't even know how many people had nowhere to stay when that snow storm hit. So when we talk about that snow storm hitting , my question -- the question that comes to my mind is what about the homeless ? What are we doing? Do you understand ? So one second -- this month is Homeless Awareness Month and the winter season is upon us. Again, if we say we are leaders and we are here for the people, then please expand and build bigger shelters until we are able to deport some of the illegals in our country . I thank you for your time. My name is Ant Marquise and God bless this country . Now here for anyone who missed it, this is a flyer for the events that I'm going to start holding with all of my music performances and all of my motivational speeches . I give out a bunch of clothes because I have a bunch of clothes in abundance . And I buy a bunch of food and stuff like that and I just give it back to the community . So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I'm just letting you guys know what's going on. So, ma'am, if you ever want anyone to help the homeless , we do have that outside of the NAACP and all of that. So thank you guys for your time. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I am standing here tonight as well about the homeless population as well. I have to thank Dr. Rothchild for the information that she did pass onto me. And I was able to look into that and do some more research on it. I did speak with some of the agencies that you had told me about. But one of them only houses families like mothers with their children . And when you see a mother on her street with her children and it's at night and as a mother's heart goes to these children that are not the -- they don't have a place to stay. Someone asked me why do you do what I do. I've never been homeless . But I have been hungry. I have gone to bed hungry. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 grew up here in Scranton and so many a night my sisters -- there was nine of us. So we were hungry. So maybe pause I was hungry growing up that I have such a desire that these people that are homeless , you know, find someplace . When it snowed the other day someone asked me, Norma, what happened when the people, you know, that were in the street when it snowed? I said, I don't know because I didn't see anything about a Code Blue. So I don't know what happened with them. I guess they slept on the snow. I don't know. But it's a heartthrob not only of me but of citizens in Scranton maybe because -- well, I do know that people watch City Council because they come up to me in Gerrity 's or wherever I am out in the street and ask me things. And I'm sure they do you as well because you're on Council . I'm just a participant , a citizen . But they continuously ask me about the homeless . And they're quite concerned . So, Dr. Rothchild , when you sent me the informati on, that information has to get out to the public. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 You know, I didn't want to read everything that you had sent because I wasn't sure exactly how and what I should do with it. So anything that has to be said about the homeless should be said from the podium so that all of the people in the City of Scranton can hear what is being done or if there's nothing being done. You know, I can't say that anybody that wants to know get in your car and go down to -- down by the Geisinger Medical Center down there on Mount Pleasant Avenue, is it? And you will see. Your heart will break. So as we prepare to go for Thanksgiving and we probably all have our turkeys ready to go, there's quite a few meals that are going to be passed out on Thanksgiving to the homeless population or someone who just doesn't want to or have the facilities to have a dinner with someone . But the difference in the homeless people and most of us here is that we'll enjoy our meal. We'll enjoy the turkey. We'll enjoy the stuffing . But we'll get up and we'll pat our bellies and we'll go in and we'll sit in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 the warm living room and watch football , put our feet up in the recliner . But the homeless do not have that luxury. So, you know, I can't stop thinking about it, maybe because like I said because I did go to bed hungry when I was young. And we just need to do something about the homeless population , not just give them a meal, but to provide a roof over their head. So the second thing I wanted to ask you about and, you know, Mr. King, maybe this is addressed to you. I do get text messages from residents up on East Mountain about the park that's going up. And they are so concerned about the number of trees that are being cut down. And is there going to be a kayak launch pad now that's going in and they're taking down a lot of the trees? I don't know. I have enough with Nay Aug Park. MR. KING: Norma, we discussed -- yeah, people have been reaching out to me as well. We discussed this during caucus. I was not aware initially with the design that there was going to be kayaking . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 So I saw pictures of trees that came down over on the Birch Street side. I was showing everyone here during the caucus the pictures . So I asked Frank Voldenberg to try to get either Tom McLane, whoever designed it to see if they could get the design to Council and then answer some questions about -- I know that over by the Robinson Park area, they put parking on the lake side across from Robinson Park. And they made a handicap , like, sidewalk was that was from what I was to understand to go down to the lake. And there was going to be a dock there. And it was going to be handicap accessible I thought for, you know, the handicap to be able to go down, for people to be on the dock to go out and look at the lake or whatever and maybe fish off of it. I can't say that I ever recall anything kayaks. So Frank is going to look into that for us and get back to us with some answers on that. But, yeah, I've been getting on -- MS. JEFFRIES : -- I don't think there's anything could do but, you know, I do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 get the text messages and the calls. MR. KING: Yeah, and I don't know why those trees -- that was the other question , like, why the trees came down over on the Birch Street side, I mean, are they moving the dock or what -- I don't know. MS. JEFFRIES : So the final thing I have is what I'm concerned about is Nay Aug Park, you know. And we were supposed to have the lighting last night. But, you know, nature does what it wants to do. So we are going to have the lighting tomorrow night at 4:00. And the switch will be thrown for our lighting at Nay Aug Park. And I know that it's the Times' lighting is tomorrow night as well. So it's going to be a dash from Nay Aug Park over to downtown and across town to get to the lighting . So that's all I have to say, okay? And can I get some additional information on the kayak as well if someone could send that to me? MR. KING: We'll get that to you. MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Next, Tom 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Thank you, Council . I will do a little introduction basically for Dr. Rothchild and for Mr. Smurl. The rest of the panel knows me very well, including your attorney . My name is Tom Morgan, 30 year career firefighter veteran of the City of Scranton , retired in 2020. And my family, been in the City of Scranton since they was a City of Scranton , coming here in 1859 -- I'm sorry, 1857, so homeowners and taxpayers for many, many years. The reason I'm here tonight is as you've been aware in the past my name has been submitted for the firefighters 's pension retiring position one of two slots. So I just wanted to give you a little history of what I know of what's gone on there so that we're all on the same page, which isn't a lot. I will tell you that. June of 2022, two retiree members that were on the board were informed that their terms were over, expired . So the process then as Council may understand because it's done by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 ordinance is that Retired Firefighter Association , which I am the Vice President has to submit three names to the union. The union approves the names or disapproves them, sends them to the Mayor. The Mayor approves them and then the person is seated. What has happened in my case is that I was first approved by the union in June of 2023. We had to do some other votes for other reasons . I won't bore you with those details. But there's a letter that I was not given. But there's a letter from the Mayor's office or from the City Solicitor . I'm not sure which one it was -- stating that the Mayor has chosen to appoint me of the three names that were provided as of March 1st. However , I cannot sit because they have to figure out my term. So that was March 1st. We're almost to December 1st. And I guess they haven't figured that out yet. So the union of which I'm still a proud member, we call active retired, since I'm retired I'm still active in the union and the pension board have both said to me that they feel that the retirees need to speak. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 So as the Vice President of the Retiree Association , I am here telling you that we would like to see that seat filled. And if you have any questions for me, I'd be glad to entertain them. But that's my reason for being here. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Yeah, we here on Council have brought it up a few times about when you're going to be seated on the pension board. And we would like to know from the administration when that's going to occur. So, Mr. Voldenberg , Mr. Gilbride , if we could reach out to the administration and see when that is going to occur. MR. VOLDENBERG : We will. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. MORGAN: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . And again, I'm just am basically here as Vice President of the Retiree Association saying we support and I know the union has supported and the pension board has tried to get this ironed out and just trying to get some answers . Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 MR. SMURL: Thank you. Alan Lucas. MR. LUCAS: Good evening , Council , Alan Lucas, Scranton resident Scranton firefighter , President of Local 60 IFF representing the Scranton firefighters . I'm here to address what Tom addressed . I've talked to multiple members of the Council about this. I'll just give you a quick rundown just kind of a recap of what Tom said. I come today to speak on behalf of the local as we all feel the same way. And Tom is a member of our local still like he said a proud member. So in June of 2022, both of the five year terms ended for retirees , Terry Osborne and Bernie Garvey. So they concluded . We, Local 60, held elections shortly after and we submitted a singular name. We -- like Tom said we did three. We submitted a singular name which was Donny Hart, a retiree of Scranton Fire. Donny's name was accepted by the Mayor and he was appointed to the board where he currently sits. He fills one of the two seats. He's the only member -- only retiree 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 member that is filling one of those seats. Again, the kind of point here is Donny's name was submitted as a singular name and was selected by the Mayor. That came first. After that, we had another round of elections and we elected a retiree Mark Schultz . We submitted that name to the Mayor's office. The Mayor's office responded back that we need to submit three names for her to pick from. So this is the second time we did it. First time we sent one name and she picked. The second time we submitted one name she told us she needed three. So we held another rounds of elections . At that point in time we elected three names which would be Tommy Morgan, Mark Schultz again and Paul Bernardi . We submitted those names to the Mayor's office in 2023, which is the election that Tom was speaking of. And the Mayor a few months later responded back that she had selected Tom to fill that position . That was March of 2024 shortly after I took over. Since then, the pension board and Local 60, we've been trying 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 to get Tom seated, like Tom said. The administration has stated that they needed to know the term he was filling . Our pension board told them it's a five-year term. He wasn't filling in the middle of a term. It was an expired term. He was duly elected , selected , put into place. After we told them that they then told us -- the administration then told us that they needed to realign or stagger these terms. That is something with ordinance and all of this stuff. So myself, the pension board have been attempting to do this with the administration . We're not getting anywhere . And it's been over a year. Almost a year since I've taken over, well over a year since this whole thing has been going on. So the retirees deserve their rightful complement of members on this board. And I don't want to have to come here and air dirty laundry . I don't want to air these issues out. But we've done everything we can. I have e-mails. I have everything under the son that I'm trying to get this guy seated. Rightfully so, she selected 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 him. And we're just asking that you guys do something . And I appreciate you reaching out. And again, anything we can do to get them seated. I just want our retirees to be able to have the voice that they're supposed to have. So I appreciate your guys' time on that. Since I have an extra minute, 30, I also want to talk about Engine 10. So the storm the other day, that was a real eye opener. And as we discussed many a times with you guys, that's exactly the scenario that we would be concerned with. So I really want to give you guys a huge kudos for giving the union a voice in that matter and amending that proposal . It's really important to us. It's really important to the citizens of East Mountain that it's up there. And like you said, that snowstorm is a real eye opener. So I thank you guys for hearing us out. And my membership really does thank you and appreciate the fact that we have a voice to come to because obviously we're having a very difficult time with this administration . So you guys are our saving 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 grace right now. And we do appreciate it. Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Lucas, one question . MR. LUCAS: Sure. MR. SCHUSTER : So the terms for those two positions , they ended in June of 2022, correct ? MR. LUCAS: Yes, both terms ended June of 2022. MR. SCHUSTER : Was that the end date or had they -- is there any kind of staggering that occurred there or they just happened to end at the same time? MR. LUCAS: No, so they ended at the same time from like what we're gathering . We did, like, go all the way back to see -- the city came back with the Doherty administration and things may have been messed up. It's been a long time. And they wanted to realign it. But both of these terms ended at the same time. And again, it would be one thing if somebody resigned a position and then, you know, Tom was filling a two year gap or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 something . But that's not the case here. We've even gotten as far as saying like some of our other guys are active members , they have both been appoint ed. We just appointed two members this past -- within the last year, both active members , both got appointed . Both got the same -- they're not staggered at all either. So it doesn't make any sense. It just seems kind of like a copout that the administration is throwing . We can't figure out why. This isn't like a cost -- there's no reason that the city doesn't appoint a retiree . It's absolutely absurd. MR. SCHUSTER : And then offhand , do you know the length of the term? MR. LUCAS: The term that Tom would be filling ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, the term -- MR. LUCAS: Yeah, both of them are five year terms. MR. SCHUSTER : Five year, okay. Thank you. MR. LUCAS: Thank you. MR. KING: Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 Mr. Gilbride -- Attorney Gilbride , can you reach out to the administration and see if they could prepare a resolution for next week. I can't speak for my colleagues , but if we could get a resolution to have him appoint ed next week I'd be willing to waive the rules and just get this done. He's waited around long enough. Apparently the Mayor has already selected him. His colleagues have selected him. Let's get his name in here. We'll waive the rules and get it passed next Tuesday night. ATTY. GILBRIDE : Mr. President , can I address Council ? MR. SMURL: Yes. ATTY. GILBRIDE : As you all may remember , probably the beginning of this year -- I think it was January , February of this year. This issue came to you and I was tasked with meeting to try to determine what was the holdup. Council has done everything we could do with regard to it. As was pointed out by both of the speaker s as well as yourselves, the name was submitted . The Mayor approved Mr. Morgan. It then went to the pension board 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 who, by the way, is responsible for their on governance . But there was a disagreement between the pension board which I think Mr. Lucas alluded to -- a disagreement as to when the length of term -- how long it's -- it's a five year term. But do we -- it seemed to me at least in my conversations because so much time had elapsed they were basically saying, well, a year or two have elapsed so, therefore , it should -- even though it's a five-year term it shouldn 't be for five years from the date he was appointed . It should be five years minus the time that elapsed . It seems to me that the pension board can seat Mr. Morgan and for whatever period of time they determine . Their operating rules govern. And if the city disagrees with that then the city can bring a lawsuit . There's not much that Council can do because the pension board governs itself. Once the Mayor makes that appointment , then they seat the person that the Mayor appointed . If they want to argue over the length of time, whether it's five years 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 from the day it was approved or five years minus the period of time that had elapsed before the appointment was done, that's -- there's still no reason why Mr. Morgan shouldn 't be already in the seat. They could argue over the timeframe later on. But I don't know that there is much Council can do. We already -- I think we passed the legislation already appointing . MR. KING: We did. ATTY. GILBRIDE : So we've done everything we can do. We passed the legislation . The dispute which, you know, it's got to be resolved between the pension board and the Mayor. MR. KING: We passed it and approved it, then he should just go to the next meeting . He's on the pension board. MR. MCANDREW : I agree, so, okay, he should be in the seat. He was appointed . He should be sitting in that seat. They can debate and deliberate how long he's going to be there. But he should be there, whether it's five minus the two from '22 or, you know, five moving forward from '22. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 That's irrelevant . If he's appointed to the seat he should be sitting in the chair them meeting s. MR. SCHUSTER : And I think looking at staggering , two years have passed now since that has occurred . If he was to have these five years starting from the day of his first meeting , the term should be staggered from that point out. MR. KING: Am I correct in saying that the Mayor of the City of Scranton appointed him. He was approved by the City Council . And the pension board itself is holding it up? ATTY. GILBRIDE : I don't want to speak for the pension board and I can't say that. All I could tell you is that he was approved by the Mayor. Legislation passed through this Council appointing him. And for whatever reason he has not been taking his seat. MR. KING: Well, by law, by law, this body passed a resolution and it was approved . As far as I'm concerned Mr. Morgan has every right to show up at that next pension 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 board meting and nobody has any right to kick you out of there. If they want to argue over the term, so be it. We know minimally , minimally , Mr. Morgan should be there probably three more years. You know, even if the argument was it should go back to 2022. So they have three years to figure it out. But right now time is going by and they are not being represented properly . So I would suggest that he just go to that meeting and you are legally on that board. MR. MCANDREW : I agree. DR. ROTHCHILD : I agree too. Thank you to Mr. Morgan and Mr. Lucas for coming tonight and speaking on that and providing more details because I was unaware of all of that information . So I do thank you for that. And, you know, I want to see you be able to take your seat on that board. And if there's anything , you know, we could do to find more answers or move along the process for determining the length of the term or the end date of it, then we'll go ahead and do that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 MR. SCHUSTER : Do you know when the next meeting is? MR. SMURL: I'm sorry, you can't speak from the gallery . I'm sorry. MR. KING: Perhaps , perhaps , could our solicitor send a letter to the pension board maybe in conjunction with the Mayor's office, with the solicitors of both bodies, the administration and Council to the pension board indicating that on such and such a date this board approved the resolution appointing Tom Morgan to that pension board. The Mayor on such and such a data appointed Tom Morgan to that pension board. And, therefore , we expect that he should be seated at the next regularly scheduled meeting and then the pension board themselves can determine , you know, figure out what the term is whether it's going to be three more years or five years from this point. He's already missed the last two years. So is that a possibility ? Thank you very much. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Possibly from that point out if there is anymore issue, we could 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 bring it back in front of this board and reappoint for a term. MR. SMURL: All right. Thank you. We'll do that. Mr. Ellman. Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: All right, Council , you could relax. First off, someone I suggested I speak no more on my conflict with the city. That's what the lawyers are for. Secondly , Rose Ann was in the hospital two weeks ago for a week for sugar in Dickson City. And they decided to send her to Allentown . She's there for a few days and they solved the problem and released her up there with no way home. She had to come home in an Uber. This isn't right. What I'm saying, where I'm going with all of this is if anybody has to go to Danville or someplace , you ought to make sure you're going to get a ride up and back not to rely on the hospital saying you'll come back. That could be a big expense , you know, for a Uber down there. Oh, well, nobody at Geisinger seemed the least bit interested in my problem about when I phoned them leaving somebody off in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 middle of nowhere , you know? It's not like a get out of jail in Ohio or something . And next, I wasn't the only one that was really disappointed in our Governor allowing 5 million dollars in tax money to go towards saving this interim plan of purchasing that 125 year old white elephant . You know, they must have had a lot of meals at the Radison. How could people that handle your money, investments make such a dire ridiculous purchase and then expect us the taxpayer s to get them out of it to save face? This is a despicable waste by the people that are in authority there. I talked to some -- some knowledgeable people. And they said this was just plan -- more that we know about to make something like this. And I'd like to say real quick, my neighborhood is full of these damn kids 8, 10 years old riding two wheel scooters and bikes all over the sidewalk and the street. They think they're vehicles . They're uninsured . They go real fast because I've ridden them. This lady across the street I see every once in a while, she walks with a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 cane and got big thick glasses . And she heard something behind her last week. She turned. Some kid flew by her on a scooter just inches from her she said. And if she hadn't turned, he might have, you know, even brushed her or something . You know, I ridden motorcycles and they're bad enough. But at least when I had my (inaudible ) I had insurance if I run over somebody . These scooters don't have no insurance if they hit somebody on the sidewalk . And lastly, this idea about venturing off into an ambulance venture , what do you need it for? Why can't -- you forgot years ago our Parking Authority losses and then the authorities that get involved and you have to hire people with knowledge and experience . You ought to listen to the taxpayers instead of some consultants , you know. To me, it's just some dunce hiding behind the name of a consultant . This is a totally ridiculous venture because I talked at Redner's to an ambulance driver. He said we can organize if they would get together . The city needs to worry about all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 the problems it's got instead of starting a new thing. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Ellman. That is all for the sign-in sheet. Does anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Good evening , Council , Tom Coyne, Minooka . We're looking at Thanksgiving and we're looking at Christmas holidays . And everyone is somewhat aware in the back of their mind of the homeless and the hungry in the city. It's always been an issue here. St. Francis is a perfect cause of how long that has been there operating . Even back in the times of the coal mines and the company store of people going hungry in this valley. Well, some of us my be having turkey. And some of us might be going out for dinners and sitting down, it is true that some of us are going to be unfortunate and not have that capability . I ask during the Recovery Act funds to take a look at putting more money to the homeless at the food kitchens because not only through Covid but through the entire period of time afterwards there's been a great demand in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 this community . It seems that a tiki bar at Coopers is more important than feeding the hungry. And that's an unfortunate statement to have to make about his city. Norma had mentioned that she wasn't aware of how the homeless sleep. They sleep on cardboard that they scavenge when they could scavenge it. They sleep on blankets and whatever they can on the ground to cushion them from the cold. You may know of them carrying around shopping -- pushing around things in shopping carts as their entire world. But the reason why stores change from plastic -- from metal shopping carts to plastic shopping carts is there were being taken in a lot of the big cities. And they weren't being taken for the use of tooling around their entire worldly possessions . They were taken back into the woods, turned sideways so that the homeless can put wood and logs inside of them and then cook on top of them. They became a portable cooking stove for the homeless who had nothing to cook on. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 It allowed them to not have to try to light a fire in the dirt and mud and to control that fire by having a metal shopping cart to keep those flames and to have something to cook on or to put a pot of water on to make hot tea, hot coffee or hot ramen soup. It's an unfortunate situation . And unfortunately the homeless -- the homeless board, the unsheltered task force has done virtually nothing except say we have a plan that was presented by the county groups. Wilkes-Barre is moving forward and we don't have time for it. What does it say about our community when we don't have time for those who are in need. Now, off to the subject of last week's Council session -- pre Council session . It was mentioned by the HR person at 25 minutes after the -- 25 minutes into the ECTV that the records put out in Dix Court, the employee records , she stuttered and said, uh, uh, uh, an awful lot of times during that small section . And that was because she was looking for the proper precise words that she wanted to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 say and trying to be careful of the words she didn't want to say. It wasn't an unfortunate event. If you plan a birthday party and it rains that day, it's an unfortunate event. If you're going to an opening of an event and your tire blows out, well, that's an unfortunate event. Negligence and incompetence is not an unfortunate event. When someone takes files and puts them out back, that's not an unfortunate event. That's negligence . And I cannot see why an HR Department would not have locks on cabinets , would not have procedures for personnel files, would not have a log in and a log out for it. And when they were originally put forward shredding , we're going to put shredding in every single office. And it took me coming up here a second time to go it really should be done by an outside company . This is the type of representatives we have here. And unfortunately that is an unfortunate event. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. ARGENTA : Good evening , Council , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 Happy Thanksgiving . God bless our President -elect Donald J. Trump. Today we had Senator Marty Flynn delivering coats to children . Today we also had Bob Bolus handing out 2,000 free turkeys at the corner of Franklin and Mulberry Street. Today we also have men, women and children living in tents, cars and wherever they could find shelter . But no worry, Scranton Mayor was cutting the ribbon on a pickleball park in the winter her minions . We still have the Scranton School Board trying to figure out how to work together and get along for the betterment of the students and the taxpayers . But the greatest gift of all comes from the Lackawanna County Commissioners , Matt McGloin and Bill Gaughan for our 33 percent tax increase for the holidays that none of you elected official s commented on or questioned . Regarding the homeless , maybe someone could reach out to a local realtor . We have enough of them in the city, ask if anyone has a warehouse space that they could contribute for a few months. We can convert it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 to a shelter . And there's more us of I'm sure that would volunteer to make it work. In regards to 6-A, Scranton Police with no warrants . Does that also pertain to loitering and the homeless and will that follow state court ruling that we have on file for that now? Have a nice holiday , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Good evening Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . I'd like to wish everybody a Happy Thanksgiving . Tonight I'm going to discuss things to be thankful for. Tonight I'm thankful to our local first responders who provided amazing response to our road conditions last Friday morning and into the weekend . We had a steady snow for several hours. There were many auto accidents , downed trees and wires throughout the area. They do this very same thing daily. Most take that for granted . As of 8 p.m. on Friday evening , the B shift, our Scranton firefighters responded to over 37 calls that included downed wires, auto accidents , elevator emergencies and fires 12 hours into their shift. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 To Al Lucas, Local 60, our brave Scranton firefighters who protect us and keep us safe daily, thank you. Our department of Public Works had an immediate response to our needs once again tested to an extreme . They never wavered in the havoc which was in front of them. They knuckle up to help our city in a real time in need. To Roger Leonard , Lodge 2305, our very hard working DPW employees . Thank you. To our Scranton Police Department who is also tested with road conditions , they work diligently like their predecessors to ensure the safety of the good people of Scranton . We're proud to have one of our -- proud to have one of the best police departments in the country . To Justin Butler, Lodge 2462, our brave police officers who keep us safe nonstop with this current climate. Thank you. To PP& L and several outages tested and caring. Technicians work nonstop to restore electricity to those affected . There were many power lines down. They are the only utility that I like here in the city. Thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 you. To the good people of Scranton that show kindness towards others daily which makes up our true fabric, the willingness to call Scranton home. Thank you. Those who helped me with their friendship who know over the years due to something that no parent could ever imagine , thank you. To those who helped start the West Scranton Crime Watch, the only one in the city. They make great strides in a short period of time, thank you. To developers like John Basalyga and many others like him who believe in Scranton and invest and keep the lights in the City of Scranton on in our Electric City and keep them bright, thank you. To those of you on Council , Mr. Voldenberg , Attorney Gilbride , those of you who truly care and ask the right questions on behalf of the good people of Scranton , thank you. I'm thankful that there are 175 days remaining before the primary in 2025. I'm thankful that there's 343 days remaining before the general election . Good people of Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 will be thankful for 400 days. That will be the last day for this expansion team along with this out of town Mayor. I'm truly humbled and thankful to live in one of the best cities in the country . I'm thankful to be an American . I'm thankful to every of veteran who served and protect ed our freedoms . I'm thankful for every friendship over the years and memories that will never be forgotten . I'm thankful that so many will focus on our local elections next year embracing change for the better. We are the electric city. We are stronger than one person or administration . No one will dim our lights. I'm thankful that our amazing city will once again shine bright. The good people of Scranton , God bless you. Happy Thanksgiving . Change is coming. Good evening , Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I hope that things are being resolved with the fire station up on East Mountain because it's like I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 predicted , if people had to drive up the hill, it wouldn't be too quick of a response . And if anybody has a petition I'll sign it. I'm from the upper south side. But they also see them in my neighborhood so -- okay, I'd like to urge that we examine our situations now with grants. And state money and don't count on it if -- with things being the way they are. As far as Mr. Gaughan , I'd wish he would get it straight , not that he doesn't need the 33 percent or whatever it is but who caused it. As far as I'm concerned the cause was Cummings and O'Malley. He told them -- the other guy told them that this wasn't going to work with the Globe Store. And we just keep sprawling out and then when we sell these buildings , we sell them for a pittance to a developer and they have a fine time with it. Hopefully they'll do okay. But it's just a shame. I just wish he would get it straight . He keeps picking on Notariani . I was a customer of his for 10 years with his automotive machine shop. And I've known him 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 for probably 50 years. And it's a shame that he didn't make it back in instead of people that are clueless . Now, tax exempts we're talking about pilots last week. I was unable to attend. You know, when somebody comes up with a bright idea like selling the water company or the streetscape plan in downtown Scranton , it brings these advocates in, provides a venue for them. And I mean, some things are okay, you know, if you want to put lighting in or something like that. I feel sorry for the trees that get planted in the middle of the city. That's like, you know, by the time they're fully grown, they're going to have to be cut down and gotten out of the way. And I never approved of that advocacy . And then because they give $100,000 or $200,000, they are actually granted by law millions of dollars annually . And I wish they'd get together . And if they don't want to pay a little fee or pilot, whatever , how about getting together with Council and the Mayor and go to the state and try and get some kind of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 revenue sharing back that gets wiped out from under us. All of these situations as far as the homeless are concerned , like, I was almost homeless because the house burned. It was a rental. But the point in being that everybody heads towards the city when they become homeless . I picked a guy up and gave him a ride out towards Tunkhannock . I was right out on the outskirts of Clarks Summit at a gas station . And the police harassed him right from the time he walked into Chinchilla until the time he -- he couldn't even stand under a really brutal rain storm. He couldn't even stand under a vestibule or something . And, okay, we have a wonderful -- prolifers got their way with the Supreme Court. Well, currently (inaudible ) law center 62,000 women were interviewed pregnant from rape and 26,000 are from Texas and more women just recently died in Texas because they were refused a DNC for a -- for a malfunctioned pregnancy . So thank you and have a good night. MR. SMURL: Thank you.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , city resident . I wasn't going to come up and talk. But it dawns on me that we start things and then we don't find out what's happening to them. For instance , what's going on with the Meadow Brook Program , anything ? MR. SMURL: It should be soon. MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm sorry, it should be what soon? MR. SMURL: It's still ongoing . It is still ongoing . MS. SCHUMACHER : On hold? MR. SMURL: On going. It is still proceeding , yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : How close is it to be -- MR. SMURL: I don't know. I haven't looked at it in probably three or four weeks. MS. SCHUMACHER : What about Serrenti , what is the -- what is the status of Serrenti ? MR. SMURL: The status as in? MS. SCHUMACHER : How -- what's the city going to do with it? Are we going to get revenue from it as the Mayor told us we would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 when she bought it? MR. SMURL: No, I don't believe we are. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And what about Nay Aug pool? Are we going to have a pool at Nay Aug? I listened to you people and I couldn't come up with whether you're going to push it and we're going to have one or whether we're not. MR. SMURL: It's in process . There's two pools and a splash pad going in Nay Aug Park. MS. SCHUMACHER : Two pools that you could actually swim in, you can -- MR. SMURL: One activity pool and one lap pool. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Okay. And then Engine 10, now I thought that Engine 10 was being moved to somebody else and we were going to get a new one. I'll tell you, I had my little friend was with me and he saw Engine 10. We were going down to the store. And we were coming back and he sees Engine 10 on a -- on a -- being taken, not driven but on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 a -- towed away. MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : And he just -- he almost jumped out of the car saying they're taking our fire engines . MR. SMURL: No, no. We have spare engines for when something like that happens . MS. SCHUMACHER : Are we getting a new -- what is happening to 10 then? MR. SMURL: The actual engine, the truck itself? MS. SCHUMACHER : No, the station . MR. SMURL: The station , as soon as the study is finished , we will know if it's going to remain in that spot or if they are going to build a brand new one. MS. SCHUMACHER : I assume there's a contract for that study. When is that going to get the final report out? MR. SMURL: I don't know if it went out for bid yet. I believe it's shortly . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I hope that was -- oh, I just want to tell you about this and see. I'd like to know who goes out and does things. There's a park that I go by once 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 in a while. And it had -- when you went in, it had a playground. And I think I've talked about it before. I think I brought a picture of the sliding board which had a big hole in it and just terrible . MR. SMURL: Was that the one at Nay Aug Park, the lower one? MS. SCHUMACHER : I don't know if it was lower or not. But anyway, I went out again recently and there's a humongous trench where that circle had been, I mean, very deep, very wide; and guess what? No fence around it. Now, kids, a dog could have run and got in there and been there forever , I guess. I don't know how things happen -- like that happened in a park. I went back to see -- actually to make some measurements and it had been filled in. But it was open wide for a very, very long time. And how does that happen? Doesn't anybody go and look at what's happening on our parks? MR. SMURL: We have parks' employees that are at the parks every day. MS. SCHUMACHER : And we hire people 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 who don't think that was dangerous and report to somebody higher? MR. SMURL: I don't know what that situation entailed, Marie. I don't know. MR. KING: Marie, Marie, where's that park that you are referring to with this hole? MR. SMURL: She said it's filled. MR. KING: What is it? MR. SMURL: She said it is filled. MR. KING: Where was it though? MS. SCHUMACHER : The one above if you look over the back, it's the DPW, I think. It begins a C. I don't know. I don't know the names of all the parks. MR. KING: Capouse Avenue? MS. SCHUMACHER : But I'll get it -- yeah, that's -- yeah. MR. KING: They're going to be doing work on Capouse Avenue park. There's actually a splash pad going in. MS. SCHUMACHER : No, this isn't that one. This is down at where the -- there's no -- there's dead ends. And then you could make a right into the park. I'll get it to you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 tomorrow though. I will get the name to you. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the administration and ask are there any trainings , classes , or anything any activities going on at the Serrenti Center where outside police agencies , groups, law enforcement , any types of groups like that are taking classes there at a fee? MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Fifth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: I have nothing this evening . MR. SMURL: Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I had some questions from last week. We got some answers on them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 So we did ask about the unsheltered homeless situations in the city, particularly I asked about the 7th Avenue corridor , the Heritage Trail on Olive Street and Silex Streets . And I asked do we have an update and when is the homeless task force meeting ? And the answer that I got back was that the Scranton Police Department constantly monitors areas where these individuals gather. And the next unsheltered task force meeting will be in December with a date that is yet to be determined . So there is no date for that meeting as of right now. I asked several questions about Rubicon at the caucus when DPW was in about the optimization of routes. And the answer I got was that -- and this is from the administration . Optimization through Rubicon has not changed any of the regular collection days. Residents will not have any day of service changes . Truck usage will remain unchanged after optimization . The collection methods and types of pickups are not set by Rubicon . DPW's daily collection rules and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 regulations for refuse including large household items will not change. Workloads will be equalized across drivers and collectors as a result of this optimization . And historically our routes were unbalanced which affected the drivers , collectors , and fleet equipment . So each truck and team will be working through equivalent routes by stop number and duration of their trip. So it just was a rundown of what optimization looks like from those questions . That is all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Just a couple since I wasn't at the very start of the meeting . But I just wanted to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving . And I have a lot to be thankful for as well and mainly my family is the biggest thing. But our city and this community is very truly important to me too. And I wouldn't want to live anywhere else. And I also wanted to thank our fire, police, and DPW workers for all of their hard 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 work on Friday with the storm. I don't think anyone was expecting us to have the sort of damage that we did. I really thought it was going to be more of a miss for the city. So I was surprised . And driving around just seeing branches and trees falling everywhere was a bit scary. But they were all very quick to respond . I myself had to call -- had to contact DPW. So I just really wanted to thank them for all of their hard work that day. And PPL too for getting power restored to many of our residents who had lost power. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a couple. So the reason for the hole at the park in Pine Brook that you encountered was -- it was explained to me just now that it was a trench that the fire department dug for training . Okay, so it was utilized as a training purposes . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 Okay, so that's the hole that you encountered and the why and how it was filled. All right. Secondly , we're still talking about parks. I get constant complaints and I still do about who's locking these parks up at night, how come it's not consistent , the damage that's being done to Novembrino is ridiculous . The shower heads are broke. The equipment is broke, some of the rides that are broke. And even the police who respond thank God because they're driving mopeds -- not mopeds, little motorcycles through there. They're ripping trees up. But we need consistency or what's protocol or what's policy? I know we don't have a Parks Director we're waiting on. But that doesn't mean these parks should be neglected because there was an assistant parks director . I guess he's covering . But can you please reach out and this isn't the first time we brought this up. This is a constant problem . And I know that people have reached out to me and said, hey, Mark, you know, my father used to lock the park up every night and the city allowed it. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 I'm willing to do the same if, you know, they give me a key or a lock. I'll lock it every night when the sun goes down. So we need something because nothing is working what's in place now. And it seems that like once a week that these parks, especially the splash pad or Novembrino Park is open and sometimes the office open. And they are rummaging through the office. It's just, you know, it's a constant , constant complaint I receive . And I don't know why it hasn't been rectified by now, but we need to do that. And, of course, we're refurbishing a bunch of other parks. So proactively -- proactively what do we do? Is there going to be a policy or a procedure where these beautiful new parks that we're spending a ton of money on are going to remain that way and not like Novembrino that's only a few years old that's almost destroyed . So I've heard from the police that respond to these -- that respond to these park issues especially at Novembrino that, you know, we need no trespassing signs. All right. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 we got to make sure that if there's parks that's don't have them, get them, you know, and do all of them have cameras or will all of them have cameras that are -- the police are able to tie into. These are a few questions . More than anything , I mean, what's the procedure or the policy daily to lock these parks and who's doing it or not doing it? I would like to know that. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll ask those questions . MR. MCANDREW : Thanks. All right. So -- MR. SCHUSTER : Can I add to that one? I know some parks have signage that say closes at dusk and other parks such as Novembrino has a sign that says -- I drove past it specifically today 6 a.m. to -- well, it's 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. And it was open as I came over even though it was dark out tonight . But are some parks dusk or are there specific times on them and just to add some clarity to -- MR. MCANDREW : Well, even 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 consistency . I mean, growing up as a kid we had school yards in addition to parks. And there would be a sign label at dusk. But they're not working . So maybe in addition to sun down/sun up we have no trespassing is a better deterrent or not. I don't know. I think we should. So in addition to Mr. Schuster -- Council man Schuster 's request about Rubicon , I myself and this isn't the first request for information about them when they were here in caucus and weeks prior, what's the cost to retain the software ? No one has given us an answer. I wasn't happy with the program . I wasn't happy with the results . We were promise d to save a million dollars in the first year. We didn't save any. So now we're being told oh, yeah, they're done. They never rolled it out. But, you know, they did some data. And then we asked recently , no, we got to retain them because for the software . We're keeping everything but we have to retain them. So we don't know if it's a thousand dollars or 50,000 a year and we keep asking and, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 we're suppose d to approve a budget. So, please, before next week can we get that amount? They promised it two weeks ago. So I think somebody has it or should. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll follow up, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. All right, so I also was asked by the great residents in Green Ridge for an update on the sewer issue on North Washington . We haven't gotten an update in a while and if you could please reach out to American Water and see where they're at, okay? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did receive one. I'll send it to you in the morning . MR. MCANDREW : Oh, okay, thank you. And then I'll pass it onto the people that inquired . Thank you. And then the 700 block of Genet Street, so this is supposedly considered by the city a paper street. Okay, I'm not even sure what that means but I was told it's a paper street. But it was also paved last year by our administration . And the issue that remains or the residents are complaining about it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 paved -- I'm sorry, not paved, it's not plowed. And they have to plow it themselves because it's considered a paper street. I don't know what that means. But if you could please reach out to administration and find out what that means. Is it a street that, you know, should receive the same services as every other street in the city because it's -- people live on it. So I don't understand if you could ask for clarification and make sure and find out if it is being paved -- or not paved. I'm sorry, I keep saying that. It's being plowed when needed. And I think that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

MR. KING: Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , if we could just ask the administration to -- in the backup document ation it states that no cost will be incurred by the city. And I understand there's a reimbursement . But in our budget we do have expenditures . We have third party inspection of $500,000. And we also have a third party review of $10,000 as well as revenue in there for pave cut administration 35,000, third party inspection 500,000 and third party review of 10,000. So if we could just get the clarity -- again, I understand it's a reimburse ment. But if we could just get clarification on how this is going to occur and how we're accounting for the transactions .
