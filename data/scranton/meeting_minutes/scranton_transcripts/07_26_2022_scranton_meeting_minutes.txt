MCANDREW : Two quick ones, so Scranton Police Department 's National Night Out 2022 will be August 2nd, 6 to 9 p.m. at Scranton High. It will be able to make the community safer and more caring places to live and work. So save the date. And then next I have -- there will be a Lackawanna County Parks and Recreation will be a tennis clinic for boys and girls ages 8 through 16 at McDade Park. The dates are August 2nd and 4th, 9th and 11, August 16th and 18th. These are from 10 to 11:30 a.m. Please arrive by 9:45 a.m. Cost is $30 for six 90-minute sessions . Deadline to register is August 1st. For more information there's a number. It's on a Facebook page you could call. And checks could be made out payable to Lackawanna County Treasurer. I'm thrilled to see that -- them tennis courts have been up at McDade Park a long time. I'm thrilled to see they are stilling being utilize d. That is all I have.

The City of Scranton 's Parks and Recreation Department is going to be sponsoring Weston Fest at Weston Field at 982 Providence Road. That's August 20th from noon to 5 p.m. They'll have food trucks, bounce houses, music, hotdog eating contest and community resources . I don't know if Joey Chestnut is going to be there for the hotdog eating contest. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any other announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes. I have two announcements . The first one I just wanted to mention I think it opened up about a week or so ago the application period for nonprofit grants through the American Rescue Plan Act. So guidance on how to apply for those nonprofit grants could be found on the City's website . And the other announcement I had on August 13th, there will be a 5-K held and that's through an organization called Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 for Ukraine . And more information could be found on their website Scranton for Ukraine dot org. But all the proceeds from the 5K will goes towards Ukrainian refugees . We also had a request for a proclamation to make that Scranton for Ukraine Day, which we are considering . But unfortunately , we won't be able to do it prior to our break so maybe something in September . But I still wanted people to be aware of the 5-K that will be held. It's $30 to run. And that is from 9 to 10 a.m., on Saturday , August 13th. And there is also an option for a one mile walk. And that is $20 for registration . That's from 9:45 to 10:30. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : And I just have one, just a reminder the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority will be holding an Electric City Flower Show on Saturday , August 6th from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., at Nay Aug. Are there any other announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 MR. DONAHUE : First on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . As of today, you're going to get six weeks off from sitting there and us standing here. So I hope you enjoy your summer. Although poor Frank and his staff get no days off. You at least don't have to come in the evening . What is the status of the union contract negotiation s? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they're still being negotiated . MS. HODOWANITZ : I'm going to be asking Mr. Murray to keep a running total of how much we're paying Ufberg because that's important . I assume you are going to probably approve their contract tonight . I also see that in only 66 days we're going to have the 2021 audit in hand. I cannot wait. I'm just tingling all over. With regard to Item 3-I, the BA's financial update, in particular the status of the pension fund -- the composite pension fund. I went to the June 15th -- July 20th meeting I believe it was when they presented 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 the minutes for June 15th. And they talked about the fund having gone down from 135 million to 114 million over the six month period. And that's a loss of 11.46 percent . Now, I'm not suggest ing that we run down the hall with our hair on fire screaming ; but I will say it is cause for concern and justification for close monitoring of the progress of that fund from here on out because we do not know how long the stock market is going to be in the situation it is right now. We do not know whether we're going to have a recession . And all of this is going to impact January 1st of 2023 when the pension funds are revaluated . And that's going to directly impact future MMOs. So it's something to keep in your hip pocket as you start planning the 2023 budget because you won't know that figure when you pass the budget just like you may not know the status of union contract s when you pass that budget. But moving on, with regard to 3-I the City Council log, the one item that I'm really interested in is the property tax refuse fee database that was dropped some time ago 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 from the City's website where you're able to see who owed what and was delinquent . And we've been waiting for that to be restored . And the last update was April 1st. I think four months is long enough. So hopefully when we come back in September you could give us the status on that. What's the bottleneck? Is it the City that is suppose d to provide the updated database or is it IT which is supposed to upload it? But that is an important piece of financial information for all City residents to be able to check that status. And during Fifth Order, I would appreciate two updates , one on the Pocket Park. I pass that every day. And I'm here to tell you that that steam shovel has not moved in week weeks. It's just sitting there. And the other one is the Nay Aug Park pool. I listened to your comment s during the caucus. But I have three questions and this is what I want to know. When are we going to get a pool? How much is it going to cost? And how are you going to pay for it? Master plans are fine. But this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 just like stormwater . You just kick the can down the road and sooner or later you're going have to pay the piper. It seems like anything to do with water around here is cursed. So please answer those two questions , the Pocket Park and Nay Aug in Fifth Order. Will we have caucuses starting September on budget preparation ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Good. MR. DONAHUE : More than likely it will be Rubicon and the capital budget will be two of the four in September but, yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. We need that. And I do want to compliment Frank. For several months he's generated several e-mails to me without being asked. I wish the other departments in City Hall would be so kind as to answer the phone and answer e-mails. Frank is proactive . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Daniel Kurtz. MR. KURTZ: Hi. Good evening . My name is Daniel Kurtz. I live on Hemlock Street and recently moved here from Princeton , New 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 Jersey at the Council 's invitation . My son and I were considering moving out of New Jersey. We were looking at different websites concerning communities and Scranton had on its front page come to Scranton . If you're a remote worker come here, settle here. And also, I heard a podcast from Mayor Cognetti talking about how the City is extremely interested in having remote workers come and settle and make life here because it's a wonderful historic community . It's extreme ly affordable. There's wonderful coffee houses. And it's all true. It's absolutely all true. This is a wonderful beautiful community . The architect ure is spectacular . And my son and I are extremely pleased. My son's a public transportation fanatic . So you'll be hearing from him as soon as he gets back from his epic train trip around the country . But I never expected to come to Pennsylvania to be disenfranchised . I never came to Pennsylvania with the expectation that I would lose my right to vote effectively . But it seems that the head of the Republican party 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 who is a seditionist who is on the grounds of the Capitol and pierced police lines. With my own eyes I saw this. I wasn't there. I mean, I saw it. He Tweeted the pictures making himself completely disqualified according to terms of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution . He claims that the legislature of Pennsylvania has the power to nullify and reverse elections . This theory has many names, be it independent legislature theory, states rights theory, state sovereignty theory. He says that he can do it. I take him at his word. This traitor has actually written to the United States Congress under his own letterhead asking for the Biden victory to be decertified . It wasn't like a personal opinion of his. He actually put it on his letterhead claiming under the position of his own authority that the will of the voters of the City of Scranton be nullified , cancelled , reversed, void. I want to say right now that I understand I'm a political science profess or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 and I understand how state governments work. I do. I understand that this is the City Council . But people need to speak out. People need to say that as we sit here and do the really wonderful , wonderful working s of democracy , the give and take, people asking for quality services , that kind of thing, the basis of the entire system is under attack as we speak from the Republican leader and many members of the Republican caucus in Harrisburg . I did not move to Scranton , New Jersey to be disenfranchised , absolutely not, okay? Without your right to vote, without your right to coalesce and use that, you are nothing . The Constitution of the United States is clear. The 14th Amendment says that no state can violate or take away anyone's rights without due process of law. State sovereignty theory is crap. It's nonsense . It's discredited it. It means nothing . It is the talk of anti-Semites and Christian nationalists in 2022. So I am going to say right now that I am not going to sit back and sit here and be quiet as bona fide Nazis in the State of Pennsylvania , people who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 will get on social media and claim that Jews don't have to worry because we're not going to be deported. I'm not going to sit here and just be silent with that. By the way, the reason why I brought up the whole thing, the whole subject of the Jews and deportation is that the leader of -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Kurtz, your time is up. MR. KURTZ: Oh, I apologize , sir. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Your time -- you get five minutes . MR. KURTZ: Yes. I apologize . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list is Doris Koloski . MS. KOLOSKI : May I approach with this piece of paper? MR. DONAHUE : Yes, absolutely . MS. KOLOSKI : Okay. I'm going to finish a couple statement s that I ran over time on. I just want to say that most of us have had a lot of -- our biggest investments have been our homes. And it's just very sad that our homes would be really down valued by the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 expansion of the Geisinger Hospital . Okay. The picture I gave you I would like you to look at. That's what it looks like with the parking garage shining in my bathroom window. Now, if they put that parking garage across the street from me it would look like that in my bedroom and the bedroom of the family next door to me. This picture is what I see from my bathroom at night, okay. My neighbors on Wheeler Avenue see that shining into their bedroom windows and their porches from that garage on 327 Wheeler . We can't sit on our porch without being blinded in the evening by the lights from the hospital . The problem with the parking garage has been -- she's had this problem with the parking garage, has called them year after year after year and they just ignore it. She's asked them to tip the lights down, put a shade over it or something . They completely ignore it. So that's what I'm saying is when you're dealing with them, once they get what they want, they stop the promises that they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 made to the neighbors . I don't know about anything else. But they don't keep their word. And that is why we can't give them the carte blanche zoning change they want because according to like April 1st in the newspaper it even stated where Mr. Beerz{phonetic } had said at the meeting he had at the old nurse's home at the CMC we will not build anything that is like 125 feet. Yet they came to the City. The City didn't come to them. That wasn't the propose d zoning, a zoning called civic. They came. They asked for it. And in that zoning of civic, they say they could build building s that are 125 feet is one of the stipulation s. They don't want to compromise on that. They wouldn't need to change that whole zoning description if they meant to keep their word and not build giant garages and a giant building of 125 feet. In the beginning they said they would build three-story building s with underground parking . Now they have no plan, which having no plan is pretty unbelievable . So all I wanted to say was I'm really hoping that you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 don't let them get away with this. I hate the fact that we were loyal -- all the people that live around there were loyal to the City when the great migration to Clarks Summit and other things went. That's when all my friends moved to Clarks Summit. We stayed. We were loyal. We support ed the school system. Our kids graduated from all the public schools in Scranton . We paid our taxes. We put money into our house. And now my house will be unsalable to anyone except the hospital . And then they could just offer you whatever they want. So I'm really hoping that you don't let this happen to our neighborhood . And thank you for your time and enjoy your vacation . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, John Thomas. MR. THOMAS: John Thomas, Scranton . A while back the DPW had a program at Johnson College where the Johnson College student s who worked on trucks and fixing truck engines would work on the DPW trucks. Do you know if that program is still in existence ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 MR. DONAHUE : I don't off the top of my head. I could find out for you. MR. THOMAS: I'm going a while back because Mr. Pisano, I believe , was head of the DPW. That was quite a few years back. And that program doesn't exist anymore? MR. DONAHUE : I don't believe it does. But I'll double-check. MR. THOMAS: Do you have your own mechanics ? Is that -- MR. DONAHUE : We do have -- I think there is four City mechanics . MR. THOMAS: I thought that was a pretty good idea by that man. You know, it doesn't cost the City any money. Do you know what I mean? MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . MR. THOMAS: -- to work on the trucks, the students . The shoe store on the corner of Penn and Linden caught on fire a couple years ago as you know. And I wonder if you have an update on what you're going to do with that building ? MR. DONAHUE : I know they went in front of the Architectural Review Board which 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 plans to tear it down. But it lacked detail in terms of how it was going to secure the wall of the building . So the HARB denied their request and wanted more information coming back. That's the last I know about it. But they were suppose d to come back with more engineering plans on how they were going to stabilize that outside wall on the building next door. MR. THOMAS: Okay. Do you have an update on the park on the corner of Wyoming and Linden? MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I was going to address that in Fifth Order. But last week we had Scranton Tomorrow in. They put the -- the bids were closed a couple weeks ago for construction of that project that included filling in the hole. That will be -- I believe that should be awarded in the next couple weeks. The money has to be expended by the middle of February . So it's my understanding that the project will be completed by the middle of February . MR. THOMAS: Okay. Thank you very 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 much and have a safe summer, Council . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . Tonight I'd like to have minute or two of my outrage . Somebody in my neighborhood has been poisoning cats and squirrels . I buried two of them last week. Now two squirrel s, and as animal lover this is heartbreaking when you see their mouths open and how they died in agony. Several of the animals just have gone. They are not there. And what happened a couple years ago the lady behind us moved whatever the reason was. And she had about 15 cats in the house. They're all over the neighborhood . I know it's a bad problem . But this poisoning has been going on for a year or so. And several of the people in the neighborhood have it sort of narrowed down to somebody on Throop Street. This is just -- it's just -- I don't know what you are suppose d to do with an abundance of cats. But this isn't the way to get rid of them. The last 25 years Roseanne and me 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 have spent, I could buy another car for what we spent on animals and having them neutered and so forth and taking them to Old Forge Hospital when they were sick. I'm just talking about animals that aren't ours. Now they have someone poisoning them. There's something wrong with these people. And last week, I complained about when you mess with my pocketbook it makes me irritable . Well, for some reason HUD bought the mortgage on my property July 7th. They just sent me a letter that they bought it. It doesn't say why. You know, I have a reverse mortgage . Once a year this gentleman comes by to see if I'm still living in the house. Last year my neighborhood diminished so badly the insurance went up. I explained because they told me the -- I owe so much and the house isn't worth any more like it was a year or two before that. Last night when I walked my puppy, there was a tractor -trailer parked on city property at the bridge, Parker Street bridge. I think it's time something is done about that. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 That's what diminishes people's houses, their property values. And the two junkyards behind the houses on Throop Street, 120 and 122, not a thing. I know the City talked to them but they didn't move nothing . There's a guy still sleeping in a camper trailer that's a bus. There's a broken down carpet on the street for over a year. There's grass is growing under it. My neighborhood didn't look like this when Mr. Courtright was in office. Mr. Doherty , Jimmy Connors , my neighborhood was nice. Miss Cognetti has allowed the licensing bureau just to step all over her. Whoever is responsible for North Main Avenue ought to be fired. There is no sense in the way grass aren't cut. There's boarding houses all over the place, illegal boarding houses. People park on the front lawns. And that's the first really -- that's what starts a neighborhood downhill is cars parking on your front lawns making a mess. But I think I'm going to have to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 just put picture s of Biden all over my son's computer if this isn't cleaned up immediately . And it would be so simple to stop the trucks down there. Put some signs up no overnight parking or put some concrete barriers up. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. We'll forward that along to Code Enforcement . MR. ELLMAN: I know you did what you could. I'm not saying that. But I would appreciate something before the man comes and looks at my house again. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Tim Schwartz . MR. SCHWARTZ : Hey everybody , Tim Schwartz . I'm the President of the Hill Neighborhood Association speaking in support of our neighbors like Doris. And not only that, this is kind of a perspective from the Hill Neighborhood Association about the zoning issue on Colfax supporting all the residents , not just those who live on Colfax but those basically that live on Harrison up towards the park. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 I first want to say thank you for your responsiveness to my comment s a couple weeks ago. I really appreciate that. It's refreshing to get feedback . So thank you. I want to make clear about some thought s from the Hill Neighborhood Association on the zoning changing . You're heard a lot from people saying, you know, about what Geisinger is doing. From my perspective it's important that in the city we have good hospital s that we have a hospital that can expand and grow and bring services , bring good services into the City. And the City needs better hospitals . I don't want to be afraid to go the hospital when I get sick. So I think it absolutely -- we need better hospital s. I think when you talk to people in the Hill Neighborhood in those blocks, they'll say, yes, absolutely we need better hospitals . However , from my perspective probably from the Hill Neighborhood perspective if bringing better hospital s into the City, bringing more services into the City at the -- because by doing that devastating the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 neighborhood s, I think we're not okay with that. I think a majority of people in the Hill would be very cautious of the expansion of the hospital and the cost of devastating entire neighborhood s. It's been months now that I've been listening to the heartache and the grief and the anger and pain of the neighborhood because of the propose d zoning changes or the change that started a civic area and it didn't change or whatever but is still threatening to a neighborhood , still allows for the neighborhood to be devastated . We would ask from the Hill Neighborhood Association that you would consider as you're making these decision s about the zoning that you would consider the resident s who are there, consider the history of the neighborhood . I was talking with somebody last night who was telling me about how he raised his kids on Colfax, how he remembers his kids running up and down Colfax Street playing ball in the street and stuff like that. Every family from Arthur to Harrison talks about how, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 you know, that has been their home. There are generational houses there. And now when you go down Colfax, it's all gone. There's a lot of grief in that. We want the hospital to expand but not at the cost of devastating neighborhoods . Now, I think like in your hands right now with the new zoning map you hold a lot. You hold the livelihood and the quality of life of not just the people of the 200 and 400 of block of Colfax, but the 40, 50, 60 families in surround ing neighborhood as well. You know, traffic is going to have to be worked in that way somehow . Doris talked about lighting , noise, all that have stuff. Those are quality of life issues. Those are issue about livelihoods as well as another thing that you hold in your hand is if the zoning for that part of the neighborhood does not change, it puts every neighborhood on call that there is a big business in the area that wants to expand to bring jobs into the City, do something that is great for the City which is good. Our homes are at risk. Our homes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 are at risk of being bought up. Our neighbor hoods are risk that my neighbor is going to sell out or sell their house. That will be plowed down and my house will be like Doris's house, one of the last four on my block and now a dust field, which is one block away from where I live right now on the 800 block of Myrtle. So I think be careful with that. I ask that you listen to the neighbors . You listen to their grief and their pain and their heartache and everything like that. And I also ask that you seek a win/win/win scenario , a scenario where the hospital wins, a scenario where the residents wins, and certainly a scenario where the City of Scranton wins as well. So thanks for your time and I appreciate it. Thanks. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Council , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I have to say to this gentleman here, my son graduated from high school and went to college in New Jersey. So I'm very familiar 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 with the Princeton area and architect ure up there and the architecture here in Scranton is very similar . I've been back in town four years. So I say all of that because , Council , as you know, I have been standing up here for four years with my concerns for the City of Scranton . When I return to Scranton four years ago I was very concerned about different issues. But I'm not a complain er. If I'm going to see something that needs to be done I'm going to see what I could do to take care of it. Of course, the first thing that I ran into was the street signs. It's been four years that I have stood here at this podium asking about the street signs. As late as last week I asked for a callback from the DPW. I have a picture of me down at the DPW with the guys that make the street signs. I had a tour down there and it was a very enlightening tour. I came back very excited thinking that we were going to move forward with getting the street signs up. Unfortunately , that has not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 occurred . I have not seen any advancement at all in getting the street signs up. And I know that they tell me that there is only 1.5 persons working down there. But they do and have added other people. So it's a concern that they could rush and put up the Biden signs that they could rush and put up -- it was a different color too. It's brown because when I went for the tour, everything has to be green and have pixelation . So the signs that they put up for the Biden signs had to be a lot more work for them to go through and put the signs up, all the missing signs in Scranton . So I hope this gentleman has good GPS so he could work his way through the area because the signs are still missing . So it's a big concern of mine and it's very disheartening to know that it's taken over three years and the only signs that I see are up unfortunately are in the neighborhood where I live. That's not right. That's not right. Everyone deserves to have a good street sign in their neighborhood . So for the good side and for the upside is, I noticed the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 banners all hanging out front. And I think someone mentioned about the national night out is going to be next week. August is a very -- the first week of August is a very busy week. So I hope everyone takes advantage of all of those things like the police night out is the first one. The Scranton Jazz Festival is the next sign that is up out there. And then, of course, the third sign is our flower show. And, you know, I've been talking about it, put a lot of work into it. We've been meeting since the fall to get it together . And we're very excited about it. And all we have to do now is pray for a good day. It's not too hot and not too this and it's not too that so that we can have a good representation of the activities that go on in Scranton so that everyone can enjoy the work and the things that have gone into it. I wish you all a very nice August time off. It's like I said, the first week of August is very busy. And I don't want people going out of town that first week. But after that they could go out of town. So thank you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 very much for your time. And I will continue to talk about the street signs. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. The first thing I have here is that a Scranton resident came up here and spoke about the hospital and the garage that I guess they plan to build. And I'd say to that woman not to waste much of her time and take a collection off of her neighbors and call the Pennsylvania Bar Association and find an attorney or go to Philadelphia and find an attorney . And it's not that I don't believe what the Hill Neighborhood Association representative s have said here today, but I wouldn't waste much time with that because this battle's in court. And if it goes -- if it has to go there, you should be prepare d to take yourself there because politics just isn't going to help you very much. And the second thing I have is, you know, another speaker spoke about the Constitution and elections . I hope that every 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 person would pick up Pennsylvania 's Constitution and see who could change election law in Pennsylvania . It's not the Court. And the Court did that. And it's illegal . Only the legislature in Pennsylvania can change election laws, which threw the whole Pennsylvania election into chaos. And really what should have happened is all the votes in Pennsylvania should have been tossed out and the election should have been held over again. And when you see what's taking place across this country , history is going to record what occurred . It's not going to be very pretty. And it's definitely shaken our country right to its foundation . Now I personally have a federal constitution and a state constitution . I don't pretend to be a constitutional authority . But I understand them because I own them. They're my property . They're my right. They're my birth right from my ancestors who voted to accept them in law. They are everything I stand on is the Constitution , both of them. I don't stand on politics . I don't care about the Democrats . And I surely don't 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 care about the Republicans . But I do think that when somebody comes into a chamber and calls someone a Nazi, I think that's way overboard, okay. And don't forget Sam Rosen lived in Scranton and he took his family by wagon to the extermination centers in Poland. Watch Judge Munley's interview with this man. Now, I spoke to this man maybe once or twice and get a real understand ing of what a Nazi is what they do. And when you throw statements around that loosely like that, that is just a terrible , very trouble thing to say. But he has the right to say it because the Constitution says he can. But he should apologize . Now, the last thing I have here is, I've done three videos so far on ECTV. I intend to do a series more. I've asked ECTV to tie the three of them together . I think it's very, very important that we rewrite the charter for the county and the city together at one time. You know, we've got a gentleman here on Council who wants to be a state 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 representative . And my question is, what about all this grant money we're throwing around? I think that the City should come forward and tell us where -- and I think the Council should want to know this -- where the grant money has gone for the last 50 years in this City. Where has all the money that's come into this City for 50 years gone to? It's not to throw stones at anybody . Let's see where this grant money was spent, how it benefit ed the residents and what ultimately happened to all of these assets, very important because , you know, we're always talking about spending a lot of money. And we're doing a reassessment . And the people in this community are already overtaxed. And we've blighted this City. This City is no better shape now than it was when it went into Act 47. And don't forget, Mayor Doherty pushed this City into distress . And we named the Pocket Park after him. And after he got elected , he torpedo ed the pension plan. He built garages we couldn't afford, wasted tons of money in the park, built a bridge to nowhere , built all kinds of project s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 that the resident s didn't need. And in my opinion , that's not what elected officials should do. They should empower the people they represent . MR. DONAHUE : Next on the list, Jess Nolan. MS. NOLAN: Good evening , everyone , Jess Nolan, 1700 block of Vine Street. I think I'm going to be brief. I'm really just here to say thank you. I was away on vacation but had a chance to watch the footage from the previous two Council meetings where Tim Schwartz spoke and Doris spoke. And I think we had another member of our Nay Aug area community concern ed about the zoning changes had spoken to that issue. So I really just wanted to thank all of you for publically expressing your concern and your sympathies with the community . For over a year we've been in a state of uncertainty not knowing what's going to happen in our backyard s, our front yards, not being able to advance home improvement project s because we don't know if we're just literally flushing money down the toilet to have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 bulldozer come and knock our houses down when we are sort of forced to sell even if we don't want to even if we love our homes and our neighborhood because they're putting something up that is just not -- we hope something we could live with. The not knowing has been incredibly stressful . And so, you know, to Council person Rothchild and Council person Donahue and I think the rest of you are probably doing this work as well with trying to get this information from the hospital . We still have not seen a plan. I think I was here three months ago. And, you know, Kyle, you were kind enough to say I'm going to try to get you a meeting . We're going to try to get answers . Council person Rothchild , I think you were trying to have conversations with Geisinger and maybe you are starting to experience some of the frustration we've been experiencing in getting them to answer question s and provide information . So I thank you sincerely for doing that work for us because they are certainly not communicating with us in any sort of proactive 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 manner. And that is also really disappoint ing and really frustrating . I have e-mailed their community representative about debris on my property several times, no response from them. And actually more disappoint ing to me is I've e-mailed the Mayor's office -- or not e-mailed. I'll called twice and received no response from her office about her position on what's happening with the hospital . Again, it's just disappoint ing to me. I know Paige and I like Paige. And on this issue I feel a little bit abandoned by her office unfortunately . So it's very refreshing to have our City Council listening to us, hearing our concerns and trying to sort of, you know, be in the middle to help us figure out, you know, if there is some compromise that we could come to. It really does mean the world to us. We're very concerned as you heard from others before me. And so I really just want to say thank you. And please do keep us updated as you learn more. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Recently I had the opportunity to visit the next door in the Governor 's Room and watch the Ethics Board meeting . They're trying desperately hard and they're going to be bringing before this body a change in the ordinance because they have found a glaring loophole that is within the documents of their procedures . I'm not going to go into that. They could go into that when they bring it up at the beginning of the next session that this Council will be holding . I find them to be a very interesting group. Unfortunately , they are lacking a lot in the knowledge and depth of what the regulations actually are. They understand ethics. They understand what should be done. They are trying to put their grasp around what is best for the City. But they are seriously lacking in the understanding of how ethics and the City's laws and the laws of the state come together in and intertwine to make procedure s that should be held going forward . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 What are violations ? At what level of violations are they? And I understand they are somewhat shielded from that because they cannot even make a decision on whether something is ethical or not until it gets ruled upon by independent bodies and brought before them. It's a daunting task. I just look at them in this organization and I think the intent is wonderful . I think they're good people. I think there is a serious lack of understanding of the total scope that binds together ethics. And they need to have some way of getting training for that. They have their own budget which is timing, miniscule . But there is no training . There is no office trips. There is no -- the equivalent of HR to show them and communicate with them what actually needs to be done by that body. They're sort of running by the solicitor asking questions and hoping to get the right -- ask the right questions to get them answered . It's sort of reaching around in the dark. And that's an issue. In 2019, I first came before this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 body. And I brought forward cyber security as one of the big issues. An existing Council member looked at that, listened to me and brought it forward and it couldn't be discussed for security reasons . Shortly after me bringing that forward , the issue of cyber security did come to the front as the City of Scranton was hit with ransomware. By putting off my comment s, the City now has a burden of $170,000 a year extra insurance payments because of that cyber attack. City government has a fiduciary responsibility . It has an ethical responsibility . And it has a responsibility to work with the people. I think there has been serious lack of communication between the people and isolationism , which is signified by the locked door at City Hall as a perfect example . I brought before this body when something comes before it to be introduced, a representative should introduce it because you cannot cross-examine or ask questions of a cover sheet. In Maryland they do that because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 it is part of defining intent by the courts is to understand the legislative intent. That cannot be done by a piece of paperwork . These are all failures of the body to secure the laws it puts forward . And last, this body is often criticize d because they have not put on referendum Biden Street. That is not the fault of this body. This body ruled on it. This body put it forward . The Mayor signed it. The citizens themselves as I talked on this dais had 30 days after that to request petition and put out a referendum . It's not this body's job to put out the referendum . It was the populous who failed to move forward in their obligations . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I will start by asking Tom if he has the percentage of exempt and nonexempt properties . MR. SCHUSTER : I did reach out via electronic ally and in person to Mr. West to get the update on that. I would say about three years ago it was about 36 percent . He said he 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 is going to get me the current percentage of exempt and nonexempt . So I'm waiting for that. And number two, I also spoke with the Law Department on the right-of-ways. There are 44 right-of-ways and only one has been secured at this point in time. And then they're going to put out RFQ/RFP process to get the legal services to go towards the rest of them. MS. SCHUMACHER : Who is the -- I'm off my schedule here. But who is the project person on that? MR. SCHUSTER : Andrew Cutillo from the Law Department was the one that I spoke to regarding the right-of-ways. MS. SCHUMACHER : Andrew -- I never heard of that name before. Spell the last name for me. MR. SCHUSTER : C-U-T-I-L-L-O. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : You're welcome . MS. SCHUMACHER : I'm going to do something selfish and I'm going to ask that you try your best to get to Mr. Preambo back. I mean, when you called over there you got something done within three days. Now it's not 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 days. It's not necessarily three weeks and you know our roads are a mess. And Pennsylvania Water I think it was -- a utility anyway came through on Seymour Avenue. And at the last portion where it meets 307 did God only knows what. But I get seasick when I go by and my car cries. And I know they've been called and I have even seen somebody out there arguing with somebody else over the -- what was done there. So I think we had somebody who got the job done. And I think we should try to bring him back. Now, I would like to say as you know that I have been very disappoint ed with you people. It certainly started when -- and I asked the people on Colfax Avenue to be careful because four of these five people listened to people from Spruce Street come here and say why they should not have to change the name of the street and what it was going to do to them. And it didn't take long, but this body voted five to nothing to go ahead with what they wanted or somebody else who was controlling them wanted and not what I believe 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 was right. And -- and then also when you first came back -- came here, you were going to do things, policies and we were going to have work statements and stuff. I have -- I know it's not happening because I have done right to knows to ask for policies . And what I get back is maybe in 30 days we could help you. So, I mean, what have you done to get them to do what they're supposed to do? I think it's terrible . And, I mean, the code -- another thing. Does anybody ever read the code? Do you know that in the code we still have the -- let me get this one. We still have when it was called South Scranton Complex -- sports complex . How long has it been since Mayor Doherty sold that to the University of Scranton ? And it's still here. That shouldn 't be. Then I would like to know with regard to policies because I got a letter that I know that each of you got that was anonymous . But I would like to know the policy is, is it normal for the City to allow people who are incarcerated to use their vacation , personal , and sick time to get paid while 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 they're incarcerated ? MR. DONAHUE : We did pass that request along. We haven't gotten a response yet. MS. SCHUMACHER : Pardon? MR. DONAHUE : We passed that along to the administration for clarification on what the policy is. And we haven't gotten a response yet. MS. SCHUMACHER : So we will not -- oh, that's before -- I have -- will we have the Third Order stuff while you're gone the six weeks? MR. DONAHUE : It will all come into Third Order in our September meeting . If there is anything you are looking for, we'll pass that along to you. Just let us know. MS. SCHUMACHER : Weekly rather than -- MR. DONAHUE : All right. Seymour Avenue, was that the entire length or just the -- MS. SCHUMACHER : I don't know. It's about the last -- I don't know. I'm not too good on --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 MR. DONAHUE : But it's more towards 307. MS. SCHUMACHER : Oh, yes. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident , taxpayer . I have a question . Where is the policeman tonight ? MR. DONAHUE : I have the same question . MR. DOBRZYN : Okay. Last week I mentioned about the security . And I would hope that the Mayor would be a little more responsive . I mean, Joan is a very intelligent person. And she probably has something decent to offer and respectful by the way. I went down to pay my taxes at the county building . And I praised the Single Tax Office. But by the time I got past the sheriff s or deputies , I felt I knew how a returnee from a work release program felt. I mean, it was like pull up my shirt and all kinds of stuff, empty my pockets , okay. Well, that's fine and dandy. But that's -- I wish they would keep in mind that I was there to pay 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 some of their wages. Maybe it's just a dollar that they would have got out of the money, but they would have gotten something . I would appreciate if we try to establish a better relationship with the Mayor and Council . And we really need to try to settle these city contracts with keeping in mind public workers that everybody doesn't get a 10 percent raise just because of inflation . And if Social Security gets a 10 percent raise, it's probably too little stacked on top of too little anyway. Every year your actual income shrinks . We had a comment here about the Governor 's race and white christian nationalist or Nazis -- and I agree. You know, there's a site called Gab and our Governor candidate in the Republican party donated $5,000 to that site. It's all kinds of white supremacist and all kinds of bull. And by the way, states are not sovereign under the Constitution like some people think. We are subject to the federal constitution because actually if you literally enforce the Pennsylvania 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 Constitution , churches would have to pay property tax and income tax. There wouldn't be any of this tax free institution s that really aren't a functional nature like a hospital or nonprofit hospital or nonprofit insurance company . You are -- you cannot -- under the PA Constitution as I remember it, you cannot be required to support an institution , a ministry that's described as that you do not believe in or are not a member of it. So, therefore , if we have to pave the streets in front of their church and we have to provide police and fire protection and everything else, all the amenities following , you would actually under the Pennsylvania Constitution have the right to probably charge them property taxes. And they run around making all of this trouble like over birth control and nonsense like that -- the world's too overpopulated now. It's way too overpopulated . And all they're going to result with are depriving young people of contraception is generating more street urchins because 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 eventually there's nothing to do. I grew up in a house that wasn't so great. And it was out in the street after 16 years old. That was it. I couldn't take -- MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a few comments I mentioned earlier at the -- during the caucus. I understand that Mr. Lazor has met with someone from the City concerning the PPT tax. If you recall we had that letter from Mr. Lazor and from Attorney McGovern . So I would just like to get a followup as to what the result of that meeting was if you could check into that for us, Frank? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. King. MR. KING: Thank you. And just also -- I'm going to mention this one 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 publically . There's been an abandoned vehicle on Birch street that we've been trying to get rid of for months. Now there is painting around it. It looks like they were trying to do some roadwork or the utilities . I just implore the Scranton Police Department or whoever to please get that vehicle . There is no license on it. It's my understanding . It's abandoned . Someone moved and it was a leased vehicle and they abandon ed the lease. But it's just been sitting there with no registration or license on it for months. So if we could just really push to get that vehicle moved out of there. The neighbor s are deeply concerned about that. That's all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes. So a couple tonight here. It came up tonight some of the section s that were missing -- I know Mr. King brought up one last week between Birch Street on East Mountain . I know Miss Schumacher -- MR. KING: Paving, right? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, paving sections 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 that were missed. When the original paving list was put out, a resident contact ed me about East Elm Street. He said that there was a section about 155 feet on East Elm Street that was probably going to be forgotten in the paving. Me and Mr. Voldenberg did reach out to try to make sure that was on the list. I know we got the response that there's nothing going to be added this year. I did speak with him today. He wanted me to let people know that he did put 7 tons of asphalt into the pothole s on that section of the street. The road still does need to be paved. But maybe we could get that on the list for next year or when we're looking into these couple sections if something comes up or if the City decides to add it to the list. Some other things that we got that it was brought up in public comment tonight , the street sign project . I know we were present ed a great presentation about the grant we received for the street signs. If we could please reach out to the DPW and see where we're at with that with the street sign replacement 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 project . And then we also got a request out of caucus for the 900 block of Quincy. I know some of those addresses were put through . The person couldn't stay but if we could send those over to Code Enforcement for the 900 of Quincy. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : All right. That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I do. I have a number of things that I want bring forward tonight . The first of which we asked the LIPS Department about accessibility for City Hall and ADA compliance and we had received a response from Mr. Eastman with suggestions and advice on what we could do to improve the situation with City Hall. So I just wanted to read out his suggestion s and what I hope will change with City Hall to improve that. The first one will be one large or two regular handicap parking spots could be added to the rear of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 building , not at the ramp but a few spaces back. The handicap drop-off section at the base of the ramp could be relined by the DPW. The restroom doors on the second floor -- so the floor we're on are handicap accessible bathroom s because they do have a lock that is located at a lower position . So if someone was using a wheelchair that they could reach them. However , the restroom s on the other floors do not have those locks and wondering if that is something that could be added. He didn't state that in his e-mail, but I don't see that as being too difficult of a thing to include and change the locks on the door so that additional restroom s could be accessible . And the automatic open mechanism on the way out is located in the rear of the building if someone needed to use that. We don't have one in the front of the building . But that one does have to be repaired. And so he's made a request for that to be taken care of. And there is no handicap access at the front of the building . All handicap is at the rear. There is no immediate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 plans to place a handicap parking spot at the front of the building because of that because the way that City Hall is set up and where the ramp and accessibility to the elevator is. And then he had another note about sidewalks that were corrected with the curb. There was a question of 818 Ash Street and McKenna Court and so that's -- that problem has been corrected . And then on the note of -- so that is the end of his response for us, which I do find those suggestions to be helpful . And I'll be looking towards the City taking care of those issues for City Hall. On the note of restrooms , I did just want to make a comment that I was really happy to see this week. I believe it had just changed this week because I just noticed it in the building tonight that we now have signs on the restrooms for all gender restrooms rather than separate men and women restrooms for the single use bathrooms , which I feel very personal ly happy about and proud for City Hall for making even just that small change, which I know for many people won't matter but for people who feel more comfortable with an all 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 gender restroom , that would be better. Or if, you know, one of the restrooms is not available, you don't have to be concerned about using the other one that's labeled for the other gender. So there are a lot of advantages to that. And I was happy to see that. And I hope that encourages other places throughout Scranton to make that change too if they do have single use restroom s instead of labeling them for one gender or another and making them all gender. And I wanted to bring up we discussed this in our caucus but the Nay Aug pool update that we received which is that nothing -- that they're not changing any immediate plans for Nay Aug or to give us other options like we thought we were going to receive , which I'm disappoint ed and frustrated in. And that instead they are going to come up with a master plan. They're going to a use McLane to develop a master plan for the park, which I'm not against , which I do understand the need for a master plan. But I just wish it would have been thought of sooner 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 and now we have to wait even longer. And by the time I'm able to walk down to the park and have my daughter use the pool, she'll probably be in grade school. So just, you know, as a resident and I'm sure to others, that's disappointing . And but I am interested in seeing what comes out of the master plan, what other suggestions there are and what other grants we could -- we could go for. So I just want to make a note about that. And then for the Hill Section and Geisinger 's plans, I have been in conversations with the neighbors . And I did set something up for next Tuesday night since we won't be having our Council meeting when I could meet with those neighbor s in that area to hear out more of their thought s and concerns because I know that five minutes is not enough for the time that they have to speak here, although I did appreciate them coming up. And I do love my neighborhood . And when I was a student at the university I did rent within the Hill. Then we moved out to a couple other neighborhood s and then we came back when we decided to buy our home I think in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 2017. So I know we love being there. And I understand how passionate other people feel about the neighborhood and wanting to still keep it as the neighborhood that they've always known. So I'm looking forward to more conversation s about that and continuing to push for more information from Geisinger and more communication between Geisinger and the neighbors . And I -- thank you to Councilman Schuster for bringing up the request for an update on the Sign Program . I was going to bring that up as well because I would like to know where we're at with it, what new signs have been put out. We have been given numbers in past as to amount of new signs that were replaced so if we could please get that update. And lastly, I just want to say thank you for the well wishes for our August recess. I do just want to remind everyone that it's a legislative recess so we won't take new legislation during that period of time. We won't be having our Council meetings. But I know I think I speak for the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 other Council members that we'll still be available through e-mail or through our Clerk's office if you do have concerns . So it's not that we won't continue working on things. I have a pretty long list of what I'd like to do over the month of August with some of that additional time that I have, which I've done -- which I've utilize d that recess period for in past years because I find it really helpful to meet with department heads. I really want to visit more of our parks which I haven't had those opportunity to do along with considering other legislation that we could possibly bring to Council when we resume in September . So those are my plans. And I am travelling , but not the first week of August, Miss Jeffries . That's all. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a few. So today I took a ride over to check up on the paving concerns I brought forward last week from resident s over in the Bulls Head area. And the issues -- and, Mr. Voldenberg , you sent out requests and inquired . They got to send 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 information and feedback . But the issues remain. This week or today I took picture s. So I would be happy to send you the picture s to back up the concerns that I received last week and that you already sent over. So on Blair Avenue, it's still curb to curb. I took a picture . It's not curb to curb like we're always told by the utility company we're going to go curb to curb. This one is three-quarters paved. The 7, 800 of Foster, half the road is paved, just half of the road going up -- one side of the road. Okay. And then the 13 and 1400 of Diamond , the whole street was milled, okay, but only paved up the middle. It reminded me of a patch like this. So I was happy to be able to speak to some resident s there because they were on the porches. It's a little cooler. And the one lady on 1301 said, you know, come here. Come on over here. Take a look. And I guess there was some type of subsidence in front of her house after it was milled. So my understanding is the utility companies told her there that, you know, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 there's an issue here. And she told me that the sewer company came. It was a collapsed pipe, okay. That makes sense. And DPW came. They both did a great job. They filled it all in, but they have yet to pave. So, Mr. Voldenberg , so we need an update on that 1300 block of Diamond because the whole street is milled and there's just a patch up the middle. So and, you know, of course, she wants to know when they are going to come back and pave it, you know, if it's safe to pave. And I talked to some more resident s today. And I still can't wrap my head around why you pave half a street, three-quarter s of a street or just up the middle because -- and this is all work that was done by the gas company . So, you know, not only do these concerned resident s pay city taxes and deserve a street totally paved, but they also pay the gas company . They're customers . So, you know, like I stated last week, we should be working with our resident s, not against them. All right. And I believe , you know, and the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 American Rescue Plan Act has money that could be used for infrastructure and paving. So please ask for an update. I know we didn't receive anything since last weeks' inquiry that when are they going to plan to fix this and make it right. All right? And then also I have another property , a concern citizen -- this is about five years now. And it's the property on 319 North Sumner Avenue. There's blight issues and other issues and these neighbors don't feel satisfied that anything has really been done in the past five years. So I don't see it on any of our current logs where it's somewhere , you know, issued citation s or we've had visits. So this is one that might have slipped through the cracks. I do remember speaking about this one or someone else bringing it up a couple years ago, but we got to take a look at that one or remind them down there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. Also, so, you know, I sat in caucus tonight too. We 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 talked about the pool. I'm here three years and we have been talking about the pool, all right? And three years ago this water bottle was the pool. It was in reach of all the little kids I'm thinking . You know, the pool's here. So then we had two or three meetings . And then in May we had a meeting and another presentation where the pool is going to be 3 feet deep. Didn't hear -- that discussion , never had. So now they took the pool and they moved it from here all the way over to here with the master plan. I'm not against a master plan. But I want answers for the pool. We have been asking for months. And Miss Hodowanitz made a great point. How much is it going to cost? We still don't know. Who's going to do it? Where's the money coming from and when is it going to done? A master plan is great, more bells and whistles . I'm okay with that. But, you know, we wanted a pool. We've been talking about a pool. At least tell us the plans that have been decided for the pool. You want to know. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 I want to know. I'm still waiting . So, Mr. Voldenberg , you know, circle around on that one because we have really been asking about it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And then months ago I asked about contract negotiations , right? I said when did you meet? Please give us actual sit down -- because we're told every week the negotiations continue and they're ongoing. I asked -- I don't know if was -- I don't remember -- maybe March or May I said how many times have you met since January , right? And they came back to us finally . And they only really met -- the three unions only met maybe twice each from January to March. So last week or maybe two weeks ago again I asked for an update on actual -- I mean physical negotiations where you actually sit down across the table from each other, all right, not phone calls, not anything else, right. So I did receive -- we all did. All the Council members receive d a memo and it says confidential attorney /client privilege 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 memorandum . Well, I don't think it's confidential . You guys need to know. You've been asking me about updates . So I'm going to tell you what I got, all right. So since February -- let's see. This is -- the police have met in April twice and then June three times. All right. That's since our last time we brought this up. The firefighter s have only met one or -- twice, excuse me. Wait. Let me see. They've only met three times since February . All right. And then the DPW has met since last time we asked so let me see. One, two -- there's only been two held since February and one to be held July 27th. All right, so that's where we're at. I mean, there's not a lot of negotiations occurring . And like Miss Hodowanitz comes in every week and says we're at day whatever , we're at day here. So I promised I would get the information . I'm reporting that out to you, all right? Let's hope they get together and really get these contracts settled . Also, we were told a couple weeks ago and a couple people asked me, they're like, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 hey, where is the DPW Director posting on the website ? We looked in your office earlier before caucus right, Mr. Voldenberg , we were unable to find it. I don't know if it's on there somewhere . We were told there would be a posting . That position needs to be replaced. The gentleman who had that position resigned. All right. So let's please get an answer on that. And then what else do I have here? Also, an update on the power washer investigation , the usage of it. I've been asking for a couple weeks now. All I know is that it's -- I got nothing official . But it's still being investigated . And I asked for the surveillance for Serrenti . I never received that either. So I hope someone retrieved it. I hope they took a look at it and we can wrap up this investigation sooner than later. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I was also going to bring up 319 Sumner. We must have gotten the same e-mail. But I did give that to Frank too before the meeting and he was going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 to look into it. In terms of some of the statement s Mr. Ellman made, Mr. Voldenberg , would you be able to reach out to animal control and let them know about the poisoning of cats and squirrels . And also reach out to Code Enforcement about the area of North Main and Parker Street. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. Schuster brought up the update for street signs. And can we also reach out to the pave cut inspector regarding Seymour Avenue, more specifically closer to 307. I could get you certain blocks for tomorrow too, but if we could reach out to them there. A couple updates I got from last week regarding the permit parking on the 200 and 400 block of Colfax, the police department said that they are still monitor ing that and enforcing the permit parking up there. They are looking into whether or not they have to either move or add signs to make them more prevalent up there. And in terms of the wall, we did 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 request an update from Lackawanna -- the wall for the Radison . We did request an update from Lackawanna County on the status. They did get a grant that I believe that was only for the one section of the wall, the smaller wall going up the -- but so we have to look at grant opportunities for the bigger project of the whole wall then that keeps up the parking lot for the Radison and then also for walk and pedestrian safety there. And I know part of that has been -- that's been discussed , has been to move the bus station because the bus station -- the bus stop on that corner really isn't in the most pedestrian -friendly spot there. But we are -- we are looking into that with the county grant department . That grant was awarded through the county. And that's all I have for this evening . Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.
