Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Do any other Council members have any announcements ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list this evening is Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, Kyle, I want to thank you for your service as a Council men and wish you luck as you move into your role as state legislator . Just remember where you come from and who you owe, us. Keep us in mind. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . Thank you, Joan. MS. HODOWANITZ : I looked at the City's website again this morning . And there really isn't any change. Still no updated DPW contract posted, no updated Controller reports , no updated City audits. So hopefully they're working on that on some kind of basis. Speaking of audits, what is the status of the 2021 audit? MR. DONAHUE : I think the last 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 update we got was to expect it the first or second week of January . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. So we're still looking at January . All right. Apparently there was a hearing today for the lawsuit , the COLA lawsuit . Does anyone know what the outcome of that hearing was today? Are they still, like, taking it under advisement ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't think Council has gotten any update on that. That's in regards to the -- MS. HODOWANITZ : The backdated COLA from the Police Association . MR. DONAHUE : Yes, for the retirees , correct , yes. MS. HODOWANITZ : I mention it because we don't have the 2021 audit. And one of the things that should be in an audit is risk to the City especially litigation . And, of course, the last posted audit is 2018 and there are no risks associated with litigation . This lawsuit predates that. But I also wonder, you know, what would happen if the Police Association wins that lawsuit . That's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 going to have a significant impact on backpay in terms of COLA. But we shall see. What is the status of the police and fire union contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : It's my understanding they're still being negotiated . MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. With regard to the amended budget, I took a look at it. I notice that with the changes made in the amendments , there's a reduction of $192,719.48 in the City's budget. That's just a .2 percent reduction . So the amendments haven't taken it down very much. But oddly enough there were several salaries which were decreased from the original proposal . But there were two that were increased . One, of course, is Frank Voldenberg , the City Clerk. But, Frank, don't spend it all in one place because it's only $854. And after the taxes it's about $2 a day. The other one -- and you're a nonunion position . The other one in DPW in the garages , the auto repairman who got and additional $2,788.70. My question is, since that union contract is settled , why did only 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 one union member get a pay raise? MR. DONAHUE : So that was miscalculated . The problem , it gets a little confusing when you get into garages because half of them are DPW union employees , half of them are clerical union employees . MS. HODOWANITZ : No, this is not clerical . This is DPW. MR. DONAHUE : No, but so the auto repairman is a DPW employee . They got the original calculation was a clerical union raise. So that's why that increased there because they had to do the DPW calculation for those two positions for the auto repairman. But then there was a motor vehicle repair and a mechanic that got the DPW raise but are actually in the clerical union. So that's what those adjustments were there because the auto repairman, there are two, right, so that's where it was confusing two out for the other two. MS. HODOWANITZ : I don't know that there were two. I think there's only -- MR. DONAHUE : No, there's two because it's 103,000.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay, moving on. Your total personnel of 507, I count 505 because you eliminated the position in the Fire Department and a position in Parks and Rec. So it should be 505. But why under employee salary breakdown is OECD counted for salary and personnel in 2022 and not in 2023? MR. DONAHUE : Because we only -- I was only explaining the amendments . And we only amended what is in the general fund -- the general funds. And most of OECD is paid out of no general fund money. MS. HODOWANITZ : Why was it included in 2022? MR. DONAHUE : Because there was a different breakdown of where that money was coming from in 2022. That was a change that wasn't present in 2023. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Lee Morgan. MR. MORGAN: Good evening , Council , Lee Morgan. I'm sure the Council members individually are aware that I extended an invitation when the time is available to allow 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 the Council members to come along with the Recreation Authority at Nay Aug Park and the Mayor. And I didn't invite City Controller yet. But I'd like to have a discussion starting off with what happened at Nay Aug Park and the pool complex and the slide and just follow the chain of events or positions regards to the whole fiasco that's going on up there. I think the residents have a right to be informed on how their government is functioning or whether their government is functioning . I'm fairly troubled by a lot of things I see this Council doing. And there's really a lot more need for transparency . And there's a greater need for the residents to have an understanding about what's happening in the budget, where the money is coming from, where it's going because after a City has been in Act 47 for 30 years and then decides it's going to create an authority and fundraises and do demolition work at Nay Aug Park -- and then the last thing I heard is we don't even allegedly have money to build a pool there. So I think the residents have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 right to ask how the Council ever came to the conclusion that it was in the best interest of the City to demolish the pool itself considering there were remedies to the leakage that the pool was suffering under. And if the City didn't have the money to build the pools or a pool, then why wasn't that remedy used to solve the problem ? And, you know, we live in a City that's been in decline for my whole life. And, you know, you watch these Council meeting s and you just watched the destruction now of the Scranton School District . We live in a City with no preschool program . And we're talking about closing elementary schools . And we're putting the school district and this City in the same peril that Act 47 did to the City itself because the answer to insolvency by the City may have been to dissolve the City itself, okay, and then let the county run it because with all the shenanigans we've suffered under, the sale of the golf course with -- Scranton 's Municipal Golf Course where the City never spent one dime to build that golf course, never paid one bond 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 payment to build that golf course but yet they sold it. A gentleman from Scranton put that all together , not the City of Scranton . And when you take a look at the Scranton Sewer Authority and the parking garages , we had a Mayor that forced the City into Act 47 when he took office. Remember Jimmy Connors was the Mayor when the ball started rolling . And Chris Doherty started talking about how we should go into Act 47. And then he proceed ed to build parking garages . They knew the City could never pay for them. I mean, there has to be a situation where we move away from this five minute timeline , sit the Council members at a seat here and start listening to facts and figures and have information because these five minute little dalliances into make believe don't inform the residents of anything . And for anyone to consider themself a leader in any shape or form after what this City suffered through for 30 years and the closure of elementary schools and no preschool and the blight this City is suffering under, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 don't forget the Hill Neighborhood Association sold their building . And they're not the only ones. So the neighborhood associations are in a full rollback. And this City is falling apart. And this Council holds some of the burden. I asked the Mayor to come at a table and sit down. She wanted to talk to me about where she lived. I'm not interested in where she lived. That's up to the Council to determine that. And they don't want to it because the Council has the right to do the investigation s but they don't want to do those either. So before the City went into distress for all these decades , the City should have been doing investigations and the Scranton Times should have an investigative reporter . And they should be investigating things so we don't have to suffer anymore. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Yes, Council . Kyle, I wish you best on your new position . I hope you remember the little people in Scranton when you are down there. And I hope I wasn't your worst 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 nightmare this year. MR. DONAHUE : I almost made it through my entire tenure here without getting subpoenaed until yesterday when I was subpoena ed to appear, you know, as a witness on your behalf in your fight against the quality of life ticket. So thanks for that. MR. ELLMAN: Last year I had a man tell me at the grocery store I'm a ticking time bomb in here. And that's not true. I'm just an irritable taxpayer when you mess with my pocketbook it makes me irritable . Because of incompetence in different department s throughout this City, everybody 's pocketbook been messed with. You know, the taxes are three times what they used to be. And they're going to skyrocket with the big lie about reassessment . A week or so ago three big companies WNEP and Glen Maura, they asked and received -- their attorneys opposed their tax base. These are wealthy businesses . WNEP got a million dollar reduction in taxes. This is outrageous . Glen Maura is another one. From a million it was reduced to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 98,000. This was in the paper. That's where I got these figures . Another one of these greedy companies from 800,000 to 250,000. This is a preview what's going to happen after reassessment . And the little man won't have any protection . These people already have attorneys . You don't have -- you know, if I wanted to oppose my new reassessment I would have to hire someone . Oh, well, too much empathy and indifference in this City, I guess. About the school closing dilemma , I think too many people think that this is a social thing, a neighborhood school -- I went to neighborhood schools where you could walk all my life growing up through high school. I'm certainly for neighborhood schools . But these three schools in particular have -- they've reached the point where their sensibility is gone. They need too much money spent on them. I think it said 27 million the next few years. They don't have the attendance anymore. And it's time whether it hurts some people or not to close these three schools . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 I walked to school maybe, I don't know, less than a half mile each way. There wasn't any school buses when I was growing up in Memphis . You took the City bus. Now right at the corner of my house on Wells Street, the end of the street, the speeding cars hit 60, 80 miles an hour miles an hour 24/7. It's like a racetrack. I've seen them go around the school bus in the morning and Wells is a stop for school buses in the afternoon also. A speeding car went through the fence there about a month ago right where the children were standing . This was in the afternoon . Nobody was there. Nothing has been done for years about the speeding cars except it got worse and worse and worse every year, especially at night. And it's not a police problem . I see police now and then. Everybody slows down. They need unmarked cars I guess. Mister -- I forgot his name -- the gentleman that got slaughtered across the -- Minicozzi got slaughtered in front of my house by a speeding car. And the paper -- I was there. I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 know what happened all day long. This is a shame. A speeding car slaughtered this man and stopped more than a 150 feet up the street and the poor guy he was dead on the pavement . The woman got out and she's looking at her car. And the paper said no charges . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Well, something needs to be done. Like I said, I wish you the best on your new endeavor . Remember us here. MR. DONAHUE : Absolutely . Thank you. That exhausts the sign-in sheet for this evening . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Last session I was in here I asked specifically about the special session , the executive session that was held. We were told that the executive session was held for personnel matters . Do we have any update on that to give it clarity of what that session actually was? MR. DONAHUE : No. MR. COYNE: Is there some reason why we are not following the Sunshine Act for that where it says -- and the courts have said that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 is not specific enough and gives the citizens enough information so they could make a decision on whether or not an executive session is valid and legitimate . That is something that the citizens have a right to know so that they do not -- so we do not assume that everything happening in the back doors under special executive sessions are actually not executive sessions . It's just hush sessions that the public is not privy too. The Sunshine Act is direct on how that is to be addressed . And I don't understand what the resistance is to following that law. Moving on. First of all, I also want to say, Kyle, congratulations and good luck. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. COYNE: Moving on, I'm also concerned about the rush to vote in this session . It's obvious that this got pushed forward for the rental and the job position because you're leaving that seat and it needs to be a three to two vote so that you get that passed. I think that rushing it forward as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 an emergency says a lot about things. It says we don't follow procedures when we have to get something done. We cut corners . We skip Council rules. And we jump through hoops. Looking back at this when it first came up before this body, it was voted on. And one of them was put to be tabled. And that was struck down and it was tabled. And then it failed introduction . But somehow it appeared next week on the Eighth Order. The Eighth Order is where tabled items go which it was actually voted down for being tabled. Mr. Schuster actually wanted it tabled and that was voted against . The normal procedure for Council is when something fails the vote, in the next executive session there is a vote before this body, a public vote to reintroduce that. But that doesn't seem to have happened . It suddenly appeared in Eighth Order without a public vote to reintroduce it, to sneak it in as if it was tabled rather than struck down as it was. Proper process is reintroducing it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 and then letting it go through the entire body. But I understand there was a rush to get this through the system to have the rental contract done to have this appointment put in place. And it seems that Council regulations and rules need to be ignored when it's inconvenient . Both of these actions are moved forward tonight are in peril of being struck down. I would advise Council when they reconvene afterwards to bring it up for a revote again and see if it survives if it passes this time because that's what happened in this body last time something failed, was it was pulled back up for a revote in the next session . And at that time maybe we'll be back to a voting position that's not impacted. I have serious concerns with the Council ignoring proper processes because anything in this is rife for a legal challenge . You have violate d the process of City Council 's regulation s. By doing so, it allows any of this to be challenge d by any citizen . That's all I have to say. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 anyone else like to address Council ? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident and taxpayer . I'm switching around here or a little bit. Congratulations again. We're going to miss you, Kyle. Now I have a little assignment for you when you get to the legislature . It's on our 38 percent tax exempt institutions in the City. And something really needs to be done. It's gone up and up year after year. We were down at 33 percent from 35, now it's up to 38 percent . And one of the ideas I had for future Council would be to get in touch with these institution s and sit down and talk with them and have them help us in Harrisburg to actually call attention to this and the need for the state to come in and kick in replacement due to their -- financial replacements due to their constitution . We can't tax them. We can only ask for the pilot. And they could say no and many of them have. Many of them wouldn't consider it. And the ones that do, want to direct the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 money. So that's really not much of a help. And so enough said on that. I'll be here to pest the other Council members on that. Another thing on pensions , that FDX Bitcoin company or Crypto coin company went bankrupt overnight . It was over 30 billion dollars in value. And it seems like a lot of the money was pilfered and totally irresponsibly spent. They had 250 million dollars dumped into lobbyist in Washington and our financial services panels. And they didn't want regulation to come into play of these. Well, my concern is that our pension losses could be related to Crypto currency . It came to my attention that a lot of pension plans and investment have been just handing over money for (inaudible ) of investment . And the good investment s are basically protecting these pyramid s. That's all they are. We should be invested in power generation or things like that are definitely going to pay back in the future. We don't need this. And then, well, you're about to pass 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 the budget. It is what it is. We've had enough time. It would be helpful if we get the audit in sometime even if it's two or three months late. And then on voting, I made a comment last week that the younger generation saved Social Security for the older generation . And they did a good thing for themselves because you wouldn't believe the family fights that erupt when Fox News comes on and your parents are in their 70s. I have a -- Fox News time about a half hour before, I always had the poor dogie had to go home and be feed. I had to go home and feed the dogie, you know? Fox News would come on and it turned a good day into mush. And our ex-president sat down last weekend at the table with white christian nationalists . And he's calling for an American Taliban . So maybe we'll get lucky some day and instead of shooting people in a bar or something like that because of who they are somebody will turn him in -- volunteer him for a swiss cheese factory . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . Would anyone else like to address 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 Council ? MS. JEFFRIES : Good evening , Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I just have to get up and speak and to voice my concern about the proper procedure for City Council . And I think that's why we have our solicitor here to make sure that City Council follows the rules and regulations to keep us out of trouble to make sure that we're following the rules. If we were to violate anything for the conduct of Council , I'm sure Mr. Gallagher would be the first one to jump in and to let us know that things were not being followed . So every time that's mention ed I sort of think, you know, that's why we have a solicitor here to keep us on track. Number two, I was thinking about this all week and wondering if Council ever goes out to the public. Do we ever have a forum set go to the neighborhood s and listen to the people out in the neighborhood s? They don't come here. So we have to go to them to listen to what do the neighborhood s have to say, what do the citizens of Scranton have to say? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 When I go to the grocery store, believe me, I get an ear full. And I know that you probably get an ear full and you're someone that could do something about it. I can't. All I could do is listen and come up here on something that hits my hot button. I went back and I checked on street signs. I've been talking about the street signs for four years. And at first it was because they didn't have enough personnel to do the work. And I did go down to DPW and every now and then you know how your cell phone is that picture pops up on my cell phone. When I was down there at the DPW to see how it works and how it functions . And when they showed me the database and there's 9,000 street signs and stop signs that need to be replaced. I haven't seen any or heard anything . And thank you, you know, Council does try to get us an update. But I don't hear anything coming through as an update as to what is going on with the street signs. I also thought about the day I got a phone call at my home. And I'm sorry I didn't write the person's name down. But it was a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 reporter . And I guess a grant had been given and signed off. And there was money that was available for the street signs. And he knew that I had been a champion trying to get the street signs, asked me how did I feel did I know this. I didn't. And, you know, I was just thrilled that I heard that. But nothing ever happened as far as I could see or where that money went to that was allocated for street signs. So, you know, we sit here and we stand and we give our concern s. But that's only a few of us that are representing different parts of the city. And I was just wondering if you would give that some thought for 2023 to start going out to the people of Scranton and making sure that they know and hear from them rather than just a few of us here. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Norma. So I know I tried to get up to as many neighborhood meeting s as possible . But in terms of Council going out into different neighborhood s, the complication with that is the live stream we have on the YouTube and onto 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 ECTV that we wouldn't be able to hold Council meetings in different places and also have them live streamed . With the street signs, I know the grant has been exhaust ed in terms of the signs that have gone up. There has been some progress on that. We are applying for another grant for next year to continue , you know, like you said, there was a lot of street signs in that database , right, so there was a chunk taken out of it. But there is still a lot of work to be done. And there is a grant being applied for it to continue to do that. MS. JEFFRIES : I don't see any new ones because I don't ride around the City all the time looking for street signs. But there just doesn't seem like there is any kind of improvement , especially in South Side -- well, it's all over the City no matter where you go. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. I think it was South Side and West Side where the initial grant money was concentrated and then, you know, moving around in a counterclockwise circle. But that's -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 MS. JEFFRIES : You know, it's just -- four years of trying to get street signs. MR. DONAHUE : Yes. That was just the update I got last week on street signs and the grant. MS. JEFFRIES : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher . I must say I was pretty disappointed in the amended budget. It's very hard when you put a document in November that has actuals through August, certainly the actuals through October could have been there and you could judge a little bit better where -- if we're going to make it. There were actually 70 -- over 70 items that had zero funding -- zero money spent through August. Why? MR. DONAHUE : Some of those expense s are late in the year expenses . MS. SCHUMACHER : 70? Over 70? I don't think so. MR. DONAHUE : Some of them are.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 MS. SCHUMACHER : Well, I understand that. But I don't -- I don't think that it really would have helped to have up-to-date -- up-to-dates. And where in that budget is the current balance from the Scranton Sewer Authority escrow account ? MR. DONAHUE : So that is still in the escrow account . There's still -- I believe there's a few of the easements they're still trying to satisfy there. And then once that comes over will create -- I'm assuming Council will create a special account to receive that money whatever is left over in the escrow account . MS. SCHUMACHER : What is the current balance ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know it off the top of my head. I believe it was in the 4 million dollar range a couple months ago. But I'll ask for Frank to get an update on the current balance in that escrow account . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. I hope next year is a better year. Let me just say that. Thank you. You're quitting tonight now? I mean, you're not -- no more meeting s? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 MR. DONAHUE : I'm not quitting . MS. SCHUMACHER : No, I didn't say you personally . MR. DONAHUE : Oh, no, Council is still meeting into the December . MS. SCHUMACHER : Into December . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : So the budget is still going to be voted on tonight . MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. JARMAN: It's good to speak to you all tonight . MR. DONAHUE : Can you just state your name for the record? MR. JARMAN: Angelo Jarman, J-A-R-M-A-N. I'm coming here because I have a few questions on behalf of a relative of mine who is looking to convert an outbuilding on their property in Scranton into a residence . And we were trying to look through on the City website about the different permits and everything that may be required . But we 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 weren't be able to find much information . And we were wondering who would be the best people to contact or departments in the City to contact regarding that. MR. DONAHUE : So what is it? It's an accessory unit basically ? MR. JARMAN: It was originally built -- it was built like early 20th century . It was like a garage first floor and sort of office space on the second floor, has some utilities hooked up to it (inaudible ). We're not sure where that lies legally with the current zoning requirements and permitting requirements . MR. DONAHUE : So I would probably start with Code Enforcement -- MR. JARMAN: Code enforcement . MR. DONAHUE : -- in terms of permitting . You could also check with the City zoning officer to make sure that, you know, anything you are doing meets proper setbacks and such and that it's a permitted use in that zone. MR. JARMAN: Yeah, because I know if there's like some -- there's like different 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 rules compared to like if you have an existing structure or just trying to build a new one from the ground up and all of that stuff. So I want to make sure everything is flush, you know? MR. DONAHUE : The City zoning officer would probably be the best person to start with there. MR. JARMAN: Does it require an appointment or is it just open -- MR. DONAHUE : No, you could call and leave a message . MR. JARMAN: Call and leave a message , okay. All right. As far as that goes, that's about it. The only other thing I do recall some of the other people speaking tonight about the Scranton School District and some of the school closures in our city. I believe I mention ed a few weeks back when I was here that at one point I went to Audubon Elementary and I was a student there at the time it was closed down. And it is very disheartening to see the City once again deciding to close down multiple elementary schools despite the fact that many of these 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 student s, like, all of our schools are at capacity . During that time when Audubon was shut down I was actually part of half of my school was sent to John J. Adams Elementary where I was -- where me and my peers were made to learn crammed all together in a basement classroom about the size of this seating area here, imagine around 50 5th graders all crammed together with two teachers trying to teach all of them. Needless to say, it wasn't a very good environment to learn in. And I'm very concerned about the impact that the closure of these schools will have on student s in Scranton . I know that I was fortunate enough to continue on with school and eventually graduate . Not all of my peers were so lucky having their education interrupted in that way. So I'm no policy master or policy genius but I do think that it's in the best interest of the City of Scranton to do what it takes to keep these schools open, to keep the schools maintained and staffed properly . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 And if that means like maybe pay like a fifth percent more in property taxes or we do fundraisers or we need to just rearrange the way that things are organized , whatever it takes making sure that student s are able to stay in school and have the resources they need is important if we're going to long-term continue to have the City function . But that's all. Thank you very much for your time. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. LITTLE: Hi. I'm Rick Little from Scranton . I'd like to talk to you about my concerns about Scranton Housing Authority , specifically the thing that's been on the menu for 7-D about a Kelly Murray to be the new board of commissioner person. I applied for that. My problem , I live in Scranton Housing Authority , Adams High Rise. I've lived there since 2009. And looking back on it I had no choice. It's the only place I could live. If I'm out of there, I'm gone. And realistically it's been constructive eviction . The word in the law constructive eviction right 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 from the beginning . They come to your door. They put scraps of paper not signed by anybody that you have to do these things or you're going to be charged $250 like this one. "You do not need to be home. They are permitted to enter in order to complete any work. Thank you for your understanding , management ." This is out of control . During COVID they were doing -- they had, you know, what they say two fires. In fact, a fire alarm went off every week for the first 10 years that I was there. Then they have water damage and they have to do construction and then they have another fire, more water damage. They have to go to the Scranton Fire Department to shut off the sprinklers . They stay on for 45 minutes and then they go to their insurance company and they have all these people come in. I don't know who they are. They're vendors . So I try to figure out who they are. So I did a Right To Know with the City of Scranton and they sent me the name of the Right To Know Officer for Scranton Housing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 Authority . So I did the Right To Know. And he gave me a paltry answer under the gun after I gave him extension after extension for like four months total between the Scranton City Hall and this place and now they hired a lawyer. I had to appeal it because they hired a lawyer Scanlon Howley and Doherty to handle the appeal. And, you know, it's sickening . They said I was harassing them. I've been trying to find out for eight years who runs -- who's doing this because they could burst in my door any time. They burst in my door with the Lackawanna County sheriffs . And I lost my kid in family court in New York state because of this one guy and I complained to him and I talked to him and, you know, and these maintenance guys they're like thugs. And they're run by the main thug who is their lawyer who is also the district attorney -- assistant district attorney . And, you know, I read in the Times-Tribune and I called Kuhot{phonetic } from the Times-Tribune about this abuse that's been going on. He stopped taking my calls. And, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 you know, they published my Social Security number. And they forged my name on two HUD documents . And, you know, I'm trying to do the best I can. I learned a bit of law from the Kings County Family Court in New York. But to survive , I have to stay here. And they just evicted (inaudible ) the final judgment from the Right To Know came through and on November 14th. And it says 30 days you have to tell -- you have to tell the full names of who works there, when they worked there going back to 2009. In my lease it says, you know, if something happens call the police. And I'm getting a lot of flak from the district attorney guy Coyne to, you know, you called the police on my staff. And in the lease it's like you are not getting along with the staff. It just goes on and on. But I want to try to fix it from the inside. And I don't have much time left. But I want to be on the board of commissioners for this place because I will not survive otherwise . And a lot of other people will be hurt very badly if something doesn't change 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 here. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council ? Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Not at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have one or two. I just wanted to respond to something that Miss Jeffries had brought up. She had asked Council members if we go out in the neighborhood s or in the communities . And I know that I have in the past. And I consider myself to be an active member of the community and being in the Hill Section to however meetings , like, neighborhood meetings are difficult with -- if they're held on Tuesday night when you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 Council meeting s or other meetings when I'm working my other job pretty late. But I have found it very useful in the past to go to those meetings and to hear directly from people there in the neighborhoods . And it's certainly something that I would like to be able to do more of. And I did just want to mention something that I was working to set up prior to the pandemic when I had first come onto Council , one of my goals was to set up another venue in addition to our City Council meetings when we could hear out the public. And so I had an idea for town halls in different section s of the City along with not just with City Council but with other City elected officials to have, like, a joint town hall with the Mayor and with some of the school board members . And so that was something that like I said I was working on prior to the pandemic . And unfortunately , the pandemic made that -- made that impossible to do. But now being out of the pandemic , I think that is something that we can consider again and start 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 to work together with, like I said, other elected officials who would be interested in doing that and just being able to hear people out and for us to all be in one place where we could discuss what matters most to the residents in Scranton . And the other thing that I was hearing a bit more of tonight were things in reference to the Scranton School District and to the school board. So I don't know if the speakers coming here with those comment s are also going to the school board meeting s. But if not, then I would encourage you to do that as well because I think it's important for them to hear from you about your thought s about school district in addition to Council . I also appreciate hearing thoughts during Citizens Participation about that. But they do have a meeting tomorrow night that will be at 6:30. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So this is a reoccurring concern that I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 been receiving complaints for, jeez, I don't know, most of the summer and now it's winter coming. And it's Weston Field's pool. All right. And these issues are not only from taxpayers . But they're customer s. They're taxpayers and they're paying to be there and use this facility as recreation , as therapy . And they keep reaching out to me because I bring it forward . But it doesn't seem like we're getting anywhere . So they said the entire month of November the pool was open four days. Two days -- two out of the four days the water was freezing. The morning classes had to leave. And then the -- the water company had -- the electric company had been there twice because they couldn't regulate the thermostat for the pool area or the pool. No one is checking the temperature of the pool to see if the heater is working . And they said they've never seen so many issues with lifeguards . And they've been there for years. And they posed another question . They said where are the two full-time lifeguard s that were there? They 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 were fired they believe . And they'd like to know why. So I hate, you know, to keep bringing this up. But I feel I have to until there is some type of resolve . So, Mr. Voldenberg , can you please send these concerns over to the parks director and please get us an update by next week? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : And secondly , it's no secret that this is Kyle's last meeting . And it was a true honor and pleasure to serve with him on the Scranton School Board and sit along side with him and serve him on Council for almost four years. I wish you the best of luck in Harrisburg and the best of luck with your beautiful family. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mark. MR. MCANDREW : And that is all I have. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. I'm going save my comments for agenda items and also for the end of the meeting . Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

SCHUSTER : On the question , it was discussed in caucus tonight this introduction here -- this ordinance that's being introduced here does contain a 3 percent tax increase ; is that correct ? MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : And it can be amended before final passage ? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 MR. DONAHUE : Yes. MR. SCHUSTER : That's all. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, on the question , during the whole budget process I stated that I would not be in favor of the tax increase whether it's 3 percent in here or it's going to be amended later to two. I'm not in favor for a couple reasons . First of all, whether it's 3 percent or 2 percent 10 minutes from now when we go through the amended budget, it's still being levied to pay for increases and new positions . And the American Rescue Plan money is -- the early pieces of it were targeted for loss revenue . So I don't believe in raising taxes when we're not using the ARPA money for loss revenue . So my position hasn't changed on a tax increase . So I'll be voting no. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR.

DONAHUE : You've heard reading by title of Item 6-B. What is your pleasure ? MR. MCANDREW : Mr. Chairman , I move that Item 6-B pass reading by title. MR. KING: Second. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : I make a motion to suspend the rules to move Items 6-A and 6-B to Seventh Order for a final vote. MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I would like to move this motion -- make a motion to postpone consideration of this for two separate reasons ; one was I would like to wait for the budget to pass before we look at these because I first mention ed my concern there were 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 positions that were included in the budget that wasn't yet passed in this. And also, I would like to see if the Law Department could give us an opinion in writing as to the 2015 lawsuit so that we know that we're not getting into those same waters. So if I could have a second to postpone consideration . MR. MCANDREW : I'll second. MR. DONAHUE : There's a motion on the floor and a second. On the question ? MR. KING: On the question , I think during caucus you had indicate d that Attorney Cutillo had given us an answer on that. MR. DONAHUE : I talked to Attorney Cutillo today. And there was a sunset on the lawsuit that was filed. And even if there wasn't, the rates are still -- so the lawsuit was based on the fact of what we were charging for a permit compared to what it cost the City to administer that program . So there was a settlement made. The rates were lowered. Those rates -- the rates that we have in our ordinance now are actually lower than the rates of the settlement . But at the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 same time we're also increasing our spend on that program . So I believe that's -- that issue is moot there. At the same time, I think it's, you know, I do think it's important to start holding irresponsible landlord s or property owners responsible for not taking proper care of their properties and for, you know, it's basically resulting in decimating some of our neighborhoods . And I know that it's been a complaint , you know, for my five years on Council . It goes even farther back than that. So I think it's time that we actually do start holding these landlords accountable . MR. KING: And I think it goes to benefit -- it benefits those responsible landlord s who live here in the City and those that maybe don't live in the City. But they are responsible and they take care of their property . And they take it serious . Whereas there's other owners which have been published in the newspaper , some quite a bit where they just bought these properties , did nothing to them, didn't repair 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 them. There were broken down conditions and they were just left to rot to the point where the City had to tear them down. So I think that this will truly help those responsible landlords in the City. MR. SCHUSTER : So I just want to say I am in agreement with Mr. Donahue and Mr. King. I do think we need to hold these landlords responsible . As I stated from the beginning mine is more procedural . I don't want to end up voting no on this due to procedural issue, you know what I mean? I would rather wait the process out. So I'm just asking right now if we could postpone the consideration so we could just get it through Sixth order and Seventh Order and get that opinion from the Law Department in writing . MR. MCANDREW : I agree. So, of course, I agree that we need to hold landlords , especially the out of town ones who have been, you know, haven't treated our City and our rules well. But the settlement that we spoke of in caucus, I still had a concern . I 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 understood the fee part. But somewhere I read -- I just want clarity . I could wait a week. But I thought it had more to do with the inspection process and what's warranted about when you could go in or not. I would just like clarity as to legally what would the Code Enforcement officer s be allowed to and when to do their inspections . I know they want every five years or whatever . But it kind read too where they can maybe go in more than once, based on what, I don't know, based on an assumption . I just want to make sure we get this legally right. I'm not pausing this for the out of town landlords in any way. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I don't share the same concerns about this legislation . I believe that Councilman Donahue did receive an answer on the legal concerns with it. And we also received answers previously that it's not going to be automatically adding more rental officers like what's in the budget. That will be a separate vote for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 later as part of the budget -- final budget vote. However , this is -- I've been a big proponent of this legislation and changes to our rental ordinance . As it stands now our rental ordinance does not have much teeth to it. And it's really handcuffed our employees and our officers in terms of what they can do to ensure that people who are renting within the City are safe in the buildings that they're living in. And that's a huge priority for me. I also think this is going to have a big impact on blight within our City which has also been a large priority for myself since I've been on Council , something that I've spoken to very often. And I think that with this legislation we'll be able to get that blight in check, have a better idea of the rentals within the City, get more of those properties registered . And so I feel prepared to vote for this ordinance this evening . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question on Mr. Schuster 's motion? MR. SCHUSTER : So my last thing is, you know, we have a solicitor right now that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 worked on the legislation back in 2015. So Solicitor Eskra is a good source for that. I just want to be reassured that we're not going to enter into the same territory to put the City at risk for another suit. That's my only concern . Like I said, it's something I could agree with this legislation . It's just I don't want to, you know, go against it for procedural issues. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question on Mr. Schuster 's motion to postpone ? So all those in favor of postponing moving this to Seventh Order for a final vote this evening -- all in favor signify by saying aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : So it's all in favor of postponing this say aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. MR. DONAHUE : Opposed? MR. KING: Opposed . DR. ROTHCHILD : No. MR. DONAHUE : The nays have it. So moved. So anyone else on the question on the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 motion to suspend the rules? All those in favor signify by saying aye. MR.

That's what we try to do. The person who was in the seat, Mr. Galella, he didn't resign. He sent a letter that he wanted to retain his seat. So this a procedural policy issue, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 right, my vote no -- I don't even know this young lady.

DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , I will be voting no for the same reasons . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? I'll be voting yes. While I understand my colleague 's point, there was -- the Mayor did have an appointee that was going to be appointed within that 30-day window. There was some expression from Council as to whether or not that appoint ee would actually receive the votes necessary . So they then went out and found another candidate . And looking at her resume it's extremely qualified to serve on the housing board. So that's why I'll be voting yes. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I agree that this is a highly qualified 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 candidate .

DONAHUE : All those in favor of the amendments signify by saying -- or on the question on the amendments ? MR. SCHUSTER : I'll speak to this resolution on the question with the next -- MR. DONAHUE : Okay. All those in favor of the amendment s signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye. MR. MCANDREW : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2582 MR. DONAHUE : Aye. Opposed ? MR. SCHUSTER : No. MR. DONAHUE : The ayes have it and so moved. What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Finance ? MR. SCHUSTER : As Chairperson for the Committee on Finance , I recommend final vote on Item-7-M as amended . MR. KING: Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : So on the question , I would like to start with the fact that I was happy to see some of the 2023 budget proposals including taxes, raises, and new positions have been downsized from the original administration proposal . So thank you to Council . However , I don't feel we've downsized these expenditures enough. At this point in the 2023 budget, I just see as tax and spend proposal . The taxes being levied are enough to cover the new expenditures which are increase d salaries and new position s. The City has just convert ed to a new tax which we have not attained the full potential of. We only collect 20 to 30 percent 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2583 of it. And we have collect ive bargaining agreement s that have not been settled for over a year now which will not only affect the 2023 budget but also the 2022 budgets. And I don't feel that it's a time to expand City Hall when these issues have not been settled and we do not know the financial impact. I stated before that I understand the reasoning and theory behind smaller tax increments . And I could agree with these increases if they were to put the City on a more sound financial footing . However , at this time with this proposal I do not see that this is the case. A portion of the revenue to cover added expenses this year comes from one time ARP funds. The totals are over $85,000. And I would have liked to have seen Council make up the difference without the use of this one time funding as it won't be sustained moving forward . This amount could have been achieved if Council was to take a closer look and scrutinize d several of the positions as well as some of the salaries . When it comes to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2584 jump in salaries I would like -- when it comes to jumps in the salary, I would not say that there have been -- that some of these actions would increase the salaries with (inaudible ) possible workloads and titles. However , I do want to point out that Council has been fair over the last two years. We've given percentage increase s of 5 percent and 3 percent for a total of about eight. And these are for the position s that are on the smaller realm of increases , which in terms of other sectors of society , these are pretty good increases over the two-year period with inflation and some of the difficulties we've been having over the years. So with that being stated I will be voting no to this piece of legislation . MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. MCANDREW : Yes, on the question , so do I appreciate the amount of work that the Mayor and the department heads and -- that they put into this budget, of course, I do. You have to prepare one every year. Do I appreciate the time and effort of my colleague s 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2585 on Council with the amendment s, of course, I do. But from the beginning , I still have a problem raising taxes to fund positions -- new positions and to fund above average wages. Even though they were reduced and I appreciate that. But we're still raising taxes to 2 percent to fund these new positions . We didn't get rid of most of them or propose to get rid of most of them or these large salary increases . Like Councilman Schuster said, we gave them decent raises the past two years. This will be a third with a decent raise above average . And I just think that, you know, we just got out of Act 47 barely, right? And we extended Act 47 for the Payroll Prep Tax. We're not doing well with that collection , right, so -- and also, inflation like I said in caucus, it's been the highest in 40 years. People are struggling . And with the potential 3 plus tax increase a block up the road being put on resident s from the school district this is a tough one. I just think that we should have, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2586 you know, been propose d with a budget that, you know, used some of the ARPA money that we got. We got it for revenue loss. And we're raising taxes instead . So with that said, of course, I'm going to vote no because my position hasn't changed in all of this. MR. DONAHUE : Anyone else on the question ? MR. KING: I would just like to add I understand the concern s of my colleague s I truly do. And the last thing that I want to do is have to raise taxes on the citizen s of this City. Unfortunately , we did just come out of Act 47. One of the recommendations from PEL was to do some incremental tax increases . I know that the City has had a past many years ago where they went at one time there was about six years we went and didn't raise taxes at all. And then did an increase for a year or two and then they went another three or four years. And I believe those were mistakes which put us in the position that we're in now. I believe we did spend a lot of time in there. I didn't agree with a lot of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2587 higher pay raises. And many of those were scaled back and we worked with the Council to try to develop parity in there and develop positions . Maybe they're not in line with some of our similar sized cities such as Lancaster , Lebanon , Harrisburg , Easton, Reading , Bethlehem , Allentown , they're still not where those cities are. But I did agree that there needed to be some increases . And we need to bring some parity within the budget. But at the same time maintain , you know, our levels of police officers and Fire Department to maintain protection from the City. And we did eliminate some of those -- attempt ed to add some new positions and we did eliminate several of those. And several of the new ones that were added should actually help to try to recoup some of the funding that we were losing there. So I'll be voting yes. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Anyone else on the question ? DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I would like to add my thought s on the budget and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2588 the amendments as proposed . I -- as you could tell there were 22 amendments . We made significant changes and cuts to what was originally proposed to Council in the budget in the past two budgets that I've been a part of in passing and voting on. I've always wanted to vote on a budget that I believe is fair and balanced and going to be fiscally responsible for the City. And I do believe that we've reached that with this budget proposal tonight . I do support increasing salary positions . But I also don't think that this budget is just about that. There is so much more inside this budget. So I think to just use salary increases and new positions to be added to equate that to the change in taxes is unfair. I think there's a lot more to it. And even if we cut those salary positions and increases down further , it still would not amount to what we would need to not increase taxes completely . I am glad that we were able to at least get it down from 3 percent to 2 percent . I also would prefer not to have to increase taxes. I'm glad that we didn't over the past 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2589 two years while we were going through the pandemic and because of the affects that that was having on people. I understand now we are in a state of inflation . Everyone is feeling the affects of the inflation . Based on the department work sessions that we had, I am really appreciative of the presentation that were given to Council and the question s that we had for those department heads and employees . But it's very clear that the City has an issue with retaining employees and attracting employees who want to work for the City. And this has largely been due to the salaries that we offer, many of which are significantly lower than other comparable cities as one of my Councilmen also pointed out. And I believe that the amendments are fair as I mentioned . We did remove some of those newly added positions . We did make changes to the salary increase s so that they are not as significant but keeping in mind that these are market based changes so in comparison to what people are making in other cities of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2590 our size as opposed to being merit based or perform ance based which I believe those are very important for us to consider too. But that's not something that they're performing now with reviews so that we could base things off of merit. So these are based on the positions themselves , not the people in those position s or the absence of people in those positions . And I also appreciate what we did here with the amendments to make those -- some of those positions , those director level positions more on the same level and in part with one another . I think that's all that I have to add. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Just on the question briefly , in terms of tax increases , this would only be the second time in the five budgets I voted for where we're increasing taxes. The first one was in 2020 where we only increased the land by -- no, I'm sorry -- yes, the land by 2.1 percent . This one is 2 percent for each. Ideally you'd like to get into a rotation of doing one percent tax increases 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2591 every year because that's what the responsible thing to do is because you don't want to get into a situation where you say okay we're not going to raise taxes for five years and then the sixth year we're raising taxes 25 percent , 30 percent because that's what you need to do to balance a budget. So I think it's, you know, I think we did as best as we can in terms limiting the impact on taxpayers . And then just in terms salaries , I know that, you know, we are severely underfunded. We underfund our director salaries by a lot. For example , if you compare us to Bethlehem, Erie, Lancaster and Allentown , we're underfunding our Director of Public Works by about 98 percent . Our -- just some other high numbers here, Parks Director by about 81 percent . Supervisors in DPW average about between 60 and 74 percent , the Business Administrator 42 percent , the City Clerk 30 percent , the Superintendent of Fire, 29 percent , Economic and Community Development by 65 percent and there is more to that. So I think if we're going to get 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2592 qualified people that are going to do the job that it's not just giving it to your buddy because he needs a job, I think you really do have to start raising some of these salaries . And that's what we're going to do because I think it's about providing a service and providing the best service we possibly can for taxpayers ' money. And that's why I'll be voting yes for this budget. Anyone else on the question ? Roll call, please. MS. CARRERA : Mr. King. MR. KING: Yes. MS. CARRERA : Mr. Schuster . MR. SCHUSTER : No. MS.

And I appreciate -- I pretty much have known you your whole life and I'm proud of you and I wish you well. I think you'll do a great job represent ing our area in the 113th in the legislature . So I really appreciate all that you've done for the City. I wish you well. And we will absolutely stay in touch because we're going to need you down in Harrisburg . Thank you so much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. King. MR. SCHUSTER : I would also like to --1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2595 DR. ROTHCHILD : I would also like to add my gratitude to your service here on City Council and it's been a pleasure to work along side you here and I wish you the best of luck in your career as a state representative . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. MR. SCHUSTER : So I'd like to also echo my colleagues ' statement s here. Good luck with the 113 and your new position in Harrisburg . You offered me some guidance back in the early days when I first transition ed onto the School Board. And I will remember that. So thank you very much for your service to the City. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Since tonight is my last meeting I just want to take just a few moments to share some parting thoughts . It really has been an honor and a privilege to serve on this body for the past five years, especially as Council President for the last 11 months. Over the last five years we've gone from indictments and resignations to multiple appointment s then through COVID. So the last five years have not necessarily been easy to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2596 say the least. But we did get through it together as a City. And I truly do believe that this City is in a better position to succeed in the future than it was just five years ago. We have a revised Ethics Code and Ethics Board to hold our public official s accountable . We've had balanced budgets that have emphasized modernizing City government while limiting the burden placed on taxpayers . We have replaced the outdated Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax with a more modern Payroll Prep Tax. We have significantly improved the City's credit rating. And we finally shed the distressed status under Act 47 that had hung over our heads for the last 30 years. We have invested in infrastructure and will continue to do so in the coming years through ARPA and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act. The stage is set for Regional stormwater Authority to start finally addressing water runoff issues on a regional level. We're finally beginning to address quality of life issues by building a case so we could actually 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2597 hold irresponsible property owners accountable . This will be a long process , can't happen overnight but the foundation I do believe has been set and put in place that we could continue to build on. I'm often asked, you know, how do you do it, how do you come to -- how do you sit on Council , deal with the people that come to meeting s and whatnot. And, you know, all of these meetings could sometimes be painful to sit through . This is a forum where resident s could express their concern s and/or displeasure with City government in a public manner. And on top of that, these meeting s although weekly only take up 10 percent of the time of what we actually spend in this role. It is extremely fulfill ing to help resident s deal with -- whether it's quality of life issues in their neighborhood , to help someone get the street paved or patched or to just simply answer a question . Being in a position to help someone through an issue is the most gratifying part of this job. And I look forward to be able to continue to help people through any issues they 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2598 have as I transit ion into my knew role. My door will always continue s -- my door will continue to always be open. I'm hoping to have a district office up and running by the first couple weeks of January . That office will be located at 1135 Moosic Street in a space that was formally occupied by Spotless Cleaners . As for my new role, one of my many priorities I have in Harrisburg is to take my experience I have gained here and to bring a unique perspective to allow cities to improve on and to not only improve on but add to the tools they have in their tool box, especially as it relates to cities with high percentage of nonprofit s. I also must take this time to thank the City Clerk Frank Voldenberg for the great work you've done and how helpful you are to all of us up here. And also I would like to take a minute to thank Frank's predecessor Lori Reed who did a tremendous job as City Clerk also. And also the front office, Cathy and Allison , you guys are rock stars. You're helpful whenever we need it and so just thank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2599 you. City Solicitor Sean Gallagher , thank you for your advice over the last 11 months. And also I just want to thank our previous solicitors Kevin Hayes and Amil Minora. And most importantly I also want to thank my colleagues up here. It's not easy to sit up here. I think it takes a lot the courage to sit up here. We're all up here to make this City a better place. And I think whether we disagree on some issues or not, we're always respectful . And we all are here for the right reasons . Now most importantly , I have to thank my family and especially my wife Mary Kate. None of us would be able to sit up here without the support of our families . And I have a wife who's a complete superwoman so I wouldn't be able to do any of what I do without her. So I really -- the last thanks is just for her. And then thank you also all so much for your interest in the City and by coming here week after week. It is appreciated . And that's all I have for this evening . So if there's no further business , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25100 I'll entertain a motion to adjourn . MR. MCANDREW : Motion to adjourn . MR. DONAHUE : This meeting is adjourned . Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25101 C E R T I F I C A T E I hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence are contained fully and accurately in the notes taken by me of the above-cause and that this copy is a correct transcript of the same to the best of my ability .
