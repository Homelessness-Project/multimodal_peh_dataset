Do any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. MCANDREW : I have a quick one. So upcoming will be Nay Aug Parks second annual Mother's Day drive for St. Joseph's Baby Pantry. It will be May 7th and 8th, 9 a.m. to 3 p.m, Saturday and Sunday. And it's to help stock their pantry so no child has to do without to include diapers , formula , wipes, lotions , baby powder, sippy cups, baby food, baby cereals . Please at this time, no clothing or furniture will be accepted . Additional details , e-mail info@nayaugpark.org. And then secondly , I would like to wish everyone a blessed Easter those who celebrate . It will be this Sunday. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any announcements ? MR. KING: Mr. President , I have two. DPW will be off on Easter Monday, April 18th. So both trash and recycling pickup will be one day behind. The schedule will be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 Tuesday , April 19th through Saturday , April 22nd. Also I'm not sure if anyone saw the article in the Scranton Times this week about Nay Aug Park Scranton repairs. They refilled the reflecting pond at the -- they drained it and they found leaks in there and they actually fixed it. I just want to thank the volunteers that were involved with that project . It was lead by the Scranton Municipal Recreation Authority volunteers . The Chairman is Bob Gattens and also Eddie Davis, Jerry Smurl, Brian Johnson , Billy Birdsall , Pat Murphy, and Bob Shumaker . I thought they did a great job on that project and that is just going to enhance the park again and bring it back to some of its glory. Also, I was asked to announce that on April 23rd from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., there's going to be an Earth Day cleanup at Nay Aug Park for anyone that's available or interested in helping out with the cleanup at Nay Aug for the Spring. Other than that, thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Does anyone else have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 any -- do any other Council members have any announcements ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I was also going to announce a few of the events that were taking place at Nay Aug Park but some of the other guys beat me to it. So glad to know that that's being put out there for people to attend. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Do any other Council members have any other announcements ? I would just like to take a moment to wish my daughter Maggie a happy first birthday . It's been a great year. She is the brightness to our life and, you know, we really are blessed . So happy birthday , Maggie. And that's all I have. MR. MCANDREW : Happy birthday , Maggie. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Voldenberg ? MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. DONAHUE : First on the list, Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . Before I forget, I just want to note that there are three major religious holidays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 coming up, Easter. I think at the end of this week Friday is the beginning of Passover . And we're also into the month of Ramadan . So for everybody celebrating those various traditions , Happy Easter, Happy Passover , and Happy Ramadan . Any update on the negotiations for the various labor contracts ? MR. DONAHUE : They are all still ongoing. MS. HODOWANITZ : Okay. Well, this is day 102 of 2022. 29 percent of the year is gone. I was happy to see that Mr. Phaneuf did send an updated resume and changed his BS in business to Associates Degree apparently . Although I do wish he would learn how to spell the word Scranton . There is no "M" in Scranton . Now that ex-city official Jack Sweeney has had his day in court, what is the status of Meghan Rade who was the prior City Treasurer ? MR. DONAHUE : I don't know. MS. HODOWANITZ : That would be interesting to know. Is she still on leave -- unpaid leave, paid leave? It would be interesting to know. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 MR. DONAHUE : I could find out and see -- MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, especially -- MR. DONAHUE : Considering it's a personnel matter, I could see what information we are able to provide . MS. HODOWANITZ : But since now we have an official treasure r, there should be some action there. With regard to 7-B, the agreement with American Asphalt Paving, did we ever figure out the difference between the financial funding of 848,000 from I guess from OECD and their bid of 1.9 million? MR. DONAHUE : So originally they were going to combine that Action Plan number with ARPA money. But now we're going to separate those out. So this is only the OECD part. And in the bids, each street had a different price so that -- so that's how it was judged. MS. HODOWANITZ : It wasn't clear in their backup. They didn't discuss that at all. If you read this morning 's paper, there was a very interesting letter to the editor from Robert Cudworth. He's a retired military 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 officer . He holds a position of responsibility I think in the Military Officer Association of America , which I'm a member. And he wrote a letter about the county violating flag etiquette . Okay, now, I don't know how many people are prior military service or ex-boy scouts or ex-girl scouts. It seems that flag etiquette is not a subject taught in public school or just generally known. But, you know, you could kind of dismiss the lack of etiquette by private citizen s and private organizations , you know, that's their business . But when it comes to a government entity like the City of Scranton , it is important that somebody in the administration be aware of the code. It's not very long, but there are certain things to be aware of. This started back in 1942 downloaded from the internet . It's a universal custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings and on stationary flagstaffs in the open. However , the flag may be displayed at night upon special occasions when it's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 desired to produce a patriotic affect. Apparently , we in the county just like to keep it up forever . That's all right as long as it's illuminated . The flag should not be displayed on days when the weather is inclement . If you are on military installation , what they'll do is, they'll take the garrison flag down and they'll put up what's called a storm flag, which can take high winds and everything else. And then when the wind passes, they switch it out. Of course, we always retire the flag at night. It's called retreat . They'll put it up on the morning and it's called reveille . So my only comment there is, you know, we keeps ours up. If you look at our flag tonight or in the daytime tomorrow , it's kind of dirty because it's up all the time and it gets soiled. It doesn't have to be ripped to be warrant be taken down and replaced. And we're coming up on Memorial Day which is the traditional day of disposing of flags by burning . So maybe we could put up a new flag. And if we don't have the money, I'll 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 buy it. Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. And just to add to that just a reminder too, if anyone wants to dispose of a flag they could do so at your local post office. And they'll dispose of them properly . The next on the list is Christen Xanthis . MS. XANTHIS : Good evening Council . My name is Christen Xanthis . I live in Green Ridge. The reason I'm here today is in reference to the pocket park in downtown Scranton . I've read numerous articles about, you know, it being renamed after somebody . As far as I understand by what it says, it's being renamed after Mayor Chris Doherty . During his time of being Mayor, a cement plant was put up across from where I live 22 feet about. He -- at the time I went to the City Council . I went to the Mayor's Office. I went to everywhere in the City you could go to have somebody do something to get rid of it. It took a very long time. They finally moved out after a while I think because they were on tax free zone for so long. During 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 that time, I as well as everybody in my house because it was a cement plant got asthma, my house filled with silica. There's film of silica still to this day everywhere you go. No matter how many times you clean you're not going to get rid of it because they never did anything for the ground that's over there. At the time, the only one that tried to help us, you know, besides Janet Evans that was on City Council at the time. Some citizens , Marie Schumacher tried to help, Ozzie Quinn, you know, unfortunately passed now. But those were the only two people besides Janet Evans on Council that tried to help. You know, in my opinion , I can't understand how, you know, what the reason is for renaming it after previous Mayor Chris Doherty . It very much bothers me because he did absolutely nothing except knowing it was put there and knowing it was put there, did nothing to help. I mean, a cement plant really shouldn 't be in a neighborhood . I really thought those were industrial parks for those. You know, after a while, you know, my dog got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 sick. My dog died, grandmother died. I -- at that time I was in high school. I missed quite a bit of high school because of it. You know, I know me coming here isn't going to change anything because they're still going to name it after him. I, you know, as I said, I have very harsh feeling s about this. You know, I understand , you know, parks. I understand they're good. That's not the problem . The problem is renaming it after somebody that in my opinion -- it's my opinion only, but in my opinion did nothing at the time for the City or for this problem . This was a major problem . It was in the newspaper quite a few times. Me and my mother and everybody came to City Council , you know. At the time I understand how City Council there was only so much they could do. But I, you know, it really bothers me to this day that they insist on naming it after him when there's so many other people in this community and this city that do things for people. I mean, people try to help but, you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 know, Mayor Chris Doherty , you know, I was in the office with my mom the one day and she got escorted out because , you know -- I don't know why. I know they knew them, you know, and that cement plant was very well known at the time because we kept trying to get rid of it. But me coming here isn't going to help. But I just -- I can't understand what the reasoning is to name it after the previous Mayor. Thank you very much for your time. Have a good evening . MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, you too. Next on the list Yvonne Xanthis . MS. YVONNE XANTHIS : Good evening Council . I hate public speaking . But the only reason I'm here is -- it's a long story. My brother was in a fire. He ended up in Regional Hospital . He had two legs amputated . I was told he needs postacute care. But there is no place in Scranton . He has to go to Wilkes-Barre or Danville. They sent him to Wilkes-Barre. This was the middle of February , 2020. I got a call in the middle of the night that my brother was in a room with a gentleman that apparently 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 passed away and my brother contracted COVID. He died within two weeks. He died when they intubated him. He had a cardiac arrest when he died. My question here is, why doesn't Scranton have postacute care? We have three large hospital s. nobody -- I couldn't see my brother before he died. This broke my heart. I just don't understand why Scranton doesn't push for postacute care. It's very important . I don't know where to go. I went to the Mayor. I went to Congress man Cartwright. Someone has to help. This could happen to anybody 's family, not just mine. This could happen to anybody 's. They didn't want him coming home. They said he needed medical care. But he didn't need medical care in a hospital . He needed it in a setting where he was on IVs after his amputation . I mean, come on. That was terrible . If anybody could help me I'd really appreciate it because I'm trying to get the ball rolling on one of these big hospital s around us. We're not living in Mayberry. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 We're in Scranton . I appreciate your help. And thank you, Dr. Rothchild , for speaking to me. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Next on the list, Ron Ellman. MR. ELLMAN: Hello Council . I too I could understand the frustration s some people have. I tried to start my lawn mower today. It had been sitting outside for a year. Of course, I failed. I'd like to mention quickly about bicycle paths downtown . If you stood in front of this building for a whole day, how many bicycles would you see riding around here except maybe going to -- for a free lunch or something . Cars pay taxes. And now we're full of electric cars aren't paying their share of taxes. But to turn main streets into bicycle paths is asinine . And it could be dangerous too. And it seems like people injured or hurt in a car accident in this City, it just goes. My friend Bob Binke{phonetic } run over on -- when people saw what happened on Wyoming , nothing ever done. The man was slaughtered right in front of my house about two months 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 ago. The car didn't stop for a half a block up the street, no charges pending . When Mrs. Corbett 's sister was injured in that accident , it was no stone unturned. And that's how it should be. I'm not complaining . That is how it should be for everybody , not just swept under the rug. But downtown doesn't need bicycle paths. We're not like Sweden where everybody rides a bicycle . I don't know the statistics . But they built a billion dollar bicycle path by my house right there on Parker Street. They did away with a beautiful forest area to make a bicycle path. And you know who's using it? The kids on the quads and trail bikes are racing up and down the thing. They did away with a forest that was like in the Abington s or Nay Aug, cut it all down for a bicycle path. And I have yet to see a bicycle on it. I go by with my little dog once a week -- I mean, once a day. All I see is the kids racing. And if one of them gets injured on City property , it's not going to be a good thing. And I don't want to offend anyone, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 but I found it very offensive by a Councilman a couple weeks ago that -- expecting people to do their job and not need consultants . I won't mention anyone's name. And then to add to this, Mr. Flynn thinks some people ought to be fired if they can't do their job. What are these deadbeats going to do? Who are they going to live off of if it's not the taxpayers of Scranton ? Have any of you ever phoned the licensing bureau? You could phone until you're blue in the face and they won't answer you. And they don't do nothing . I've been complaining for years how bad my neighborhood looks. And it just doesn't affect nobody. I got a junkyard on Throop Street. Cars in the street for a year that aren't licensed or insured or nothing : There's two houses they sold this week. It's in the paper in the 40,000 because my neighborhood is gotten so run down because the licensing bureau has somebody that doesn't even know it exists it seems. Well, I thank you for letting me get even for my lawn mower not starting up here. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, Mr. Ellman. Have a good evening . That exhausts the sign-in sheet for tonight . Would anyone else like to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . Members of Council , we recently put on that there was a fundraiser for Scranton having an office mural. Has anyone involved in that received copyright releases from people who are represented in those pictures as well as NBC Universal ? MR. DONAHUE : I believe they are working with NBC Universal who owns the copyright . MR. COYNE: And also the people who have been -- that are -- MR. DONAHUE : I know they're working with NBC Universal . MR. COYNE: So we started the fund before we have copyright permission . MR. DONAHUE : I don't know -- I'm not a lawyer in terms of copyright. MR. COYNE: Okay. Last week I had asked the status of officer Chad Dougherty who 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 admitted to drunk driving . And the officer on the scene -- officer on the scene whether he was suspended with or without pay. Further looking back a month prior, Officer Leland Palmere failed a sobriety test. He agreed to take a blood test. And arrival at the hospital , the officer did not remember consenting to the blood test and denied it upon being asked again. What is his status? And what is the official policy for the police department on officers who are charged with DUI? Scranton last week reported in the Minooka section a 1.4 million dollar drug bust which was actually in south Scranton . Police reported 600 marijuana plants. From the picture provided , they were new plants and 100 pounds of harvested marijuana at an estimate d street value the 1.4 million dollars . I'm curious how the police come to the estimated street value. A quick look at dispensary prices in Scranton provides the price of decent strength marijuana 3.35 grams is $40 or $11.40 a gram; 100 pounds is 45,359 grams. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 At 1.4 million dollar value, the police say the street value was just shy of $31 a gram, a 300 percent increase over dispensary prices who are under a high tax burden. Wholesale price for marijuana is about $6 an ounce or $272,154. Dispensary price is $11.40 or $517,093. How much did the number get inflated by $886,000 or by 1,127,846 dollars? I'm just curious on how the numbers are actually calculated for press releases because they seem to be inconsistent with market prices in a state that actually legally sells it through dispensaries . Now onto IT, I'm sure two weeks ago you must have been notified , Members of Council , or automatically upgraded for both your Chrome and Edge browsers as there was a patch for a critical exploit , right? If not, I don't know why you haven't been notified . Last on the insurance contract , it was released that major increase was $171,000 a year due to the increase on the cyber insurance . If only someone could have warned us. Wait. I did. I told City Council on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 12/16 of 2019. The departing member passed it on, and I was told it was being address ed and it could not be discussed because of security . That action cost the price of a new $250,000 trash (inaudible ) every two years. What happened ? Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , as there wasn't any new business in five or six, I took a little bit deeper look at the Third Order. And the first one, 3-A, I don't understand why there's a percentage just percentage of the total of what's been collect ed to date. It would be nice to have some useful information which would be something like -- and I'm going to give these to you when I leave. It would be nice to have a number of the tax bills that had been mailed. It would be nice to know the numbers of the bills that were paid in full and those being paid quarterly and those not making any payment . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 Instead of the percent of total collected , it would be more informative to show the year to date percent of the total budget for each line and then the percent from the third might also be compared with the prior year to see if we're doing better than this year or last or if we're not doing better than last year. So those are my comments on that one. Then the next one is tough especially during wholly week but I can't help it. I expect the Treasurer to be concerned about details. But looking at this document I believe it's a typo. On one line it says certified by the NFCC ABD Bankruptcy Court. I believe that's a typo that is meant to be and. And then when he has additional information at the bottom, it says I have a very confidential rapore, R-A-P-O-R-E. There is no word. I believe he meant R-A-P-P-O-R-T with some very difficult clients . That's nice but, you know, if I was doing something like this for somebody , I would truly give it to somebody that I knew and would look it over for me and pick this up. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 So it tells me two things about how he works with other people and just doesn't care about details, I guess. So I don't know him. Is that other woman ever coming back that was appointed to be a treasurer or was that just that -- MR. DONAHUE : I don't know what her status is. Miss Hodowanitz brought that up and I'm going to check into that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. I wasn't here. Okay. The next one is the paving improvements . Now, you know, I feel sorry for poor Pike Street. It's got to be at least 70 years now that they have not had anything done to their streets . I went to some of the streets in my section and I would say -- well, first let me go with my -- it would be nice to have the zip codes that go with each street. And where -- I would like to know if there's a resident 's association where any of these go. Were these given to the association to look over them and to point out some things because , for instance , at the road that's going to be redone from Fire Engine 10 House over to Derby Avenue, there's a spot where they -- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 where there's a swamp connect s to a stream except it goes across the street instead of under it. So that definitely needs a pipe. Is the pipe included in here? MR. DONAHUE : So I know the -- no, it's not. But I do know they are reengineering that to deal with that issue. MS. SCHUMACHER : And then there's the other one on the other side of it right at the top of Birch Street where there is a pipe underneath. It's a stream that just goes through . But it's -- MR. DONAHUE : Is that by the new development or is that around on Birch Street? MS. SCHUMACHER : It's around. It's easy to see. But it certainly needs I think a cement culvert over it. And then East Elm Street, there's a -- well, I have the trouble spot. I have on here -- I have the utility pole numbers . But if you go over to -- and I have it for East Elm Street too. But there's a section when you turn off Derby Avenue that has springs underneath it. And I don't -- I mean, I don't know how you do it but there's got to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 be some way to do it because if you just resurface that road, first big storm it's going to be just like it is now. MR. DONAHUE : Yeah, I'll look into that. Thank you. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. MR. DONAHUE : Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? MR. DOBRZYN : Dave. Good evening Council , Dave Dobrzyn , resident . One thing I'd like to mention about that grant I don't know if the -- for the firemen . I don't know if a decision has been passed on that already . But if you think it might ease some issues with the negotiations , it might need some -- or it could use some consideration . Other than that, it's up to you. Once again, I'd like to speak about Ukraine a little bit. The thing that is unique about what's going on over there with comrade Putin, I'm starting to call him just comrade Poopski. But he threatened to use nuclear forces in an aggressive war which internationally they're considered -- they're suppose d to be considered last resort defense .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 So they need tanks, jets, antiaircraft, long range antiaircraft , surface to air and surface to surface long range vehicles . And here's the number to call if you are out there in TV land and you're interested , 1-202-225-3121. And you could actually ask for the Senator or Congress man that you want to talk to or give them your zip address . And it doesn't seem to be stopping . It seems to be getting worse and worse and worse. And I suspect that the only thing that's going to stop him is when he's walking out the Kremlin for the last time or maybe hopefully in handcuffs . I often speak about the COVID issue. Once again, it's on the upswing. Philly is considering reenacting mask policies for indoors . And at any rate, getting back to Mr. Putin, a lot of this antivax stuff, you're just being a useful idiot for Putin. He's using it to -- a lot of this is the same type of things on the internet and QAnon nonsense and stuff that it's Russian origin, the critique of the vaccine, somebody got a shot and dropped dead. Well, they may have fainted but 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 they're still alive from what I know. And if you're a nurse and you faint over a little shot, maybe you should find something else to do. And on voting rights, you have organizations like the American Legislative Exchange Council . And they are constantly running around the country promoting tightening voting restriction s and impeding the vote. And it's not right. It's you have the Heritage Foundation , all types of different organizations that are well funded and they're just lobbyist organizations . And I mean, the gun laws that cost Trayvon Martin his life were American Legisla tive Exchange Council . I don't need every jerk under the face of the earth with a shiny new pistol or following me around when I'm walking my dog or something either, you know, not that paranoid about guns. And another thing with Ukraine , perhaps we could have the government petition some businesses to stay at home on their office work and save gasoline and also put a dent in that. And once again, I'm kind of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 disappoint ed. I was disappoint ed with the School Board that they didn't join that lawsuit over the 40 million dollars we're shorted . I'm out of time. Thank you. Have a good night. MR. DONAHUE : Thank you, you too. Would anyone else like to address Council this evening ? Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. DONAHUE : Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments this evening ? MR. KING: Nothing at this time. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments this even? MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, two things, one which ties into another . I'd like to thank the sign crew with DPW and the DPW Department . They had a quick response to a sign that was down that I got a call from a neighbor . And they had it up within the day that I sent over the e-mail about that sign being down. And on that same day I got to speak to one of my neighbors who the drainage basins on West Mountain had been at this point after a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 year of clogging , the drain basins are pretty much clogged up. So I did put that request into DPW as well. They said that would be on the list. And that's what brings me over to my next comment . I know we haven't really been given official -- any developments at the 1700 block of Wyoming Avenue but, Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to see if there's been any movement on that because we are in a time of the year where we are getting a lot of rain. And I know seeing these basins get filled and knowing that there's blockages over there, we definitely need to get a beat on what's going on over there. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. MS. SCHUMACHER : Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : I have none this evening . Thank you. MR. DONAHUE : Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. MCANDREW : Nothing at this time. Thank you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 MR. DONAHUE : I just want to say a couple words about Buddy Cosgrove who passed away this week. Buddy would always call me weekly regarding the delinquent trash -- where we stood with delinquent trash refuse fees. And last week I was actually able to get him the sheet while he was in hospice . And he wanted to make sure he read it. Buddy was a pillar of his community , not only in North Scranton but, you know, throughout the City. He had a heart as big as can be. You know, no one ever walked away from a conversation with him without a smile on their face. And I just want to say he will be missed. And that's all I have this evening . Thank you. Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B. No business at this time. SIXTH ORDER. 6-A. No business at this time. SEVENTH ORDER. 7-A.

MR. DONAHUE : What is the recommendation of the Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works? MR. KING: As Chairperson for the Committee on Public Works, I recommend final passage of Item 7-B. MS. SCHUSTER : Second. MR. DONAHUE : On the question ? MR. MCANDREW : On the question , since perception is 100 percent reality anymore, there was a little confusion last week 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 as with regards to the bid and the scope of work. So, Solicitor Gallagher , can you just clarify like we spoke in caucus about they're going to scale back some streets ? This paving list is different than the one that was present in 3-H and that the ones that are going to be removed are only for a time being and these streets will be paved when other funding comes in. Can you just clarify that conversation we had, please? ATTY. GALLAGHER : Yes, we had a conversation with Attorney Hart from the OECD office. Originally the plan was as Mr. Donahue said earlier was to use the CDBG money in addition to use the money for ARPA funds. Apparently there's some certain restrictions on the ARPA funds that can't be used together with the CDBG money. So that's where the change in money comes from. So the low bid I think was 1.9. Now it's -- they could only use the CDBG money which I believe is 848. I don't have it in front of me. But I don't know what streets were taken off. I didn't ask that. But I do know that the streets aren't just being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 forgotten .
