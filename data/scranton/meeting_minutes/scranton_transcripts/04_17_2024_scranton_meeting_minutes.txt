CORRESPONDENCE DATED APRIL 7, 2024, FROM BA/ARPA DIRECTOR , REGARDING ARPA DEPARTMENTAL BUDGET TRANSFERS . 3-B. CONTROLLER ’S REPORT FOR THE MONTH ENDING MARCH 31, 2024. 3-C. CORRESPONDENCE RECEIVED FROM 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 254 THE BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION REGARDING A BUDGET TRANSFER FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON ’S LICENSING , INSPECTIONS & PERMITS DEPARTMENT . MR. SMURL: Are there any comments on any of the Third Order items? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have two. 3-A, Mr. Voldenberg , I didn't have a chance to look at my e-mails today. Did we get any reasoning for the budget transfer s that was asked last week? All right. Thank you. And then if we notice, there is $56,179 paid to Mr. Ufberg. Did we get any more billing from Mr. Ufberg? MR. VOLDENBERG : We did. I could share that with you tomorrow morning . I'll send you copies. MR. SCHUSTER : All right. Thank you very much. That's all. MR. SMURL: Okay, so received and filed. Any Council members have any announcements at this time? MR. KING: I have just a couple. This coming Saturday , I know there is going to be cleanups around the city, Nay Aug Park I believe from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m., and also the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 255 same at Connell Park. I'm looking -- those are the two that I see right now that are scheduled for this Saturday . But I believe there is other cleanups happening through the city. So if anyone wants to volunteer obviously we'd appreciate people coming out even if you could only put a couple hours in. Every a little bit helps. That's all I have at this time. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Also to add to what Mr. King said, there is that cleanup at Nay Aug Park this Saturday the 20th. Last week the telephone number to preregister was given out. Just to repeat that number and correct it, it's 570-241-9003. Thanks. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Anyone else? MR. MCANDREW : Yeah, so this Saturday , April 20th, the Ancient Order of Hibernians Kennedy Division of Scranton , PA will have their annual pasta dinner fund-raiser. What to expect is, join us for 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 256 our annual pasta dinner fund-raiser. Each dinner will cost $15. Dinners will include the pasta meal, a side of salad, and dessert . Dinner is takeout only and will be available for pickup at the Laceworks Tap and Grill. And again, it's from one to four. And also the Lady Ancient Order of Hibernians will also have a basket of cheer raffle that you could purchase at the event. And that is all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . Fourth Order. MR. VOLDENBERG : FOURTH ORDER. CITIZENS PARTICIPATION . MR. SMURL: Joan Hodowanitz . MS. HODOWANITZ : Joan Hodowanitz , Scranton . First, I just want to point out that April 21st, Sunday, is the last day for Library Express in the mall at Steamtown . Everything is now 75 percent off. So there are a lot of bargains to be had. The union contracts , still not on the city's website . The firefighters ' contract was settled by arbitration 378 days ago; the police 263 days ago. I did a right-to-know 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 257 request since I couldn't get any results otherwise asking for copies of those contracts . And the 15th I receive d an e-mail which said there was a 30-day extension to my request because a timely response cannot be accomplished due to bona fide staffing limitations . Now, I don't know if that's the whole story, but when I talked to some of the union members for the police and the firefighters , I suspect that there is more to it than just the typing grill. So we shall see. I think once I get an answer in May on my request for copies of the contracts , I'm going to put in a right-to-know request . I want to know how much money we have paid to the city's labor counsel Ufberg since he began negotiations for the firefighters and the police in November of 2021. That's how long he's been our labor counsel . And as was pointed out, last month he made $56,179.79. It's almost like the city is his personal cash cow, but we shall see. Last week on the agenda you had a request for a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 258 residency waiver for Denis Zakharov and the legislation was pulled. Is Mr. Zakharov living in the city or not? MR. SMURL: Yes. They told me he had got an apartment in the city. MS. HODOWANITZ : He move in. Okay, so that settles that issue. On 3-A on the agenda for tonight , the budget transfers , there were three of them. What was the backstory to that? You know, I didn't understand . I said just move money from A to B and then A to B and then A to B. But didn't give any explanation of what triggered these transfers . Does anybody know? MR. SCHUSTER : So that's the same question I asked last week. MS. HODOWANITZ : I think it's on this week's agenda though. MR. SCHUSTER : Yeah, I think we got some correspondence last week. It was put into Third Order this week. But I asked that question last because they're going from -- it's going from a childcare wage boost into individual reimbursement and then it's going from wage boost into building startup fund. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 259 I wanted to know have these programs -- some of them have been successful while others haven't. I wasn't really sure what the backstory was. MS. HODOWANITZ : Yeah, two of them are going to small business grants to business startup fund. But they are significant amounts of money, 121,000, 139,000, 405,000 dollars . I'd like to know what's going on there. MR. SCHUSTER : We didn't get anything back. MR. VOLDENBERG : We did not. MS. HODOWANITZ : Also on the agenda 5-C extending the contract from Matt Domines ' for another year, that is one of the smartest things you can do because I don't think you're going to find someone to replace him. You know, I sit on the police and firefighter pension boards and I go to the composite pension board meetings every month and he's always there. That guy is sharper than a whip. If it has anything to do with budgeting or money or financing , he's on top of it. So I think, you know, every penny you pay him is going to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2510 be well earned. He's really got his mind on the game. And if you want a straight answer about anything that has to do with money, ask him. And finally , as you know, I have been running around the city, you know, pushing the pedestrian buttons , you know, to see which ones work and which ones don't. There's an awful lot of buttons . It's going to take me a while because you can't do it when it's raining holding a notebook and an umbrella at the same time. I've done about I would say 75 or 80 buttons so far. It's got to be probably around one third of what's downtown , many work, many don't work. The point is, if you are going to spend any money on any kind of innovations or upgrades , you need a long-term plan to sustain it and not let it go into disuse. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Joan. Les Spindler . MR. SPINDLER : Good evening , Council , Les Spindler , city resident , homeowner . My garbage always gets picked up on 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2511 Monday. Well, it used to. Last two weeks it wasn't picked up until Tuesday . Are we short garbage trucks or something because today I saw a Wilkes-Barre garbage truck in the city. Are we borrowing trucks from other cities now to do the work or what? MR. SMURL: I don't believe so. That's the first I've heard of it. MR. KING: The week after Easter I know DPW was off that Monday so it would have pushed it one day that way. MR. SPINDLER : There was no holiday yesterday or Monday and it wasn't picked up until yesterday . MR. KING: Yeah, I don't have an answer on that one. MR. SPINDLER : If we're short garbage trucks or people or whatever we better get going so people's garbage gets picked up on time. And speaking of garbage , the fourth week that garbage I talked about at the Providence Road exit off the expressway near Redner's is still there. There's totes and a shopping cart and clothes and whatnot. And it's four weeks 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2512 in a row now that I talked about it and it's still there. It's a former homeless camp that was broken up, I guess. And it's a mess. It's all in the trees. So maybe it will decompose before it's picked up by DPW. Next thing, I have been against this for a long, long time. People are able to go to gun shows and buy guns without mandatory background checks. And now President Biden is doing something about it. It was on the news the other night that he's closing a loophole to allow that to happen. So now at gun shows there's mandatory -- going to be mandatory background checks for people buying guns. I always thought that was ridiculous that any Tom, Dick or Harry could walk up to a gun show and buy a gun without being checked . It was the most stupid thing I heard of. Thank God for President Biden doing something about it. Okay, next thing. Mr. King, you came here late last week. You didn't hear me talk about the meeting at Lackawanna College a few weeks ago about the parking better and the walking better and making the city beautiful . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2513 You were there. They couldn't answer my question about how visually impaired people could cross the street. They gave me answers but they weren't answers to my question . They just danced around it. They said that -- the one guy said cars will let them go. I said, well, how is a blind person going to know the cars are going to let them go and they couldn't answer. MR. KING: I asked them afterward s if they could look into any type of devices that could possibly assist with that. So they told me they will investigate those. MR. SPINDLER : Something has to be done because there's no way a visually impaired person could cross a street with stop signs. And you heard what Mr. Pocius said. He said you can't replace traffic lights with stop signs and have it be safe. That's a man with 50 years experience talking . And next thing, they want to plant trees and this and that and make the city beautiful . I'm all for making the city look nice but not at the expense of losing parking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2514 spaces. Show them what it did to the parking lot on Main Avenue. They made it look so nice, yeah, but there's nowhere to park. Friday night, Saturday night going to Vincenzo 's, you can't park in that parking lot. My wife and I met friends there a few weeks ago. They got the last spot. It was a handicapped lot -- a handicapped spot. There was nowhere to park for regular people. He took a handicap spot. I said I hope you don't get a ticket. MR. KING: Les, I think some of the ones they said they were going to -- are already -- they're already illegal , like they're too close. They don't meet the code in terms of how close they are to corners . So I think there were at least eight of them that would be eliminated as just a result of that. MR. SPINDLER : Yeah, I just think we need more parking in the city, not less. That's all I have tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Mr. Voldenberg , will you ask the administration we sent a request about two weeks ago about the garbage at Redner's, get an update and find out when they are going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2515 to get down there and clean that up. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. SMURL: If they're going to put the signs up first and see if it is a camp or however they do it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll take care of it. MR. SCHUSTER : I think that's along the exit, right, that's along the exit as you get off coming towards Redner's turning towards Sheetz. MR. SMURL: Norma Jeffries . MS. JEFFRIES : Norma Jeffries , Scranton resident . And I want to thank you for mention ing about the cleanup this Saturday at Nay Aug. I'll be there. Bob Gattens will be there and others from the SMRA Board will be there as well and look forward to seeing everyone . I'll be handing out rakes if anyone doesn't bring one, okay? What's been on my mind and what I have been -- Joan's been running around pushing buttons . I run around trying to -- looking at street signs that aren't there trying to find my way around the city. But the thing that 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2516 really has been on my mind and wondering what can I do to help and over the past few weeks we have been disheartened by the acts of violence in our city by gang members . Most of it is gun violence . How it all went from heartbreak to joy as we prayed for Detective Gilmartin . Now as we deal with the latest gang activity with the shooting and death in the Weston Field area, most of us remember Weston Field. It was part of our growing up and what a good time we had there. As I travel through the city and I see the Scranton Police cars pass by, their logo is "Be a Part of the Solution ." Hmm, I think to myself. Be a part of the solution . I want to be that part. I want to be a part of the solution . I'm not sure what that covers. So I called the police department after Googling what was online. And they suggested that I go and attend neighborhood groups. Well, I do that already . I'm active with our Hill Neighborhood Association . Chief Carroll has come to our group several times and has spoken to us. And he's given us very good 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2517 information . But that still didn't satisfy the gut feeling that I have. Again, I am thinking how can I be a part of the solution , not only me but others that have hearts desired to help. My thoughts for the gangs is a mentorship program . And others I'm sure can be a part of the mentorship. I did call and I -- around the city to see if there was any mentorship programs available that I could participate in. And I found none. I spoke with Maureen Gray at the Northeast Youth Center and she said for the ones that we need to research are the 4th and 5th and 6th grades. It's okay to have an assembly and they talk to the kids. But once they leave that assembly , they need someone to hold their hand, someone that cares about them, somebody that they could build a relationship with. I know myself I work with the youth and I do tutoring at my church. And there is no greater feeling -- you probably know this too, Mr. McAndrew , when a young person addresses you by name. They may be out in the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2518 store and they say hi, Miss Norma. That is a great feeling because you know you've had an impact on that person's life. You cannot do that. You cannot reach that person by sitting at a podium and having a meeting from the auditorium . I know that the Mayor has convened a panel of leaders to help with the situation . And looking at the picture in the paper, I will be praying for that team, praying for the following; to develop a tutor program for homework help. I'm there because I do that right now, develop a summer program for student s in the lower grades, develop a mentoring program for students . These kids need to be a part of the solution . They need to feel that they belong and can make a difference in the City of Scranton . I know these issues can't be handled right away or overnight. I feel that such urgency in the gut of my stomach when I read about these kids. One day they were born and they were handed this little baby and someone was more than likely very happy with this little one. And now they are causing havoc. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2519 What happened ? What happened ? We can be a part of that solution if someone comes up with a mentoring program . And like I said, I work with kids right now at my church. And I just feel that we as the citizens of Scranton need to be a part of the solution . I did find on the website -- if I could just have a few more seconds here. I did find on the website -- of course it doesn't act right when I want to look at it. It says, the Scranton Police Department employs four federally funded police officers from a grant obtained from the City of Scranton Office of Community Development Office. One officer is assigned to a specific area of the city which is broken down into four sections , West beat, North beat, Hill beat and South beat. These officers embrace the philosophy of community policing and all the daily operation s and functions . Officers -- this is the part -- officers work closely with neighborhood groups and community leaders and share the responsibility of identifying , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2520 reducing , eliminating , and preventing problems that impact community safety and order. By working together , the police and community can reduce the fear of crime and improve the quality of life in the neighborhood . And it just goes on and on. And I just think that we need to be a part of the solution and put those words that are on the police cars into use. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Norma. Rik Little. MR. LITTLE: Hi. Rik Little, Scranton , Pennsylvania . I'm not too articulate tonight because I've been up a long time and I got the newspaper . Something has to happen. Biden is coming here. The nation is focusing on the big picture . We're voting on stuff. And he's talking about saving the middle class. There is no -- things have been wrong for too long. And the people talk a lot about the homelessness problem . I will say my opinion is that it's all Scranton Housing Authority 's fault. And I say it this way because over the last 28 years they edged their way into the county housing because Scranton 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2521 Housing is Scranton . It was set up by Scranton , set up a long time ago. And sometime -- the way I figure it 28 years ago about the same time my lease was written they were infiltrated by lawyers and judges, lawyers . And so -- and there's no tenant people admitted . I tried to get on the board, can't get on the board. It's closed. But the people that pick the Board is the Mayor. And for the last 10 years I've watched administrators come in. Scranton has to take that back because what the people that are running Scranton Housing , they have gotten all of these people in the county into it by offering them to be caregivers. Everybody is a caregiver. You got Scranton Housing is suppose d to be a caregiver really because they're a 5013C. They're not suppose d to make a profit like a church, like a spiritual organization . But they've drawn in all these different agencies , especially health and human services which oversees the Area Agency on Aging. And I see -- you know, you see Area Agency on Aging TV commercials . I still have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2522 never -- I have not met anybody who is helped by the Area Agency on Aging. And I could understand why Patrick is now the head of the whole state on the Area on Agency. And it's because the old head of Health and Human Services -- I can't think of his name -- well, he was let go. And he's the guy that brought in the ERAP, millions of dollars . I applied for it. You read the Times-Tribune . Oh, they had this money but they didn't distribute it. I promise you they distributed it. I promise you that I applied for it four times. I have a letter from the head counsel of Health and Human Services said, yeah, David Coyne -- your full rent is paid. And then they put me in this court process which is unusual ly cruel because I spent 15 years fighting for my child. It's very personal . They just attack me. They hired the last two managers to evict me because they're not even supposed to go to the Courts by law. By -- they shall not go to the Courts until they get me a grievance hearing . And they kept me going for pretty much four years. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2523 I never got a grievance hearing . And they got the courts -- all the courts in their pocket. And I'm reading the newspaper today. And the place I ended up, their solution is the charity , the Catholic Services . And I was in their shelter , 20 beds in the bottom. But there's a hundred beds above it. We're bringing in elderly from Philadelphia . We're bringing in migrants and all of this stuff, and it's hell. And then I read the newspaper -- and just four -- eight numbers away from where they put me, you know, and way over the 30 percent of my federal subsidy which is what I was fighting for which I always said if I lose that, I'm dead. I mean, that's where all the shootings were the last time, you know, the Crips and Bloods. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Little. That's all for the sign-in sheet. Anyone else wish to address Council ? MR. COYNE: Tom Coyne, Minooka . First off, I had asked about two weeks ago since there is evidently a homeless group and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2524 meeting s that were held, I had asked and Mr. Smurl said he would look forward to finding out who was on these actual Mayor's homeless group, where they meet, and if there were any minutes from that. And if you've gotten a response back, you could give me that in Fifth Order. Off to -- off the paper. I didn't need it tonight for the subject at hand. Last session Mr. Smurl and Mr. King talked about going to Harrisburg with the Mayor because of how much better this city is and how much the city has improved. I understand it was on a financial standing . But it's juxtapose d when the Council of this city goes to Harrisburg to get an award on how much better this city is when one of its citizens at the same time are going to get a death certificate for one of their people who were shot on the streets . There's been a lot of talk about in the neighborhood of Weston Field. Let's make it correct . The beat down of this man by three people happened in Weston Field in the -- at the facility at the courts. It wasn't outside . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2525 It was around -- it was on city property . This same property that has been brought to the attention of this body for drinking , for parties , for gatherings , who this party directed the Director of Parks to make sure is locked and secured in the evenings . From talking with people around there, evidently the locks that were there lasted for like a day or two before they were either stolen, broken or gone and maybe just not -- did not get reported to anyone. Sure, the police got there on scene after the bullets flew. We heard it from City Council here as this meeting was going on as they tore up this street going to Providence Road. Some of the members in here got the police call and left during the meeting to go on site. There was one Council member who actually went up to the scene himself, Mr. Schuster and stood there and looked at what was happening at that location . There's a serious problem when you say that this city is doing better. On one of its location s that either has no cameras or the police are not monitoring the cameras for it, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 someone gets beaten and then gets shot less than a hundred yards away from that location . That's not a failure of gangs. That's not a failure of bad kids. That's a failure of a governmental body who knows a location is a hangout, is used after hours, is used for drinking , is used for drugs, has been broken into and is constantly under attack by people not to have a cop car sit up there rather than at the Sheetz at the bottom of the hill as they tend to do two or three at the Sheetz station there and get coffee. And the Sheetz, I understand it's a great place for both the police and the medical people to hang out because they could get Main Street, they could get to Center City, and they could get up onto 81 to go to different location s. It's a nice location to be at. But it's actually very well lit. So is Weston Field, but Weston Field is where we've known the problem is. Weston Field for six months is where this body has been told the problem is. And there is absolutely no reason why there wasn't a police car station ed and sitting there if it's going 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2527 to idle anywhere else for that neighborhood because it has access to highways , to Green Ridge, to everything from that location . But evidently that's not important . And negligence and not taking care of the issue will only come back to bite the taxpayers because he got beat down on Scranton 's property . And that homicide is a direct relation to that that negligent homicide . We could do better. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MR. DOBRZYN : Good evening , Council , Dave Dobrzyn resident , taxpayer and so forth. Once again, I'm calling for a kinder gentler more cooperative home inspection s and property inspections . If somebody -- you show up once and tell them what's wrong and leave it at that. And they're by the way, they're your employees . So they are representing your opinions and attitudes on it. Then if they scoff away, you know, then they have to be dealt with and it's not fun. Now, on Weston, yes, we should have cameras there. But I'm calling on parents. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2528 That was a 17-year-old kid running around with a gun. It was four years until he was qualified to own a gun. And the parents buy these guns and they leave them laying around where they could just swipe them up and do the wrong thing with them. And more than drugs, I think something like that is just adolescent testosterone or something . It's just -- out in Chicago the Crumbleys , either Michigan or Chicago, they bought their kid a gun and they took him to the range and everything and they left that gun laying around. He took it to school and killed a couple people, you know, and now they've been convicted of manslaughter . And both of them might get as high as 10 years. So don't leave your guns laying around for an angry kid whose girlfriend broke up with him or, you know, some bullies picking on him and he wants to settle the score because he's going to have one hell of a life because you left your gun laying around. So parents lock up your guns. If you are intelligent enough or know enough to disable them while not in use. Take the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2529 bullets out and hide it somewhere or whatever , you know and ammunition also. Once again, the landfill . They want to introduce leachate juice into the gorge at Nay Aug. Please get in touch with these people that are opposed to the landfill and put a stop to this. They have to currently ship the leachate to the Sewer Authority . And by the way, I'm probably paying their damn bill anyway because that water is probably way more poisonous and dangerous than anything that I pull the handle on to get rid of. You know, I'm probably paying part of their bill. The water company now, you know, instead of fines, why don't we insist that people be removed from the Board of Directors , anything happens under the boss's auspice , anything that goes on. So if they want to be so cheap that they want to do things on the sly and open up a gate or whatever and cause the kind of problem s that they caused in water that flows through the gorge, then too bad. Get off the board. Get them off the board. They are not qualified to be there. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2530 They are not qualified to accept hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars off us every month to clean up the river. And now, you know, I'm going to talk a little bit about life. I was a very young kid when our president left office Eisenhower . And so I don't know what it was like when to try and earn a living or something . I was about six years old when Kennedy took over. And, you know, by and large he's my favorite one -- one of my favorite presidents of the 20th century . Maybe it's just my lack of knowledge or maybe I followed him enough to know he did several really good things. He put an end to Joe McCarthy . But the one thing -- he made two mistake s that I know of. He had an operation went back where they shipped immigrants back to Mexico. Everybody on the bus almost died wherever they were dropped off. And another one was in the 1958 IRS Act, he allowed 5013Cs and C4s to hold conferences provided that there were equal, equal representation of pros and cons. And instead we got people like Henry Amoroso being 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2531 brought in. This is your salvation . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Dobrzyn . MR. DOBRZYN : As we could see, it hasn't been our salvation so they have to be -- MR. SMURL: Thank you. MR. DOBRZYN : Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. O'HARA: Hi. I'm Lori O'Hara, Scranton resident . And I'm here to put my two cents in for the homeless problem that we've got going on. I see that we have a pedestrian bridge to be built over the Lackawanna River, which is fabulous . And I'm just curious as what the plan is for the people that are living where this propose d plan is. Maybe we could do something in conjunction with. So what I've come up with, my two cents, everybody has a lot of stuff that they're doing and it's great and it goes to the collective . So it's like bits and pieces and hopefully he could get something together to actually come to a resolution . So this a my plan, Scranton recover y campground by Lori O'Hara, Scranton city 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2532 resident . I believe we as a city have the capacity to fully address the homeless blight that is currently in our town. While we have service s and resources available in the city, it appears there is something missing between the services provided and a positive result on the end of the homeless person. I was happy to hear one success story last week at the meeting . I believe if we have a foundation structured within the existing homeless encampments, it would provide a better transition for when they become a contributing member of society . I believe this should be a goal that can be met if structure d properly with the existing services currently on hand. We are living with the awareness of catastrophic results when rules and laws are not applied if its residents who pay taxes and live by rules and obey laws then we should all be held accountable to the same sets of rules and laws. And the question arises and the debate continues to this land it is and jurisdiction in regards to enforcement . But in the interim , there is nothing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2533 being done to alleviate the homelessness and help the resident s or keep the city safe. So this is just an initial plan. There will we more. This is just, you know, first part. The plan I see is a visionary long-term developing inclusive and it promotes a community in the city. A pilot initiative for Scranton , this will further utilize collective service s, collective agencies working in tandem for the common good of all humanity . A natural development of community between the homeless and the residen tial community can be establish ed with a comprehensive plan. Number one, I assert we meet these people where they are and that's on the ground. I've been down there weekly when weather is, you know, good enough to go down there. And I'm filling can liners of garbage . We're not ripping tents apart, cutting up IDs or anything like that. There is plenty of garbage to pick up. There's no need to do any of that. We're not part of that. That was the city. That was not the groups. Obtain land agreement s with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2534 the appropriate land owners, simultaneously as you begin the process of developing , ask the existing occupants as to what their current needs are, inform them of the structured encampment and survey those who choose to remain and they could help in the cleanup, have an application . The application should be designed similar to those of rehab, include needs and skills they may possess . Institute a requirement for campground resident s to perform volunteer work around the community . People with skills can help with small project s within the city. Examples of those are painting , grass cutting , shoveling elderly sidewalks, etc. There are endless opportunities for the homeless to give back to the community that is helping them. This shows resident s that they are willing to help in their own recovery and take an interest into the community that surrounds them and our great city. Within the application process survey the needed social services . Examples would be, big one, helping obtain 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2535 identification , literacy , ESL, mental health drug, alcohol addiction , provide AA literature . There's a meeting every hour pretty much in Scranton until you could get yourself into an actual rehab, people seeking employment , life skills, hygiene , cooking , dressing , personal responsibilities . Again, possibilities are endless and able to be tailor made to suit specific area needs. There is also -- has to be time designation for campers . Establish a 30 day, 60 day, 90 day turnover goal to be met for the campers . If process ed properly , the goal would be to not have a recovery camp grown at which time there is no longer a need for recovery campground that it could be repurposed as an income producing campground and since you wanted (inaudible ) it would have fit in nicely, wouldn't it? Campground rules, incorporate campground rules, rehab style rule structure , no drugs or alcohol . Campsites have to be clean and tidy, curfews , coordinate services with trash, etc.; three strike rule. Funding would be clean up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2536 landscaping , design, garbage receptacle s, dumpsters , porta-potties , lavatory services , lighting , security , especially in the evening , an option to hire security guards with a SPD officer onsite in situations that arise and immediately be addressed via law enforcement and could be a mentoring program . The idea is to begin structure on the literal ground where these people need to be met in order to lift them up. This allows better insight into the city's homeless as to what is needed and in what capacity . This affords efficient ways to allocate funds to be most effective in resolving or providing tangible solutions to alleviate this plight. The natural progression is the trickle down of a program that once the word is out it will deter illicit behaviors and actions and more importantly signal a place for the people, especially women with children , and unfortunately , children can be safe and receive meaningful help, a place one can go to recovery . It gives the city a better direction on how to bridge the gap between homeless and 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2537 returning them to productive members of society and part of the community and resident s will know who is here, where, and clearly why. And rules and structures equal success . MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. NELLIS: Hello, Council , I was just wondering if you have any suggestions of the start of the -- that I was going to implement if you had any ideas or any things that you guys maybe you wouldn't want me to do this. I don't know. Maybe you would have some direction . MR. SMURL: I don't think that part is organized yet. But would you please state your name? MS. NELLIS: My name is Louella Nellis. MR. SMURL: Thank you. MS. NELLIS: I was thinking about starting a program called Self-Taught Angel Resources which is for people to learn how to do your driver licenses , how to go to Social Security , how to go to welfare , things like that, like, a checklist . And I thought maybe I could use some 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2538 of your implementations like, you know, suggestion , you know, how you would like to set that up because I would like to be, you know, you guys to be part of this because you taught me. But it took me a long time to find these resources because if you don't know what to ask for, you don't get the help and I figured that out. And it took me a long time to figure that out. So a lot of people out here being homeless don't know what to ask for. And sometime s they stay homeless because they don't know what to ask for. But I figured it out, you know, but it took me a long time. So I would like to have a program , you know, like a pamphlet or something that says, okay, you know, if you lose your license you have to do this. Like, I find out -- my license is in New York, right, I have to get an abstract to get my license . And it's like, well, why can't I get it here? So maybe there's some things that could be done here that would make it a little bit easier because there's a lot of red tape. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2539 You have to get your identity back without identity , you know what I'm saying? And that's what happened to me. I'm still waiting to get my license . It's been almost a year. So I just, you know, my question is that if there is any, you know, maybe we could work together or something on this because I think it is a big project for a lot of homeless . Maybe some people won't be homeless if they had an idea of where to go to stop the homeless . MR. KING: Perhaps if you -- it sounds like you're familiar with some of the local support groups, Keystone Mission and Catholic Social Services and some of the other groups in town. Maybe, you know, if you were willing to type something up or work with them to say listen, as people come in, maybe I could set up a table and offer these services . If they're struggling with any of those issues that you just brought up, that might be one avenue -- just a thought . MS. NELLIS: Yeah, that's why I'm here because , I mean, I was homeless for a long time. But some of it was my fault because I didn't know what to ask for. So I was just 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2540 wondering if, you know, you guys had -- because you made these programs , the Keystone and the Mission and all of these things. But there is a lot of failure going on over that too because there is no direction . And I even was part of that victim myself because I was out there with all of these people, which didn't want a direction see, but I did want one. And that's how I'm a success story. But I would like to find out -- since you guys have these programs if there is any other program s that maybe would make it easier, you know, for some of these people to not be homeless anymore because I know that's our goal, right, is for people not to be homeless because it really knocks you down to a point where some people don't ever come back. But I came back because I was strong to do it. But I'm just asking, you know, if there was anything that you guys wanted to implement into that. MR. KING: I think council -- I don't think it's next week. It may be the following week. We're planning to have a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2541 caucus to meet with some of the local representative s to really discuss the homeless issue to try to come up with some thought s and ideas on how we as a community may be able to address some of the issues facing the homeless in our area and try to look for positive solutions to the problem . MR. NELLIS: So a couple weeks you said. MR. KING: I think it's -- is it next week -- two weeks from now because we're having meeting s on Wednesday , the individual that's going to meet -- one of the individual s that's going to meet with us can't come on Wednesday s. So it will be two weeks from now. All right? MS. NELLIS: Okay. Thank you very much. MR. KING: Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. SCHUMACHER : Marie Schumacher , City Council member of bugging Council , I guess. I have what I call some loose ends, things like the first one is for -- I'd say about six or seven weeks recently we talked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2542 about permits and licenses and a lot of people were coming and saying what issues they had. And I certainly thought it was going to end in some kind of an investigation of what was happening in -- but it didn't. All of a sudden it just -- MR. SMURL: No, it has. Our attorney had read that out at our last week meeting . Would you like him to read it again? MS. SCHUMACHER : Yes, please. MR. SMURL: Attorney , would you -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : An investigation was done internally and externally . All the issues that were brought up were address ed. And that's where it sits. And we're not allowed to really go into anything more than that but it has a deal with personnel issues. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, so you are doing something . MR. SMURL: It has been complet ed, yes. MS. SCHUMACHER : That's good. And another one though is the Serrenti , we haven't heard anything about what's going on up there and Engine 15. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2543 MR. SMURL: Engine 15 I believe they assessed it for the value to see if they were going to put it up for sale, but I haven't heard anything since that. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. And the Nay Aug pool, what's the status of the Nay Aug pool? MR. SMURL: Those bids, you should see those in the paper in the next two weeks. MS. SCHUMACHER : Excellent . MR. KING: That will be for phase one I believe for that project . MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. Pilots, the payments in lieu of taxes, I thought we were going to do some kind of an have audit. MR. SMURL: That audit is underway . It has been processed . MS. SCHUMACHER : And when does it conclude ? MR. SMURL: It depends how deep they have to get into each one. I mean, not every one is simple. Some are going to take a lot more time than others. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay, and stormwater , that's always going to be an issue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2544 And there's things that can be done there. And then DPW performance , I thought we were going to see Rubicon reports every week. Did that drop? MR. SMURL: We do get Rubicon updates . I will check and see when our last ones -- I do get them. I don't know if -- MR. SCHUSTER : I think they come monthly . And it's really like how much tonnage has been taken to the landfill per month, how many employees are utilizing the system and to what percentage . It really only gives that data. But they come monthly and they have been in Third Order. MS. SCHUMACHER : Okay. That's it for tonight . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. MANCINI : Good evening , Council , Mike Mancini , Scranton . I was here last week. I was the last one to appear before this body for the public comment section . Five minutes after that gunshot s rang out yet again through our city. These calls are becoming too frequent , the nature of the calls more severe. We know this. We know that there is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2545 safety concerns . That's why I address ed this Council the last three weeks about the importance of canines . All right. Unfortunately , the Mayor decided to not -- I don't want to say address the issue. She has a different fundamental understanding as to her indifference with myself. I reached out to her today. I had spoken to her secretary , made him aware of the situation -- two canines, two Cane Corsos. I took it upon myself because of the importance and the safety of our city. As a father losing a son, I hear about a lot of these calls before a lot of other people do so people only hear half of it. That's not all the calls. There's so many calls that our Scranton Police Department take on a daily basis since 1866 that we don't even know about. And they'll go out daily for us and make a difference . We are so proud of them. We are so blessed to have them. Romano's canine corso is a breeder , Shadow Romano. I was hoping that he would be here tonight along with his father-in-law Ed Adams. Some of you probably know that name. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2546 He's a trainer for many of the canines throughout the region. He's willing to train the canine. Shadow Romano's willing to give two canine corsos. It was in some of the news media outlets at the beginning of the week. Understand , this isn't about me. I'm only one person, right. If me and two other people could do this and make a difference , can you imagine what our whole city can do? We have been tested so many times throughout the years. One thing we've never done is we've never broken. Our police department is at 80 percent capacity . They need our help. Neighbor hood watch programs have gone beyond the wayside after -- through COVID. Dunmore doesn't even have one. West Scranton doesn't have one either. It's the biggest part of the city. And we actually receive percentage wise, the majority of, a good portion of the calls. And, you know, neighbor doesn't really know neighbor anymore. And it's unfortunate . We need to have our neighbors get to know our neighbors once again. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2547 I'm asking everybody out there who truly cares about our city, you could make a difference , join a neighborhood watch, okay. There are websites out there. Scranton .gov, state police website . Both of them allow us to give tips anonymously to help out. Our police department s, our first responders, it's very important to them that they clear a call with no issue, rather not have an issue. Anything times zero, zero, hey, that's great, you know. But they would rather clear an issue before it becomes a major issue. Now a lot these have become major issues. After that shooting last Tuesday , the young individual tossed the gun. You know who found it, a canine. They hit on drugs. They hit on guns. And I'm willing to make a difference . And I'm asking the Mayor, no more names because that doesn't benefit anybody . It's at the expense of the people of Scranton . I know we all have the same goal. And that's the safety of this city. And I'm asking the Mayor this evening , please do the right thing, accept these canines , allow us to make a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2548 difference . God bless the Scranton Police Department and our first responders. Good evening , City Council . MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Mancini. Mr. Mancini , have you contact ed Chief Carroll about the canines ? MR. MANCINI : I have contact ed the Mayor's office directly . I have that phone number. I spoken with Isiah her secretary . She had mention ed that she's going to look into. Also, Mr. Smurl, I spoken last week. I go back and I watch over this because it's important of what everybody says here. You know, to Council it might not be something important , but these people here it's very important . Okay, this is very important to me. One thing that I didn't mention is I'm very sorry for your loss. MR. SMURL: Thank you. Anyone else? MR. SCHUSTER : Mr. Mancini, the two individual s that you spoke of Chad Romano and Ed Adams, one is a breeder and one is a trainer? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2549 MR. MANCINI : Correct . MR. SCHUSTER : Okay. Yeah, I think it's a -- I mean, you reached out to the Mayor, but I think it's important that we get ahold of the police department maybe put them in contact . MR. MANCINI : These canines are going to be born in about two weeks. We walked the older brother Typhen{phonetic } up to City Hall the other day. He weighs 160 pounds, massive . And he looks menacing . But you know what, they're such a loving dog. You know, they could make a difference , bring them to the school districts , you know, bring them to the schools . Let the kids meet them and get to know their police officers again. MR. SCHUSTER : I think it's important for the police, you know, to kind of vet the process because even though they're not born, you still don't the know the temperament , things like that. I think there's a couple things -- MR. MANCINI : I intended on having them both here tonight . But unfortunately , 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2550 there was a family emergency . Shadow who is married to Ed Adams's daughter , so there was a family issue. I hope everything is okay. It's intention -- both of their intention s were to be here tonight . I'm hoping to have them here next week. Mr. Smurl, is it okay if we bring a canine here? MR. SMURL: You'll have to check with the administration . I don't run the building day-to-day operations . Thank you. MR. MANCINI : Okay. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Anyone else? MS. FOTIA: Hi. Good evening , Council , Gloria Fotia{phonetic } Scranton resident . I would first like to start by saying congratulations , Dr. Rothchild , on behalf of me and my mother. I'm very happy for the new addition in your family. Secondly , I'm just here to touch on a couple things that Miss Lori O'Hara did not get a chance to say in her five minutes . So in the packet that she gave to you, the second page is a post on Facebook from the University of Scranton Office of Community Relations . On it says, our third CDL talk is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2551 only a week away. This is four days ago so sorry for the post date. This CDL talk will explore the root causes of homeless and poverty in NEPA. Krista Murray, Executive Director of the Catherine McAuley Center and Jessica Wallow, Director of Community Services at United Neighborhood Center of NEPA will provide their insight , discuss their work and how their organizations are meeting the needs of the community . This CDL talk will be hosted on Thursday , April 18th at 6 p.m., in the PNC auditor LSC 1333. To register , copy the provided link or Scan the QR code. We hope to see you there. And there's a link provided at the end of the post. So I just wanted to make that aware for everybody in the community and for our fellow Council members . So thank you. MR. SMURL: Would you say your name again? I didn't hear you. MS. FOTIA: My name? MR. SMURL: Yes. MS. FOTIA: Victoria Fotia. DR. ROTHCHILD : And just to clarify , so LSCU is the Science Center. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2552 MR. FOTIA: I'm sorry? DR. ROTHCHILD : LSCU is the Science Center, correct ? MS. FOTIA: LSC -- I'm not sure. I haven't been to the University myself so I'm not sure. Thank you. MR. VOLDENBERG : FIFTH ORDER. 5-A. MOTIONS . MR. SMURL: Mr. King, do you have any motions or comments ? MR. KING: Just a couple comments . Can we check with Scranton Police Department and probably really our Parks and Rec Director about the locks down at the Weston Field to see -- I know there's more than one entrance to that place down there. So there is multiple entrances to get into Weston Field. So locking that place down is not the easiest task. But can we just check to see parks are suppose d to be locked at dusk. So can we just check to see that that's happening . I've seen videos and photos that indicate that it hasn't been happening . So if we can check on that, that would be greatly appreciated . This past weekend , I had the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2553 opportunity to attend the gathering for Gilmartin up on Montage Mountain and was extremely well-attended, couldn't believe the number of people that came out to support Detective Gilmartin -- Kyle, so very happy and proud of this community the way they come together to support the police department and especial ly Detective Gilmartin after everything he's been through and continues to go through . On Saturday night, I attended boxing matches up at the Holiday Inn in Dunmore . In those boxing matches were quite a number of young men, black, Hispanic , Caucasian , many of them are city residents , our city students who train. They train with the likes of Gene Reed, Jimmy Simmrel and Senator Flynn quite frankly . And it was pretty awesome to sit there and watch these kids get out there and perform , you know, in an environment where there were 650 people watching them. And it reminded me of one of the things I used to do when I was principal in 9th grade. In 9th grade, we used to try to get -- I used to tell student s -- I'd bring 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2554 them in for an assembly and I told them the most successful students in the school were the kids that got involved in something , didn't matter it was football , if it was the band, if it was a play, if it was the French Club, if it was debate, anything . Get involved in something so that students have a feeling of belonging . They feel a part of something . That's extremely important . And I couldn't stop thinking that at that boxing match the other night, the self-esteem on these kids after they perform -- and I will tell you this. There were very few of the Scranton kids that lost or they weren't all necessarily right from Scranton , the majority of them were. Some of them were from around the region. But a lot of the kids that they boxed were from Lehigh Valley or up in the Easton area. To me, I saw young men with self-esteem who really felt a sense of belonging and were really proud of what they were able to accomplish and they had self-esteem. And I think -- I know myself, I never planned on going to go college . I'll be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2555 quite honest with you. I was going to be tin knocker. And there's nothing wrong with that. My entire family -- my father, my brother , my brother -in-law, every one of us worked in the sheet metal business . And that's the direction I was going to go. When I got involved in sports I never felt real strong academically , but the athletics really helped to build my self-esteem as I got better. I was a runner. Believe me, I tried every other sport and I was terrible , finally found something I was decent at. And that got me to the point where I really I wanted to continue running and it led me to college . So success breeds success . So to Norma's point, there are program s that we need to try to look at, program s that have existed in the past such as big brother s and big sisters , this boxing program I talked about, mentorship programs . When we grew up, many of us grew up on playground s. I'm number seven of eight children . We slept three in a bed. We left the house at eight in the morning and we were home when it got dark and we spent most of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2556 days on the playground . For me it was the Mattes Community Center which is now the Marine Corps League up on East Mountain . Unfortunate ly, those program s don't exist. But all of those program s in the summer were run by teacher s who they -- Ceta programs and they were hired to work with the kids and they had softball program s. They made all kinds of arts and crafts and did things. And kids had a place to go and kids have things to do and they were busy and they felt a sense of belonging . So I think that's important developing programs . And, you know, we talk about the University of Scranton . I think of the resources available just at the University of Scranton , Marywood and Lackawanna College alone. If we took the education department of each of those schools and we develop mentorship program s where maybe kids could go up and meet with some of the kids and, you know, those kids -- those students , the teacher s that are studying to become educators , a lot of them need community service . And if they could develop programs 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2557 where these kids instead of walking by the University of Scranton can go in the Byron Rec Center and play some hoops or get to know and learn that, boy, you know, if I work hard enough maybe I could achieve something at this level or someone that's just there to listen to talk to them, help them to build their self-esteem. Those are the type of program s that I think are the best. Norma hit it right on the head, mentorship type of program s. They work. We got to keep these kids busy. We got to get them -- you know, if we don't give them a sense or a place to find a sense of belonging, they're going to go to gangs because they -- unfortunately , a lot of them are coming from broken homes. God love the parents . They're working long hard hours to try to keep a roof over their head and it's very difficult , you know, with children have a lot of free time on their hands. And it's very difficult to monitor them. So when there's programs like this available , I think that could be part of the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2558 solution . It's a multifaceted problem . And with multifaceted problems such as homelessness , such as issues with gangs, there's got to be multifaceted answers. So those are my thoughts this evening . Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. King. Mr. Schuster , do you have any motions or comments ? MR. SCHUSTER : Yes, I have a few. I would agree with Mr. King on his comments about, you know, meeting needs. But there is a hierarchy of needs and there's, you know, needs that people seek out and love and belonging are one of those. If we're meeting those needs we won't turn to gangs. I did have a chance to go down to the scene last Tuesday night and I stayed until it was over and I got to listen to a lot of the concern s of the neighbors there. I met with some neighborhood groups a week or two earlier and got to listen to the concern there. And a lot of the concerns that were being brought to these meetings were that the parks are opened after dark and kids are in there playing from 12 until 3 in the morning .1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2559 I did send some e-mails to the Mayor, the Mayor, the BA or the Deputy Mayor and the Chief of Police are all aware of this. So I think we do have to find out what is going to be the plan, how are we going to address these parks after dusk. I was glad that Mr. King said it as well but for someone to come to the park after dusk when the gates are chained and locked and police officer -- when someone is inside, it's a very easy ask of why are you inside when the gates are locked? So I think the parks do need to be secured at night. If we could find out what the administration 's plans for our parks at dusk is. With that being said, I'd like to thank the Scranton Police Department for their immediate response to the scene. The officer s that night were on the scene, sad to say as the man was falling to the ground and they were there to provide immediate medical attention , so thank those officers . Thank you to the DA's office and the State Police that helped that night. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2560 Changing topics, I did put a right to know in and I got the same responses I think Mrs. Hodowanitz got that a timely response could not be accomplished due to staffing limitation s. So, Frank, if we could ask -- to find out what the staffing limitations are when it comes to the right-to-know request s. And did we get anything -- I asked about unfilled position s of employment in the city. Did we get a list of that? MR. VOLDENBERG : That was include d in last Wednesday 's questions . I have yet to receive . MR. SCHUSTER : Thank you very much. I know you stay on top of all these requests , but if we could stay on top of that as well. I know we have some legislation coming up in the next few minutes that we're going to make an addition to the 2024 budget. And I'd like to see if we could take some of the fundings from those positions that aren't filled to fund this position rather than make this transfer . Thank you. That's all. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. Schuster . Dr. Rothchild , do you have any motions or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2561 comments ? DR. ROTHCHILD : Yes, I have a few. First off, there was one issue that was brought to my attention . And then we also received an e-mail today about a property on the corner of Vine and Clay in the Hill Section that I believe is unoccupied . However , there have been student s that have taken it upon themselves to party there over the weekend or even the week days. It sounds like that it's become a big issue for the neighbors and for the area there. So I want to make sure that we get that sent over to the appropriate department so that they are monitoring the situation . It sounds like there were calls put into the police when the parties were happening and there wasn't always the response to have a, you know, car come by to break up the party or to get the student s to leave the premises . I don't know who the owner is, if it's abandoned or what the situation is at that property but it needs to be handled . MR. VOLDENBERG : I received that today. And I sent it out to both code 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2562 enforcement and the police department . It's owned by an LLC. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. MR. SMURL: Dr. Rothchild , is that 447 Clay? I think that was -- is that the same building ? MR. VOLDENBERG : That's the building , Mr. Smurl, yes. DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And next, I just wanted to speak to a couple issues that have been brought up over the many months and weeks that we've been here. And, you know, it seems like some of the major issues in our city right now are both violent crimes and gangs and then also with the homelessness . And I just wanted to say I really appreciate the people that come here and that do offer suggestions and they want to find ways to help. And we have just such a strong community and to have people do that, I'm really appreciative of that. And I know I want to do whatever I can to make our city safe. I always want someone to feel safe here. And, you know, it seems to be that it doesn't matter what neighbor hood or where you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2563 live that there have been issues and that people are not feeling safe. And so I want to figure out ways that we could do that. I feel like we need some better coordination with the administration and what their plans are and some of these groups that they're getting together because , you know, maybe we can then bring to them the, you know, the person who wants to give more resources to people who have lost their identity or that, you know, bring up the ideas of campground and bring your ideas forth to them because ultimately I think it would be difficult for us to start those programs . But we want to work together with the administration to see what we could make possible and also what, you know, what things can be enforced and, you know, where are we sending patrols , what neighborhoods are they getting to. And then, of course, coordinate too with the issue of if the parks are being locked or not. Now, I know not all the parks have -- are gated or able to be locked. But the ones that are, then we need to make sure 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2564 that's happening . So I'd like to -- I want to request Chief Carroll to come in. I mean, I wanted to meet -- I've requested to meet with him separately too. But, you know, I think it would be great to have him come in for an update. I know that he's done that in the past and, you know, I think we have a lot of important question s and suggestions specifically for that department . It would be great to have him come in for a caucus again soon. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll do that, Dr. Rothchild . DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. And I don't know was he -- is he already going to be present for the caucus where we will be discussing the homeless ? MR. SMURL: I believe we're just going to ask them for their opinions -- DR. ROTHCHILD : Okay. All right. That's all that I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Dr. Rothchild . Mr. McAndrew , do you have any motions or comment s? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2565 MR. MCANDREW : I got a few comments . So I agree with Miss Hodowanitz . Three hundred seventy days the firemens ' contract has been ratified , 263 days for the police contract , negotiated , agreed upon, arbitration , ratified . So and for labor counsel to keep telling us, you know, we got to dot some I's and cross some T's and it takes longer than you think it does, well, I don't think it should take this long. And I don't think that Mr. Schuster here should have to do a right to know asking how much we're spending and you're spending for this process . This is becoming absurd. So I don't I don't think we should have to do a right to know. Mr. Voldenberg , first of all -- had to do a right to know to get information that should be provided to us easily is ridiculous and it raises eyebrows, at least mine. So what I want to know and I want to know within a week and I don't want to hear about staffing shortages because we pay a ton of money over there. If they don't have enough employees , labor counsel , then hire somebody . But I want 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2566 to know how much this labor counsel has charged us for since the negotiations of both contracts started . And even more so, I want to know how much we paid them since these contract s were ratified until now with the silly nonsense of typing up some language . What did that cost us, all right, and not preventing them from being on the website . I'm sorry, but this is long enough for me. I think there's a problem here and we got to get to the bottom of it. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that information , sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. I'm not waiting another month or two months or want to hear the reasons why they can't provide it, which is nonsense . MR. VOLDENBERG : Agreed. MR. MCANDREW : They work for you and us. They're paid by you and us so enough. I also like to report out on the ANZ Hotel because , you know, we have some great concerned resident s up in that area. And you know what, they do a great job for us because their eyes and ears are open for us.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2567 And I know they are constant contact with the police and I know the police are doing a great up job up there. So -- but they still have some concerns . And the police -- I'm sorry, Chief Carroll confirmed to me because I spoke to him last week. And he said, you know, they're making a lot of arrests in that parking drug related because think about it. It's right on -- you hop on 81. You could go up through -- up on 80 from there. But, you know, as of yet, they haven't noticed any criminal or suspicious behavior within the hotel. And, you know, we asked for inspection reports and making sure. So they are doing a great job there and that's a tribute to the residents that are our eyes and ears there. So I want to thank them. But their concerns remain with the traffic study that I asked for them on their behalf regarding that block of Meadow Avenue where initially that -- I'm sorry, the gas station when the zoning was approved for it was not suppose d to exit right onto -- from the right onto Meadow Avenue and they continue to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2568 do that. We asked for that traffic study. I know they are going to do the crosswalk s, repaint all the lines to make it more safe. We're waiting for the weather . But can you please ask when is this traffic study going to occur? And because it's been brought to my attention -- and now that the Wawa has come to fruition for the most part, it's being built on Moosic Street with the road connected to this same block of Meadow Avenue, all right. There's going to be more traffic added to this already overloaded street. Think about it. All right. So these neighbor s are concerned and I don't blame them, so has that traffic study been completed , make this part of that now since it didn't start or request that, please on my behalf and all our behalves because , you know, adding another traffic pattern to Meadow Avenue in addition to, you know, with the Wawa and the concern s that are already there, somebody has to take a good look at it. So please ask where we're at with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2569 that. And, you know, we want an update. We want a timeline when is this going to happen. It was promised to us. All right. MR. VOLDENBERG : I'll get that, sir. MR. MCANDREW : Thank you. So I got a question and I don't know what the answer is that's why I'm going to ask Mr. Voldenberg . I'm going to reach out. A resident reached out to me and said, you know, there was a handicap sign on 425 Breck Street in South Side. The owner, God bless him, passed away, right, and there's new owners there but the sign remains and so it's prevent ing people to park there that aren't handicap but there's no longer anyone that's handicapped that live there. It's a new owner. So what's the process ? Is the sign removed normally or how does that happen or can you please look into that? MR. VOLDENBERG : I will. I'll ask the traffic officer . MR. MCANDREW : Put them on alert that the sign isn't needed there anymore. MR. VOLDENBERG : Correct . That should be removed . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2570 MR. MCANDREW : I can't hear you, I'm sorry. ATTY. GILBRIDE : In reading -- my preparation for the reserved parking , I believe the process is that that the owner of that property should contact the Scranton Police who will then contact DPW to make plans to get that removed . MR. MCANDREW : From my understanding -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : They have a -- the owner, of course, in this case the person passed, but they actually have a duty to contact the police to have that removed once it's no longer needed. MR. MCANDREW : So the conversation I had with the neighbor doesn't think that's ever going to happen. So they might need -- ATTY. GILBRIDE : The neighbor could contact . MR. MCANDREW : I'm asking you to contact them now if you do that on behalf of that neighbor because he doesn't believe the new owner's going to do it. All right. Thank you very much, both of you. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2571 Also, so I have been getting a lot calls and texts about unsecured parks, especially Weston Field. Look what happened last week. I was here getting a text when this horrific shooting was starting to occur over there. We get complaints about Novembrino Splash Pad is never locked. Someone broke into the -- not broke into the building , the building was open two weeks ago and somebody went in and ransacked it. I don't know what they took or didn't take. It doesn't matter. We're not securing our parks. And I agree not all of them can be secured . But, Jesus, the ones that we could secure, we got to secure them, all right. And because , you know, when these -- when the youth or these gang members have somewhere to congregate , it fosters this type of behavior . And if we could at least prevent some places for them to go, we might be helping the situation . So I would like -- because in 7-B tonight there's a grant $276,000 grant for Weston Field and rehabilitation the Weston 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2572 Field -- and it's for rehabilitation of Weston Field. And I know -- I also know that the skate park over there -- and I don't know, almost half a million dedicate d to that, neighbor s came to me and said, listen, the fences are a mess. So, of course, we hope that they spend more money on replacing all the fencing so it's a more secure park. But until then, let's secure Weston Field, please. Let's secure Novembrino Park on a nightly basis. So I would like, Mr. Voldenberg , if you would reach out to the Parks and Recs Director Mr. Gassenmeyer what his action plan is for this because we hear, oh, okay, it was locked. They finally locked. And two days later it's not locked again. So we need an action plan from the Parks and Recs Director , please, and a schedule as to how they are locked, when they are locked, who's responsible for locking these lockable parks, I should say, on a nightly basis at dawn. All right. MR. VOLDENBERG : I will, sir. MR. MCANDREW : If you would you do 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2573 that, please. Thank you. I also attended the Gilmartin event and it was a fantastic turnout . It was just incredible to see Detective Gilmartin there, his beautiful family, and, you know, a community that always rises to the occasion . It was just beautiful to see. So, you know, continued prayers and God bless, you know, Detective Gilmartin and his beautiful family and his brothers and sisters in blue. And that's all I have. Thank you. MR. SMURL: Thank you, Mr. McAndrew . I have a few. Due to primary election on Tuesday , April 23rd, the regular schedule d Council meeting has been rescheduled to Wednesday , the 24th at 6:30. The 1600 block of Nay Aug Avenue, Council submitted the block to DPW for replacement or to be placed on the pothole patching work list. 619 Crown Avenue, complaints City Code Enforcement had issued a quality of life citation and they will follow up on April 20th. The rear of 1820 to 1826 North Main Avenue, which is the former Castle Restaurant 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2574 building , both Scranton Police and Code Enforcement were asked to investigate complaint s from the neighbor s of another after hours nightclub at the rear section of the building this time. I know the owners were previously cited and that club was shut down in 2023. So hopefully we can find out if that is open again. Sewer basin complaints , we forwarded the following basin complaints to DPW for review and repair along requested to review all sewer basins in the city; Wyoming Avenue, Woodlawn Street, Boulevard Ave and Woodlawn , the basin in front of 1022 Grandview and Mulberry Street and Adams Avenue. They were the ones listed on that complaint . And also 1615 Monsey Avenue, zoning and rental registration we asked to followup on an illegal third floor unit apartment . Code enforcement cited recently for outdoor trash and other issues. And that is all I have, Mr. Voldenberg . MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-B.

D/B/A NEIGHBORLY SOFTWARE , FOR SCRANTON OFFICE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT HOUSING , COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-B be introduced into its proper committee . MR. MCANDREW : So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , if we could have -- Attorney Gilbride , if we could have you take a look at this. It is a one additional year but it also has an auto renewal . I wasn't at caucus earlier this morning -- I wasn't at caucus earlier today. But I wanted to bring it up at caucus about that auto renewal that we're seeing there. And then if we can ask the administration what services are being provided by this company . There was a list of them that were in there. Is it mostly being used for ARPA money tracking or is it being used to meet the concerns and provide resources to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2576 needy?

FOR INTRODUCTION – A RESOLUTION – AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR AND OTHER APPROPRIATE CITY OFFICIALS FOR THE CITY OF SCRANTON TO EXECUTE AND ENTER INTO AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT – EXTENSION WITH MATTHEW DOMINES TO PROVIDE FINANCE DIRECTOR SERVICES TO THE CITY OF SCRANTON . MR. SMURL: At this time I'll entertain a motion that Item 5-C be introduced into its proper committee . MR. KING: So moved. DR. ROTHCHILD : Second. MR. SMURL: On the question ? MR. SCHUSTER : On the question , Mr. Voldenberg , can we reach out to the 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2577 administration , ask what's the reasoning why we're not hiring Mr. Domines ' for the full-time position of Finance Director and is the position still posted? This contract is for $85,000 and the line item for the Finance Director is $84,915. It really doesn't make sense why we wouldn't hire Mr. Domines ' full time other than contracting him yearly. MR. KING: On the question , I think the answer is Mr. Domines ' doesn't want to work full time to be -- that's my understanding . You know, he almost left us. And quite frankly , we're paying a lot of money for attorneys . I'd paid this guy $100,000 to stay four days a week, but that's my belief. I've seen what he's done for us. And he's done an extremely great job. MR. SCHUSTER : He is someone I would love to see in a full-time position . MR. KING: Yeah, I know. But I don't believe that that's something that he wanted. And quite frankly , we had to convince him to stay on longer than -- to do this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2578 extension . So, you know, I'm just saying that I know for a fact I've spoken to him. We convinced him to stick around. DR. ROTHCHILD : On the question , I know many of us are very happy with the work that he's done for the city. So I'm happy that he's at least willing to extend the contract further . MR. KING: And also on the question , I worked with him last year quite a bit on budget, especial ly when we were reducing it from three and a half percent down to two percent and his input was invaluable . So I really appreciated working with Mr. Domines '. MR. MCANDREW : On the question , I too -- I'm very happy to extend his contract . I feel he's the smartest guy in the building . And whenever he's in here at caucus or presenting , he's the smartest guy in the room. So I'm happy to vote to extend his contract . MR. SMURL: Thank you. All those in favor of introduction signify by saying aye. MR. KING: Aye. MR. SCHUSTER : Aye. DR. ROTHCHILD : Aye.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2579 MR. MCANDREW : Aye. MR. SMURL: Aye. Opposed ? The ayes have it and so moved. MR. VOLDENBERG : 5-D.
